<HEADLINE> Internet Use Rises in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- More Canadians are hooking their
home computers up to the Internet, a new survey said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The study of 2,013 Canadians in late March and early April
indicated 20 percent of households had access to the Internet, a
sharp rise from 13 percent in a similar survey last November.
</P>
<P>
The new figures confirmed earlier findings of the demographics
of Internet users: predominantly males aged 18 to 29 and 45 to 59.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the spread of personal computers in the
country is not growing nearly as fast.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows 40 percent of Canadian households own
computers, a slight increase from the 36 percent level indicated
by the statistics agency last year.
</P>
<P>
It also found that most computer owners earn more than 24,000
U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Environics Research Group Inc., is
considered to have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2
percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

<HEADLINE> Britain Welcomes Lifting of EU Ban on Ulster Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Labor government Wednesday
welcomed the European Union's (EU) decision to lift a two-year-old
ban on Northern Ireland's beef exports from June 1.
</P>
<P>
The EU's executive Commission announced early Wednesday that it
was exempting Britain's Northern Ireland region from a worldwide
ban on British beef exports because Northern Ireland has kept
detailed computerized records for years.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the easing of beef ban, British Agriculture
Minister Jack Cunningham said in a statement issued early
Wednesday, "This is excellent news and an important day for the
United Kingdom's beef industry."
</P>
<P>
Cunningham stressed that the British government is to make
"sustained efforts to win a wider lifting of the ban to benefit
exporters throughout the United Kingdom."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ben Gill, president of Britain's National Farmers'
Union, said that the EU decision would boost confidence and
increase the impetus for a lifting of the ban nationwide.
</P>
<P>
"This is fantastic news and we are confident that in the near
future we will also be celebrating the resumption of beef exports
from England and Wales," Gill said.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission decided to impose a worldwide ban on British
beef exports in March 1996 when Britain's previous Conservative
government admitted possible links between mad cow disease and its
human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.

<HEADLINE> European Food Safety Legislation Update Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- An official of the U.N. food
agency has urged European countries to revise and update their
legislation governing food safety, according to the U.N.
Department of Public Information here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some European food exports have been rejected because of their
contamination with pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella and
failure to meet safety regulations for certain canned foods, John
Lupien, director of the FAO Nutrition Division, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons for their rejection include non-permitted food
additives, incorrect Labeling, filth, pesticide residues, banned
pesticides, heavy metal contamination and faulty packaging, Lupien
told a FAO regional conference in Europe Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics from the United States Food and Drug
Administration, Lupien said some 770 shipments of European food
products, including cheeses, vegetables, fruits, spices, baked
foods, tea, coffee, mushrooms, soups and fish, were rejected by
the U.S. early this year.
</P>
<P>
The FAO, or the Food and Agriculture Organization, estimated
that the international food trade has grown to over 400 billion
U.S. dollars a year and is expected to go up further. Europe is
one of the largest food exporters in the world.

<HEADLINE> France to Hold Exhibition of Napoleon's Invasion of Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition opens Friday on
Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion of Egypt from 1798 to 1801 at the
Army Museum in Paris, reported Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
On display will be a manuscript of a decree signed by Napoleon
ordering all Egyptians to wear a cockade of the French Republic's
tricolor flag, which was put on the walls of Cairo and Alexandria
by French troops at that time.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, named "The Campaign of Egypt, Myths and
Realities," will also display 133 other objects including a
telescope used by Napoleon during the Battle of Pyramids, French
army uniforms and arms of honor, and weapons such as sabers and
yataghans used by the Turkish-Egyptian troops.
</P>
<P>
The Egypt Campaign confirmed the military genius of Napoleon,
although it remained highly controversial whether it was a
military success.
</P>
<P>
Some 38,000 French troops were stuck in Egypt and other parts
of the Middle East for three years before they could re-embark on
ships to return to France, because the route home in the
Mediterranean was cut by their enemies, the British.
</P>
<P>
One third of the French expedition force died, half of them of
contagious diseases, as stated in the documents of military
hospitals to be displayed.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition coincides with another on the ancient maritime
civilization of Alexandria which was inaugurated last week by
President Jacques Chirac and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak at
the Petit Palais in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Both France and Egypt are marking the bicentenary of the Egypt
Campaign, which they regard as the beginning of the relationship
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> UK Has Poor Record of Forest Conservation in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain has a poor record of forest
conservation in Europe as it comes fourth from the bottom in a
survey of 15 European countries, according to a report Wednesday
by the World Wide Fund for Nature.
</P>
<P>
The first ever detailed survey on forestry management showed
that virtually no natural forests are left in Britain, which ranks
12th out of the 15 countries assessed by the survey.
</P>
<P>
"The UK has virtually no natural forests left, and some
ecosystem types have entirely disappeared. Forest cover is low and
most British `forests' are actually plantations," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The fund said that about half of the country's ancient forests
have been lost in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite widespread forest loss, only 2.5 percent of
the remaining area is under strict protection, it added.
</P>
<P>
The survey gave each country a scorecard based on scores in
several categories including levels of pollution, the amount of
protected forest area, the standards of production and the
national environmental, social and cultural policies applied to
forests.
</P>
<P>
Britain ranks behind Finland, Austria, Greece, Sweden, Turkey,
France, Norway, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Only Spain,
Belgium and Denmark have worse records than Britain. Switzerland
emerged top.

<HEADLINE> France to Mobilize 1,000 Soldiers at Football World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- France will mobilize 1,000 soldiers
to guard airports, railway stations, sea ports and other places
frequented by the public during the 1998 France Football World Cup
finals, announced the French Interior Ministry Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The mobilization makes up a reinforcement of the Vigipirate
anti-terrorist operation renewed by France since 1995, as the
1,000 soldiers will join 860 of their fellow soldiers already
mobilized over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers will be deployed in the sensitive points of the 10
departments where the World Cup finals will be held from June 10
to July 12, as well as in the areas which serve as traveling
transitions for the supporters and spectators of the matches, said
the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The department of Seine-et-Marne near Paris, the only
department which will receive five national football teams from
Brazil, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Austria and Belgium, will have an
extra strong deployment of soldiers and police.
</P>
<P>
Each national team joining the matches will have close
protection by the elite RAID police or the EPIGN air-borne
gendarmery, whose deployment will be arranged by the private
security companies in charge of security during the World Cup by
the organizers.
</P>
<P>
The Comite Francais d'Organisation (CFO) has sent at least 48
million francs (8 million U.S. dollars) to the Interior Ministry
to "compensate for the extra cost linked to the security during
the World Cup," Agence France-Presse quoted police union sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CFO has mobilized 5,000 volunteers to work as
security agents with 1,850 professionals.
</P>
<P>
The Vigipirate anti-terrorist operation has been put into force
twice since its creation in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The first such operation was launched in January 1991 at the
outbreak of the Gulf War, while the second was launched in
September 1995 following a car bomb attack on a Jewish school in
southern France.
</P>
<P>
French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said Tuesday
that the new mobilization was not the outcome of high
psychological tension, but was aimed at securing the World Cup
finals.
</P>
<P>
French police Tuesday launched a simultaneous raid with their
German, Swiss, Belgian and Italian counterparts on suspected
sympathizers of the Algerian terrorist Armed Islamic Group, making
an unspecified number of arrests.

The KSE-100 Index lost 70.64 points to close at 1092.86 points
Wednesday against Tuesday's close of 1163.50 points.
</P>

A total turnover of 50.10 million shares were traded Wednesday
against 810,000 shares traded the previous day.
</P>
<P>
There were 20 gainers, 86 losers while 32 scrips remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Within an hour of trading, the Karachi Automated Trading
System, the computer system on which the bourse trades, developed
some problems and trading was suspended till the afternoon
session.
</P>
<P>
On resumption of business, the news that the government has
appealed to the Lahore High Court (LHC) to order the Hub Power
Company Limited (Hubco) to bring back money it has repatriated as
profits abroad was greeted with heavy selling in most stocks.
</P>
<P>
The LHC has set June 2 as the next date for hearing of the case
in which a private citizen has challenged the rate at which Hubco
is charging the government in power tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The case has caused upsets on the market since the court has
decreed that till the hearing is concluded, Hubco will have to
sell power at 1.50 Pakistani rupee (PKR) per kilowatt hour (KWH)
against the existing rate of over five PKR per KWH (one U.S.
dollar=44.05 PKR).

Traders expect further falls in the Karachi Stock market in the

<HEADLINE> Kyrgyzstan Enjoys Healthy Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev
said Wednesday that his country's gross domestic product (GDP) in
1997 grew by 10 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Akayev disclosed the figure at an international conference held
in the Kyrgyz capital, Alma Ata, to mark the fifth anniversary of
the issuance of the Kyrgyz currency, the Som.
</P>
<P>
Akayev attributed the country's economic growth mainly to the
issuance of Som and the assistance provided by the world
community, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in particular.
</P>
<P>
The Kyrgyz people had mastered their national economy since the
issuance of Som in May 1993, which was also a strong catalyst for
economic reform, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the country's budget deficit dropped
from 25 percent to 5 percent, he noted. The inflation rate also
declined from 1366 percent to 14.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the economic recovery in the past two years, the Som
maintained a value of 18.85 against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Michel Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, said in his
speech at the conference that Kyrgyzstan had begun to benefit from
the introduction of market economy.
</P>
<P>
Now the country had to make great efforts to take advantage of
the economic globalization to further develop its economy, he
pointed out.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The federal government approved
Wednesday a plan to halve its gold reserves but it still requires
the approval first from the parliament and then from the people
through a referendum.
</P>
<P>
If endorsed, the legislation will allow the Swiss National Bank
to sell about 1,300 tons of gold, or half of its current 2,590-ton
gold reserves, according to reports from the Swiss capital of
Berne.
</P>
<P>
After the plan was approved Wednesday by the cabinet, Swiss
Finance Minister Kaspar Villiger told reporters that he hoped the
parliament would pass the plan by the end of this year and that a
referendum could follow in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
Villiger said that Switzerland could not start selling half of
its gold reserves before late or early 2000.
</P>
<P>
To avoid disrupting prices on world gold markets, Villiger
said, the selling of roughly half of Switzerland's gold reserves
would probably be spread over five to seven years.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Canada's greenhouse gases emissions
have continued to rise despite promised reductions.
</P>
<P>
Canada has promised to stabilize its emissions of greenhouse
gases at 1990 levels by the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
But on average, Canada produced 1.5 percent more carbon
dioxide, the most powerful greenhouse gas, each year from 1985 to
1994, new figures showed.
</P>
<P>
The country's emissions of carbon dioxide climbed 3.8 percent
in 1995, the latest year for which verified figures are available.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Canadians have been producing still more of the
pollutant gases each year, even though precise amounts are not
available.
</P>
<P>
At the current rate, Canadian greenhouse emissions will grow 11
percent from 1990 to 2000, said Commissioner of the Environment
and Sustainable Development Brian Emmett in a report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"What really concerns me is that far too often, the government
is not keeping the promises it makes both to Canadians and to the
world," Emmett said.
</P>
<P>
"If the performance of the government does not improve, the
environment and the health of Canadians will be damaged," he

LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The costs of adapting the
information technology systems of European companies to cope with
the European economic and monetary union (EMU) are estimated to
rise to 150-400 billion U.S. dollars, the Financial Times reported

Citing a research by the information technology consultancy

technology systems to deal with EMU could exceed some estimates of
the cost of dealing with the millennium bug of the computer
system.

costs and more information from early EMU projects," the
consultancy said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the research said that unfortunately, EMU and the
millennium bug projects partially overlap in Europe and as a
result, many companies will be left with little spare spending to
invest in new information technology systems.

<HEADLINE> Russia Ready to Oppose NATO Eastward Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia is ready to take appropriate
measures against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO)
eastward expansion, the Russian Defense Ministry stated on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an article published by the Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Colonel
General Leonid Ivashov, head of the Defense Ministry's main
department for international military cooperation, denied that
Moscow had reconciled itself to the alliance's enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov said if former Soviet republics become candidates for
NATO membership, Russia would have to increase its strategic forces
in the northwest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Russia might also have to reduce its commitments regarding
tactical and strategic weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Response measures may vary, but Russia's security will be
ensured," he added.
</P>
<P>
"At all official levels we openly say that if former Soviet
republics become candidates for admission into the alliance, the
situation in Europe will become unstable and the geopolitical
situation will change," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov criticized NATO for failing to discuss serious issues
during the first meeting of the Russia-NATO Joint Permanent
Council.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia was extremely concerned over the transparency of
the development of NATO's military infrastructure, especially in
the territories of new Eastern European members of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
As NATO was moving closer to Russia's borders, it should
take note of Russia's national security, Ivashov said.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Approves Continued Peace Mission in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The German cabinet has approved an
extension of German soldiers' peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, a
government spokesman announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the Bonn government has also
decided that Germany's contributions to the U.N. peacekeeping
forces in Bosnia, the Stabilization Force (SFOR), will remain at
the current level of 3,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The current mandate of the 35,000 SFOR troops in Bosnia is due
to expire on June 19. Germany has said that it supports an
extension of the mandate and believes that European countries
should maintain their troop contribution at the current levels
though the number of U.S. soldiers is likely to be reduced.
</P>
<P>
According to German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is expected to make a decision
on the Bosnia peace operation Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Comes Under Fire On Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government led by the
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came under fire Wednesday in Lok
Sabha, the Lower House of Parliament, for its decision to conduct
nuclear tests earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Virtually the entire opposition accused the BJP-led coalition
of starting a nuclear arms race in the Indian Sub-continent.
</P>
<P>
They questioned the need and the timing of the tests, saying
there was no threat from China, and cautioned against the danger
of inducting nuclear weapons for deployment.
</P>
<P>
Congress said irresponsible statements by some cabinet
ministers had damaged India's relations with many countries
including China and Pakistan and lambasted the government for not
generating a national consensus before exercising the nuclear
option.
</P>
<P>
Indrajit Gupta, leader of the Communist Party of India, asked
the Vajpayee government to explain the "sudden provocation" for
carrying out the nuclear tests and warned it could trigger a
nuclear arms race in the region.
</P>
<P>
Former minister of state for external affairs Salman Khurshid
accused the Vajpayee government of reversing the peaceful nuclear
policy laid down by the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal
Nehru.
</P>
<P>
When Nehru set up the Atomic Energy Commission, he explicitly
said India's nuclear policy would be peaceful and create energy to
build a self-reliant economy, Khurshid said Wednesday at a
function to mark Nehru's 34th death anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The heated debate also saw the opposition charging the ruling
BJP with trying to derive political mileage out of the tests.
</P>
<P>
The debate on nuclear will continue Thursday and Vajpayee will
answer questions raised by the opposition.

<HEADLINE> An Exclusive Interview with U.S. Experts on China Daniel  Burstein and Arne De Keijzer  by Zhou Xisheng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Prominent American experts on
China told Xinhua in an exclusive interview Wednesday that the
United States and China should cooperate rather than clash in
handling issues concerning bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"American politicians and strategists should make objective
assessments and analysis of China's role in the world, and the
United States should adopt a policy of 'dynamic engagement'
towards China," said Daniel Burstein and Arne De Keijzer, American
experts on China and the authors of the newly published monograph
entitled "Big Dragon."
</P>
<P>
The two authors made the remarks at the headquarters of the
Blackstone Group, a leading private investment bank based in New
York.
</P>
<P>
Burstein, a senior advisor of the Blackstone Group, and De
Keijzer, who served on the staff of the National Committee on
United States-China Relations earlier in his career and is now
head of his own consulting firm, said that "Big Dragon" has caught
so many Americans' attention that some U.S. Congressmen have
expressed their willingness to promote the book worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Burstein said he and De Keijzer made their first trip to China
in the early 1970s and have returned dozens of times. They have
met numerous Chinese government officials, scholars and economy
and trade leaders. It is their informed perspective and
cross-culture experience which shaped "Big Dragon."
</P>
<P>
Burstein said that there are sharp differences between "Big
Dragon" and the book "The Coming Conflict Between the United
States and China" published last year. The former is shaped by
their on-the-spot investigation and observation of China in past
decades while the latter is based on the hearsay and conjecture of
a few American newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "China Threat" is radical and unfair, which does
not reflect the reality of China and the development trend of the
Sino-U.S. relations, said Burstein, adding that China's democratic
process and modern construction are moving forward. China has
been becoming an even more responsible member of the international
community, a trend conducive to the further development of the
Sino-U.S. relations rather than prompting conflicts between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
De Keijzer, for his part, maintained that American politicians
and strategists should objectively assess and analyze the positive
changes taking place in China since it adopted the policy of
reform and opening to the outside world in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Holding that the United States should pursue a policy of
"dynamic engagement" towards China, De Keijzer said China has
undergone great changes in recent decades with enhanced
comprehensive national strength. The United States should regard
China's development as a challenge to its creativity and
innovation rather than a political, military and economic threat.
</P>
<P>
This challenge would contribute not only to the progress of the
United States, but also to world peace and prosperity, said de
Keijzer, and the best response from the United States to this
challenge was to adopt a policy of full engagement towards China.
</P>
<P>
De Keijzer also warned that while adopting the "dynamic
engagement" policy towards China, the United States cannot impose
its one-sided thinking on China, such as setting up preconditions
in granting the most favored nation trade status to China as well
as in the issue of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The United States should conduct patient, sincere and true
dialogue with China, and take full advantage of the opportunities
looming from China's development in the areas of economy and
trade, culture, education, technology, environment and energy,
said De Keijzer.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should also improve their cooperation both in
the international and regional organizations, he added.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, Burstein and De Keijzer said President Clinton's
visit to China stands foremost among the 18 recommendations made
in "Big Dragon," and they hoped that Clinton's forthcoming visit
was a success.

<HEADLINE> Iran Announces Ambitious Plan to Transfer Caspian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Wednesday announced an
ambitious plan of exporting the Caspian Sea oil through Iranian
territory instead of other routes, dealing a new blow to the shaky
U.S. d'Amato sanction law against Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Oil Minister Ali Majedi said that Iran has planned to
transfer oil of the Caspian Sea littoral states in three stages,
saying that the first stage would be laying a new pipeline from
the world largest inland sea to the Iranian capital Tehran.
</P>
<P>
By laying a 392-kilometer pipeline from the Caspian port of
Neka in Mazadaran province to Tehran, the official news agency
IRNA quoted him as saying, the Caspian oil will be transferred to
two Iranian refineries in Tehran and Tabriz to swap with Iranian
oil in the Persian Gulf terminals.
</P>
<P>
Majedi said that the first-phase project would be put to the
international tenders next week at a seminar in London, adding
that the stage was estimated to cost 400 million U.S. dollars,
which would be paid from the sale of the crude oil in swap deal.
</P>
<P>
The project will be completed within two years and it will take
five years to pay off the cost, he said, adding that the pipeline
would carry oil from Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan to
Tehran and Tabriz refineries and the same amount of crude would be
delivered in the Persian Gulf terminals to the international
customers.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official put the capacity of the pipeline at
40,000 barrels per day (bpd), saying that the capacity was not
sufficient to meet the demand of the contracts already signed on
the swap deal with the Caspian states.
</P>
<P>
The second stage is to transfer the Caspian oil to two other
Iranian refineries in Isfahan and Arak, central Iran, Majedi said,
and the third one is to pipe the Caspian oil to the Kharg terminal
in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian plan was announced after the U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright warned foreign companies that Washington
remained strong opposition to oil and gas pipelines through Iran
to transfer the Caspian oil.
</P>
<P>
Washington will carefully examine and take appropriate measures
under the Iran-Libya Sanction Act adopted in 1996, better known as
the d'Amato law, she said last week.
</P>
<P>
She made the remark after U.S. President Bill Clinton announced
to waiver threats against foreign firms helping Iran to develop
offshore gas field, under a strong pressure from the European
states.
</P>
<P>
However, reports said that Anglo-Dutch Shell was currently
carrying out a feasibility study of various pipelines through
Iran and the study might be completed by autumn. Some other
foreign companies, including the U.S. Mobil, also intended to be
involved in Iranian projects.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the Iranian new plan would deal a serious
challenge to the d'Amato law, which bans foreign company to put
more than 20 million dollars investment in the energy sector of
Iran and Libya as a punitive measure against the two countries'
alleged support to terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Crop Elimination High on U.N. Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Eliminating illegal drug
crops is one of the core issues to be dealt with at the special
session of the U.N. General Assembly on the world drug problem to
be held here on June 8-10.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. International Drug Control Program
(UNDCP), the global acreage for coca and opium cultivation totals
over half the size of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of the world's opium poppy is grown in
Afghanistan and Myanmar, and most of the world's coca crop is
cultivated in Bolivia, Colombia and Peru, the UNDCP said.
</P>
<P>
The coca bush and the opium poppy are the basis of the highly
addictive drugs cocaine and heroin, which are abused by some 21
million people globally.
</P>
<P>
However, in villages around the world, a rising number of
peasant farmers are turning away from drug corps due to falling
prices and government pressure.
</P>
<P>
In most cases, the prices paid to farmers for coca leaf and
opium poppy are no longer as attractive as they were, said Pino
Arlacchi, executive director of the UNDCP.
</P>
<P>
In countries where the alternative development program is
practiced, projects are designed with community input to help
farmers increase yields, market products, generate additional
income and raise living standards.
</P>
<P>
UNDCP figures show that projects introduced over the last
decade have led to a decline in drug crop cultivation in a number
of countries, with an elimination in Pakistan and Thailand and a
cut of 40 percent in coca cultivation in Peru.
</P>
<P>
Government leaders are expected to adopt a political
declaration committing themselves to eliminating or substantially
reducing illicit drug cultivation by 2008 at the special session.

<HEADLINE> Kabbah Says He Has Forgiven Koromah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah said he has forgiven Major Johnny Paul Koromah, who
overthrew him in a coup last May but was flushed out in February
by the West African peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation
Tuesday, Kabbah said he is ready to talk to Koromah as an
individual to show his willing to genuine reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah also said that he would engage in discussion with Foday
Sankoh, leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front, who was
arrested by Nigerian authorities upon entrance in March 1997 and
has since been in detention.
</P>
<P>
"I am prepared to talk to anybody as long as that would bring
about peace to Sierra Leone. What I want is sustainable peace. We
should be concentrating our attention on developing our country,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah stressed that he would only talk to Koromah as an
individual, not as a representative of any group.
</P>
<P>
Upon his reinstatement in Freetown in March, President Kabbah
has vowed to bring a new beginning in Sierra Leone through
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Koromah has been in hiding since he was driven out of Freetown
by the ECOMOG. Earlier reports said he had offered to surrender
to the Roman Catholic bishop instead of the government for fear
of losing his life. But that was denied by the church.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stresses Position on Sovereignty Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus stressed on Wednesday that
any settlement of the protracted Cyprus problem should be based on
a single sovereignty as provided for in a United Nations Security
Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
"The government (of Cyprus) considers paragraph two of the
U.N. Security Council Resolution 939 as the cornerstone of a
Cyprus solution," government spokesman Christos Stylianides told
reporters after a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The 1994 resolution maintains that a solution to the Cyprus
issue "must be based on a state of Cyprus with a single
sovereignty and international personality and a single
citizenship, with its independence and territorial integrity
safeguarded."
</P>
<P>
Stylianides made the remarks in response to a statement by
Thomas Miller, United States special coordinator for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Miller told a business conference in Nicosia on Tuesday that
the situation in Cyprus could get worse before getting better and
hinted that the issue of sovereignty may well be on the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the government is concerned, there is no issue of
sovereignty to negotiate," Stylianides said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Miller's view that things could get worse, the
spokesman said the Cypriot government is handling the situation in
a responsible manner to avert anything.
</P>
<P>
"The government does not consider that we are going through a
period when unpleasant developments for the people of Cyprus
could occur," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island after a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union
with Greece. Turkish Cypriots later set up a breakaway republic in
northern Cyprus which is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led efforts to help reunify the island in a bizonal
and bicommunal formula have so far failed to achieve tangible
results.

<HEADLINE> German Domestic Demand Picks Up, Institute Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The German economy has begun to profit
from a recovery in domestic demand thanks both to increased
investments and gradually reviving private consumption, a leading
German economic research institute said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
While foreign orders for German investment goods continued to
pour in at "extremely high levels," domestic spending on
investment goods also registered a strong recovery after a
prolonged recession, the Berlin-based German Institute for
Economic Research DIW said.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1998, Germany's investment goods
industry registered an overall growth of 5 percent in orders, the
institute said.
</P>
<P>
Although private consumption still remained sluggish at the
moment, a revival was expected to come during the course of the
year, the institute predicted. Meanwhile, it saw signs of an
improvement in the construction sector.
</P>
<P>
The latest monthly economic report of the DIW also noted that
the positive development on the domestic market came at a time
when the country's dynamic export expansion had appeared to slow
down slightly for the moment.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, exports would continue to be the main driving
force behind Germany's economic growth in 1998, the DIW said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
on Wednesday expressed his great concern over the nuclear tests
conducted by India earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif, Demirel said the nuclear tests in India not only threaten
stability in south Asia, but also hit a blow to international
peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The president told Sharif that he had conveyed his concern
about the nuclear tests to the Indian government.
</P>
<P>
Demirel stated that Turkey has appreciated the calm and
responsible attitude of Pakistan against this threat, saying that
the Pakistani attitude will produce favorable consequences.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said he believes the international society should
extend further support to Pakistan, which is under threat, and
Turkey will make efforts to this end.
</P>
<P>
On May 11 and 13, India conducted a total of five underground
nuclear tests, which triggered off widespread concern and
international condemnation.
</P>
<P>
India has so far refused to sign the Nuclear Non-proliferation
Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, calling them
discriminatory.

<P>
ATHENS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Most ports in Greece remained closed
Wednesday as dock workers began a 48-hour strike to protest the
Greek government's plans to privatize the port authorities of
Piraeus and Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
The strike was called by the General Confederation of Greek
Labor and the civil servants' Supreme Administrative Council.
</P>
<P>
In Piraeus, some 15 km southwest of Athens, tension rose when
riot police arrested a trade union leader and another striker.
</P>
<P>
Strikers rushed to the police station and demanded and secured
the release of both men.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Athens, police used tear gas to disperse
strikers who tried to break through a cordon and enter the
Parliament building.
</P>
<P>
In the clashes between riot police and strikers, one policeman
was reportedly injured and at least 10 strikers and bystanders
fainted.
</P>
<P>
The clashes also created traffic chaos in downtown Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government denounced the violence in Piraeus and
Athens and reiterated its determination to privatize the two
ports.

<HEADLINE> Germany Institute Sees Reviving Domestic Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The German economy has begun to profit
from a recovery in domestic demand thanks both to increased
investments and gradually reviving private consumption, a leading
German economic research institute said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
While foreign orders for German investment goods continued to pour
in at "extremely high levels," domestic spendings on investment goods
also registered a strong recovery after a prolonged recession, the
Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research DIW said.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1998, Germany's investment goods industry
registered an overall growth of five percent in orders, the institute
said.
</P>
<P>
Although private consumption still remained sluggish at the moment,
a revival was expected to come during the course of the year, the
institute predicted. Meanwhile, it also saw signs of an improvement in
construction sector.
</P>
<P>
The latest monthly economic report of the DIW also noted that the
positive development on the domestic market came at time when the
country's dynamic export expansion had appeared to slow down slightly
for the moment.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, exports would continue to be the main driving force
behind Germany's economic growth in 1998, the DIW said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia has good working relations
with the United States, Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
said here at the Congress of the 47th General Assembly of the
International Press Institute (IPI) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the Intergovernmental Commission on Trade and
Technological Cooperation between the two countries, which has
done a lot of good over the past five years, will meet in Moscow,
and its date is to be set soon.
</P>
<P>
Russia will maintain mutually beneficial cooperation with other
countries but will never deviate from the commitments under the
agreement on non-proliferation of nuclear technologies, Kiriyenko
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent events in Latvia amount to violations of the
Russian-speaking population's rights. Russia cannot be indifferent
to this and will take "civilized steps to influence the situation
and prevent the violation of the rights of ethnic Russians, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the protection of human rights is a major priority in
the government's activities, Kiriyenko said the Russian
authorities will do their best to prevent any incidents in the
country which could be regarded as a violation of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the congress of the IPI, Kiriyenko also emphasized
the problem of stabilization in Russia. He said that "efficient
social welfare" is the key to stabilization of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Efficient social welfare is a crucial element of
stabilizing the general situation in Russia." The efficiency of
social welfare can be achieved only by adopting a firm financial
policy, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko stressed that the government will invest maximum
efforts to ensure that social welfare reaches the destination.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Moves Toward Repealing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (parliament)
Wednesday passed the preliminary reading on a bill that would
repeal the direct election for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The bill was approved by a vote of 50-45. But this was only the
first step to abolish the direct election law.
</P>
<P>
Under Israeli law, it requires only a relative majority to pass
the preliminary stage, but will need the support of 61 members of
the 120-seat Knesset to pass three more readings.
</P>
<P>
The bill was submitted by ruling Likud Party member Uzi Landau
and opposition Labor Party member Yossi Beilin.
</P>
<P>
They said that the direct election system gives the prime
minister too much power and is not good for a democratic country.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Labor
leader Ehud Barak are opposed to repealing the direct election.
</P>
<P>
The direct election law was only put into effect in 1996.
Before then, Israelis had voted for parties under a system that
limited the power of the prime minister and made it easier to
topple the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti Higher Council of
Planning, an advisory and supervising organ for economic planning,
held a meeting Wednesday to discuss two reports on the state
budget, the official news agency Kuna reported.
</P>
<P>
The two reports were submitted by the Economic and Financial
Committee.
</P>
<P>
One report deals with the committee's opinion about the general
guidelines of the state budget for the fiscal year 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
The other covers the committee's assessment of the financial
and economic situation in the country with regard to the drop of
world oil prices and the impact on the budget for the fiscal year
of 1997-1998 ending on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is expected to have a deficit of 3.3 billion U.S.
dollars in the fiscal year 1997-1998 due to the slump of oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
The committee has suggested a series of urgent measures topped
by reduction of spendings, increase of non-oil revenues and
reconsideration of the subsidization policy without affecting the
limited-income earners.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah
Al-Salem Al-Sabah, who chaired the meeting, underlined the need to

<HEADLINE> Arafat-Gingrich Talks "Beginning of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, WEST BANK, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians and
the U.S. Congress have created "a real dialogue" by the talks
between Palestinian National Authority (PNA) leader Yasser Arafat
and U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Palestinian officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing outside Arafat's office, where the
90-minute talks between Arafat and Gingrich were held, Palestinian
Planning and International Minister Nabil Sha'ath said the talks
were "frank and positive."
</P>
<P>
"We have established a mechanism to visit each other, to
contact each other... We have created a real dialogue with the
U.S. Congress for the first time. I think this is important,"
Sha'ath said.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich also described the talks as "very good, very
positive." "We focused on ways to push forward the peace
process," he said, "We believe it is possible (for us) to work
together."
</P>
<P>
The talks were held amid doubts over whether the PNA would
cancel the scheduled meeting to protest against Gingrich's siding
with Israeli government, especially his remarks that Jerusalem
should remain united and eternal capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich insisted at the news briefing that his stand on the
status of Jerusalem reflected the position of the U.S.
government. "We do have a law which says there should be an
embassy in Jerusalem," he said, referring to a bill passed by the
Congress in 1995 which mandating that the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv
should be moved to Jerusalem by May 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, there is a lot of disagreements about that," he
admitted.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Sha'ath said Arafat explained very clearly the
Palestinian stand on the issue of Jerusalem and Gingrich
"listened very carefully and in a positive way."
</P>
<P>
"We were not in an argument mood," he added.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Gingrich would leave for Amman in the
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Saudi Arabia Agree to Cooperate Over Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Saudi Foreign Minister Saud
al-Faisal said on Wednesday that his country and Iran have agreed
to cooperate in preventing world oil prices from further falling,
the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have agreed to draw up a long-term strategy
to stop the oil prices from slumping with the assistance from
other oil producers, al-Faisal said in a meeting with Chairman of
Iran's State Expediency Council Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi official said that cooperation between Saudi Arabia
and Iran would be effective in stopping the drop of the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The world oil prices are falling sharply in recent months
mainly due to a low demand from Asian countries in financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, former Iranian president, said that to shore up the
oil prices is an area of cooperation between Tehran and Riyadh,
adding the two countries along with other oil producers are
expected to make a serious decision in this respect.
</P>
<P>
He said the Islamic nations need unity and solidarity more than
before to settle regional crisis and maintain peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
He called for multilateral cooperation among Iran, Saudi
Arabia, Syria and other states to attain the goal.
</P>
<P>
Al-Faisal arrived here on Tuesday for a two-day visit. He left
here Wednesday afternoon after holding the second round of talks
with his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi, Tehran Radio said.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two officials underlined the need of
understanding and cooperation between Tehran and Riyadh on
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that regional issues, such as those of Iraq and
Afghanistan, can not be resolved through military ways, but only
through political talks and peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Faisal said the two countries share the view on need for
cooperation between the Organization of the Islamic Conference and
the United Nations to help end the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also exchanged views about the
recent Indian nuclear tests. Kharrazi said that nuclear tests
would pose threat to regional security, calling on regional
countries to join efforts to announce a region free from nuclear
weapons.

<HEADLINE> Susan McDougal to Be Tried for Embezzlement in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A judge in Santa Monica,
California, Wednesday set a July 13 trial date for Susan McDougal
on charges she embezzled 150,000 dollars from conductor Zubin
Mehta and his wife while she worked as their bookkeeper.
</P>
<P>
The Whitewater figure didn't make it to court because she
wasn't feeling well, so Superior Court Judge Steven Suzukawa
decided to set the date without her, the Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Mark Geragos said he was uncertain of his
client's ailment. He said she had seen a doctor.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal was charged with grand theft, check forgery,
fraudulent use of credit cards, income tax evasion and making
false financial statements, from 1989 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal and then-husband Jim McDougal were partners in
the failed Whitewater development with Bill and Hillary Rodham
Clinton when Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas. Both McDougals
were convicted of bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
Jim McDougal died in a Texas federal prison on March 8.
</P>
<P>
Geragos said Mrs. McDougal will face another trial in Little
Rock, Arkansas, before the Santa Monica trial. A jury trial is
scheduled for June 22 on two counts of criminal contempt and one
count of obstruction of justice for her refusal to testify before
the Whitewater grand jury.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal served 18 months for civil contempt in a jail
term imposed to coerce her cooperation with the grand jury. That
term expired in March and she has served time since then on her
two-year Whitewater prison sentence for fraud.

<P>
AMMAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- United States Congress Speaker Newt
Gingrich here Wednesday met King Hussein of Jordan and discussed
with him on the long-stalled Middle East peace process and the
U.S.- Jordanian relations.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich briefed the king on his current tour in the
region. The details of their meeting have not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, he dined with Hussein and his U.S.-born
wife, Queen Nour, at the king's Peace Gate Palace outside Amman.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Gingrich held separate talks with the
king's heir Hassan, President of the Jordanian Upper House of
Parliament Zeid Rifai as well as Speaker of the Lower House of
Parliament Saad Hail El-Sorour, official Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Amman Wednesday afternoon from visit to the
Palestinian self-ruled West Bank, Gingrich told reporters that he
had found there was willingness from both the Israeli and the
Palestinian sides to continue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been deadlocked for 15 months due to the
Jewish settlement expansion in Arab East Jerusalem.and the delayed
Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was deeply committed to the restoration of the peace
talks between Israel and the Palestinians, he added.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich wrapped up his four-day visit to Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule areas earlier Wednesday after giving
unreserved backing to Israel's claim of sovereignty over the
occupied Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The East Jerusalem was seized from Arabs in the 1967 Mideast
War by Israelis before the Jewish state formally annexed it and
declared that it was the state's capital in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which once ruled the East Jerusalem, calls for its
return to the Palestinians and King Hussein considers himself as
the guardian of the Muslim shrines in Jerusalem.

Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) for a further six months
until November 30, 1998.

Through the unanimous adoption of Resolution 1169, the council

JOHANNESBURG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The South African National
Defense Force had dumped 7,500 tons of ammunition into the sea
since May 1994, South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted

</P>
<P>

obtained from the Department of Environment Affairs, Modise told
parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said this included 1,350 tons of explosive material, 3,450
tons of remaining parts of ammunition and 2,700 tons of packaging

<HEADLINE> Orchards and Vineyards Decline in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Romania, one of the 10 richest
countries in the world in orchards and vineyards, is witnessing
sharp decline in the plantations.
</P>
<P>
According to Gheorghe Glaman, President of Romanian
Horticulture Owners Association and President of Romanian
Horticulture Society, over 70 percent of the vineyards and the
orchards were transferred into private property as a result of the
application of Land Law. Most of the new owners could not take
proper care of the plantations due to lack of equipment, financial
means and expertise. Major vineyards and orchards were thus
cleared and transformed into arable land.
</P>
<P>
Orchard areas declined from 242,000 hectares to 214,000
hectares and the fruit harvest decreased from 1,570 thousand tones
in 1989 to only 1,300 thousand tones.
</P>
<P>
The plight of the viticulture is even more terrible. Almost
half of vineyards were planted with hybrids banned in other
countries, which seriously affect the quality of the Romanian
wines and exports.
</P>
<P>
Specialists voiced deep concern over this situation. They
proposed setting up a fund for supporting the development of the
orchards and vineyards.

<HEADLINE> Food Production in CIS Improving: FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. food agency said
Wednesday that the food situation in most of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) is gradually improving and food aid needs
have fallen sharply.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. Department of Public Information quoted the
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) as saying that the
CIS continues to have vulnerable groups including pensioners,
disabled people and refugees who cannot afford to buy enough food.
</P>
<P>
The CIS is made up of most of the countries that were once part
of the former USSR.
</P>
<P>
Seven Countries (Almenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) with a population of 53
million people are classified as low-income food-deficit
countries.
</P>
<P>
Though overall food supplies in the CIS are adequate to meet
demand, FAO said, there are large differences within countries. In
Tajikistan, 16 percent of the population still need assistance to
survive.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, the
Russian Federation and Ukraine have exportable grain surpluses in
1997/98.
</P>
<P>
FAO statistics show that CIS grain production rose sharply to
156 million tons in 1997, but CIS wheat output for 1998 is forecast
to decline by up to five million tons, with falls expected in
Ukraine and the Russian Federation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Announces Subsidized Barley Sale to Retaliate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. will subsidize 30,000
tons of its barley for sale to retaliate for Europe's shipment of
subsidized grain to this country, Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Use of the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) to help U.S.
growers "is a measured, targeted response to the European Union's
recent sale of heavily subsidized barley into the United States,"
Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
"Our action today demonstrates how seriously we view the E.U.
sale," he added.
</P>
<P>
He made the decision after widespread complaints from American
farmers and some members of Congress about Europe's sale of 30,000
tons of subsidized Finnish barley to a California feed mill.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. subsidized barley sale will go to Algeria, Cyprus and
Norway. The EEP program, which has not been used since 1996, pays
cash bonuses to purchasers of American farm products, which makes
their prices more competitive.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Reform Bill Triggers Lobbying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Groups on both sides of a debate
on overhauling the political fund-raising laws in the United
States are sending pointed messages in various ways to members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The National Right to Life Committee, a leading opponent of
restrictions on donations and issue-oriented advertisements, wrote
lawmakers that a vote for restrictions would hurt their ratings in
the group's annual guide.
</P>
<P>
The League of Women Voters, which supports the legislation
designed to change campaign finance laws, sent out an "action
alert" urging its members: "We must generate a high volume of
pro-reform calls."
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Business Political Action
Committees, worried that the current legislation could be amended
to curtail PAC donations, took out a biting, full-page
advertoisement in a Capitol Hill newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The PACs, or political action committees, are groups that
represent a point of view and parcels out campaign money to
lawmakers or candidates sharing that point of view.
</P>
<P>
That ad began with a dictionary-like entry for the word
"turncoat" and gave the following definition: "A member of
Congress who solicits money from political action committees
(PACs) and then turns around and co-sponsors or votes for
amendments to eliminate or curtail PAC contributions."
</P>
<P>
The ad says that group members gave 56 million dollars in
contributions in the last election, and warns that "We will
vigorously oppose any threats that reduce the fundamental right to
freedom of speech."
</P>
<P>
At issue is a bill that would ban so-called "soft money" -- the
unlimited donations given to political parties by wealthy
individuals, corporations and labor unions -- and restrict
interest groups' ability to air issue ads designed to sway
elections.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives began debating the legislation
last week.
</P>
<P>
The coalition that favors the campaign finance overhaul has
reached beyond its traditional base of good-government groups to
include organizations such as the American Association of Retired
Persons, the National Council of Churches and the Union of
American Hebrew Congregations.
</P>
<P>
"It's quite clear that this is resonating with the American
people," said President Ann McBride of the Common Cause, an
advocacy group for campaign finance overhaul.
</P>
<P>
"Congress may have mistaken frustration for apathy," she said.
"There is not apathy out there on this issue. People are angry and
frustrated."
</P>
<P>
The opponents include some of the biggest political givers on
Capitol Hill, such as the National Rifle Association, which asked
its members to visit their lawmakers at home this week.
</P>
<P>
While most attention has been focused on soft money and issue
ads, PACs reportedly are worried that they might become a target.
</P>
<P>
PACs, the donating arms of special interest groups, can give up
to 10,000 dollars each to a lawmaker in an election cycle -- half
for the primary and the rest for the general election. Some
proposals would curb those donations or eliminate them.
</P>
<P>
"There is an awful lot of hypocrisy among the candidates,"
business PACs spokesman Steve Stockmeyer said. "During the day,
they give speeches against PACs and at night, they're at the
Capitol Hill Club with their hands out, urging PACs to come to
their fund-raisers."

<P>
LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Almost one in four of the UK
population now has access to the Internet and a growing number are
using the net to research products to buy, according to a research
published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by opinion pollster NOP, showed that
the total number of British Internet users reached 10.3 million in
the first three months this year, or 23 percent of the adults,
though many are only using the net for e-mail.
</P>
<P>
Web-surfing is less common, but 13 percent of the population,
or 5.9 million people in the UK, have now used the World Wide Web,
more than double the number a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that the Web is becoming a crucial
research tool for consumers, with two million people using the net
to investigate products and prices before buying.
</P>
<P>
Web users were found to be particularly affluent, with 46
percent having a household income of more than 25,000 pounds
(40,775 U.S. dollars) and 70 percent owning their own home.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expresses Confidence in Russian Economic Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday
expressed its confidence in Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
economic team amid turmoil in the country's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Russia's leaders are "fully capable" of leading the Russian
economy in the right direction, said State Department spokesman
James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian government is taking steps to deal with the
situation," said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
"The central bank raised interest rates sharply and reconfirmed
its commitment to ruble stability. In addition, the president
approved a package of fiscal measures designed to reduce the
budget deficit," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government took drastic measures to halt panic
selling in Russia's financial markets Wednesday, but investors
kept bailing out as the nation slid closer to a full-fledged
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank tripled its main interest rate Wednesday to a
whopping 150 percent. The move was meant to keep investors in the
Russian market, but analysts said such high rates were
unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
Speculation is growing that Russia will need a multibillion
dollars rescue package from the IMF, similar to the ones arranged
after Asia's financial crisis struck last year.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Defends His Minister in Nuke Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
Wednesday gave his firm backing to his embattled environment
minister who faces a call to resign over recent revelations of
contaminated German nuclear waste shipments.
</P>
<P>
At issue is the disclosure last week that some of Germany's
nuclear waste shipments to French and British reprocessing plants
had leaked much more radiation than official standards permitted.
</P>
<P>
At a special parliament debate on Wednesday, the ecologist
Greens party sharply accused Environmental Minister Angela Merkel
of neglecting her duty to supervise the nuclear activities in the
country and called on her to resign to take the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the call, Kohl said that Merkel "has been doing
excellent work and is fully capable of carring out her duty with
responsibility".
</P>
<P>
"The German government has done its duty while the nuclear
operators have not," said Kohl in a reference to an earlier
admission by the country's nuclear operators that they had been
informed of the contaminations as early as mid-1980s but had
failed to inform the government.
</P>
<P>
After a stormy debate, the Greens' call for Merkel's
resignation was finally turned down by a majority vote in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the nuclear incident might still has political
repercussions because it came at a time when Kohl is trailing in
polls of voter's support with only four month to go before the
general elections in September this year.
</P>
<P>
The Greens, which hopes to join the main opposition Social
Democratic Party in a new government after the election,
threatened Wednesday to seek the establishment of a parliament
committee to launch further investigations into the scandal.

<HEADLINE> NATO Not Ready for Deployment in Albania: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- NATO, the 16-nation western
military alliance, admitted Thursday that it was not quite ready
for deployment in Albania, but its planners could work out
detailed action plans within weeks.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official said that the NATO Military Committee, the
highest military authority within the alliance, was given the
mandate a month ago to make detailed studies for options of
sending NATO-led border-monitoring troops to Albania.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the Military Committee had been
considering three options with from small to large troop sizes to
help guard Albania's northern border with the Yugoslavian province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He quoted United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
as saying that the alliance could not afford too few nor too many
troops.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the manpower had to correspond to the mandate
otherwise NATO troops would fall short of their mission.
</P>
<P>
When asked to elaborate on the number of the largest size of
what NATO described as a preventive force, the NATO official said
that it had to be as large as between 20,000 and 23,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
A considerable force had to be deployed to help guard the
140-kilometer border shared by Albania and Kosovo and the lack of
infrastructure in the Balkan country made the deployment of the
NATO preventive force difficult, he explained.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers agreed during their half-yearly council
meeting on Thursday that all NATO actions must be in conformity
with the United Nations Charter and international law.
</P>
<P>
The NATO official disclosed that it was the first time that
NATO consulted Russia on military action before NATO member states
made a decision.
</P>
<P>
NATO authorities discussed with Russia's permanent
representative to the alliance on Wednesday plans for assistance
to be offered to Albania and NATO foreign ministers were to meet
and discuss with their counterpart Yevgeny Primakov the issue of
Kosovo during the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
When pressed for a definite reply whether Russia supported or
opposed NATO intervention in the Balkans, the NATO official
only said that Russia did not say it would not participate in the
preventive force.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A pharmaceutical company, run by
musicians and music lovers, has bought 150 sculptures of Beethoven
to give to music societies, colleges and individuals in China.
</P>
<P>
The 28-mm high bronze sculpture was created by Prof. Zeng
Zhushao, who has done works of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and former Peking
University president, Cai Yuanpei.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's Music Weekly bought the rights to the sculpture and
had 170 copies made to commemorate the 170th anniversary of
Beethoven's death last year. No.001 has gone to the Hong Kong
Symphony Orchestra, while others have gone to the Chinese
playwright Wu Zuguang, the director and conductor-in-chief of the
Beijing Symphony Orchestra Tan Lihua, and to some schools that
actively promote after-class musical activities.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Canadian Shaanxi Wenhai Pharmaceutical Co.,
Ltd. bought the remaining 150 sculptures. Xiu Jun, president of
the three-year-old joint venture, graduated from the Tianjin
Conservatory of Music with a degree in composition and was once a
violinist in a local song and dance ensemble before going into
business.
</P>
<P>
General manager Lin Zishen, of Hong Kong, said he is just a
music lover but says that his wife, who studied singing for some
time at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, is connected with
musicians, and the company's sales manager is a professional sax
player.

<HEADLINE> NATO Decides to Assist Albania, Macedonia in Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) decided on Thursday to launch
NATO-led assistance programs in Albania and Macedonia to help
secure their borders with Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The programs include a military exercise involving ground and
air forces in Albania in August and another in Macedonia in
September and the establishment of a NATO/Partnership for Peace
(PFP) liaison in Albania's capital.
</P>
<P>
Both Albania and Macedonia are PFP member states.
</P>
<P>
NATO's standing force in the Mediterranean was authorized by
the foreign ministers council meeting to make a port call to
Durres in Albania in early July and the measures are seen as a
sign of the NATO's display of PFP solidarity.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers also expressed their support for the
United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe in monitoring activity as well as for NATO's preventive
deployments in Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
A NATO statement released after the meeting said that the
western military alliance was "deeply concerned by the situation
in Kosovo" and it deplored "the continuing use of violence in
suppressing political dissent or in pursuit of political change."
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that the problems of Kosovo could best
be resolved through a process of open and unconditional dialogue
between authorities in Belgrade and the leadership of the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We support a political solution which provides an enhanced
status for Kosovo, preserves the territorial integrity of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and safeguards the human and civil
rights of all inhabitants of Kosovo," it added.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Companies Keep High Confidence in HK: Japanese Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Latest statistics show that
Japanese companies, far from being pessimistic about their current
status in Hong Kong, are in fact very upbeat about the future
here, Kunihiko Makita, consul-general of Japan in Hong Kong said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the dinner reception hosted by the Chinese
Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, Makita said that the
results of a survey conducted by the Consulate of Japan among 737
Japanese companies in Hong Kong last month showed that the
companies questioned have actually increased the number of staff
for the period from July 1997 to March 1998.
</P>
<P>
During the same period more companies in the survey said they
have expanded their office or factory space than those who have
reduced their working area, Makita said.
</P>
<P>
When these companies were asked what their strategies were for
the next three years, more than 60 percent of the Japanese
companies questioned planned at least to maintain their current
size, while 25 percent were actually planning to expand their
operations over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, nearly one third of the Japanese companies questioned
from the commerce and manufacturing sectors confirmed they would
be expanding their operations over the next three years, the
consul general said.
</P>
<P>
Makita said despite the economic slowdown in Hong Kong due to
the current Asian economic crisis, there are still grounds for
optimism for the future since all the sound economic fundamentals
of Hong Kong still exist.
</P>
<P>
The proven success of the "one country, two systems" principle
and the determined support from China's central government
obviously are sources of confidence, Makita said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Lawmakers Set No-Confidence Vote in PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) has set Saturday for a vote of no-confidence in the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) headed by Yasser Arafat for
its inaction.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made by the legislative body in West Bank
city Ramallah on Thursday after 28 legislators, including several
PLC members of Arafat's own Fatah faction, signed a petition in
favor of holding such a vote.
</P>
<P>
They were to protest the PNA's failure to approve the 1998
budget or implement the laws passed by the PLC, according to the
Jerusalem-based Palestinian press service JMCC.
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's session, the seventh session of the second
term, the PLC was briefed on the report on allocating the PNA
budget for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Several PLC members in the past several days have threatened to
table a no-confidence motion to the PLC, saying the PNA has not
implemented the long-promised reforms following charges of
high-level corruption and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat signed on Thursday a number of laws such as the Civil
Service Law and the Law for Monitoring Precious Minerals. But this
could not prevent some lawmakers from submitting their
no-confidence motion for voting.
</P>
<P>
PLC Speaker Abu Ala also tried to prevent the lawmakers from
setting a date for the no-confidence vote. But Azmi Suhabi, an
independent legislator from Ramallah, collected signatures in
favor of holding a special session on Saturday from 28 members,
enough to put it on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here said that Arafat and his PNA would
survive any no-confidence vote because the majority of the
88-member PLC supports Arafat and even if the motion did pass, it
could only lead to a cabinet reshuffle by Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Thai Scholars on Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Stabilizing Thai baht, keeping
ample foreign reserves and maintaining public trust in the
government's economic policies are what should be done to get
Thailand out of the economic mire, a famous Thai scholar said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Somchai Pacapakviwat, a prestigious scholar specializing in
both politics and economics, made the remarks at a seminar on
economic crisis, organized by the Chinese Studies Center of
Chulalongkorn University and attended by both Chinese and Thai
experts.
</P>
<P>
Somchai briefed the experts on the government's steps in
solving the current economic problems.
</P>
<P>
First, stabilizing the exchange rate of Thai baht against hard
currencies; second, restructuring the financial sector by closing
56 finance companies last year and taking over another 7 companies
last week; third, controlling the spread of bad debts so as to
restore confidence in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Another famous Thai scholar, associate professor Sompop
Manarungsang from the Chulalongkorn University, analyzed the root
causes of the economic and financial crisis in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He said bubble economy should be blamed for the crisis. Big
bubbles in non-manufacturing sectors such as real estate and stock
market were blown up by the massive influx of short-term,
low-interest loans from abroad after the country opened its
financial sector in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Political instability in the country, featured by the frequent
changes of finance ministers and central bank governors, further
worsened the economic situation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kovit Posayanon, another professor from the Chulalongkorn
University, reviewed the measures the government has taken to
reform the financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that financial institutions should attach
importance to long-term objectives research and plans of sustained
development.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Producer Inflation Rises in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's producer
inflation ticked up to 2.9 percent year-on-year last month from
2.3 percent in March, according to the latest statistics released
by the Central Statistical Services (CSS).
</P>
<P>
It was expected in the market that the producer inflation
would only rise by 2.4 percent in April, local media reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The CSS figures showed a monthly rise in the producer price
index of one percent following price increases across the
spectrum of agricultural, mining, beverage and paper products,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The index of imported goods was unchanged form March but up
1.3 percent from April last year, influenced by the recent
weakness of the Rand.
</P>
<P>
Economists noted that the year-on-year increase was the first
since March last year. They predicted producer inflation would
end the year at just more than four percent, and the average for
the year would be about 3.5 percent, well below last year's 7.1
percent.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD Official Says Small Firms Have Big Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) can be leading entrepreneurial engines for development but
many governments in developing countries have not realized the
importance, said a senior United Nations official here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Actions are needed to develop the enormous potential that
these firms have and to stimulate growth and development through
foreign direct investment (FDI)," said U.N. Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD) Secretary-General Rubens Ricupero.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD chief made the remarks at launching his agency's new
report, entitled A Handbook on Foreign Direct Investment by Small
and Medium-sized Enterprises: Lessons from Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We want to encourage governments to build healthy SME sectors
and cooperate in stimulating the international investment
potential of these firms," Ricupero said. "Actions can be taken
through greater exchanges of information on SME experiences,
harmonizing regulations and simplifying regulatory provisions."
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD report is based on case studies of the economic
structures and policies of selected Asian economies including
Japan, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Current levels of FDI in Asia by SMEs, accounting for barely 10
percent of total regional FDI, are below their full potential,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD suggests that the mix of policies and programs be
designed to establish monitoring and performance systems;
encourage the development of growth-oriented and internationally
oriented SMEs in the domestic economy; provide accurate
information to foreign investors that are SMEs.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for encouraging linkages between SMEs across
borders; providing appropriate incentives to SMEs and their access
to support services and infrastructure; and addressing specific
impediments and barriers to foreign direct invest by SMEs.
</P>
<P>
The report has found that obstacles the SMEs are facing in
investing abroad include unfair competition, complex business
regulations, difficult investment approval systems and corruption.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-three percent of small investors and 71 percent of
medium-sized investors questioned said corruption by low-level
officials was a major problem.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Warn Of More Deaths From Teen Smoking In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Anti-smoking groups warn that China
will have an increase in the number of smoking-related deaths in
the next three decades unless steps are taken to curb teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
The annual number of smoking-related deaths will climb to 2
million by the year 2025, compared with 750,000 now, and most of
them will come from today's adolescents, a group of health
officials, doctors, educators, and representatives of the World
Health Organization were told at a meeting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held to discuss ways of keeping young people
away from cigarettes, and ways of stopping tobacco advertising and
the images of smoking on TV.
</P>
<P>
China reported an increase in smoking among males aged 15 to
25, an increase of as much as 6 percentage points since the
1984-1996 period.
</P>
<P>
The average age for the first puff in 1996 was about 19, or 3
years earlier than it was in 1984, according to a recent national
survey of smoking patterns in China. Almost 90 percent of the
smokers started before the age of 19.
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, many children are becoming victims of
passive smoking, because 90 percent of the smokers puff away in
public places and 70 percent of them do so at home, says
Prof. Zhang Yifang, vice president of the China Association of
Tobacco or Health.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting complained about the images of
movie stars with cigarettes dangling from their lips and sports
matches boldly sponsored by tobacco giants that encourage young
people to just light up. "Many teenagers can't resist the
temptation of a small cigarette when smoking looks enjoyable or
fashionable," says Zhang Lichuan, an official with the Beijing
Municipal Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yifang told Xinhua that his association intends to push
for a ban of cigarette sales to people under 18, but efforts have
so far proven less than fruitful. "The work is really tough since
the tobacco industry is still a leading taxpayer, and it creates
new consumers constantly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has started prohibiting some tobacco stores from
selling cigarettes to minors, the first move of its kind in the
country.

SHENZHEN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The construction of China's first
electrified high-speed railway, from Guangzhou to Shenzhen in
southern Guangdong Province, was completed today. It is the

By June 10, when the railway is fully electrified, a new
locomotive from Sweden will make test-runs on the tracks at 200 km

<P>
With the completion of the railway and the use of the Swedish

draws near, Leonel Allerto Alves, a Portuguese man who was born in
Macao, says that he is confident about Macao's future and will

</P>
<P>
Alves has a law practice in Macao and was made a member of the

</P>
<P>
Many Portuguese who were born here are civil servants or work

want to play an active part in the transition and transfer of
power and will work together with other residents of Macao to

BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government plans to
spend 40 billion yuan more on highway construction in 1998,
bringing total spending for the year to 160 billion yuan,
according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
Of that amount, 90 billion yuan will be used for key road
projects, 50 billion yuan for improving highway networks and hubs,
and 20 billion yuan for roads in rural and poor areas.
</P>
<P>
The government has goals for highway construction in the Ninth
Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), and wants to reach those two years
ahead of schedule, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Five-Year Plan calls for 24,000 km of new roads to bring
the total mileage in China to 1.25 million km.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China is expected to build 1,117 km of expressways,
296 km more than the plans call for.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Trade Official Optimistic About Trade With Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The trade of China's inland areas
with Hong Kong could still see improvement this year, because most
exports to Hong Kong could be re-exported to Europe and the United
States, where the economy is growing steadily.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wende, the director of the Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao
Affairs Department under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, says that trade between the inland and Hong Kong
increased at a slower rate in the first quarter than for the same
1997 period, but was still higher than the average growth of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from Customs show that inland exports to Hong Kong,
its second biggest trade partner, were worth 9.94 billion
U.S. dollars, while imports from the region were worth 1.47
billion U.S. dollars, up 15.1 and 5.2 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Inland exports to Hong Kong of garments, electric machinery and
plastic products rose by 29.1, 12.2 and 17.6 percent respectively
while the shoe exports doubled.
</P>
<P>
The inland increased imports from Hong Kong, adding about 28
percentage points from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong re-exported most of its imports from the inland
China, 55 percent of them to North America and European Union.
</P>
<P>
Trade experts here believe that inland exports to Hong Kong
will continue to grow.

<HEADLINE> WHO Calls for Actions Against Tobacco Use Among Youths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
has urged the international community to take tough action to
prevent children and young people from smoking.
</P>
<P>
"Unless tough action is taken immediately, the tobacco epidemic
will prematurely claim the lives of about 250 million children and
young people alive today," said WHO Deputy Director-General ad
interim Dr Fernando Antezana Thursday in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came on the occasion of World No-Tobacco Day 1998
on May 31 which is dedicated this year to children under the theme
"Growing Up Without Tobacco."
</P>
<P>
Antezana said that in many countries, tobacco use was rising
among young people, while the age of smoking initiation is
declining. The majority of smokers began in their teenage years or
earlier.
</P>
<P>
However, he believed if young people did not begin smoking
before the age of 20, they were unlikely to start as adults.
</P>
<P>
The WHO estimates that about one-third of the adult population
smokes and that out of two smokers, who started at a young age and
continue smoking throughout their lives, one will ultimately be
killed by a tobacco-related illness.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say there are a number of complex and interacting
reasons why children and adolescents begin smoking. Often, they
mistake smoking for an attribute of independence.
</P>
<P>
They say that the image of independence has been skillfully built
by tobacco advertizing and promotional activities.
</P>
<P>
"Early use of tobacco products is purposeful and is the result of
demand created by the tobacco industry," said Director of the United
States Office on Smoking and Health Michael Eriksen.
</P>
<P>
"As adults, we must stand up for the health of the world's
children, even in the face of considerable opposition," Antezana
said. "It is time for all of us to make those critical decisions,
which will truly allow our children to grow up without tobacco."

<HEADLINE> China Developing Use of Ethnic Minority Medicines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The traditional medicines used by
China's ethnic minority groups have gained in popularity over the
past 20 years and there are now 128 hospitals and 10,000 people
involved in using them.
</P>
<P>
There are 52 hospitals that specialize in traditional Tibetan
medicine, Zhu Guoben, chairman of the Chinese Society of
Traditional Ethnic Medicine, told a national symposium on
traditional medicines that started in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The traditional medicines of 30 ethnic groups have been
collected in a systematic way, and the medicines of the Tibetan,
Mongolian, Uygur, Dai, and Zhuang nationalities have done
especially well, Zhu says.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1970s, local governments have set up standards for
Tibetan and Mongolian medicines that have been added to the
national pharmacopoeia, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are at least 30 factories in Qinghai Province, the Tibet
and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions, and other areas producing
400 types of traditional medicine, some of them producing
brand-name products and making a name for themselves.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the symposium is to get more ethnic minority
medicines into the domestic and world market, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium is sponsored by the Chinese Society for
the Traditional Medicine of Ethnic Groups.
</P>
<P>
The society will publish a guide book on Chinese traditional
medicines of ethnic minorities based on information gathered at
the symposium.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- An Afghan group called on the world
community Thursday to speed up the process of seeking a solution
to the crisis of his country.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Tehran, Secretary General of the Afghan

He said that Iran, the current OIC chairman and a neighbor of
Afghanistan, is able to play a key role in helping solve the
Afghan problem and establish peace and stability in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hubei branch of the People's
Bank of China (PBOC) penalized 6 financial institutions and 26
individuals earlier this week for failing to comply with finance
laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
This closely followed the central bank's penalizing the
directors of 8 other financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
This year, the bank has worked to improve financial order
during the period of reforms to eliminate financial risks.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the financial sector say that finance departments
have looked into various kinds of malpractice in business and
local departments have paid attention off-the-record operations,
paying high interest for deposits, using public funds for private
benefit, and improper cash management.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions are also trying to improve internal
controls. According to PBOC rules and regulations, if any
financial institution is found guilty of serious malpractices, the
director and employees face the risk of losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, PBOC's governor, said recently that the new
round of financial reforms benefits financial developments and
improves employee quality, and that good financial order is a
significant part of the reforms.

CHONGQING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The First Intermediate People's
Court of Chongqing Municipality, in southwest China, today
sentenced a children-trafficker Yan Guangfen to death and deprived
her of properties valued at 50,000 yuan at a public gathering.
</P>
<P>
Yan was executed soon after the announcement was made. Yan's
death penalty has been approved by the Higher Court of the city
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four members of Yan's trafficking clique, all women,
also received imprisonment terms ranging from 12 years to eight
years, plus sums of fines.
</P>
<P>
According to the court, the five-member group trafficked 12
boys in Chongqing between May 1996 and February 1998. Of the
kids, 10 were sold to eastern Fujian Province, some 1,200 km away
from their home.
</P>
<P>
Yan alone was directly involved in 11 of the 12 traffickings,
the court said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) made
these announcement here on Thursday after concluding a two-day
meeting on the renewal of Macao's member status to some
international bodies and the continuation of world conventions
applicable to Macao.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xi'an, representative of the Chinese side of the JLG,
said that the consensus was reached very quickly after reviewing
the list of about 200 international conventions applicable to
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Among the agreed some 80 conventions, some have already been
effective in Macao and some are still not, but will after 1999,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that consultation on the international
convention issue should be completed basically by the end of the
year so that the re-registration procedure can be started next
year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the talks on Macao's member status to some
international organizations after 1999 has also entered its final
stage and is expected to complete this year.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese side has provided the Chinese side with a list
of international organizations that Macao hopes to join in before
the handover in 1999. It contains less than 10 organizations.
</P>
<P>
"We will make further studies of the list," Wang told
reporters on Thursday. "The Chinese side will support the entry so
long as it is necessary for Macao and benefits Macao."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang said that the two sides reached consensus at
the meeting on Macao's entry into four international bodies after
1999. They include two on bank supervision, one on moneywashing,
and one on a world sports body.

<HEADLINE> 5 Leftist Rebels Killed in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Five suspected members of the
leftist rebel group, the New People's Army (NPA), were killed
during separate armed encounters with the Philippine government
troops over the weekend, the military said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. Melchor Rosales, chief of Civil Military Operations
of the Philippines' Armed Forces, said Thursday that the
government troops encountered the rebels in separate battles,
killing five rebels in the southern provinces of Camarines Sur and
South Cotabato.
</P>
<P>
Rosales said a lot of rifles were also seized after the
gunfights in the clash areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Col. Nestor Castillo, a military spokesman,
dismissed charges of the National Democratic Front (NDF) that the
military has allegedly violated an earlier agreement on the
suspension of military operations.
</P>
<P>
Jalandoni, a negotiator of the NDF which led the NPA,
reportedly charged that the military attacked NPA camps and
captured wounded guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Castillo said the NDF's refusal to declare a joint ceasefire
with the government was an indication of their insincere attitude
in forging peace with the government.
</P>
<P>
The NDF, a leftist alliance created by the Communist Party of
the Philippines in the late 1960s, has fought the government for
decades. The group began its on-and-off exploratory peace talks
with the government six years ago, but the two sides have so far
failed to reach any agreement.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Moroccan King Hassan II wound up his
three-day visit here Thursday, during which he coordinated stance
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on salvaging the stalled
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak sent Hassan off at Cairo International Airport at noon
Thursday, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency did not give details about their talks. But Arab
League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid termed Hassan's visit
as "an important step toward a concerted Arab plan of action."
</P>
<P>
Hassan's visit came at a time when the Israeli-Palestinian
talks have been deeply stranded due to Israel's intransigence, and
Arab countries are pushing for an Arab summit to discuss the
peace-making after the U.S. has failed to persuade Israel to
accept its proposal.
</P>
<P>
Israel has turned down a U.S. formula calling on it to pullback
its troops from 13 percent more of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The MENA has quoted an Egyptian diplomat as saying that
Hassan's visit to Egypt was partly in preparation for the summit,
proposed by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Hassan and Mubarak witnessed the signing of several agreements
and protocols on cooperation between the two countries in
judiciary, oil, tourism, agriculture, electricity and fishery.
</P>
<P>
A free trade zone agreement was also signed to boost bilateral
trade which currently stands at 30 million dollars annually.

BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A group of non-communist party
leaders attended today's discussion on the country's economic
situation and its future development with the background of the
current financial turmoils in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The panel was sponsored by the United Front Work Department of

<HEADLINE> HK Banks Strong Enough to Weather Difficulties: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Even if bad debts do rise and
profits are lower, Hong Kong banks have the fundamental capital
strength to manage their way through the current difficulties,
said a senior Hong Kong monetary official on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
David Carse, deputy chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA), described the Asian financial crisis as a
"one-in-a-lifetime" event, which is bound to have an impact on the
banks' funding, loan growth, asset quality and profitability.
</P>
<P>
"However, the Hong Kong banking sector is robust enough to
withstand this," the official told a press conference reviewing
the performance of the banking sector in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Deposit growth was sluggish between January and March, up 1.8
percent compared with the December quarter while domestic loans
falling 0.8 percent in the period, he noted.
</P>
<P>
And the regional crisis and the slowdown of the domestic
economy led to some deterioration in asset quality, Carse
continued. For the local banks, loans overdue for more than three
months increased from 1.57 percent at end-December 1997 to 1.97
percent at end-March 1998, while overall problem loans, measured
by classified loans, grew from 2.08 percent to 2.77 percent.
</P>
<P>
But they are still low by international standards, the official
noted.
</P>
<P>
"Further deterioration can be expected in the coming months
although not to the extent seen in other parts of Asia. However,
even deterioration occurs, banks have substantial protection from
continued operating profits, existing bad debt provisions and high
capital adequacy ratios," the official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
All local banks made profits in the first quarter, though lower
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
"Lower profitability is not by itself a cause for concern in
terms of systemic stability because banks remain highly
capitalized and highly liquid," he noted.

Program on the theme "Hong Kong, Our Home - Let's Serve and Share"
would be launched in July this year to bring young people aged six
to 25 a joyful and meaningful summer, it was announced here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The highlight of this year's program would be on the community
service aspect, with particular emphasis on services to the
disabled, elderly living on their own and new arrivals from
China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here on Thursday, Norman Lo,
chairman of the Summer Youth Program (SYP) Committee, said SYP
entered its 30th anniversary in 1998 since its founding in 1969.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, more than 15,000 activities were organized for
1,1170,000 participants, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 SYP budget amounted to 63 million HK dollars (8.08
million U.S. dollars), of which 19 million HK dollars (2.44
million U.S. dollars) was contributed by the Hong Kong Jockey Club
Charities Trust and the balance was covered by relevant government
departments, the Provisional District Boards and corporate
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
The press conference was followed by an oath-taking ceremony
for district volunteers and members of the Power of Youth, which
comprised of outstanding young people who had taken part in past
SYP activities.

<HEADLINE> Italian Coach Sees Brazil as Favourite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Brazil remains the favourite for the
coming World Cup in France while Asian outfit Saudi Arabia might
raise a few eyebrows, Italian coach Cesare Maldini said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"It's too early to make real forecasts," said Maldini, "but
Brazil has players who are the envy of the whole world and is the
favourite to win the competition," Maldini told the reporters.
</P>
<P>
In Maldini's opinion, no outsiders can really hope to upset the
Form Book and make it to the last eight.
</P>
<P>
In Group A, he said Brazil and Norway are to go through; in
Group C, France and Denmark; in Group D, Spain and Bulgaria, with
Nigeria a possible threat; In Group E, Holland and Belgium; in
Group F, Germany and Yugoslavia; in Group G, England and Romania;
and in Group H, Croatia and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
But Maldini warned that Asian side Saudi Arabia might be more
of a threat to hosts France and 1992 European champions Denmark
than Nigeria to the rest of the Group D, which many pundits
believe.
</P>
<P>
He refused to advance forecasts for Group B, where Italy is
playing with Austria, Cameroon and Chile.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Maldini said only that "We know Austria and Chile
better, while Cameroon has lost an important player (Foe), yet
qualified easily."
</P>
<P>
On the individual front, like most of the world, Maldini sees
Brazilian Ronaldo as the one star the World Cup is likely to
confirm as the World No.1, but he also cites Juventus star,
Alessandro Del Piero.
</P>
<P>
"For him, I hope it will be a graduation exam."
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned the Yugoslav Mijatovic, Michael Owen of
England, Iliev of Romania, "some Spaniards" and Marcelo The
Matador Salas, the Chilean star bought by Lazio and one of the
Italy's opponents in the group games.
</P>
<P>
Maldini also believes, with the introduction of the new rules
meant to rule out the tackles from behind, "The players with
better technique will be favoured, but the powerful defenders
should also maintain their space."
</P>
<P>
"England, Scotland and Germany may suffer most," he added.
</P>
<P>
But still, the Italian predicts "many goals, at least in the
first phase, since there are great players taking part."

BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China has so far conducted
cooperation with more than 50 countries in the building materials
sector, with foreign investment expanding rapidly to new building
materials, high technology and intensive processing.
</P>
<P>
A large number of building materials projects
financed with loans from the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank have gone into operation, according to Lei Qianzhi, deputy
director of the State Administration of Building Materials
Industry.
</P>
<P>
And, a group of gigantic technical transformation projects
involving sanitary ceramic production, financed with a 100 million
US dollars loan from Italy, has been going on smoothly in the
provinces of Shaanxi, Shandong, Guangdong, Jilin and Hunan.
</P>
<P>
The official said that since 1997 China has signed cooperation
agreements with the Netherlands, Germany, Tailand, Greece,
Australia, Japan, France and Denmark, witnessing a growing number
of foreign partners in the building materials sector.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that China's exports of building materials
exceeded 2.1 billion US dollars in 1997, and its cement exports
amounted to a record 12 million tons last year, up 46 percent over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has cumulatively injected five billion US dollars
in overseas investment into the country's building materials
industry.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the country has also introduced
advanced precalcining kiln production lines from other countries
in recent years and built a number of large and modern-sized cement
plants, adding an annual cement production capacity of 22
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a number of large float glass production lines
jointly funded by companies from Britain, the US and Japan, with a

<HEADLINE> China Arrests Four Taiwanese For Espionage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Four people from Taiwan were
arrested and charged with espionage in March this year, state
security officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
Kou Jianming, 42, Han Yueting 35, Chen Shaoyu, 43, and Zhou
Changming, 36, have admitted being sent to the mainland by the
Taiwan "Defense Ministry's Military Intelligence Bureau" to
collect political, economic, and military information.
</P>
<P>
Kou, 42, a Taiwan resident, who is the head of a Taiwan
publishing house, started the China Cross-straits Non-governmental
Exchange Association (CANEA) in 1991 in Taiwan and shortly
afterwards began to spy for the "Military Intelligence Bureau",
which paid for his office in Taiwan and a monthly salary.
</P>
<P>
Kuo was told to recruit agents under the cover of CANEA and to
send them to spy on the mainland. From June 1993 to March 1998,
Kou sneaked into the mainland several times and collected
political, economic, military and social information.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested in mid-March in Beijing and police found
instructions from Taiwan military intelligence on his person.
</P>
<P>
He had brought the other three suspects into CANEA and sent
them to the mainland to spy as well.
</P>
<P>
The state security department has called seven people in for
questioning who may be involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits contacted the Straits Exchange Foundation in Taiwan about
this today.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blast Kills 2 Israeli Soldiers in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were killed
by a roadside bomb in south Lebanon late Wednesday night and
Hezbollah guerillas have claimed responsibility, Israel Radio
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two 20-year-old soldiers were taking part in a united
military action in the Israeli self-declared security zone in
south Lebanon when the bomb exploded, the radio said. Two other
soldiers were wounded.
</P>
<P>
This brought to six the number of Israeli soldiers who have
been killed since the beginning of the year. Nine Israeli-allied
South Lebanon Army militiamen have also been killed during the
period.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted military sources as saying that the bomb was
apparently detonated from a distance. It said Hezbollah guerillas
have claimed responsibility for the bomb explosion.
</P>
<P>
The incident followed four straight days of Israeli air raids
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Senior Israeli military officials warned of a further
deterioration in the area, linking increasing Hezbollah activities
in the area with the municipal elections being held in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war in south Lebanon in a bid
to drive the 2,000 Israeli soldiers from the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
areas from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.

<P>
And their half-yearly gathering this time is expected to task
NATO military commanders to work out immediate contingencies and
longer-term measures to cope with the crisis in the Balkans.

An option for them are joint military exercises in Macedonia,
scheduled for September this year, and in Albania, expected to
take place as early as this summer.

Both Macedonia and Albania are member states of NATO's
Partnership for Peace (PFP) program and NATO stated that it has to
act to demonstrate solidarity within the PFP framework.

LUANDA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Angola is striving to develop its

materials for its national industry.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 150-200 Cambodians Killed by Landmines: CMAC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- About 150-200 people were killed
per month in Cambodia although the war has stopped there,
Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC) Director Sam Sotha told
reporters here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After a five-year concerted clearance efforts, the CMAC
estimated that there are 4 million to 6 million mines left in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The director said that the dreadful challenge of removal of
every anti-personnel land mine and UXO (unexploded ordnance) will
take a long time, however, in the short term they set an aim of
zero mine incident casualties, according to the Australian
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Sotha said CMAC's program of mine awareness training and
minefield surveying had reduced mine casualties to zero in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
In five years of operations, 3,000 deminers have cleared 50
million square meters for the loss of one dead and 34 injured,
Sotha said.
</P>
<P>
But the CMAC database still features 2,700 suspected
minefields. New technology, including better mine detectors and
mine flails and explosives snifter dogs, offers the promise of
speeding up the clearance process.
</P>
<P>
The clearance job still comes down to one person working on
hands and knees probing the earth a few centimeters at a time.
</P>
<P>
Sotha said that Australia heads the list of countries providing
15 million Australian dollars (9.5 million U.S. dollars) aid.
</P>
<P>
"My purpose to visit here is to say thank you to the Australian
Government and people and, secondly to beg for a continuation of
support," Sotha said.

LAGOS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 people have been killed

<HEADLINE> Indian Trade Deficit Widens in 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- India's trade deficit widened by
a whopping 6.6 billion U.S. dollars despite a sharp decline in
imports which grew at a rate of 5.8 percent in the fiscal year
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
Economic Survey 1997-98 tabled in parliament Thursday said the
balance of payments situation in 1996-97 and 1997-98 remained
manageable despite some concerns on the export front.
</P>
<P>
India's export growth decelerated to 2.6 percent in 1997-98
from 4.5 percent in 1996-97 after three successive years of
increase ranging from 18 to 20 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
The total imports in the last fiscal year were 40.779 billion
U.S. dollars while the exports were 33.980 billion dollars,
according to provisional figures listed by the survey.
</P>
<P>
The demand for imports has been subdued over the last two
years, reflecting a moderation in industrial activity, it said.
</P>
<P>
A noticeable decline in the growth of external trade in 1996
and 1997, decline in export prices of some major items of
manufactured goods and appreciation of India's currency rupee in
real effective exchange rate terms were caused by both foreign and
domestic factors, said the survey, prepared by the Ministry of
Finance.
</P>
<P>
However, non-oil import recovered in 1997-98 to grow by about
14.5 percent over the corresponding period of the previous year,
when it recorded a meager 5.2 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
Oil imports fell by 20.6 percent in 1997-98 after an average
growth of about 30 percent in the previous two years primarily due
to softening of international prices of crude oil and petroleum
products.
</P>
<P>
The survey called the government to take urgent steps to boost
export, bolster capital markets and cut interest rates, thus
ensuring availability of productive capital to industry for
arresting industrial slowdown of in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
India's industrial growth in 1997-98 slowed down to 4.2 percent
from 7.1 percent the previous year mainly due to decline in
investment.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey said, India's macroeconomic fundamentals
are "reasonably strong" compared to the East Asian countries which
are reeling under financial stress.
</P>
<P>
The survey urged the government to devise "effective (social)
security nets" to shield the poor and vulnerable sections against
income fluctuations and market failures.
</P>
<P>
It predicted earlier that foodgrain production target of 200
million tons in 1997-98 is unlikely to be achieved owing mainly to
the fall in wheat production.

<HEADLINE> Kuala Lumpur Stocks Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange closed broadly lower Thursday due to
continued negative perception of the local and regional economic
situation.
</P>

</P>
<P>
An analyst said investors continued to stay away from the

better in the near term as reflected by most of the major regional

<P>
COLOMBO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Five Tamil school boys have been
abducted by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in North
Central Province of sri Lanka, police sources here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the boys were fishing in a lake at Bowatta in
Polonnaruwa District, 220 kilometers from here Wednesday evening,
when a group LTTE rebels arrived. All five boys were between 12
and 14 years of age.
</P>
<P>
The parents of the children had made complaints at local police
who are investigating, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Only two weeks ago, LTTE leaders assured the visiting United
Nations special envoy on Children and Armed Conflict Olara Otunnu
that children would not be recruited.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been waging a 15-year war against the
government for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the

<HEADLINE> HK's Economy to Rebound once Regional Situation Settles: HKSAR FS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economy should be
able to rebound expeditiously from the current doldrums, once the
regional situation has settled, Donald Tsang, Financial Secretary
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tsang admitted that in the light of a further deterioration in
regional and local economic conditions in the more recent months,
his earlier forecast of economic growth for the current year is
likely to be unattainable.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 12th International
Travel Expo Hong Kong Thursday, Tsang said what lower level of
growth it should be it was impossible to assess with any precision
at this stage, as the situation in the region continued to be
volatile.
</P>
<P>
"The efficiency of Hong Kong's economy tends to reflect these
external events with their wide implications exceptionally
promptly in various performance indicators. This compounds the
difficulty of forecasting."
</P>
<P>
He added that the SAR Government Economist would be providing a
fuller analysis of the latest situation when he published the
Government's First Quarter Economic Report on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tsang noted that the austere economic situation and the
uncertainties surrounding the region since the outbreak of the
Asian financial turmoil loomed large.
</P>
<P>
"The current sluggishness and financial sector troubles in
Japan add to the stringency while the controversy over nuclear
tests in the sub-continent creates new regional tensions," he
remarked.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the economies in the region, and elsewhere, are
suffering badly. Their growth forecast for this year have been
shaved down substantially, in certain cases to well in the
negative range. Interest rates were in double digits.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong, being what we are, cannot be immune from this
plight," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
He was confident, however, that with the strong fundamentals,
coupled with the flexibility of adaptation to external shock, and
with the extent of price and cost adjustment, Hong Kong's economy
should be able to rebound expeditiously from the current doldrums,
once the regional situation has settled.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Remains Trapped in Tight Range </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Attempts to talk up the Australian
dollar by Federal Treasurer Peter Costello in New York overnight
had little effect in the foreign exchange market Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The local dollar remained trapped in a tight range for most of
the trading session, closing only slightly higher because of
strength in the Japanese yen and the gold price.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended the day back above the 62.00 U.S.
cents up from 61.98 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It has just been range trading most of the day, it tested
62.30 U.S. cents a couple of times and there seems to be a very
big sell order there that has capped it during the day," Colonial
State Bank foreign exchange dealer Nick Volanakis said.
</P>
<P>
"The buyers are all lined up around 62.05 U.S. cents."
</P>
<P>
The unit last night dipped to another new near 12-year low of
61.65 U.S. cents in early London trade.
</P>
<P>
In New York, Costello soon after that attempted to distance
Australia from the economic problems in Asia, ruling out further
cuts to economic growth forecasts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters Costello said the Australian dollar was
trading "on a very stable basis", the low Australian dollar also
made Australia an attractive destination for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Despite his positive comments, traders have predicted more
downside for the currency.
</P>
<P>
"The market does not seem to have a lot of conviction at this
stage," Volanakis said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was buying 85.42 Japanese yen from 85.29
and 1.1090 German marks from 1.0948.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Good Summer Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Though enduring a drought and
floods, China is expecting a good summer grain harvest this year,
according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"If there is no major natural disaster in the coming days, the
output will be just a little less than last year's," a ministry
official said today.
</P>
<P>
China harvested nearly 124 billion kilograms of grain last
summer, an all-time high. China has reaped good summer grain
harvests in three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
This year's summer grain planting area is similar to last year,
said the official.
</P>
<P>
Though the drought in major grain-producing provinces since
last winter had affected the growing of wheat, a major summer
grain crop, rainfall since April has eased the drought, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The drought will affect the grain harvest a little," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the problem now facing the grain harvest is
the rainfall in the southern part of the country. The continuous
drizzly climate could make wheat mold without sufficient sun.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has warned local governments to make preparations
for the harvesting and storing of wheat.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Water Resources also warned that China may face
more severe flooding this year than in previous years. Southern
provinces such as Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian and Guangdong have
suffered flooding in 100,000 hectares of crops.
</P>
<P>
To minimize the losses, the ministry has sent working teams to
flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
One-fourth of China's annual grain output comes from summer
harvest. The latest prediction from the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences said that the country is expected to harvest 497-to-500
billion kilograms of grain this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Travel Expo
(ITE) Hong Kong '98 remains a strong force in the travel industry
both in Hong Kong and Asia, Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said in his message to
the ITE HK '98, which opened here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to be the crossroads of the East and West
where visitors from all over the world for business or leisure and
we will continue to invest in our infrastructure and take the
necessary measures to ensure adequate support to our positions as
a leading tourist destination and aviation center in the region,"
he said in the message.

held since Hong Kong's handover last July.
</P>
<P>

travel industry in Asia, the organizers of the 12th annual event
managed to maintain the size and scale of ITE HK '98. Some 500
exhibitors from 50 countries and regions around the world are
attending this year's Travel Expo.

<HEADLINE> Chirac to Visit Lebanon for the Third Time in Two Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac will
pay a two-day visit to Lebanon from Saturday, the third since he
took office two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) said that the visit by Chirac comes at
a time when the Middle East peace process is blocked, and a feeling
of distrust toward the United States is on the rise among Arab
countries following its failure to persuade Israel to accept a
partial withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the European Union is also trying to play a full
part as a political partner in the efforts to revive the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that the reason for Chirac to repeatedly visit "the
nation of cedar" is that he has long chosen it as its "natural
gate" for restoring France's influence among Arab countries, as
Lebanon has strong cultural and historical links with France.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will meet with his Lebanese counterpart Elias Hrawi,
Prime Minister Rafic Hariri and parliament speaker Nabih Berri,
and will make a speech at the Superior School of Business in
Beirut, a Franco-Lebanese joint institution established in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He will also re-open the restored historical site of the French
embassy in Beirut, the Residence des Pins, which was abandoned by
France in 1982 during the invasion of Lebanon by Israeli troops.

<P>
DHAKA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
planned to conduct a combing operation soon to crackdown on
terrorists across the country, a press report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A list of three categories of terrorists has been prepared by
the law enforcing agencies to nab the miscreants, the report
quoted a senior police official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The decision for the crackdown which might start from the next
month came following an alarming rise of crimes, including murder,
rape and extortion, posing serious threat to the security of the
people, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Police were concerned about recent increase in the number of
terrorist activities in the capital of Dhaka and also across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of terrorists were arrested in the country in the
past two years, the official said. "But most of them were released
on bail and they again got involved in crimes," he added.

<HEADLINE> NATO Holds FMs Council Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The half-yearly meeting of NATO
council of foreign ministers, held here Thursday, is to focus on
Kosovo and the new strategic concept of the western military bloc.
</P>
<P>
NATO is considering sending peacemaking troops to northern
Albania to help fend off possible spillover into the Balkan nation
of the turmoil in neighboring Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers are to discuss options ranging from
minimum to maximum assistance to the Balkan country via sending
NATO-led troops consisting from 7,000 to 22,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Italy and some Scandinavian nations have expressed willingness
to join the NATO peacemaking force. Italy joined a NATO force to
assist Albania in calming down a domestic unrest early last year.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official, who asked not to be named, said the meeting
will send out an "important signal that NATO is interested in the
unstable region of the Balkans" and it will be there if needed.
</P>
<P>
Whether NATO should wait for a mandate from the United Nations
Security Council is the key issue in the decision-making process
of this two-day ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the meeting said France insists that a
U.N. mandate is a must for any NATO action in the Balkans whereas
the United States, Britain, Italy, Turkey and Canada opposed the
U.N. route and wanted to have a free hand for potential NATO move.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers will also meet their counterparts from

<HEADLINE> International Efforts Urged for South Asia Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China today urged the international
community to make concerted efforts and take a common stand to
stabilize the situation in South Asia after India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The comments were made by Zhu Bangzao, spokesman for China's
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in the routine news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that India is held solely responsible for the current
instable situation in South Asia. "In disregard of the opposition
from the international community, India wantonly conducted nuclear
test, posing a threat to neighboring countries," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative for the international community to take
common action in the effort to prompt India to abandon its nuclear
weapons development program and change its wrong stance in this
regard," Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the view that only in this way can the worries of
nations in the region about their security be eliminated.

<HEADLINE> Painful Adjustment to Make Hong Kong Healthier: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chief Executive of the
Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa said Thursday
that the current economic adjustment, which is painful and may
last longer, was a good thing for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"This is a necessary correction for us to move ahead and be
competitive again and to regain our economic vitality," Tung told
economists here Thursday at a conference jointly organized by the
International Institute for Strategic Studies and Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
In a question-and-answer session, the Hong Kong leader said
that Hong Kong was going through a period of structural adjustment
because years of high property prices, a negative interest rate,
and high inflation and wages had created a bubble.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian financial turmoil accelerated this correction," said
the Chief Executive, who admitted that the process could be
painful and prolonged.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed: "The adjustment is a good thing for Hong
Kong. I think after the adjustment period we will be much
healthier and better." Tung said he could not give a timetable for
a full recovery of Hong Kong economy before uncertainties in Asia
went away. But he was confident that Hong Kong would benefit from
China's economic expansion.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Researchers Discover New Method to Kill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at Malaysian
Science University have found a method to eradicate fruit flies
using the synthetic sex pheromone technique, the university's
Biological Science Studies Center Lecturer Prof. Tan Keng Hong
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The synthetic sex pheromone, produced from the chemical Methyl
Eugonole, was similar to that secreted by the male flies and could
be used to attract female fruit flies to a spot making it easier
for the insects to be exterminated, he said after attending the
opening of the five-day Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) international
conference in Pulau Pinang, northwestern Malaysia, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Pheromones are natural substances produced by plants and its
odour can be picked up by insects which are attracted to it," he
was quoted by Malaysia's national news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tan said research on the synthetic sex pheromone technique was
started some four years ago and the method was still on trial.
</P>
<P>
He said spraying the fruits with pesticides or covering them
had been found not to be effective in preventing attacks by fruit
flies.

<HEADLINE> China Woos Foreign Funds for Building Materials Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China has introduced five billion
U.S. dollars in overseas funds into its building materials
industry and is trying to attract even more.
</P>
<P>
The funds will be used to produce new building materials,
inorganic nonmetallic materials, and equipment to manufacture
building materials, according to a senior official with the State
Administration of Building Materials, which is asking overseas
enterprises involved to strictly abide by Chinese laws and rules
and to meet industry needs and provide advice.
</P>
<P>
The official said the use of overseas funds should take the
industry's product mix restructuring into consideration as well as
environmental protection. All overseas-funded projects must meet
international standards for environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Overseas funds will be introduced mainly for producing cement,
glass and ceramics. The country is encouraging the undertaking of
large cement projects and technology upgrading in small cement
plants. In cement production, the focus will be placed on
improving product quality.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Building Materials will also set
ceilings on overseas-funded enterprises, and will not allow the
establishment of wholly foreign-owned cement and glass
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Co-funded technological transformation or share-holding by
foreigners in key state-owned enterprises, whose products are
listed in the country's production plans, will be allowed only
with approval from government departments.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, overseas-funded projects should pay attention to
technical upgrading. China particularly encourages the
establishment of research and development centers for glass
fiber-reinforced plastic and other new building materials for the
sustained development of related technology.
</P>
<P>
Production equipment in overseas-funded cement, glass, and
ceramics enterprises should be purchased through bidding and at
least 50 percent of the equipment should be domestic, according to
the administration.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on Netanyahu's Visit to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The visit to China by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyaha took place at a critical time in the
development of the Middle East peace process, Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese and Israeli leaders had an exchange of views with
emphasis on how to push forward the Middle East peace talks," he
said in the routine news briefing.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese side expressed candidly its concern
over the current stalemate of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The key to breaking the deadlock is to earnestly implement the
agreements reached between the Israeli and Arab sides in
compliance with relevant UN resolutions and the principle of "Land
for Peace," he said, emphasizing that only when a comprehensive
and just peace is realized in the Middle East, will the region,
including Israel, enjoy genuine security.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Israeli side will size up the
situation, respond to the calls of the international community
and adopt a more flexible attitude, so as to push the peace talks
out of the dilemma and facilitate ensuring progress.
</P>
<P>
"China will, as always, make unremitting effort to this end," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, Netanyahu briefed the Chinese side on Israel's
contacts with the United States and other parties concerned. He
thanked the Chinese side for its concern over the cause of the
peace in the Middle East and hoped that China would play a greater
role in promoting the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Also, Zhu said that leaders of the two countries also exchanged
views on bilateral relations and international issues of
common interest. Both sides expressed willingness to further
strengthen cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit.
</P>
<P>
"No agreement on bilateral cooperation was signed during the
visit," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were killed
and two others wounded in south Lebanon overnight by a Lebanese
guerrillas' roadside bomb, Lebanon's Voice of the People radio
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded when an Israeli armored patrol passed on a
road leading to the village of Marka inside the Israeli occupied
security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The new casualties brought to six the number of Israeli
soldiers killed in south Lebanon since the start of 1998. Last
year, 39 Israeli soldiers were killed in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources said Israeli troops would soon
launch a harsh military offensive in retaliation for Hezbollah's
attack.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war in south Lebanon in a
bid to drive the 2,000 Israeli soldiers from the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
areas from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
But the heavy losses Israel has suffered in the area have
forced the Israeli government to think about ways of leaving
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has offered to withdraw from south Lebanon under the
condition that Lebanon grants border security before Israeli
troops pullout.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria have rejected the offer, insisting
that Israel must leave Lebanon as stipulated in the United
Nations Resolution 425, which calls for an unconditional and
immediate Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which has 40,000 troops deployed in Lebanon, seeks a
comprehensive deal which would also involve an Israeli withdrawal
from the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle
East war.

<HEADLINE> Indian Govt Tries to Ward off Effects of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government prescribed
immediate policy initiatives Thursday to try to ward off adverse
effects of sanctions imposed by the United States, Japan and other
countries following India's nuclear tests earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997-98 Economic Survey tabled before the Parliament
today, the government said it was too early to comment on the
implications of the sanctions, both short and medium term, for the
Indian economy as some countries reacted negatively to its nuclear
tests.
</P>
<P>
It was imperative to implement the policy decisions necessary
to ensure macroeconomics stability and rapid and sustainable
economic growth of 7 to 8 percent, said the survey prepared by the
Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
India's overall economic growth rate has decelerated
significantly to 5 percent in 1997-98 from 7.5 percent in 1996-97
and its trade deficit widened by a whopping 6.6 billions U.S.
dollars despite a sharp decline in imports which grew at a rate of
5.8 percent in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The sharp slowdown in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and export
growth, which the survey attributed mainly to the sharp fall in
growth rate in agriculture and industry, were identified as two
central areas of concern besides slippages on the fiscal front
during 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
Concern about fiscal deficit and infrastructure problems
continue to rise with each passing year and higher growth is the
best antidote for removing mass poverty and unemployment and for
generating revenues needed to supply goods and other government
services.
</P>
<P>
The task of preserving macroeconomic stability was complicated
by the lack of fiscal flexibility, the survey said, adding that
the fiscal deficit had reached 6.1 percent of GDP as against
targeted 4.5 percent in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The deceleration in the rate of inflation from the beginning of
the year reflected moderate money supply growth, sluggish demand,
abundant agricultural supplies and high production in 1996-97 and
competitive price discipline in an increasingly open economy.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that the balance of payment situation in
1997-98 remained sound and the current account deficit was
expected to be about 1.5 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The survey admitted that the process of fiscal correction
received a serious setback during 1997-98 largely on account of a
shortfall in tax collections and disinvestments receipts.
</P>
<P>
There was a need to persevere in the process of prudent fiscal
management, it added.

future of Asia, according to the prime minister's assistant press
secretary Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir is scheduled to deliver a keynote address on

</P>
<P>
The Nikkei conference is held annually since 1995 and is aimed

</P>
<P>
The financial and economic crisis affecting the region as well
as the worrying state of the Japanese economy is expected to top
the agenda of both the IMF symposium and the Nikkei conference.
</P>
<P>
The regional economic crisis which broke out last July
following the attack on the Thai baht had a contagion effect on
other currencies and economies, especially that of Thailand,
Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir is scheduled to return on June 5.

<P>
In the past two years, the annual expressway construction
surpassed 1,000 km in China.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are also considering new plans for expressway
construction. Liaoning, Shanxi and Hebei provinces and the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region have committed several billion yuan to
expressway construction this year.

<HEADLINE> Israel Ready to Deploy Arrow-2 Missile System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Defense Ministry has
approved a missile defense plan for the next decade, paving the
way for the deployment of the Arrow-2 anti-ballistic missile
system, the Jerusalem Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai Wednesday convened top
Israeli military commanders and defense officials for a meeting
and approved a multi-year defense plan to develop and produce the
Homa (Wall) anti-missile system, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Homa program launched in the 1980s mainly includes the two
Arrow-2 anti-missile batteries with their Green Pine
missile-tracking radar and Citron Tree fire-control system.
</P>
<P>
The program, which was estimated to cost about 1.6 billion
U.S. dollars, is largely financed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Air Force Commander Maj.-Gen. Eitan Ben-Eliahu said in
the meeting that the air force was preparing to deploy the first
Arrow-2 battery and scheduled to finish the deployment of the
second battery by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
And the Arrow-2 missile's Green Pine radar has been put into
operation, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has promised to fund Israel's research and development
of the third Arrow battery.

<HEADLINE> Water Level Declines in New Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Compounding the unbearable heat
and frequent cut of power supply, the Indian capital of New Delhi
is facing a severe shortage of water.
</P>
<P>
Water has already become precious in many parts of the city,
and the Statesman newspaper reported Thursday that it will become
one of the rarest commodities in a couple of years as all the
underground sources of water are drying up at an alarming pace.
</P>
<P>
The Underground water level in the capital is going down at an
average of 0.4 meters every year, according to a recent study
conducted by the hydrologists at the Nuclear Research Laboratory
(NRL) of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
In the southern part of New Delhi, the underground water level
has plummeted from 15 meters below the ground in 1979 to 20 meters
in 1984 and 29 meters in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the northern part, the underground water level has fallen
appreciably from three meters in 1984 to 10 meters in 1989 and 25
meters in 1994, said the study.
</P>
<P>
This would severely affect the life of the inhabitants because
more than 70 percent of the population of around 10 million in the
capital are dependent on the underground sources of water.
</P>
<P>
NRL principal scientist Dr. P. S. Dutta, leader of the
research, attributed the phenomenon to the rapid urbanization.
</P>
<P>
There is hardly any open space left for rain water, the only
source of underground water, to percolate below the soil due to
concrete construction in every part of the city. And in most parts
of the city, only 5 percent of rain water actually permeates below
the ground, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The problem has been further aggravated by the improper
drainage system which makes the rain water impossible to be
stored.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that the only solution before the authorities
and citizens to the water problem at the moment is to make prudent
use of this priceless natural resource.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Minister Unseated for Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Minister of Labor
and Youth Development, Sebastian Kinyondo, has lost his
parliamentary seat after he was charged with corruption and use
of abusive language against others in his 1995 election
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The High Court Wednesday unseated Kinyondo as the parliament
member for Bukoba Rural constituency by the Lake Victoria, by
declaring his 1995 parliamentary election results null and void,
Dar es Salaam newspapers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The nullification means that Kinyondo automatically loses his
ministerial post.
</P>
<P>
The Registrar of the High Court in Bukoba, Daniel Safari, said
that the court was convinced that Kinyondo, a member of the
ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), had used defamatory
language during his campaigns against Medard Mutungi who
contested for the seat as a CHADEMA candidate.
</P>
<P>
The High Court found Kinyondo "guilty" by claiming that
Mutungi sodomized his schoolmates while studying at the Ihungo
Secondary School.
</P>
<P>
Kinyondo was also charged with bribing women groups with
clothes and offering wine and various drinks to other voters
during the 1995 campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Mutungi has also claimed that Kinyondo and his agents bribed
the returning officer with alcohol and managed to open ballot
boxes at will and inserted votes in favor of Kinyondo.
</P>
<P>
In his 120-page ruling, Judge Kahwa Rugakingira ordered
Kinyondo to pay all costs of the petition which was filed by
Mutungi asking the court to nullify the election results. Under
the ruling, Kinyondo is barred from contesting parliamentary seat
for the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Kinyondo, absent from the court, is reportedly on a trip in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
In the 1995 election results, Kinyondo scooped 42,169 votes, while
Mutungi won 10,116 votes.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong 12-day-old Baby Makes Medical History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A 12-day-old Hong Kong baby has
made medical history to become the world's youngest patient to
take a ground-breaking keyhole surgery in his large intestine.
</P>
<P>
The boy was suffering from total colonic aganglionosis, an
illness that can cause fatal bowel obstruction for lack of nerve
cells in the large intestine. He was diagnosed two days after
birth.
</P>
<P>
The 2.7 kg infant has successfully undergone a laparoscopic, or
 keyhole surgery, in which surgeons inserted a thin tube with a
light and camera into the body. The affected section of the large
intestine was cut and removed during the three-hour operation
which took place on May 5 at Prince of Wales Hospital attached to
the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in the world that a laparoscopic surgery
was conducted in so young a baby in a single operation. In the
past, only older patients take such operations, which had to be
completed in three separate stages.
</P>
<P>
About one in 5,000 children suffers from the colonic
aganglionosis in Hong Kong.

harmful drugs. Our action has been very stringent," he added.
</P>

Nearly 90 percent of drugs in Uganda are imported, he noted,
and the NDA's provisional registry has 3,000 drugs for human
beings and more than 300 drugs for animals.
</P>
<P>
To end the country's heavy dependence on foreign drugs, the
authority has spent about 240,000 Dollars to purchase modern

<HEADLINE> 1997: A Boom Year for Philanthropy in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Americans gave more than 140
billion U.S. dollar to charities in 1997, up 7.5 percent from
1996, according to a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of donation by the American people for
philanthropy rose to 143.45 billion dollar thanks to a robust
economy, said the report by the American Association of
Fund-Raising Counsel's Trust for Philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
"This was one of the best years in at least a decade," said Ann
Kaplan, the group's research director. "The last two years have
just been very, very good years."
</P>
<P>
The 1997 rise followed a similar increase in 1996. There was
little or no growth in charitable giving in the early 1990s,
largely as a result of the economic recession.
</P>
<P>
Religious organizations maintained their position at the top of
the charity heap, receiving 74.79 billion dollar, or 6.1 percent
more than 1996.
</P>
<P>
Educational organizations received the second-biggest piece of
the charity pie, netting 21.51 billion dollar, an increase of 12.3
percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Health organizations took the third place, receiving 14.03
billion dollar, up one percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
One area where donations were down was to arts and cultural
organizations, which received 10.62 billion dollar, a decline of
2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The statistics in the report are based on deductible
contributions listed on tax returns and surveys of givers.

<HEADLINE> Books Mark 20th Anniversary of Reform, Opening-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 80 kinds of books will be
published later this year to mark the 20th anniversary of the
reform and opening-up which was initiated in 1978.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Press and Publications
Administration said that the topics of these books vary from local
practices to background and the process of the reform and
opening-up in China.
</P>
<P>
The books will include one about a foreigner's views on China's
reform and opening-up, one on China's rural reform and the whole
reform and opening-up process, and a reference book on big events
that happened in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting, Yang Muzhi, vice director of the State
Press and Publications Administration, asked all the relevant
publication houses not to seek only their own economic returns
when publishing these books.
</P>
<P>
"Quality of publication should be put in first place," he said.
</P>
<P>
The reform and opening-up policy was initiated in 1978 at the
Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China. Since then, great changes have taken
place in China and significant progress in all aspects have been
made.
</P>
<P>
China will hold a series of activities, such as picture
exhibitions and seminars, to mark the 20th anniversary of the
reform and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
Today's People's Daily (overseas edition) published the first
part of achievements made by China's provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions during the past 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition Leaders Attacked, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Investigations conducted by human
rights watch into last year's shooting in Kabwe, Zambia, have
revealed that former President Kenneth Kaunda and another
opposition leader were shot at.
</P>
<P>
At an opposition gathering held in Kabwe, 150 kilometers north
of Lusaka, Kanuda, leader of the country's largest opposition
United National Independence Party (UNIP), and Rodger Chongwe who
heads Liberal Progressive Front were allegedly shot at by police,
the country's leading independent newspaper, The Post, reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda's forehead was reportedly scratched while Chongwe was
seriously injured in the shooting. But the Zambian government has
denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a Human Rights Watch report for May 1998 as
saying that the bullet hole in Kaunda's vehicle, a bullet
catridge found at the scene of the incident and the bullet
reportedly taken from the car show that the vehicle was hit.
</P>
<P>
If the shrapnel had hit him a couple of inches to the left,
Kaunda would have been dead, according to the report which came
after a detailed ballistic analysis of the Kabwe incident
conducted with the help of Richard Shepherd of the forensic
medical unit at St. George's Hospital school in London.
</P>
<P>
The Human Rights Watchdog urged the Zambian government to
support an independent inquiry into the shooting and publish the
results and make those responsible for human rights abuses
accountable.

<HEADLINE> IMF Loan Disbursement to Indonesia Not Decided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- An official of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) said here Thursday that he will soon report on
the latest situation in Indonesia to enable the fund to decide
when to release the one-billion-U.S.-dollar loan as part of its
rescue package for the country.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the IMF loan would be disbursed as soon as possible.
But I have not reached the final stage of my assessment," IMF
director for Asia Pacific, Hubert Neiss told the press after
meeting with President B. J. Habibie here.
</P>
<P>
Neiss said that since he just arrived last Wednesday, he was
still holding meetings with both Indonesian government officials
and public figures.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on Indonesia's economic situation, Neiss said
Indonesia's macroeconomy is weaker than in the past few months,
thus needing many recovery efforts, particularly in the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
He said the IMF is ready to cooperate with the new government's
economic team, especially in implementing the IMF-recommended
economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
He added that during their one-hour meeting, Habibie explained
to him the government's plans to strengthen the economy, mainly by
putting pressure on the inflation rate and boosting economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, the IMF expressed its readiness to extend
funds worth 10 billion U.S. dollars to help revive the ailing
Indonesian economy.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank also promised to pitch in 4.5 billion dollars,
the Asian Development Bank 3.5 billion dollars, and the Indonesian
government itself 5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some countries have also expressed their commitment to
extending a total assistance of 20 billion dollars, under both the
framework of the IMF and bilateral terms.
</P>
<P>
The IMF released the first tranche of loan amounting to 3
billion dollars in November last year. It promised to extend the
next 3 billion dollars in the three months from May to July.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Three people were feared drowned
after Nairobi River burst its banks following a heavy downpour in
the Kenyan capital Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said they died after being swept away by the
torrents while they were trying to cross the swelling river at a
bridge.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Thursday quoted police as saying
that the Nairobi River also swept away two matatus (mini-buses)
full of passengers, adding that the fate of the passengers still
unknown.
</P>
<P>
The city was paralyzed for hours in the reportedly historic
downpour which began at 5:30 p.m. local time at the height of the
evening rush hour and continued unabated until 10:30 p.m..
</P>
<P>
At least five cars were reported swept away and hundreds of
houses submerged in different parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
Even President Daniel arap Moi was caught up in the traffic
jam Wednesday evening. He surprised staff and guests at the New
Stanley Hotel in downtown when he popped in and took shelter.
</P>
<P>
The downpour, which was accompanied by thunderstorm, threw
evening traffic into chaos and left many commuters stranded and
drenched with rain at many bus stops. Hundreds of workers walked
home after a futile wait for vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Bars and restaurants experienced an upsurge in business as
hundreds of residents poured in, waiting for traffic to clear.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, a hailstorm hit the city, causing a lot of
damage.

</P>
<P>
The "People's Daily" carried a lengthy article expounding the
causes for the large-scale layoffs at state-owned enterprises and
suggested that the idea of trying to eliminate total unemployment
should be abandoned and the whole society needs to take care of
the re-employment project; get a correct idea of employment;
enlarge employment channels; and improve related policies.
</P>
<P>
The existence of the large number of surplus workers in
state-owned enterprises is the basic cause for the phenomenon,
the article emphasized, adding that under the structure of a
planning economy, employment comes by administrative arrangement,
which is similar to a welfare system.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening reform of state-owned enterprises, the
number of workers to be laid off from the surplus work force must
increase by a large margin, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Under the investment structure of a planned economy,
overlapping constructions have wasted limited resources. With the
rapid adjustment of the industrial structure, some enterprises
must be merged or eliminated through competition, which will
result in a large number of laid-off workers.

<TEXT>
<P>
The idea of "eliminating unemployment in a socialist society"
is an employment idea for an agricultural society, which must be
changed in a modern industrial society, the article stated, adding
that people's viewpoint of employment must be adjusted to cope
with the deepening reform of the economic structure and the social
security systems.
</P>
<P>
The society should develop the service sector and private
industry to enlarge employment channels. The service sector, which
can provide far more employment opportunities than other
industries, constitutes only 24 percent of China's job market
compared to 70 percent of that in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The country's private sector also contributed most, among all
economic sectors, to providing new job opportunities from 1992 to
1996, and the sector also has the broadest prospects for
development, for it only constituted 13 percent of the urban job
market in 1996, compared with 20 percent in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Family enterprises, urban greenery industry and township
enterprises, which are relatively new industries in China, will
also offer more job opportunities for the society. Besides these
sectors, the adoption of a flexible employment system will be
another plus.
</P>
<P>
A complete set of policies will be worked out to support the
development of the service sector and the private economy, and
preferential policies will also be formulated for workers who
transfer from state-owned enterprises to private or collectively
owned enterprises.

<P>
MANILA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) and the United States have agreed to cooperate
more extensively in their common war against illegal drug
production, trafficking and abuse.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency reported Thursday that at the just
concluded ASEAN-U.S. dialogue in Manila, delegates from the two
sides agreed to mobilize their respective agencies in pooled
efforts to more effectively control narcotics trade and abuse.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, a U.S. official said the U.S. is committed
to contributing its share in reducing the illegal drugs traffic
and their abuse in southeast Asia, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia is a confirmed production base of illegal drugs
and where drug abuse is also widespread while the U.S. provides a
huge market for the commodity.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN delegates said a joint ASEAN-U.S. initiative to control
both supply and demand of the illegal commodity is a more
effective strategy.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has been known as a major transshipment point
of the world's illegal drug traffic, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Children Building School From Cola Tins, Toothpaste Tubes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The idea of collecting cola tins
and toothpaste tubes to build a school sounds unimaginable, but
millions of Chinese children have achieved it following six months
of efforts.
</P>
<P>
China's first environmental elementary school in the suburbs of
Nanchang, capital of east China's Jiangxi Province, was
established today through the collection and sale of penny-worth
wastes.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Children's News, a newspaper influential among
schoolchildren, called on children nationwide at the end of 1996
to raise money through waste collection to build an elementary
school for poor children in Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
By July of 1997, the newspaper office had received more than
243,000 yuan from children across the country, including Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"More than 2,000 pupils at our school collected over 85,000
pieces of wastes, packing nine trucks, and selling for some 8,000
yuan (1,000 US dollars)," said Yu Miao, a sixth-grade student at
Yucai Elementary School in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province.
</P>
<P>
"We want to do something for the cleaning of the earth and also
for our poor pals in Jiangxi," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Taohua Village in Nanchang's northern suburb had a school,
which was only a row of worn-out single-story house, before a new
one was built.
</P>
<P>
Local pupils said: "We could see stars from the classroom, and
would freeze when winter came."
</P>
<P>
The newly built four-story school undoubtedly has brought hope
to local children. Relevant government departments have decided to
designate the school as the country's first environmental
education base for children.

which was built from cola tins and toothpaste tubes, is a great
gift from Chinese children both to the upcoming International
Children's Day on June 1 and the World Environmental Day on June
5."
</P>
<P>
She added that the move has enabled children to see that they
can do great things through unity, and fostered their
environmental awareness of "turning the useless into the useful."
</P>
<P>
"Children are a force that should not be neglected in
implementing the basic state policy of environmental protection,"
Lu said.
</P>
<P>
China has opened environmental classes in elementary and middle
schools, and tried to foster children's ability to probe and
understand environmental problems as well as searching for ways to
solve them in education, she said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, many student environmental organizations like the
"earth village" have been set up in schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration and the
National Working Committee of the Young Pioneers have decided to
establish 2,000 "Hand-in-hand Earth Villages" across the country
within two years. These student organizations will conduct regular
environmental activities.

<HEADLINE> China Succeeds in Making Pomegranate Wine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A small business in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has added a new variety
-- pomegranate wine -- to the wine family in the country.
</P>
<P>
After two years of research, the China Hotan Rose Wine Industry
Co., Ltd., in Hotan Prefecture of southern Xinjiang, began brewing
the new wine early this year, which made its debut recently and
met immediate market recognition, said the company's general
manager Wang Jianjun.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture produces nearly 3,000 tons of pomegranates
annually, sufficient for 1,000 tons of pomegranate wine. Wang
predicted a peak time for pomegranate wine production within two
years as local farmers are expanding their pomegranate growing
acreage.
</P>
<P>
The wine sells well in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, at a
price of 200-to-400 yuan per bottle, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has a 2,000-year history of pomegranate plantation,
and the fruit contains twice the amount of vitamins found in
apples and pears. Also, it is rich in such trace elements as
phosphorus, calcium and iron, said Yang Chengshi, a research
fellow with the regional Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Pomegranates have long been used in Uygur medicine for the
treatment of stomach diseases, hypertension and coronary heart
disease.

<HEADLINE> Henan Province to Make Tourism Priority for Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Henan Province in central China
has put forward the idea of making tourism a priority for
development and writing it into the provincial plan for its
economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
A new committee on tourism development and administration, with
a senior provincial official taking charge, will be set up to
intensify tourism construction and development, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
The local governments at various levels will be urged to
include investment for tourism into their annual budgets and to
earmark special funds for tourism in tandem with the original 12
million yuan of special financial allocation set aside by the
provincial government.
</P>
<P>
The province has also encouraged the state, collective and
individual, as well as overseas investors, to explore local
tourism resources in its various forms.
</P>
<P>
In the near future Henan, commonly considered the "birthplace
of the Chinese nation and culture," will concentrate its efforts
on constructing four major tourist routes which feature ancient
cultures along the Yellow River, pilgrimages, martial arts and
specialized research.
</P>
<P>
Li Chenyu, executive deputy governor, emphasized that the main
task of tourism in the future will be to improve existing tourist
sites and related services instead of building more new tourist
sites.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the province would redouble efforts to expand
the international tourism market. While continuing to keep and
develop its tourism market in Japan, Southeast Asia, and Hong
Kong, Macao and Taiwan, the province will vigorously expand
tourism markets in the Republic of Korea (ROK), Europe, America
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province attracted 46.264 million tourists,
including 264,000 overseas visitors, and earned about 27.78
billion yuan from tourism industry.

<P>
TAIYUAN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- One hundred volunteers in north
China's Shanxi Province will solicit donations for "Project Hope,"
a nationwide educational program to help school dropouts return
to school.
</P>
<P>
The donations will be used to help school dropouts in Shanxi's
15 poverty-stricken counties receive education and hold
training programs for their teachers.
</P>
<P>
The province initiated the Project Hope in 1990. To date, it has
received more than 40 million yuan in donations from all walks of
life. The funds have helped 44,000 dropouts return to school, set
up 260 primary schools, established 248 libraries for pupils, and
bought 400,000 study aids.
</P>
<P>
The current donation management system is complicated for
people who are willing to donate to the project, a local education
official said.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers with certificates of special training will
provide a convenient way for people to donate in their place of
work or at home.

<HEADLINE> Australia Develops Weevil-Resistant Peas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia has produced
genetically-modified peas almost 100 percent resistant to weevils,
the most damaging pest of the nation's pea crop.
</P>
<P>
Dr. T. J. Higgins with the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), a leading research body
in Australia, made the announcement at a science briefing on gene
technology in Canberra Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, growers spend up to 16 million Australian dollars
(about 10 million U.S. dollars) a year on chemical insecticides to
control the pea weevils," said Higgins.
</P>
<P>
"In our field trials, we've shown that the genetically-modified
peas are 99.5 percent resistant to weevil attack, no insecticide
required," he said.
</P>
<P>
Higgins said his research team introduced into the peas a gene
found in the common kidney bean which has a natural resistance to
those seed-eating weevils.
</P>
<P>
"This gene produces a protein that blocks the normal digestion
of seed contents by weevil larvae, so they don't grow and develop
into adults."
</P>
<P>
"Weevils can reduce yields by 25 to 30 percent," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tests in four of Australia's six states show the
genetically-modified peas are identical to conventional peas in
every way except in their susceptibility to insect attack, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The researchers will attempt to apply the same method to other
important food legumes such as chickpeas and cowpeas.
</P>
<P>
Weevils are particularly severe in Asia, Africa and South
America, Higgins said.

XINING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Golmud City on the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau is fighting to avoid being engulfed by desertification.
</P>
<P>
The 146-million-yuan (17.59 million U.S. dollars)
anti-desertification project is designed to plant 7,272.2 hectares
of vegetation, and establish standardized plant nurseries,
botanical gardens of cold-resistant plants, wind-break tree belts,
and a huge water conservation project in eight years.
</P>
<P>
Due to influence of geographic and weather conditions, Golmud
is susceptible to wind erosion. The situation has been made worse
with the process of industrialization and random tree felling.
</P>
<P>
According to incomplete statistics, 1.33 million hectares of
vegetation in the city has been destroyed in the past decades,
leaving more than 3.8 million hectares of desert for the city.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wheat Output Predicted to Jump Markedly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Australian wheat farmers will see
their best crop production season in a decade with predictions of
a 22-percent increase to 16 million tons in production this year
because of weather pattern changes, Australian experts said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Australian climatologist Roger Stone said the sudden rise in
the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), which measures water
temperatures in the Coral Sea to the northeast of Australia
indicated the El Nino dry weather influence was decaying.
</P>
<P>
"This year is shaping up to be one of the best for Australian
wheat farmers and other grain and cotton growers since the 1980s
with improving chances of good rainfall over much of the
continent," Stone told a climate workshop for agricultural
officials and rural representatives in Brisbane, capital of
Australia's Queensland state.
</P>
<P>
Holger Meinke, a crop output analyst, said Australia could
produce an extra 3 million tons of wheat worth 260 million U.S.
dollars this season.
</P>
<P>
Australia's wheat crop totals 16 million tons in a "fair"
season, the Australian Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
"Based on rainfall probabilities, growers can manage for a
record crop, an opportunity that does not occur often," Meinke
said.
</P>
<P>
Stone, senior climatologist at Queensland's Center for Climate
Applications, said a further boost for wheat farmers were
indications of adverse growing conditions among Australia's major
competitors including the United States, Argentina and Central
America.

<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The administrative office of the
Summer Palace, in Beijing's western outskirts, has fenced up the
Marble Boat and closed it to visitors to prevent further damage.
</P>
<P>
The 36-meter-long Marble Boat beside Kunming Lake in the
western portion of the Summer Palace, was first built in 1755. It
survived a fire in 1860 and was rebuilt in 1893.
</P>
<P>
The Marble Boat attracts thousands of visitors every
year. However, its wooden pavilion in western architectural style
suffers serious erosion from wind and rain, and the carvings on
the boat suffer from wear and tear by visitors.
</P>
<P>
The administrative office announced plans to repair the boat
next year.
</P>
<P>
The Summer Palace, close to the Western Hills, was built by the
Dowager Empress of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) to celebrate her
60th birthday with funds collected to build a navy.
</P>
<P>
The park itself covers 823 acres with more than 100 buildings

<HEADLINE> U.S. Phone Company to Offer High-Speed Internet Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Pacific Bell, a subsidiary
local telephone company of SBC Communications, announced Wednesday
that it plans to offer high-speed Internet service this summer.
</P>
<P>
The service, to be available to more than a third of its
customers across California, will use existing phone lines and
move data at up to 30 times faster than today's computer modems.
</P>
<P>
Behind the new service is a new technology known as asymmetric
digital subscriber line, or ADSL, which is designed primarily for
Internet and telecommuting, namely home office, applications.
</P>
<P>
Packaged with Internet service, ADSL provides on-line consumers
and small businesses with accelerated access to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
In addition, as a stand-alone connection, ADSL allows
telecommuting employees and after-hours home workers to connect
their employers' corporate networks via dedicated, secure links.
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell had been moving cautiously to deploy the new
technology in its service area covering over 13.4 million business
and residential customers.
</P>
<P>
After a year-long test and a lengthy market trial, it plans to
charge home users 89 U.S. dollars per month and businesses up to
339 dollars per month for the service, including Internet access.
</P>
<P>
The company already offers the high-speed service in parts of
the San Francisco Bay Area, with monthly prices ranging from about
160 dollars to 400 dollars.
</P>
<P>
To be eligible for the new service, users must be within about
5 kilometers of one of its offices in 63 cities. The deployment
will start expanding in June, company officials said, and should
be finished by late August or September.
</P>
<P>
To use ADSL technology, a new modem would be required, and the
phone company would need to install new equipment. Once installed,
ADSL is always on and consumers would never need to dial their
Internet service provider again. Also, people can talk on the
phone and surf the Web at the same time on the same line.

<HEADLINE> China's Export of Labor Services Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- After two decades of development,
China's export of labor services has continuously improved in the
past few years with the implementation of a quality strategy,
according to an official with China's Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
More and more specialists such as engineers, doctors, nurses
and certified accountants as well as high-tech and business
management personnel in aircraft maintenance, computer software
development and applications, project designing, consulting and
management are working abroad, said Cui Mingmo, deputy director
of the Department of Foreign Economic Cooperation of
MOFTEC.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the number of laborers involved in such
services abroad reached 1.54 million.
</P>
<P>
When China started such services at the end of the '70s after
it initiating a reform and opening-up policy, its export of labor
services only involved ordinary workers and technicians, Cui said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has established and applied a training
system for contract workers sent abroad, which would enable them
to learn about the country, local laws and customs.
</P>
<P>
The trained workers were well received by both domestic and
overseas companies, and such a system has laid a solid foundation
for an expected further improvement of such workers and businesses
in China, Cui said.
</P>
<P>
The labor services for overseas projects have also helped some
state-owned large- and medium-size enterprises deal with their
redundant workers and expand their businesses, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some laborers coming from poor areas have earned some money
through working abroad, and some of them even brought information
back to their hometowns for cooperation with overseas partners,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted a provincial governor as saying that a worker going
abroad can help a whole family be better-off, thus contributing to
the social stability of a locality.
</P>
<P>
He said China will continue to improve the selection,
training and management of such laborers, and MOFTEC will continue
to join diplomatic, public security and industrial and commercial
administrative departments in cracking down on fraudulent
activities in the name of labor services export.

<HEADLINE> China Issues White Paper on Marine Development (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's ocean fishing industry has a long history steeped in
experience. In developing this sector, the country adheres to the
principle of "speeding up the development of aquaculture,
conserving and rationally utilizing offshore resources, actively
expanding deep-sea fishing, emphasizing processing and
circulation, and strengthening legal administration." Since the
mid-1980s, China's saltwater aquaculture has developed rapidly,
with a large increase in species and expansion of breeding
areas. The output of such products rose from 1.926 million tons in
1987 to 7.91 million tons in 1997, with their proportion in the
total output of the maritime harvest rising from 27 percent to 36
percent. In accordance with the actual conditions of marine
fisheries resources, China has actively readjusted the structure
of this sector, made efforts to conserve and rationally utilize
off-shore fisheries resources, and actively exploited new
resources and fishing grounds, so as to make the fishing industry
constantly adapt to the changes in the structure of marine
resources. In 1997 the total output of China's ocean fishing
industry came to 13.854 million tons. While expanding deep-sea
fishing and international fishing cooperation, China adheres
strictly to relevant international maritime laws, pays full
attention to protecting the eco-environment and, in the light of
the principle of "equality, mutual benefit, rational development
of the exploitable resources, and abstention from infringement on
the interests of other countries," actively develops fishing
cooperation with relevant countries and regions, in order to
jointly expand the fishing economy. Since the 1980s, China has
established cooperative fishing relations with more than 30
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to the protection of marine
fisheries resources, and has adopted various measures to conserve
such resources so as to guarantee the implementation of a
sustainable marine development strategy. It has done this by
instituting various closed fishing seasons, closed fishing areas,
marine sanctuaries and moratorium systems, banning harmful fishing
gear and methods, and restricting the size of net meshes and the
proportion of young fish. In 1979 China began to adopt a fishing
permit system to curb reckless fishing, and in 1987 the country
began to control fishing boats' horsepower. Since 1995 China has
practiced a new midsummer moratorium system -- every year during
July and August fishing is banned in the sea areas north of 27
degrees north latitude. The new system has achieved encouraging
economic, ecological and social results, and from this year the
midsummer moratorium area will be expanded to 26 degrees north
latitude and its duration will be lengthened to three
months. China attaches great importance to the marine reproduction
and the reproduction of fisheries resources, and has always
insisted on the marine reproduction and releasing of prawns and
other species, a measure which has achieved positive
results.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Warns of War With Eritrea on Border Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) has warned that it would
use force to eject Eritrean troops accused of invading its border
territory.
</P>
<P>
"Eritrea's rejection of Ethiopia's demand for unconditional
withdrawal of its troops...leaves Ethiopia with no alternative
but to use force," EPRDF was quoted by reports reaching here
Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia has repeatedly made it clear that it will not
negotiate with Eritrea while its troops occupy part of its
territory," it said in a statement issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi also warned
of a full-scale conflict with Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is Ethiopia's priority, but it will be obliged to
defend the nation's sovereignty if peace efforts end in a
deadlock," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Eritrean government accused Ethiopia of
resorting to measures to ensure its economic isolation in the
border conflict between the two Horn of Africa nations.
</P>
<P>
The latest conflict was sparked when Eritrea sent troops
earlier this month into Tigray, a region Ethiopia considers part
of its northwest territory.
</P>
<P>
In the first public acknowledgement of the border dispute,
Ethiopia on May 13 threatened Eritrea that it would take "all
necessary measures" if Eritrea did not withdraw from contested
territory it had occupied.
</P>
<P>
The Eritreans proposed a five-point framework for negotiating
a settlement, accusing Ethiopians of frequent incursions into
Tigray over the last year,.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea, which borders the Red Sea and lies between Ethiopia
and Sudan, achieved independence only in 1993 after a 30-year
secessionist war against Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Thus leaves Ethiopia landlocked, losing the Red Sea ports of
Massawa and Assab. Ethiopia now uses the port of Djibouti on the
Gulf of Aden.
</P>
<P>
Currently Eritrea is heavily outgunned by Ethiopia. The
International Institute for Strategic Studies says Eritrea has an
estimated 46,000-strong active army while Ethiopia's forces
number around 120,000.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Crashes Out of French Open in Big Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- World number one American Pete
Sampras had his Grand Slam sweeping dream all but evaporated as he
crashed out of the French Open here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ten-time Grand Slam winner slumped 7-6, 6-3, 6-4 in
straight sets to little-known Paraguayan Ramon Delgado in a second
round match of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who was the 1996 semifinalist here, could blame his
defeat on the bad weather as the rain fell when he led 4-1 in the
first set.
</P>
<P>
When he returned, the American looked lacking morale, while his
98th-ranked opponent played consistently from the baseline.
</P>
<P>
A passing shot gave the tiebreaker to Delgado, who soon set up
a 3-0 lead in the second set and a 2-0 in the third to hold onto
his upset win.
</P>
<P>
Sampras joined compatriot Andre Agassi and second seed Petr
Korda of the Czech Republic as the early casualties of the event.
</P>
<P>
Agassi fell to Russian sensation Maret Safin on Tuesday and
Korda bowed out to Argentina's Mariano Zabaleta.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Marcelo Rios of Chile stands a real chance of
replacing Sampras again as the world number one.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean showed his domination as he routed Spaniard Emilio
Alvarez 6-4, 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Rios, who became the first ever South American to top the world
rankings last month, meets South African Wayne Ferreira in the
third round.
</P>
<P>
In the women's tournament, Monica Seles saved a first-set loss
to beat South African Marion Maruska 2-6, 6-1, 6-0 in a
second-round tie.
</P>
<P>
World number one Swiss Martina Hingis cruised past German Meike
Babel 6-1, 6-2 in less than one hour, keeping her eyes on the
first title here, while Venus Williams gave more impressive
performance as the eighth-seeded American overwhelmed Japanese Ai
Sugiyama 6-0, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The two teenager sensations had a potential quarter-final
clash.

because it was created and fostered by Chairman Kim Il Sung and
Chairman Mao Zedong, and other leaders of the old generation of
the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Ji said he believed the bilateral friendship would be
strengthened under the concern of current leaders of the two
nations.

<HEADLINE> China Issues White Paper on Marine Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) - The Information Office of the State
Council today issued a white paper on the development of China's
marine programs. The full text of the white paper is as follows:

The Development of China's Marine Programs

Foreword
</P>
<P>
The ocean, which covers 71 percent of the earth's surface, is a
basic component of the global bio-support system. It is also a
treasure house of resources and an important regulator of the
environment. It is inevitable that the development of human
society will come to depend more and more on the ocean.
</P>
<P>
In the coming 21st century mankind will have new opportunities
to develop and utilize the ocean. Upholding the principles of the
 international marine law as defined by the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea, maintaining the wholesomeness of
the oceans, protecting the marine environment and guaranteeing the
sustainable utilization of marine resources and maritime safety
have become common norms for all the people in the world to abide
by, and a collective mission for all mankind to undertake.
</P>
<P>
As a major developing country with a long coastline, China
attaches great importance to marine development and protection,
and takes it as the state's development strategy. It is
constantly strengthening comprehensive marine management,
steadily improving its marine-related laws, and actively
developing science, technology and education pertaining to the
oceans. China has made positive contributions to international
ocean development and protection by participating positively in
UN marine affairs, promoting cooperation between countries and
regions and conscientiously carrying out its obligations in this
field.
</P>
<P>
The year 1998 has been designated by the United Nations as the
International Ocean Year, and on this occasion the Chinese
government would like to introduce the progress of China's work
in this particular field to the world.

I. Sustainable Marine Development Strategy
</P>
<P>
China has a population of more than 1.2 billion, and its land
natural resources per capita are lower than the world's
average. Official statistics show that China has a land area of
9.6 million sq km, making it the third-biggest country in the
world. However, the land area per capita is only 0.008 sq km,
much lower than the world's average of 0.3 sq km per capita. In
recent years China's average annual amount of freshwater
resources has been 2,800 billion cu m, ranking sixth in the world;
but the amount of freshwater resources per capita is only one
fourth of the world's average. China is rich in land mineral
resources, but the amount per capita is less than half the figure
per capita worldwide. As a major developing country with a long
coastline, China, therefore, must take exploitation and
protection of the ocean as a long-term strategic task before it
can achieve the sustainable development of its national economy.

China boasts a mainland coastline of more than 18,000 km. There
are more than 5,000 islands in China's territorial waters, each
with an area of more than 500 sq m, and the islands' coastlines
total more than 14,000 km. China also exercises sovereignty and
jurisdiction over the vast continental shelves and exclusive
economic zones (EEZs), as defined by the UN Convention on the Law
of the Sea. Located in medium and low latitudes, China's sea areas
have comparatively advantageous natural environmental and
resource conditions. Some 20,278 species of sea creatures have
been verified there. The fishing grounds that have been developed
in China's sea areas cover 818,000 square nautical miles. The
shallow seas and tidelands have a total area of 13.33 million ha,
of which 2.6 million ha of water surface are suitable for raising
aquatic products in terms of the current scientific level. So far,
938,000 ha are being utilized for this purpose. Scattered in
these offshore waters are more than 30 sedimentation basins, with
a total area of nearly 700,000 sq km. It is estimated that there
are about 25 billion tons of oil resources and 8.4 trillion cu m
of natural gas in these basins. More than 160 bays are spread
along China's coasts, plus the deep-water stretches of coast with
a total length of several hundred kilometers. Many spots along the
coastline are suitable for constructing harbors and developing
marine transportation. There are more than 1,500 tourist, scenic
and recreational spots favorable for developing marine tourism. In
addition, China's offshore areas abound in seawater resources and
regenerable marine energy resources.
</P>
<P>
The China Ocean Agenda 21 formulated by China in 1996 put
forward a sustainable development strategy for China's marine
programs. The basic ideas of this strategy are as follows: To
effectively safeguard the state's marine rights and interests,
rationally develop and utilize marine resources, give positive
protection to the marine eco-environment and realize the
sustainable utilization of marine resources and the marine
environment as well as the coordinated development of the work in
this field. In this regard China abides by the following basic
policies and principles:
</P>
<P>
-- Safeguarding the new international marine order and the
state's marine rights and interests. In February 1992 the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) of China adopted
the Law of the People's Republic of China on Its Territorial Seas
and Adjacent Zones. As China's important law in this particular
field, it provides a legal basis for the country to exercise
sovereignty over its territorial seas and jurisdiction over the
adjacent zones and safeguard the state's safety and marine rights
and interests.

<TEXT>
<P>
To uphold the new international marine legal system and the
state's marine rights and interests, the NPC Standing Committee
approved the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea in May 1996, and
solemnly stated: In accordance with the provisions of the UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea, the People's Republic of China
enjoys sovereignty and jurisdiction over the EEZs and continental
shelves up to 200 nautical miles off its coasts. Together with the
countries with opposite coasts or its neighboring countries, China
shall, through consultation and on the basis of international laws
and the principle of fairness, fix the dividing lines of each
country's marine jurisdiction. China has sovereignty over all
archipelagos and islands listed in the Law of the People's
Republic of China on Its Territorial Seas and Adjacent
Zones. Regarding disputes over marine issues between China and
its neighboring countries, the Chinese government shall, in view
of the vital interests bearing on peace and development, stand for
their settlement through friendly consultation. With regard to
issues that cannot be solved for the time being, China stands for
pigeonholing them and for strengthened cooperation and joint
development.
</P>
<P>
-- Overall planning for marine development and control. China
will strengthen the comprehensive development and administration
of its coastal zones, rationally develop and protect the offshore
areas, actively participate in the development and utilization of
international seabeds and oceans, and exploit the coastal land and
sea areas in a unified way in order to gradually form coastal
economic belts and marine economic zones, thus making the coastal
areas more prosperous and developed.
</P>
<P>
-- Rationally utilizing marine resources and promoting the
coordinated development of the marine industries. China adopts the
policy of placing equal stress on development and protection to

oceanic matters, and contribute its full share to the prosperity
and development of the world's work in this field.

II. Rational Development and Utilization of Marine Resources
</P>
<P>
In the light of the bearing capacity of marine resources, China
adopts a policy of developing and utilizing them in a
comprehensive way, so as to promote the coordinated development of
the marine industries. In recent years China has made constant
efforts to upgrade the maritime fishing, transportation,
salt-making and other traditional industries. At the same time, it
has spared no effort to develop the industry of marine
reproduction and mariculture, offshore oil and gas, tourism,
marine pharmaceuticals and other burgeoning industries. It has
actively explored new marine resources as far as possible, and
promoted the formation and development of some potential marine
industries, such as deep-water mining, comprehensive utilization
of seawater, and power generation with marine energy. In 1997 the
total output value of the major marine industries, including ocean
fishing, salt-making, the salt chemicals industry, marine
transportation, shipbuilding, offshore oil and gas, and tourism,
topped 300 billion yuan. As a result, these industries have become
forces actively promoting the development of China's economy as a
whole.

As far back as in the 1960s China began to explore and exploit
offshore oil and gas resources on its own. In the 1980s it started
to absorb foreign capital and technology to develop this industry
in cooperation with foreign companies. In exploiting offshore oil
and natural gas, China follows the policy of placing equal stress
on oil and gas, with the balance inclined slightly toward gas,
combining domestic exploration and exploitation with cooperation
with foreign companies, and integrating upstream and
downstream. As a result, great progress has been made. By the end
of 1997 China had signed 131 contracts and agreements with 67 oil
companies from 18 countries and regions and imported a total
capital of close to six billion US dollars for this industry. At
the same time, more than 100 structures with oil and gas had been
discovered, and 1.7 billion tons of oil reserves and 350 billion
cu m of natural gas had been found. Twenty oil and gas fields are
under development. With an offshore oil and natural gas industry
in place, in 1997 China's offshore oil output exceeded 16.29
million tons, and its natural gas output stood at four billion cu
m.
</P>
<P>
China has worked out a policy of utilizing its deep-sea waters
and coastal resources in a rational way. According to the policy,
priority shall be given to the construction of harbors in
deepwater coastal areas, and vigorous efforts will be made to
develop marine transportation. Significant achievements have been
attained in marine transportation development since the founding
of New China, especially since the implementation of reform and
opening to the outside world. By the end of 1997, merchant ships
had increased to 320,000 with a total deadweight tonnage of close
to 50 million, of which more than 23 million were of the fleets in
foreign trade transportation. Harbor construction and marine
transportation in China are based on the planning concept of
constructing major waterways, harbor hubs and water transport
support system. China will put special efforts into the
construction of specialized berths for bulk goods such as
containers, coal, oil, ore and grain, set up collection and
distribution channels in the rear, speed up the establishment of a
modern loading-unloading-hauling system, and construct a container
transport system with advanced freight-handling technologies and
featuring a combination of trunk lines with branch lines while
strengthening the technical transformation of old harbors to
improve their handling capacity and efficiency. At present, China
has 15 harbors each with an annual handling capacity of more than
10 million tons. In 1997 the volume of freight handled by the
country's major coastal harbors totaled 905 million tons. In
recent years China's coastal shipbuilding industry has shown a
trend of rapid development, and in 1997 China's shipbuilding
tonnage ranked third in the world.

China's marine tourism development policy features relying on
the coastal cities, stressing marine characteristics, and
developing it region by region and sector by sector. In recent
years, the coastal areas have created more than 300 marine and
island tourism and recreational zones, with a variety of marine
features. Marine tourism is now a burgeoning industry. In 1997
this sector received more than 10 million overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
China was one of the world's pioneers in making salt from
seawater. Some of China's new industries are associated with this
aspect of marine resources development and exploitation: salt,
salt chemicals, direct seawater utilization and seawater
desalination. With an area of 430,000 ha, China's salt pans
produced 29.281 million tons of raw salt in 1997. The major salt
chemical products are potassium chloride, bromide, anhydrous
nitre and magnesium chloride. The annual output of potassium
chloride and bromide each exceeds 500,000 tons. In addition,
Tianjin, Dalian, Qingdao, Yantai, Qinhuangdao and other coastal
cities are now making efforts to use more seawater directly as
industrial chilled water and non-potable water, which is of great
significance for alleviating China's serious shortage of
freshwater resources.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has listed the exploration and
exploitation of the mineral resources of the Pacific Ocean as a
long-term development project for which it intends to offer
special investment. Meanwhile, it has established a special
institution in charge of coordinating and administering China's
exploratory and exploitative activities in the international
seabed region. China is the fifth-largest investor in
international efforts for seabed development, and has obtained an
exclusive exploration and development area of 75,000 sq km. In the
future, China will continue to actively participate in the
administration and development of international seabed areas, and
develop new exploration and exploitation technologies to make its
due contribution to the peaceful utilization of international
seabed resources for the benefit of the whole of mankind.

III. The Protection and Preservation of the Marine Environment
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to the protection of the marine
environment. Organs and laws aimed at marine environmental
protection have been gradually established, and the people's
consciousness of the importance of protecting the marine
environment and abiding by the laws have been further
strengthened, both of which have speeded up the work of marine
environmental protection. As a result, the momentum of serious
marine pollution has been slowed; the environmental quality of
some of the country's sea areas has been improved; and most
offshore waters are of good quality, despite the drastic increase
in the amounts of pollutants brought about by the booming economy
of the coastal areas.

In 1982 the Marine Environmental Protection Law of the People's
Republic of China, a basic law of the country to protect the
marine environment, was approved by the NPC Standing Committee to
prevent damage to the marine environment resulting from coastal
construction projects, offshore oil exploration and exploitation,
navigation of ships, wastes dumping, and discharge of land-sourced
pollutants. Later, several concrete regulations were issued by the
Chinese government, such as the Regulations of the People's
Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Marine
Pollution Caused by Ships, Regulations of the People's Republic of
China on Environmental Protection and Control Pertaining to
Offshore Oil Exploration and Exploitation, Regulations of the
People's Republic of China on Control of the Marine Dumping of
Wastes, Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the
Prevention and Control of Environmental Pollution from
Shipbreaking, Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the
Prevention and Control of Pollution Damage to the Marine
Environment from Land-Sourced Pollutants, and Regulations of the
People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of
Pollution Damage to the Marine Environment from Coastal
Construction Projects. In addition, a dozen rules and standards
were enacted concerning marine environmental protection by
government departments. All of these laws, regulations and rules
have formed a legal framework for marine environmental
protection. Besides, programs and plans for marine environmental
protection, professional plans for the protection of wetlands and
biological diversity, an overall marine monitoring network and a
nearshore environmental monitoring network have also been put in
place by related state organizations.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, an administration system for marine
environmental protection has been gradually set up: State
environmental protection departments are in charge of marine
environmental protection for the whole country; state marine
administrations are responsible for the organization of survey,
monitoring and surveillance of the marine environment, the
conduct of scientific research and the prevention of pollution
damage to the marine environment resulting from offshore oil
exploration and exploitation and the dumping of wastes at sea;
state harbor administrations are responsible for the supervision,
investigation and disposal of pollutant discharge by ships, the
surveillance of harbor waters and the prevention of pollution
damage to the marine environment caused by vessels; state fishing
port administrations are responsible for the supervision of
pollutant discharge by fishing boats and the surveillance of
fishing grounds; environmental protection organs of the armed
forces are responsible for the supervision of pollutant discharge
by military vessels and surveillance of naval port waters; and
environmental protection organs of the local people's governments
in coastal areas are responsible for the environmental protection
work of preventing pollution damage resulting from coastal
construction projects and land-sourced pollutants. This
coordinated network plays an important role in the implementation
of the related laws and the efficient protection of the marine
environment.

China carries out the policy of putting prevention first and
combining prevention with control in managing existing marine
pollution. While endeavoring to make a success in the protection
of marine biological resources and the prevention and control of
marine pollution, China makes the prevention and control of
land-sourced pollution the focal point of its marine environmental
protection work. A series of regulations have been drawn up to
check land-sourced pollutant emission, and enhance the monitoring,
surveillance and control of the main pollutant-emission
outlets. Large and medium-sized cities have paid constant
attention to readjusting the distribution of industries, improving
technical transformation, and recovering waste gas, waste water
and industrial residue (the "three wastes") for multipurpose
use. Enterprises creating serious pollution are required to take
effective measures to control it within a definite period of time;
otherwise they have to close down, suspend operations, merge with
other plants, change their products or move to other
places. Besides, a number of sewage treatment plants have been
built to control new pollution sources and reduce the amount of
land-sourced pollutants dumped into the sea. To prevent marine
pollution resulting from ship and port discharge, in addition to
the formulation of the Crash Program to Combat Ships' Oil
Pollution, oil-water separators have been installed aboard ships
of all types in accordance with relevant stipulations, and
oil-polluted water treatment equipment, including emergency
treatment equipment, has been installed at all sea ports. This
equipment can help dispose of 3.7 million tons of oil-polluted
water from vessels and recover 42,000 tons of waste oil a
year. Similarly, to prevent marine environment pollution resulting
from offshore oil exploitation, besides the formulation by
offshore oilfields of the Crash Program to Combat Oil Spills
During Offshore Oil Exploration and Exploitation, oil-polluted
water treatment equipment has been installed on all drilling
platforms, engine-room oil-water separators have also been
installed aboard all drilling ships, and oil barriers, chemical
de-oiling agents and spill recovery ships provided in all China's
offshore oilfields.
</P>
<P>
As one of the contracting parties to the Convention on the
Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other
Matters signed in 1972 in London, China attaches great importance
to the fulfillment of the provisions under the convention and is
steadily improving its control of the dumping of wastes into the
sea. So far, China has designated 34 dumping areas for dredged
materials of the third category and four areas for midair oil
discharge. It has issued about 2,000 dumping permits and tightened
up the monitoring of the environmental quality of dumping
areas. Besides, it has strictly prohibited the disposal of any
radioactive substance and incineration of toxic waste at sea, and
plans to gradually stop the dumping of industrial waste into the
sea.

To protect the ecological environment of fishing grounds, the
Water Quality Standards of Fishing Grounds have been drawn up by
the Chinese government and the Regulations on the Supervision and
Control of the Environmental Sanitation of Shellfish-Raising Areas
and other regulations have been drawn up by departments
concerned. In addition, a sequence of measures have been taken to
further strengthen the eco-environmental protection of spawning
grounds of saltwater fish and shrimps, feeding grounds, wintering
grounds, migration channels and aquatic farms. A multilevel setup
for the protection of the fisheries environment has been
established by the state and coastal region authorities, including
15 monitoring stations at and above the provincial level around
the country and a number of marine life protected areas in major
fishing grounds. In 1995 the department concerned worked out the
Procedures for the Administration of Marine Reserves, based on the
guiding principle of " conservation first, appropriate
exploitation and sustainable development," and divided each marine
nature reserve into core, buffer and experimental zones, in order
to improve the building and management of the marine nature
reserves. At present 59 marine protected areas, covering gulfs,
islands, estuaries, coasts, coral reefs, mangrove swamps, coastal
lagoons, marine natural history sites, seaweed beds and wetlands,
have been built, covering a total area of 12,900 sq km.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the countries which are most vulnerable to
marine calamities. The economic losses suffered by the coastal
areas from storms, tidal waves, ice floes, seaquakes, coastal
erosion, typhoons, fog and red tides account for about 10 percent
of the total of all natural disasters afflicting China. After
making unremitting efforts for decades, China has installed a
basic marine environment and disaster observation network and
forecast-alarm system, covering both offshore areas and distant
waters, with the cooperation of several departments. This network
engages in analysis, forecast and grading of major marine
calamities, and runs maritime rescue centers and coastal emergency
stations. As a result, a marine disaster alleviation framework has
been put in place.
</P>
<P>
The rapid economic growth and steady population increase in the
coastal areas, coupled with the constant expansion of marine
exploitation, mean that China continues to face problems of marine
environmental protection and disaster alleviation. To cope with
this situation, China has adopted the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000) and Long-Term Program to the Year 2010 for National
Marine Environmental Protection, which further advances the three
major policies of "putting prevention first, combining prevention
with control," "making the causer of pollution responsible for
treating it" and "improving the control of the environment." The
following are the principal measures China will take to protect
the marine environment:

IV. The Development of Oceanographic Science, Technology and
Education
</P>
<P>
In recent years China has made further efforts to promote the
investigation and exploration of marine resources and the marine
environment, search actively for new exploitable resources, study
new techniques and methods of marine resources exploitation and
protection, train technical personnel in marine development and
protection, and spread oceanographic knowledge among the general
public in order to rouse the whole nation to protect the marine
environment.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of a multidisciplinary oceanographic research
setup, which consists of 109 research institutes and 13,000-some
research personnel, China has many achievements to its credit in
oceanographic survey and research, studies in basic oceanographic
science, development and protection of ocean resources, marine
monitoring technologies and manufacturing of oceanographic
technical equipment.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 a
large amount of work has been done in the field of oceanographic
surveys and research, which started in offshore areas with surface
observation of the sea and later expanded to deep-sea regions by
means of aerospace remote sensing and underwater detection, as
well as surface observation. As early as in the period 1958-1960 a
national comprehensive survey of China's offshore waters was made;
later, from 1980 to 1986, a comprehensive survey of coastal zones
and shoals resources was conducted nationwide, along with the
launching of a number of pilot projects on the comprehensive
development and utilization of coastal zones; and from 1988 to
1995 a general investigation of the country's island resources and
an experiment on their comprehensive development were carried out.
</P>
<P>
China signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1983 and began to make
surveys of the Antarctic and the surrounding sea areas in 1984. By
1997 the country had completed 14 programs of scientific
investigation in this region, using the Great Wall and Zhongshan
survey stations as bases. Thus, China has made positive
contributions to the world's peaceful exploitation of the
Antarctic. In 1996 China joined the International Scientific
Committee on North Pole Research, and has taken an active part in
international cooperation projects in the Arctic, such as "The
Role of the Polar Region in Global Change."
</P>
<P>
With more attention paid to the study of the inshore shelf
oceanography, China has established a multidisciplinary
oceanographic research system with regional characteristics. Under
the direction of the oceanographic development strategy and the
support programs and plans for the development of oceanography
drawn up by relevant state departments, marked progress has been
made in recent years in physical oceanography, biological
oceanography, marine geology and marine chemistry. These
achievements have provided scientific directions and references
for the promotion of offshore fishing and oil and gas
exploitation, protection of the marine environment, and reduction
and prevention of marine disasters.
</P>
<P>
China makes vigorous efforts for the development of
oceanographic technologies, building up an oceanographic
technology system focusing mainly on the marine environment,
exploration and exploitation of marine resources, and general
marine engineering, and covering more than 20 technological
fields. The country has now turned its attention to implementing a
marine high-tech program, a program for tackling key problems in
marine science and technology and one for marine development by
reliance on science and technology.

In its marine high-tech research China gives priority to
technologies covering marine monitoring, marine exploration and
resources exploitation, deep-sea exploration and marine
biology. The program for tackling key problems in marine science
and technology centers on fields directly related to modern marine
development, such as sustainable exploitation of the resources and
environment of coastal zones, desalinization of seawater,
exploitation of marine energy and comprehensive utilization of
seawater resources. In 1996 government departments concerned
jointly formulated the National Plan for Implementing the "Program
for Marine Development by Reliance on Science and Technology" in
the Ninth Five-Year Period (1996-2000) and to the Year 2010, which
focuses on research, development and dissemination of the
technologies of marine reproduction and mariculture, fine
processing of marine biological resources, exploration and
extraction of marine pharmaceuticals and exploitation of chemical
resources in seawater. Through implementation of this plan, China
hopes to foster marine technology enterprises, improve the
productivity of the marine industries, and make the technological
progress factor rise from 30 percent to 50 percent in the output
increase of the marine industries.
</P>
<P>
China has basically evolved an oceanographic education system
embracing professional education, vocational education and popular
knowledge education. Oceanography as an area of study is taught in
37 institutions of higher learning and 29 secondary specialized
schools in China, training large numbers of technical and
managerial personnel. The vocational schools, offering courses in
more than 20 oceanographic fields, have trained more than 8,000
people in the past three years. The mass media is frequently used
in China to inform young people about oceanographic topics and
educate the people living in coastal regions in the proper way to
exploit marine resources and protect the marine environment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a service system providing oceanographic data and
information headed by the National Oceanographic Information
Center has been established in China in the wake of the progress
in the past dozens of years in this field; it provides
comprehensive information services for ocean development,
oceanographic research and marine environmental
protection. Besides, in the early 1990s China built up a basic
network jointly run by government departments concerned,
enterprises, research institutes and coastal zones to promote
oceanographic information exchanges.

To give a further boost to oceanographic technology, offshore
development and marine environment protection, the Chinese
government has worked out the Medium- and Long-Term Program for
the Development of Oceanographic Science and Technology, the
Oceanographic Technology Policy (Blue Paper) and a number of
concrete development plans.
</P>
<P>
The main tasks for oceanographic technology development in the
future are: To strengthen research into basic oceanographic
science; tackle the key technologies of marine resources
exploitation and environmental protection; promote the
application of oceanographic technologies to marine industries;
improve marine resources development and service support for
marine disaster prevention and reduction; improve marine
environmental protection; and narrow the gap between China and the
developed countries in oceanographic technology.

V. The Implementation of Comprehensive Marine Management
</P>
<P>
The UNCED Agenda 21, formulated at the United Nations
Conference on Environment and Development in 1992, recommends that
a comprehensive marine management system be established by
countries with sea coasts to ensure sustainable utilization of the
sea and coordinated development of the marine programs.This
recommendation has received endorsement from all the countries in
the world, including China. In recent years China has established
and perfected state marine management organs as well as local
organs in coastal regions, with a fairly large contingent of
personnel engaged in marine law enforcement, management,
monitoring and scientific research. Marine-related laws and
regulations have been formulated and comprehensive management
exercised.
</P>
<P>
China has also improved its legislation work concerning
maritime matters. The National People's Congress has adopted the
Law of the People's Republic of China on Its Territorial Seas and
Adjacent Zones, Marine Environmental Protection Law of the
People's Republic of China, Maritime Traffic Safety Law of the
People's Republic of China, Fisheries Law of the People's Republic
of China, Mineral Resources Law of the People's Republic of China
and other related laws.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has promulgated administrative regulations,
encompassing the Regulations on the Exploitation of Offshore
Petroleum Resources in Cooperation with Foreign Enterprises,
Regulations on the Administration of Sino-Foreign Oceanographic
Surveys, Regulations Governing the Laying of Submarine Cables and
Pipelines, and Procedures for the Registration and Administration
of Mineral Resources Survey Zones and Sectors. In content, these
laws and administrative regulations are all consistent with the
principles and relevant provisions contained in the UN Convention
on the Law of the Sea.

The formulation and implementation of these laws, rules and
regulations has, on the one hand, protected China's state
sovereignty and marine rights and interests, and on the other,
promoted the rational development of marine resources and the
effective protection of the marine environment. Comprehensive
management of China's marine areas is beginning to be contained
within a legal framework. Aiming at the scientific, effective and
comprehensive management of marine areas, from 1989 to 1995 a
total of 3,663 marine zones have been divided into different
functional types by the relevant departments of the central and
coastal area governments, encompassing development and utilization
zones, control and protection zones, nature preservation zones,
special function zones and reserved zones.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1994, these departments worked out the National
Plan for Marine Development, in which the strategic objective of
marine development, marine industrial production and distribution
planning, and regional marine development planning were put
forward, along with policies and measures to promote marine
development.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has achieved gratifying successes in
comprehensive management experiments in the coastal zones. The
Comprehensive Survey of China's Coastal Zones and Tideland
Resources, which was carried out from 1979 to 1986, has
accumulated abundant information for further efforts to be made
in this field.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, construction of the Coastal Zone Model
Comprehensive Management Area has been going on in Xiamen, with
joint efforts by the Chinese government, the UN Development
Program (UNDP) and other organizations. This project, which has
achieved good results, has been praised by international
organizations and provided experience for China and other
countries to draw on for work in this regard. In 1997, China again
cooperated with the UNDP in coastal zone comprehensive management
experiments carried out in Fangcheng in the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, Yangjiang in Guangdong Province and Wenchang in
Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
The basic objective of comprehensive marine management is to
ensure a healthy marine environment and the sustainable
utilization of marine resources. To make a greater success in
this, China will make further efforts in this field, as follows:
</P>
<P>
It will perfect the legal system pertaining to the use and
administration of sea areas;
</P>
<P>
It will set up and perfect an information system to bolster
comprehensive marine management, and expand the survey and
appraisal of marine resources and the marine environment;
</P>
<P>
It will formulate large-scale offshore functional divisions and
plans for comprehensive marine development and protection;
</P>
<P>
It will set up an overall policy-making mechanism to promote
the coordinated development of marine programs;
</P>
<P>
It will gradually perfect the multi-functional force of marine
supervision and law enforcement personnel so as to form an
integrated air, sea and onshore marine surveillance and
management system;
</P>
<P>
It will mobilize people from all walks of life to take part in
the protection of marine resources and the marine environment and
enhance their consciousness of the need to cherish and protect
the ocean.

<HEADLINE> China Issues White Paper on Marine Development (16) VI. International Cooperation in Maritime Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the world's oceans are an integral whole, the research,
development and protection of the oceans require common efforts
by all countries in the world. As an important developing
country, China is well aware of its responsibilities and
obligations concerning international maritime affairs. China has
consistently insisted that the ocean be peacefully utilized, and
jointly developed and protected, and disputes over maritime
matters be settled in a fair manner. China has always taken an
active part in international and regional maritime affairs,
promoted cooperation and exchanges in this field, conscientiously
fulfilled its duties and contributed its share to international
development of the oceans.
</P>
<P>
China has always supported and actively participated in the
various forms of marine-related activities promoted by the United
Nations. China has joined nearly 20 international organizations,
including the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO/IOC), Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR),
Commission on Maritime Meteorology (CMM), International Maritime
Organization (IMO), UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES), and Pacific
Conference on Science and Technology (PACON). China has also
engaged extensively in cooperation and exchanges in maritime
affairs with scores of countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has attended all the sessions of the Third
Conference on the Law of the Sea of the United Nations (UNCLOS)
and joined the formulation of the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea, thus becoming a contracting party to the
latter. It has also attended the meetings of the preparatory
committees on the International Seabed Authority (ISA) and the
International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea. China took part in
the establishment of the ISA and was elected as one of its first
B-level council member states. As one of the first investors in
international seabed development, China has put large amounts of
capital, technology and qualified personnel into seabed
exploration, which has not only safeguarded China's rights and
interests in the international seabed but it also constitutes a
contribution to man's endeavors to exploit marine
resources. Moreover, a Chinese scientist was elected as one of the
first judges of the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea,
playing a positive role in international marine affairs.

China sets store by the protection and management of the high
seas and their resources. From 1993 to 1995, China participated
in the formulation of the Agreement for the Implementation of the
Provisions of the December 10, 1982 United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea Relating to the Conservation and Management of
Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. China
has successively engaged in negotiations with Russia, the United
States and Japan on the development and protection of the
fisheries resources of the Bering Sea, and signed and ratified the
Convention on the Conservation and Management of Pollack
Resources in the Central Bering Sea.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect fisheries resources on the high seas, China
has taken part in international activities to protect tunas,
whales and other endangered species of marine life, acceded to the
International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas,
and participated in the formulation of the Agreement to Promote
Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures
by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas.
</P>
<P>
Oceans being a main artery across the world, international
cooperation in sea transportation is of great importance for
promoting the interflow of commodities and economic development
globalwide. As a member of the IMO China has signed bilateral
maritime transportation agreements with 51 countries, making
positive efforts to promote international cooperation and
exchanges in maritime transportation.
</P>
<P>
At the 16th to 20th sessions of the IMO, China was successively
elected as an A-level council member state. China has also acceded
to the 30-some conventions formulated by the IMO, such as the 1965
Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic, 1990
International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response
and Cooperation, International Convention on Standards of
Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, As
Amended, 1974 International Convention for the Safety of Life at
Sea, International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from
Ships, 1973, as modified by the protocol of 1978 relating thereto
(MARPOL, or 73/78 Convention on Pollution Convention), Athens
Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and Their
Luggage by Sea, 1974, and International Convention for the
Unification of Certain Rules of Law with Respect to Collision
Between Vessels.
</P>
<P>
China has also taken part in global oceanographic activities,
including the GSMMP (global studies and monitoring of marine
pollution), the TOGA (tropical ocean and global atmospheric
project), the WOCE (world ocean circulation experiment), the JGOFS
(joint global ocean flux study), the LOICE (land-ocean interaction
in the coastal zone), and the GLOBEC (global ocean ecosystem
dynamics), making positive efforts to promote worldwide
oceanographic cooperation.

From 1985 to 1990, China sent three ships and more than 300
scientific workers to conduct the coupled ocean and atmospheric
response experiment in the tropical Western Pacific (COARE). Large
amounts of scientific data were obtained, providing important
materials for understanding the influence of that kind of response
in the Western Pacific's ``Warm Pool'' on global climate changes,
for improving global ocean and climate forecast modes and studying
the El Nino Phenomena. China joined the North Pacific Marine
Science Organization (PICES) and the Regional Committee for the
Western Pacific of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission
in 1990 and 1992, respectively. China also joined the Working
Group on Marine Resources Conservation of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Conference and other regional organizations, as well as
the Global Ocean Observation System (GOOS) initiated by the
UNESCO/IOC and other international organizations, and helped to
initiate and organize the Northeast Asia Ocean Observation
System.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, China has engaged in extensive scientific
cooperation in marine projects with dozens of countries,
including the United States, Germany, France, Canada, Spain,
Russia, the DPRK, the ROK and Japan, resulting in fruitful
achievements in projects concerning the deltas of the Yangtze and
Yellow rivers, Kuroshio, air-sea interaction, and the bio-
diversity of Hainan Island. During the Kuroshio survey, jointly
conducted by China and Japan from 1986 to 1992, more than 100
field operations were carried out, and meetings of over 20
scientists were arranged, which helped to accumulate a rich store
of information for understanding the movement of Kuroshio, its
regular pattern of changes and its origin, as well as the
resources variations in the fishing grounds of the Western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
China has made strenuous efforts to foster cooperation in
regional marine fisheries on the principles of equality and mutual
benefit. Under the Agreement of Fisheries Between the Government
of the People's Republic of China and the Government of Japan in
1975, China and Japan arranged for the development and protection
of their fisheries resources every year through negotiations. In
1997, China and Japan signed a new agreement on fisheries, laying
the foundation for long-term cooperation between the two countries
in this regard. China has held talks with the ROK, the Philippines
and other neighboring countries on the development and protection
of fishery resources in the surrounding sea areas.

China is also committed to helping developing countries train
people for marine development and comprehensive management work,
and has hosted many international maritime conferences. In 1987,
the training course on ocean management of the International Ocean
Institute was offered for the first time in Beijing. In October
1994, the China Center of the International Ocean Institute was
set up. So far, it has held three training seminars for over 50
people from 19 developing countries, majoring in marine
development. In 1996, the Pacem in Maribus XXIV Conference was
held in China, at which positive results were attained and a
Beijing Declaration was announced.
</P>
<P>
While making great efforts for the development and protection
of the ocean, China is clearly aware of the fact that, as a
developing country with inadequate level of development and
limited economic strength, China has lagged behind some of the
developed countries in this regard. The marine scientific and
technological level in China is relatively low, the equipment
used in marine development is backward and many development areas
are still in rough shape. Especially, the increasing population
and rapid economic growth in the coastal areas in recent years
have put great pressure on the marine environmental protection
and hampered the rational development of marine resources.
</P>
<P>
China has put the issue of rational utilization and protection
of marine resources and the marine environment into the overall,
cross-century plans for national economic and social development,
and has adopted the sustainable development of marine programs as
a basic strategy. With the continuing growth of the forces of
social production, the further building-up of comprehensive
national strength and the gradual awakening of the people's
consciousness of the importance of marine protection, China's
marine programs will definitely enjoy still greater
development. Together with other countries and international
organizations concerned, China will, as always, play its part in
bringing mankind's work for marine development and protection onto
the road of sustainable development.

PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- World number one player American Pete
Sampras had his Grand Slam sweeping dream all but evaporated as he
crashed out of the French Open here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ten-time Grand Slam winner slumped 7-6, 6-3, 6-4 in
straight sets to little-known Paraguayan Ramon Delgado in a second
round match of the tournament.

Sampras, who was the 1996 semifinalist here, could blame his

first set.
</P>
<P>
When he returned, the American looked lacking morale, while his
98th-ranked opponent played consistently from the baseline.
</P>

A passing shot gave the tiebreaker to Delgado, who soon set up
a 3-0 lead in the second set and a 2-0 in the third to hold onto

MOSCOW, May 27 (Xinhua) -- First Deputy Prime Minister of
Kirghizstan Boris Silayev said Wednesday that up to 580 people
suffered from the leakage of cyanide in the Issyk-Kul state.
</P>
<P>
Silayev, who is also in charge of emergency affairs in the
republic, said 71 of the victims had been hospitalized and another
six in critical condition had been sent to Bishkek, capital of
Kirghizstan, for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Silayev blasted Kumtor, a Kirghizstan-Canada joint mining
business, for its delayed report of the accident to the local
government.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when a truck from Kumtor loaded with
1.5-ton cyanide fell into a river flowing to the lake of
Issyk-Kul. The business reported the incident five hours late.
</P>
<P>
Silayev requested media both home and abroad not to play up the
accident, saying that the leakage would not result in a serious
pollution of the water in Issyk-Kul as only about 200-300
kilograms of cyanide drifted into the lake.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lankan Rebels Step Up Violence in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels have
stepped up violent activities after government forces sought to
intensify their Jaya Sikuru (Certain Victory) operation against
them early this month.
</P>
<P>
Velupillai Prabhakaran, leader of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE), said on May 13 over his clandestine radio
Voice of the Tigers that the rebels would fight to death to defend
their territories.
</P>
<P>
He threatened that thousands of troops would be killed if the
government persisted in pushing ahead with the operation aimed at
capturing a 75-kilometer corridor of a main highway between the
north and the south through rebel-held territories. Government
troops recaptured only 45 kilometers during the course of one
year.
</P>
<P>
The military have declared that the Jaya Sikuru operation will
go on till next year unless another strategy evolves.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has increased its violence not only in the warfront
but also in non-combat areas.
</P>
<P>
On May 14, senior military commander Brigadier Larry Wijeratne
was killed in a suicide bomb attack while on his way to a camp in
the north, just before he was to assume duties as commander of the
Military Academy in Colombo the following week.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the rebels also ambushed an army bus in
Northern Province with claymore mines. They later opened fire on
the soldiers, killing 14 and injuring 35 others.
</P>
<P>
Three days later, a lone gunman shot dead the mayor of a
northern Jaffna town in her home. The rebels had demanded she
relinquish her post or face consequences.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have been opposed to setting up a civil
administration in Jaffna which they claim was their territory but
was recaptured by government troops in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Sri Lanka this month, LTTE rebels blasted two
electricity transformers in Hatton Town in Central Province,
causing a loss of 16,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE also bombed three separate telecommunication exchanges
at Kuliyapitiya in North-Western Province, Ratnapura in Uva
Province and Nochchiyagama in North-Central Province.
</P>
<P>
The one-and-half-kilogram bomb at Kuliyapitiya caused only
minor damage. But at Nochchiyagama and Ratnapura, telephone
equipment was damaged and all telephones served by these exchanges
were rendered inoperative.
</P>
<P>
Late this month, two squads of LTTE cadres were reported to
have sneaked into the country's capital city, Colombo, to carry
out suicidal bomb attacks, according to Tiger radio transmissions
monitored by the security forces in Trincomalee in the east.
</P>
<P>
They were reported to be targeting two places which are
probably two significant buildings in the city.
</P>
<P>
Security has been tightened in and around Colombo amid fears of
bomb attacks.
</P>
<P>
There has been at least one major bomb attack every month in
Colombo and other key towns since the LTTE blasted the business
center of the capital in October last year.
</P>
<P>
The civil war between the LTTE and government forces has
entered its 15th year and has seen more than 55,000 persons killed
and an even larger number maimed.

The coalition said it will see its victories in Seoul, where
former Prime Minister Koh Kun of the NCNP is running for mayor,
and in Inchon, where the incumbent mayor Choi Ki-sun is running on
the ULD's ticket.
</P>
<P>
The NCNP is expected to win Cholla and Kwangju regions which
are its traditional political bases while the ULD says it will
surely sweep the Chungchong provinces and Taejon.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the GNP, which controls the 299-member
National Assembly, or parliament, with 161 seats, vowed to win all
five districts in the Kyongsang provinces, Pusan, Taegu and Ulsan,
which are its traditional political strongholds.
</P>
<P>
Although a survey showed its candidates failed to secure solid
leads over independents in Pusan and Ulsan, the GNP said regional
prejudice against the ruling coalition will eventually add up to
overwhelming voter support for its candidates in the two cities.
</P>
<P>
The GNP said its candidate, Sohn Hak-Kyu, has overtaken Lim,
whom it portrayed in TV debates and campaign rallies as one of the
culprits responsible for pushing South Korea into a currency
crisis late last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the GNP noted that it has a great chance to win
Kangwon Province as the ruling coalition's delay in deciding on a
joint candidate split their vote in the province.
</P>
<P>
The NCNP and the ULD failed to produce a joint candidate until
the former gave in shortly before the candidates registration on
May 15. Lee Sang-yong, the former Kangwon governor from whom the
NCNP withdrew its backing, is running as an independent.
</P>
<P>
The minor opposition New Party by the People, with little
chance of winning any of the 15 posts of nine governors and seven
mayors, is trying to win head posts of districts and councils.
</P>
<P>
However, election analysts said the nation will see a record
low turnout rate in the elections as voters become indifferent to
politics because of the ongoing economic crisis.

JOHANNESBURG -- South Africa's consumer inflation hit a 30-year
low last month when it dropped to five percent year-on-year from
the 5.4 percent in March, according to the statistics released by
the Central Statistical Service (CSS).
</P>
<P>
The fall in inflation was largely due to a one percentage point
drop in home loan rates, from 19 percent in February to 18 percent

HANOI, May 27 (xinhua) -- Dengue fever and encephalitis have
killed dozens of Vietnamese people as the diseases spread across
the country, the Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever spread to 40 provinces with over 22,300 cases
reported so far this year, a 68 percent increase over the same

Meanwhile, about 500 cases of encephalitis, including Japanese

Vietnam can produce vaccines against the Japanese B type

<HEADLINE> Russia Still Against NATO Expansion: Primakov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said here Wednesday that Russia is still against the
eastward expansion of NATO.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a joint press conference with his Ukrainian
counterpart, Boris Tarasyuk, after a meeting with Ukrainian
President Leonid Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization would create dangerous factors and new dividing lines
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
If NATO could develop into a political organization and focus
on peace-keeping operations, it would be helpful to promoting its
relationship with Russia, he said.
</P>
<P>
His talks with Kuchma mainly focused on the border issue
between the two countries, relations with NATO, the nuclear tests
in India and the situation in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the two sides have made "remarkable progress" in
land demarcation.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian foreign minister Tarasyuk said that Ukraine would
stick to its principle on integration with Europe and the
Europe-Atlantic structure.

people working in that bank to "be ready for the struggle" against
the laundering of money gained from narcotics trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Civil Rights Leader Defends Affirmative Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Civil rights gains won in the
1950s-1960s are under attack and progressive groups must combine
forces to fight back, Julian Bond, chairman of the largest
U.S. civil rights group said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We meet at a time when the leadership of the House and Senate
is more hostile to civil rights than in recent memory," Bond, who
is also Chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP) said at the National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
Both houses of Congress deserve failing grades on civil rights
matters, said Bond, who was elected chairman of the largest and
oldest civil rights group in the United States in February.
</P>
<P>
The problems are widespread, he said. "Everywhere we see clear
racial fault lines which divide American society as much now as at
anytime in our past."
</P>
<P>
The NAACP is working with labor groups, women's organizations
and religious leaders to fight a ballot proposal in Washington
State to end affirmative action there, he said.
</P>
<P>
Affirmative action is a practice in the United States that
favors people who are often treated unfairly because of their race
or sex in employment and education.
</P>
<P>
The fight to maintain past gains and to reach economic equity
today is less defined than old-fashioned Jim Crow segregation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In some important ways," Bond said, "non-white Americans face
problems more difficult to attack than in the years that went
before."

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: China Capable of Playing Bigger Role in Peace Talks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua)-- Since China has important influence
in the Middle East, it is capable of creating a generally cordial
atmosphere in this region, said visiting Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in an exclusive interview with Xinhua late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Because of that influence, he said, China could play a bigger
role in the Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, noted for his hard-line stance on the Middle East
peace talks, is in China for a four-day official visit, the first
since he became Israel's prime minister in June of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old prime minister praised China's efforts in
promoting the Middle East peace process, saying that the Chinese
have "goodwill and sympathy" for Israel and the Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
China's stance on the Mideast issue chiefly includes:
</P>
<P>
-- The Mideast peace talks should be based on the United
Nations resolution and comply with the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
-- The agreements already reached should be put into action
conscientiously.
</P>
<P>
-- Terror and violent activities should be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
-- Hostility should be reduced and mutual trust should be
increased.
</P>
<P>
Since the London peace talks between Israel and Palestine
achieved no substantial results and Netanyahu's Washington visit
was fruitless early this month, the peace process was plunged into
a deadlock again.
</P>
<P>
Israel rejected the U.S.-backed proposal for a transfer of 13
percent more land on the West Bank to Palestine, and said that
national security concerns must limit any handover to 9 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
Wiping out violent activities is the important pre-condition
for the peace talks, said Netanyahu, who believes that
"face-to-face and direct" negotiation is still the best way to
break the current deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his belief that the Middle East peace process will
"succeed absolutely," the prime minister promised that Israel will
comply with all the agreements reached, exchange land for security
and for peace, eventually.
</P>
<P>
Within the past two days Netanyahu has held in-depth
discussions with Chinese leaders on breaking the deadlock in
the Mideast peace talks and promoting bilateral relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders showed much concern about the stalemate in the
Mideast peace process, saying that so long as the peace talks
continue to be stalled, there will be a negative impact on peace
and stability in the region and in the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leaders expressed their hopes that Israeli leaders
would be farsighted and work with the international community to
break the deadlock in the Mideast peace talks in a positive and
practical manner.
</P>
<P>
They also reiterated that China will, as always, join the
international community to make its due efforts and contribution
to promoting the Middle East peace process
</P>
<P>
Impressed by the knowledge and far-sightedness of Chinese
leaders, Netanyahu said that to develop a relationship with China
is one of the focuses of Israel's foreign policy. It is very
important for the two of the world's oldest people to build a new
partnership in a new era, he said.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela: OPEC's Conference to Be Crucial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The ministerial conference of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will be
crucial to stabilizing the crude prices on international markets,
a Venezuelan official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Energy and Mines of Venezuela, Erwin Arrieta,
made the remark in an interview with the local media.
</P>
<P>
He said when the conference, planned for June 24, met in
Vienna, Austria, the international energy market would have
perceived the effects of the withdrawal of 1.5 million barrels of
crude per day, which was decided in an agreement on April 1.
</P>
<P>
Arrieta said that the conference would lead to a clear
diagnosis of market behavior at the closing of the second quarter
of the year, which was historically considered the season of less
demand.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that it was still too soon to evaluate the
impact of the agreement between independent producers and the OPEC
which was instituted in Riad on March 21 by Saudi Arabia, Mexico
and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
He said the petroleum ministers of the OPEC as well as
independent producers were constantly in communication to make any
decision which contributed to boosting prices, without discarding
possible additional cuts to the production.

<HEADLINE> China Reports Stable Growth in Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China's stock market showed stable
development in the first four months of this year, with market
capitalization up 18.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Composite Index of the Shanghai Stock Exchange
closed at 1,343 points on April 30, up 12 percent from the start
of this year, according to the latest statistics of the China
Securities Regulatory Commission, the industry watchdog.
</P>
<P>
The key index of the nation's other stock exchange in the
southern special economic zone of Shenzhen finished April at 4,180
points, almost unchanged from the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
China's stock market capitalization surged 18.7 percent in the
four-month period to more than 2.08 trillion yuan. Earlier
commission figures indicated that China now has more than 34
million stock market investors.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, China issued 39 A shares, four B shares
and three H shares in the January-April period. "A" shares refer
to those issued by Chinese companies for domestic investors only;
"B" shares are those issued in China but reserved for overseas
investors; and "H" shares refer to those issued in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The issues raised funds worth 29.4 billion yuan in aggregate,
with A-share issues and their rights issues pooling 24.9 billion
yuan, a jump of 33 percent from the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months, China also issued its first three
securities investment funds valued at 2 billion yuan each. The
funds, all closed-end, have met with significant investor
enthusiasm.

<P>
VIENNA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Austria gained their World Cup
confidence after beating fellow World Cup qualifiers Tunisia 2-1
in a warm-up match here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Austrians lost 3-2 to Hungary and 3-0 to the United States
in previous friendlies.
</P>
<P>
Herald Cerny and Arnold Wetl scored in the 11th and 17th
minute, but the Austrians played sluggishly after the first 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia's Khaled Badra closed the gap by heading the ball home
in the 23rd minute, benefiting from an unneccessary collision
between Austria's goalkeeper Franz Wohlfahrt and midfielder Heimo
Pfeifenberger.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisians played without key midfielder Riadh Bouazizi who
remained at a training camp in the French town Albertville to
nurse a minor thumb injury.

<P>
BRASILIA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United States Defense
Secretary William Cohen says he did not discuss the prospect of
future U.S. arms sales to Brazil at his meeting with Brazilian
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The local media had reported that Cohen's intention was to talk
Brazil into buying U.S. F-16 warplanes during his two-day visit to
Brasilia which started Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to any press speculation, there was no discussion
about arms," Cohen said soon after meeting Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
He said he discussed with the Brazilian president wide-ranging
issues including difficulties of establishing a defense ministry
in the Brazilian government.
</P>
<P>
Brazil now has four military ministries -- the army, the air
force, the navy and the general staff of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Cohen wrapped up his South American tour later Wednesday, which
also included Chile and Argentina.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The international donor community
has pledged financial assistance worth 780 million U.S. dollars to
Sri Lanka for 1998/99, official sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was announced at Sri Lanka's first Development Forum
(formerly known as Aid Group Meeting) which concluded in Paris
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Finance Minister G. L. Peiris who led a Sri Lankan
delegation to the forum said he was happy with the outcome in view
of the extremely difficult environment for global aid, the Finance
Ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted Peiris as saying the donor community's
support was an indication of its confidence in Sri Lanka's
management of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The community provided 700 million dollars for Sri Lanka last
year, the sources said, adding that prior to this year's meeting
Sri Lanka had expected the same amount of assistance for 1998/99.
</P>
<P>
The development forum was attended by Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Britain and
the United States.

Development, the U.N. Development Program and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the World Bank commended the government of Sri
Lanka for its efforts to pursue economic reforms but expressed
concern that prospects were not encouraging for a prompt end to
the 15-year ethnic conflict in the country, the sources added.

HELSINKI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The talent-studded Germany did not
show their competitiveness for next month's soccer World Cup
finals when they drew 0-0 with Finland in a warm-up match on

Juergen Klinsmann withdrew just hours before the kick-off with
a bruised calf, but may still recover in time for Saturday's
friendly against Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Finland's Jari Litmanen served as a consistent threat to German

<HEADLINE> New Officials from Inland Areas Chosen to Help Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The second group of 637 officials
have been chosen from across the country to help the Tibet
Autonomous Region and replace the 621 inland officials sent there
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Some officials chosen from Shandong Province and Shanghai have
arrived in Xigaze, the second largest city in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The officials will work for three years in 44 cities or
counties in the region.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the 621 officials in the first group will
leave Tibet before the end of July.
</P>
<P>
According to the third conference on Tibet held in July of
1994, officials would be chosen from central and local government
departments to work for a fixed period in different localities or
sectors in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In July of 1995, 621 officials from 33 departments of the
central government and from 15 provinces or municipalities arrived
in Tibet to serve as county-level officials.
</P>
<P>
Tibet regional officials said that the first group was an
outstanding contingent of conscientious, pioneering and dedicated
officials who proved popular among Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
The officials chosen from the inland areas have strengthened
prefecture- and county-level leadership in Tibet, cemented ties
between Tibet and other places, promoted the economic growth and
social progress of Tibet and enhanced ethnic unity, according to
regional officials.
</P>
<P>
During the last four years, the gross domestic product of Tibet
has exceeded a 10 percent growth rate, higher than the national
average.

<HEADLINE> Escaped Mafia Boss Extradited to Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Convicted Sicilian Mafia boss Pasquale
Cuntrera was extradited to Italy on Wednesday evening from Spain
where he fled to avoid being sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
Cuntrera, 63, was flown to Rome from Madrid by a military
aircraft on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
He escaped police surveillance in early May just as he was
about to serve a 21-year prison sentence for drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The ailing Mafia boss, who at the time was confined to a
wheelchair, was allowed out of jail on a technicality and
prosecutors were informed of his release too late to order his
re-arrest.
</P>
<P>
Italian police caught up with him while he was out for a stroll
with his wife on the Fuengirola sea-front near Malaga, in Spain.
</P>
<P>
Cuntrera's escape created a storm over the country's justice
system, prompting Justice Minister Giovanni Maria Flick to tender
his resignation last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cuntrera's disappearance coincided with the escape of Licio
Gelli, former grandmaster of the outlawed Propaganda 2 Masonic
Lodge, who fled at the end of April when the Italian Supreme Court
confirmed his 12-year prison sentence for fraudulent bankruptcy in
the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Marine Development as Strategic Task (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- As a major developing country with
a long coastline, China attaches great importance to marine
development and protection, and takes it as a long-term
development strategy.
</P>
<P>
A White Paper titled "the Development of China's Marine
Programs" issued today by the Information Office of the State
Council said that China boasts a mainland coastline of more than
18,000 km, and more than 5,000 islands in China's
territorial waters, each with an area of more than 500 sq m, and
the islands' coastlines total more than 14,000 km.
</P>
<P>
Located in medium and low latitudes, China's sea areas have
comparatively advantageous natural environmental and resource
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper said that China exercises sovereignty and
jurisdiction over the vast continental shelves and exclusive
economic zones (EEZs), as defined by the UN Convention on the Law
of the Sea.
</P>
<P>
The China Ocean Agenda 21 formulated by China in 1996 put
forward a sustainable development strategy for China's marine
programs.
</P>
<P>
The basic ideas of this strategy are as follows: To
effectively safeguard the state's marine rights and interests,
rationally develop and utilize marine resources, give positive
protection to the marine eco-environment and realize the
sustainable utilization of marine resources and the marine
environment as well as the coordinated development of the work in
this field.
</P>
<P>
China sticks to the principle of safeguarding the new
international marine order and the state's marine rights and
interests, the White Paper said.
</P>
<P>
In February 1992 the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC) of China adopted the Law of the People's
Republic of China on its Territorial Seas and Adjacent Zones.
</P>
<P>
As China's important law in this particular field, it provides
a legal basis for the country to exercise sovereignty over its
territorial seas and jurisdiction over the adjacent zones and
safeguard the state's safety and marine rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
To uphold the new international marine legal system and the
state's marine rights and interests, the NPC Standing Committee
approved the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea in May 1996, and
solemnly stated: "In accordance with the provisions of the UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea, the People's Republic of China
enjoys sovereignty and jurisdiction over the EEZs and continental
shelves up to 200 nautical miles off its coasts.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Marine Development as Strategic Task (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Together with the countries with opposite coasts or its
neighboring countries, China shall, through consultation and on
the basis of international laws and the principle of fairness, fix
the dividing lines of each country's marine jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
China has sovereignty over all archipelagoes and islands listed
in the Law of the People's Republic of China on Its Territorial
Seas and Adjacent Zones.
</P>
<P>
Regarding disputes over marine issues between China and its
neighboring countries, the Chinese government shall, in view of
the vital interests bearing on peace and development, stand for
their settlement through friendly consultation, the White Paper
said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to issues that cannot be solved for the time
being, China stands for pigeonholing them and for strengthened
cooperation and joint development.
</P>
<P>
The basic policies and principles in implementing China's
marine programs also include overall planning for marine
development and control, strengthening the comprehensive
development and administration of its coastal zones, rationally
developing and protecting the offshore areas, and actively
participating in the development and utilization of international
seabeds and oceans.
</P>
<P>
In order to gradually form coastal economic belts and marine
economic zones, the coastal land and sea areas should be exploited
in a unified way, the White Paper said.
</P>
<P>
China will rationally utilize marine resources and
promote the coordinated development of the marine industries,
work out a program for the coordinated development of marine
resources and the protection of the marine eco-environment.
</P>
<P>
China will also reinforce oceanographic technology research and
development, set up a comprehensive marine management system, and
actively promote international and regional cooperation in the
field of marine development, the White Paper said.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Export of Soda Ash, Caustic Soda, Tires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China will try to corner a larger
share of the international market for soda ash, caustic ash and
tires, according to a government official in charge of the
petroleum and chemical industry.
</P>
<P>
"Increasing exports is an important means to safeguard the
sustainable growth of China's chemical industry," said Li Yongwu,
director of the State Bureau of Petroleum and Chemical Industry,
during an interview.
</P>
<P>
Although the export of chemical products was affected in the
first quarter of the year by the Asian financial turmoil, Li said,
the proposed target for 1998 exports is realistic.
</P>
<P>
China plans for a 10 percent export growth in the chemical
industry, and to lower the trade deficit of chemical products to
less than 5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The total trade volume for chemical products during the first
quarter was 8.05 billion dollars, including 3.37 billion dollars
of exports, which was 9.2 percent more than the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
To raise the export volume of soda ash, caustic soda and tires
-- the three major export-oriented chemical goods -- related
industry associations and major manufacturers have put forward
specific measures, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China expects to export 120,000 more tons of soda than last
year, and is now stepping up the effort to establish a unified
exporting corporation for soda.
</P>
<P>
China is adopting the practice of the United States, and the
new corporation will embrace eight major soda exporters in
Lianyungang, Tangshan, Weifang, Tianjin and other cities.
</P>
<P>
Experts say a unified export system will help double the export
volume, and the price per ton should rise by 15-to-20 dollars as a
consequence. And China will be more competitive against the United
States, the largest soda producer in the world.
</P>
<P>
China also plans to build docks and storage facilities in
Dalian, Tianjin, Qingdao and Lianyungang dedicated to bulk soda
ash export, and to purchase cargo ships for bulk transportation.
</P>
<P>
China's export volume of soda ash was 600,000 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
Export of caustic soda this year is expected to be equivalent
to last year, and the bureau is stepping up the building of
unified export bases for the northern and southern part of China,
according to Ye Shangzhen, an official with the bureau.
</P>
<P>
China exported 117,300 tons of liquid caustic soda and 112,300
tons of solid caustic soda in 1997.
</P>
<P>
An organization coordinating unified caustic soda export from
southern China is already operational. It covers the city of
Shanghai and the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and Fujian.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of its counterpart in northern China is under
discussion, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
"The export of tires, especially heavy-duty radial tires, is
promising this year, and supplies of major exporters cannot meet
the demand," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The bureau is committed to place more importance on
coordinating exports in the tire sector, and creating a better
environment for Chinese name brands," he added.
</P>
<P>
China expects to export eight million tires this year.

other traditional industries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has spared no effort to develop the industry
of marine reproduction and mariculture, offshore oil and gas,
tourism, marine pharmaceuticals and other burgeoning
industries.
</P>
<P>
The country has actively explored new marine resources as far
as possible, and promoted the formation and development of some
potential marine industries, such as deep-water mining,
comprehensive utilization of seawater, and power generation with
marine energy.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that in 1997 the total output value of the
major marine industries, including ocean fishing, salt-making, the
salt chemicals industry, marine transportation, shipbuilding,
offshore oil and gas, and tourism, topped 300 billion yuan. As a
result, these industries have become forces actively promoting the
development of China's economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1980s, China's saltwater aquaculture has
developed rapidly, with a large increase in species and expansion
of breeding areas. The output of such products rose from 1.926
million tons in 1987 to 7.91 million tons in 1997, with their
proportion in the total output of the maritime harvest rising from
27 percent to 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to the protection of marine
fisheries resources, and has adopted various measures to conserve
such resources so as to guarantee the implementation of a
sustainable marine development strategy.
</P>
<P>
China has done this by instituting various closed fishing
seasons, closed fishing areas, marine sanctuaries and moratorium
systems, banning harmful fishing gear and methods, and restricting
the size of net meshes and the proportion of young fish.
</P>
<P>
As far back as in the 1960s China began to explore and exploit
offshore oil and gas resources on its own.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s it started to absorb foreign capital and
technology to develop this industry in cooperation with foreign
companies.

<P>
By the end of 1997 China had signed 131 contracts and
agreements with 67 oil companies from 18 countries and regions and
imported a total capital of close to six billion US dollars for
this industry.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, more than 100 structures with oil and gas had
been discovered, and 1.7 billion tons of oil reserves and 350
billion cu m of natural gas had been found.
</P>
<P>
Twenty oil and gas fields are under development. With an
offshore oil and natural gas industry in place, in 1997 China's
offshore oil output exceeded 16.29 million tons, and its natural
gas output stood at four billion cu m.
</P>
<P>
China has worked out a policy of utilizing its deep-sea waters
and coastal resources in a rational way.
</P>
<P>
According to the policy, priority shall be given to the
construction of harbors in deepwater coastal areas, and vigorous
efforts will be made to develop marine transportation.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, China's merchant ships had increased to
320,000 with a total deadweight tonnage of close to 50 million.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has 15 harbors each with an annual handling
capacity of more than 10 million tons. In 1997 the volume of
freight handled by the country's major coastal harbors totaled 905
million tons.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the coastal areas have created more than 300
marine and island tourism and recreational zones, with a variety
of marine features.
</P>
<P>
Marine tourism is now a burgeoning industry. In 1997 this
sector received more than 10 million overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that China was one of the world's pioneers
in making salt from seawater. With an area of 430,000 ha, China's
salt pans produced 29.281 million tons of raw salt in 1997. The
major salt chemical products are potassium chloride, bromide,
anhydrous nitre and magnesium chloride.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has listed the exploration and
exploitation of the mineral resources of the Pacific Ocean as a
long-term development project for which it intends to offer
special investment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it has established a special institution in charge
of coordinating and administering China's exploratory and
exploitative activities in the international seabed region.
</P>
<P>
China is the fifth-largest investor in international efforts
for seabed development, and has obtained an exclusive exploration
and development area of 75,000 sq km.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Marine Environmental Protection (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China attaches great importance to
the protection of the marine environment by establishing specific
organs and laws and strengthening the people's consciousness of
the importance of the protection.
</P>
<P>
Despite the drastic increase in the amounts of pollutants
brought about by the booming economy of the coastal areas, the
momentum of serious marine pollution has been slowed, the
environmental quality of some of the country's sea areas has been
improved and most offshore waters are of good quality, said the
White Paper on the Development of China's Marine Programs, which
released today by the Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
In 1982 the Marine Environmental Protection Law of the People's
Republic of China, a basic law of the country to protect the
marine environment, was approved by the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC). The Chinese Government also
adopted five regulations, including the Regulations on the
Prevention and Control of Marine Pollution Caused by Ships, and a
dozen of rules and standards concerning marine environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
All of these laws, regulations and rules have formed a legal
framework for marine environmental protection. In addition, an
overall marine monitoring network and an offshore environmental
monitoring network have also been put in place by related state
organizations, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
China carries out the policy of putting prevention first and
combining prevention with control in managing existing marine
pollution. While endeavoring to make a success in the protection
of marine biological resources and the prevention and control of
marine pollution, China makes the prevention and control of
land-sourced pollution the focal point of its marine environmental
protection work, it said.
</P>
<P>
A series of regulations have been drawn up to check
land-sourced pollutant emission, and enhance the monitoring,
surveillance and control of the main pollutant-emission outlets,
the white paper said.

<P>
To prevent marine pollution resulting from ship and port
discharge, in addition to the formulation of the Crash Program to
Combat Ships' Oil Pollution, oil-water separators have been
installed aboard ships of all types in accordance with relevant
stipulations.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, oil-polluted water treatment equipment, including
emergency treatment equipment, has been installed at all sea
ports, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
As one of the contracting parties to the Convention on the
Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other
Matters signed in 1972 in London, China attaches great importance
to the fulfillment of the provisions under the convention and is
steadily improving its control of the dumping of wastes into the
sea, it said.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has designated 34 dumping areas for dredged
materials of the third category and four areas for midair oil
discharge.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it has strictly prohibited the disposal of any
radioactive substance and incineration of toxic waste at sea, and
plans to gradually stop the dumping of industrial waste into the
sea, it said.
</P>
<P>
A multilevel setup for the protection of the fisheries
environment has been established by the state and coastal region
authorities, including 15 monitoring stations at and above the
provincial level around the country and a number of marine life
protected areas in major fishing grounds.
</P>
<P>
At present 59 various types of marine protected areas have been
built, covering a total area of 12,900 sq km, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the countries which are most vulnerable to
marine calamities.
</P>
<P>
After making unremitting efforts for decades, China has
installed a basic marine environment and disaster observation
network and forecast-alarm system, covering both offshore areas
and distant waters, with the cooperation of several departments,
the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
This network engages in analysis, forecast and grading of major
marine calamities, and runs maritime rescue centers and coastal
emergency stations. As a result, a marine disaster alleviation
framework has been put in place, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Several Panamanian rivers have
risen to a dangerous level this week due to the heavy rain, which
is threatening to cause flooding and landslides, a government
official warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The rainfall, which began this week, has reached six and
one-half inches and will increase in intensity during the coming
days," said Roberto Velasquez, director of the National System for
Civil Protection.
</P>
<P>
He said the first storms so far have taken a severe toll in the
loss of property and human lives. About 100 people have been
killed and two are reportedly missing.
</P>
<P>
International meteorological services predict that Panama will
suffer the worst effects of the El Nino weather phenomenon between
August and December, when sudden climatic changes such as
torrential rains, tornados and floods will strike the nation.
</P>
<P>
Velasquez said that his office has already warned riverside
communities within the country to take preventive measures to
minimize the disasterous effects of El Nino.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of citizens living in high-risk areas will be
relocated to places at least 100 meters from the river, Velasquez
added.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of this year, Panama was hit by a
serious drought that devastated the country's agriculture and
livestock farms and left two main hydro-electrical plants without
water.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian government worked out emergency plans to fight
the drought. Now, the target will shift to contending with the
floods.

BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China has promoted the
investigation and exploration of marine resources and the marine
environment, said the White Paper on the Development of China's
Marine Programs which was released today by the Information Office
of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
In recent years China made further efforts to search for
new exploitable resources, study new techniques and methods of
marine resources exploitation and protection, and train technical
personnel in marine development and protection, it said.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of a multidisciplinary oceanographic research
setup, which consists of 109 research institutes and 13,000-some
research personnel, China has many achievements to its credit in
oceanographic survey and research, studies in basic oceanographic
science, development and protection of ocean resources, marine
monitoring technologies and manufacturing of oceanographic
technical equipment, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 a
large amount of work has been done in the field of oceanographic
surveys and research, which started in offshore areas with surface
observation of the sea and later expanded to deep-sea regions by
means of aerospace remote sensing and underwater detection, as
well as surface observation, it said.
</P>
<P>
As early as in the period 1958-1960 a national comprehensive
survey of China's offshore waters was made; later, from 1980 to
1986, a comprehensive survey of coastal zones and shoals resources
was conducted nationwide, along with the launching of a number of
pilot projects on the comprehensive development and utilization of
coastal zones; and from 1988 to 1995 a general investigation of
the country's island resources and an experiment on their
comprehensive development were carried out, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
China signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1983 and began to make
surveys of the Antarctic and the surrounding sea areas in 1984. By
1997 the country had completed 14 programs of scientific
investigation in this region, using the Great Wall and Zhongshan
survey stations as bases, it added.

In 1996 China joined the International Scientific Committee on
North Pole Research, and has taken an active part in international
cooperation projects in the Arctic, such as "The Role of the Polar
Region in Global Change", it said.
</P>
<P>
With more attention paid to the study of the inshore shelf
oceanography, China has established a multidisciplinary
oceanographic research system with regional characteristics, the
white paper said.
</P>
<P>
Under the direction of the oceanographic development strategy
and the support programs and plans for the development of
oceanography drawn up by relevant state departments, marked
progress has been made in recent years in physical oceanography,
biological oceanography, marine geology and marine chemistry, it
said.
</P>
<P>
These achievements have provided scientific directions and
references for the promotion of offshore fishing and oil and gas
exploitation, protection of the marine environment, and reduction
and prevention of marine disasters, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
China makes vigorous efforts for the development of
oceanographic technologies, building up an oceanographic
technology system focusing mainly on the marine environment,
exploration and exploitation of marine resources, and general
marine engineering, and covering more than 20 technological
fields, it added.
</P>
<P>
The country has now turned its attention to implementing a
marine high-tech program, a program for tackling key problems in
marine science and technology and one for marine development by
reliance on science and technology, the white paper stressed.
</P>
<P>
China has basically evolved an oceanographic education system
embracing professional education, vocational education and popular
knowledge education, it said.
</P>
<P>
Oceanography as an area of study is taught in 37 institutions
of higher learning and 29 secondary specialized schools in China,
training large numbers of technical and managerial personnel, it
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a service system providing oceanographic data and
information headed by the National Oceanographic Information
Center has been established in China in the wake of the progress
in the past dozens of years in this field; it provides
comprehensive information services for ocean development,
oceanographic research and marine environmental protection, the

BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- In recent years China has
established and perfected state marine management organs as well
as local organs in coastal regions, with a fairly large contingent
of personnel engaged in marine law enforcement, management,
monitoring and scientific research.
</P>
<P>
A white paper, titled "the Development of China's Marine
Programs" issued today by the Information Office of the State
Council, said that China also formulated marine-related laws and
regulations and exercised comprehensive management.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that the UNCED Agenda 21, formulated at
the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in
1992, recommands that a comprehensive marine management system be
established by countries with sea coasts to ensure sustainable
untilization of the sea and coordinated development of the marine
programs.
</P>
<P>
This recommendation has received endorsement from all the
countries in the wold, including China, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
China has improved its legislation work concerning maritime
matters. The National People's Congress has adopted the Law of the
People's Republic of China on Its Territorial Seas and Adjacent
Zones, Marine Environmental Protection Law, Maritime Traffic
Safety Law, Fisheries Law, Mineral Resources Law and other related
laws.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has promulgated administrative regulations,
encompassing the Regulations on the Exploitation of Offshore
Petroleum Resources in Cooperation with Foreign Enterprises and
other regulations.
</P>
<P>
In content, these laws and administrative regulations are all
consistent with the principles and relevant provisions contained

The white paper said that the formulation and implementation of
these laws, rules and regulations has on one hand, protected
China's state sovereignty and marine rights and interests, and on
the other, promoted the rational development of marine resources
and the effective protection of the marine environment.
Comprehensive management of China's marine areas is beginning to
be contained within a legal framework.
</P>
<P>
Aiming at the scientific, effective and comprehensive
management of marine areas, from 1989 to 1995 a total of 3,663
marine zones have been divided into different functional types by
the relevant departments of the central and coastal area
governments, encompassing development and utilization zones,
control and protection zones, nature preservation zones, special
function zones and reserved zones.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, construction of the Coastal Zone Model
Comprehensive Management Area has been going on in Xiamen, with
joint efforts by the Chinese government, the UN Development
Program (UNDP) and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China again cooperated with the UNDP in coastal zone
comprehensive management experiments carried out in Fangcheng in
the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Yangjiang in Guangdong
Province and Wenchang in Hainan Province, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
China will make further efforts to perfect the legal system
pertaining to the use and administration of sea areas, to set up
and perfect an information system to bolster comprehensive marine
management, to formulate large-scale offshore functional divisions
and plans for comprehensive marine development and protection, to
set up an overall policy-making mechanism to promote the
coordinated development of marine programs and to gradually
perfect the multi-functional force of marine supervision and law
enforcement personnel, and to mobilize people from all walks of
life to take part in the protection of marine resources and the
marine environment and enhance their consciousness of the need to
cherish and protect the ocean.

<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China will conscientiously fufil
its responsibilities and obligations concerning international
maritime affairs, the Chinese government reiterated today at a
white paper on marine programs.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, titled "The Development of China's Marine
Programs" issued by the Information Office of the State Council,
said China has always taken an active part in international and
regional maritime affairs and promoted cooperation and exchanges
in this field.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that as the world's oceans are an integral
whole, the research, development and protection of the oceans
require common efforts by all countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
As an important developing country, China has consistently
insisted that the ocean be peacefully utilized, and settled in a
fair manner.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said, China has always supported and actively
participated in the various forms of marine-related activities
promoted by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
China has joined nearly 20 international organizations,
including the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO/IOC), Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR),
Commission on Maritime Meteorology (CMM), International Maritime
Organization (IMO), UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES), and Pacific
Conference on Science and Technology (PACON).
</P>
<P>
China has also engaged extensively in cooperation and exchanges
in maritime affairs with scores of countries in the world, it said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has attended all the sessions of the Third
Conference on the Law of the Sea of the United Nations (UNCLOS)
and joined the formulation of the United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea, thus becoming a contracting party to the
latter.
</P>
<P>
China sets store by the protection and management of the high
seas and their resources. From 1993 to 1995, China participated
in the formulation of the Agreement for the Implementation of the
Provisions of the December 10, 1982 United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea Relating to the Conservation and Management of
Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.
</P>
<P>
China has successively engaged in negotiations with Russia,

<P>
China has also taken part in global oceanographic activities,
including the GSMMP (global studies and monitoring of marine
pollution), the TOGA (tropical ocean and global atmospheric
project), the WOCE (world ocean circulation experiment), the
JGOFS (joint global ocean flux study), the LOICE (land-ocean
interaction in the coastal zone), and the GLOBEC (global ocean
ecosystem dynamics), making positive efforts to promote worldwide
oceanographic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, China has engaged in extensive scientific
cooperation in marine projects with dozens of countries,
including the United States, Germany, France, Canada, Spain,
Russia, the DPRK, the ROK and Japan.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan arranged for the development and protection of
their fisheries resources every year through negotiations. China
has also held talks with the ROK, the Philippines and other
neighboring countries on the development and protection of fishery
resources in the surrounding sea areas.
</P>
<P>
China is also committed to helping developing countries train
people for marine development and comprehensive management work,
and has hosted many international maritime conferences. In October
1994, the China Center of the International Ocean Institute was
set up.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Pacem in Maribus XXIV Conference was held in
China, at which positive results were attained and a Beijing
Declaration was announced.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said as a developing country, China has lagged
behind some of the developed countries in marine development and
protection. Especially, the increasing population and rapid
economic growth in the coastal areas in recent years have put
great pressure on the marine environmental protection and hampered
the rational development of marine resources.
</P>
<P>
China has put the issue of rational utilization and protection
of marine resources and the marine environment into the overall,
cross-century plans for national economic and social development,
and has adopted the sustainable development of marine programs as
a basic strategy.
</P>
<P>
Together with other countries and international organizations

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Promises Increased Investment in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi said here Thursday that his government will try its
best to increase investment in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Prodi made the remarks during the opening ceremony of the first
Italian trade fair in Tirana, the capital city.
</P>
<P>
He said his government is prepared to offer 60 billion lira
(34.8 million U.S. dollars) in emergency aid to Albania. The plan
however has yet to be approved by the Italian parliament.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Italian companies and enterprises took part in
the fair, which Prodi said is a signal to the industrial and
financial world as well as political circles that Albania enjoys a
healthy investment environment.
</P>
<P>
The fair will help Albania attract more foreign investment, the
Italian prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Italy is Albania's number one trade partner and aid
provider. It also ranks first in the world in terms of investment
in the south-eastern European country.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day stay here, Prodi also met Albanian President
Rexhep Meidani and Prime Minister Fatos Nano. This is the third
visit by Prodi to Albania after the country experienced turmoil in
early 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meidani and Nano expressed appreciation for the Italian
government's support. They also promised to prevent Albanian
refugees from entering Italy illegally.

<P>
ROTENBURG, Germany, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Ana Belen Alvaro scored
17 points, including five 3-pointers, to pace Spain to a 72-55 win
over China on Wednesday night at the Women's World Basketball
Championship here.
</P>
<P>
Like medal favorites Russians, who downed Argentina 107-32
early Wednesday, the Spainish won two straight victories and will
fight for the group A title against Russia Thursday night at
Meirotels-Hall, Rotenburg.
</P>
<P>
"I am very satisfied with the game, especially our defense,"
said Spain coach Manuel Coloma.
</P>
<P>
"The key to our success is our team spirit. With these kind of
players you can only win. Our captain Alvaro played sensational
game. Her three-pointer percent (5-7) was incredible."
</P>
<P>
Spain, which placed eighth four years ago in Sydney, Australia,
never looked back after Elisabeth Cebrian scored one of two free
throws which put the Spaniards 14-11 ahead 12 minutes into the
game.
</P>
<P>
After Spain concluded the first half 41-31, Alvaro scored two
3-pointers in a row to key Spain in a 16-5 run that allowed the
winner to build an edge as many as 21 points with 57-36, the
biggest gap in the game.
</P>
<P>
Three other players also scored double-figures with Anula
Nieves added 16 points, Pilar Alonso 12 and Marina Ferragut 11.
</P>
<P>
Miao Bo led the Chinese with nine points, followed by Ma
Chengqing.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Haixia, the defending Most Valuable Player at the last
championship, was a disappointment again, making off only two
points and three rebounds in 21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"Our offense was not strong enough, especially in the first
half. Zheng Haixia, inspite of her injury and illness, gave her
best, but unfortunately with her two points in total, couldn't
come close to her normal performance level," said Chinese coach Ma
Yuenan,
</P>
<P>
Veteran Zheng Dongmei, who contributed six points, said her
team was still a young team and need time to gain experiences.
</P>
<P>
China takes on Argentina Thursday for third place in the group
with the winner entering the second round in Bremen along with
Russia and Spain.

<HEADLINE> China Pursues Sustainable Maritime Development Strategy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China has listed it in its
cross-century general plan for national economic and social
development to rationally develop and utilize marine resources and
protect marine environment, according to a white paper titled "The
Development of China's Marine Programs" issued today by the
Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper said that China has also made it a fundamental
strategy to maintain sustainable maritime development.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper, China's first on marine programs, pointed out
that in the coming 21st century mankind will have new
opportunities to develop and utilize the ocean.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country with a long coastline, China must take
exploitation and protection of the ocean as a long-term strategic
task before it can achieve the sustainable development of its
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the year 1998 has been designated
by the United Nations as the International Ocean Year, and China
will participate positively in UN marine affairs, promote
cooperation between countries and regions and conscientiously
carry out its obligations in this field.
</P>
<P>
China boasts a mainland coastline of more than 18,000 km. There
are more than 5,000 islands in China's territorial waters, each
with an area of over 500 sq m, and the islands' coastlines total
more than 14,000 km. China also exercises sovereignty and
jurisdiction over the vast continental shelves and exclusive
economic zones (EEZs), as defined by the UN Convention on the Law
of the Sea.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that in developing marine programs, China
has adhered to the principle of safeguarding the new international
marine order and the state's marine rights and interests. In
February 1992, the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) of China adopted the Law of the People's Republic of
China on Its Territorial Seas and Adjacent Zones.
</P>
<P>
As China's important law in this particular field, the law
provides a legal basis for the country to exercise sovereignty over
its territorial seas and jurisdiction over the adjacent zones and
safeguard the state's safety and marine rights and interests, the
white added.

<TEXT>
<P>
The paper pointed out that to uphold the new international
marine legal system and the state's marine rights and interests,
the NPC Standing Committee approved the UN Convention on the Law
of the Sea in May 1996, and solemnly stated: "In accordance with the
provisions of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the
People's Republic of China enjoys sovereignty and jurisdiction
over the EEZs and continental shelves up to 200 nautical miles off
its coasts. Together with the countries with opposite coasts or
its neighboring countries, China shall, through consultation and
on the basis of international laws and the principle of fairness,
fix the dividing lines of each country's marine jurisdiction."
</P>
<P>
China has sovereignty over all archipelagoes and islands listed
in the Law of the People's Republic of China on Its Territorial
Seas and Adjacent Zones, the paper said, adding that regarding
disputes over marine issues between China and its neighboring
countries, the Chinese government shall, in view of the vital
interests bearing on peace and development, stand for their
settlement through friendly consultation.
</P>
<P>
With regard to issues that cannot be solved for the time being,
China stands for pigeonholing them and for strengthened
cooperation and joint development.
</P>
<P>
According to the white paper, China will work out overall
planning for marine development and control. It will strengthen
the comprehensive development and administration of its coastal
zones, rationally develop and protect the offshore areas and
actively participate in the development and utilization of
international seabeds and oceans.
</P>
<P>
China will also exploit the coastal land and sea areas in a
unified way in order to gradually form coastal economic belts and
marine economic zones, thus making the coastal areas more
prosperous and developed, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years China has made constant efforts to upgrade the
maritime fishing, transportation, salt-making and other
traditional industries. At the same time, it has spared no effort
to develop the industry of marine reproduction and mariculture,
offshore oil and gas, tourism, marine pharmaceuticals and other
burgeoning industries.
</P>
<P>
China has actively explored new marine resources as far as
possible, and promoted the formation and development of some
potential marine industries, such as deep-water mining,
comprehensive utilization of seawater and power generation with
marine energy.
</P>
<P>
The paper disclosed that in 1997 the total output value
of the major marine industries, including ocean fishing,
salt-making, the salt chemicals industry, marine transportation,
shipbuilding, offshore oil and gas, and tourism, topped 300
billion yuan. As a result, these industries have become forces
actively promoting the development of China's economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In developing the ocean fishing industry, China adheres to the
principle of "speeding up the development of aquaculture,
conserving and rationally utilizing offshore resources, actively
expanding deep-sea fishing, emphasizing processing and
circulation, and strengthening legal administration." The output
of such products rose from 1.926 million tons in 1987 to 7.91
million tons in 1997, with their proportion in the total output of
the maritime harvest rising from 27 percent to 36 percent.

<P>
The paper noted that while expanding deep-sea fishing and
international fishing cooperation, China adheres strictly to
relevant international maritime laws, pays full attention to
the protection of the eco-environment and, in the light of the
principle of "equality and mutual benefit, rational development of
the exploitable resources, and abstention from infringement on the
interests of other countries," and actively develops fishing
cooperation with relevant countries and regions, in order to
jointly expand the fishing economy.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to the protection of marine
fisheries resources, and has adopted various measures to conserve
such resources. It has done this by instituting various closed
fishing seasons, closed fishing areas, marine sanctuaries and
moratorium systems, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
As far back as in the 1960s China began to explore and exploit
offshore oil and gas resources on its own. In the 1980s it
started to absorb foreign capital and technology to develop this
industry in cooperation with foreign companies. By the end of
1997 China had signed 131 contracts and agreements with 67 oil
companies from 18 countries and regions and introduced some six
billion US dollars for this industry.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China has discovered more than 100 structures
with oil and gas, 1.7 billion tons of oil reserves and 350 billion
cu m of natural gas. Twenty oil and gas fields are under
development.
</P>
<P>
China has worked out a policy of utilizing its deep-sea waters
and coastal resources in a rational way. According to the policy,
priority shall be given to the construction of harbors in
deepwater coastal areas, and vigorous efforts will be made to
develop marine transportation.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the number of China's merchant ships had
increased to 320,000 with a total deadweight tonnage of close to
50 million, of which more than 23 million were of the fleets in
foreign trade transportation. At present, China has 15 harbors
each with an annual handling capacity of more than 10 million
tons. The volume of freight handled by the country's major coastal
harbors totals 905 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has listed the exploration and
exploitation of the mineral resources of the Pacific Ocean as a
long-term development project for which it intends to offer
special investment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it has established a special institution in charge
of coordinating and administering China's exploratory and
exploitative activities in the international seabed region. China
is the fifth largest investor in international efforts for seabed
development, and has obtained an exclusive exploration and
development area of 75,000 sq km.

<P>
The white paper pointed out that China attaches great
importance to the protection of the marine environment, and has
established organs and laws aimed at marine environmental
protection. In 1982 the Marine Environmental Protection Law of the
People's Republic of China, a basic law of the country to protect
the marine environment, was approved by the NPC Standing Committee
to prevent damages to the marine environment resulting from
coastal construction projects, offshore oil exploration and
exploitation, navigation of ships, wastes dumping, and discharge
of land-sourced pollutants.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has also issued several other
regulations on marine environment protection such as the
Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention
and Control of Marine Pollution Caused by Ships. Besides, China
has strictly prohibited the disposal of any radioactive substance
and incineration of toxic waste at sea.
</P>
<P>
On the development of maritime science and technology and
education, the paper said that in recent years China has
made further efforts to promote the investigation and exploration
of marine resources and the marine environment, search actively
for new exploitable resources, study new techniques and methods
for marine resources exploitation and protection and train
technical personnel in marine development and protection.
</P>
<P>
China has established 109 institutes involving oceanographic
research and 13,000-some research personnel. China has 37
institutions of higher learning and 29 secondary specialized
schools involving teaching of oceanography.
</P>
<P>
China has done a large amount of work in the field of
oceanographic surveys and research, which started in offshore
areas with surface observation of the sea and later expanded to
deep-sea regions by means of aerospace remote sensing and
underwater detection, as well as surface observation.
</P>
<P>
China signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1983 and began to make
surveys of the Antarctic and the surrounding sea areas in 1984. By
1997 the country had completed 14 programs of scientific
investigation in this region, using the Great Wall and Zhongshan
survey stations as bases. In 1996 China joined the International
Scientific Committee on North Pole Research, and has taken an
active part in international cooperation projects in the Arctic,
such as "The Role of the Polar Region in Global Change."
</P>
<P>
While implementing the comprehensive marine management, China
has established and perfected state marine management organs as
well as local organs in coastal regions. A total of 3,663 marine
zones have been divided into different functional types by the
relevant departments of the central and coastal area governments,
encompassing development and utilization zones, control and
protection zones, nature preservation zones, special function
zones and reserved zones.

<HEADLINE> Major Tea Exporter Expecting Higher Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Wuyuan Tea Plant in southeast
Jiangxi Province, one of three tea-processing plants authorized to
conduct direct foreign trade in China, is preparing for an upturn
in its exports this year.
</P>
<P>
"The bustling scene in the workshop tells of brisk sales," the
head of the packaging department said, adding that contracts have
been flowing in one after another since Spring Festival in
February, months ahead of the Wuyuan's spring tea harvest.
</P>
<P>
At the East China Export Commodity Fair held in March, the
company closed deals for 883.2 tons. At the Chinese Export
Commodity Fair (CECF) in April, the company signed contracts for
1,210 tons, said Yu Xinchun, director of the plant.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, Southeast Asia's financial turmoil has little
follow-up effect on China's tea exports. "We are expecting a
higher transaction figure in the autumn event of CECF," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the country's major green-tea cultivation center, Wuyuan
County has 10,666 hectares of tea growing area yielding 6,000
tons of output annually, with the export portion making up more
than 90 percent of its total sales.
</P>
<P>
The Wuyuan Tea Plant with an annual output of 5,000 tons has
more than 20 varieties. Green tea labeled with the brand "Wuyuan"
has gained reputation in markets both at home and abroad. It has
been honored in the U.S. book "Complete Collection of Tea" as an
elite green tea.

In conducting international cooperation in maritime affairs,
the paper said that China has always supported and actively
participated in various forms of marine-related activities
promoted by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
China has joined nearly 20 international organizations,
including the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO/IOC), Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR),
Commission on Maritime Meteorology(CMM), and International
Maritime Organization (IMO). China has also engaged extensively in
cooperation and exchanges in maritime affairs with scores of
countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that China has signed bilateral maritime
transportation agreements with 51 countries, making positive
efforts to promote international cooperation and exchanges in
maritime transportation. China has also acceded to 30-some
conventions formulated by the International Maritime Organization
(IMO).
</P>
<P>
China has also taken part in global oceanographic activities,
including the GSMMP (global studies and monitoring of marine
pollution), the TOGA (tropical ocean and global atmospheric
project), the WOCE (world ocean circulation experiment), making
positive efforts to promote worldwide oceanographic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out that China is clearly aware of the fact
that, as a developing country with inadequate level of development
and limited economic strength, China has lagged behind some of the
developed countries in this regard. Especially, the increasing
population and rapid economic growth in the coastal areas in
recent years have put great pressure on the marine environmental
protection and hampered the rational development of marine
resources.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that with the continuing growth of the forces of
social production, the further building-up of comprehensive
national strength and the gradual awakening of the people's
consciousness of the importance of marine protection, China's
marine programs will definitely enjoy still greater development.
</P>
<P>
Together with other countries and international organizations
concerned, China will, as always, play its part in bringing
mankind's work for marine development and protection onto the road
of sustainable development, the paper said.

ROTENBURG, Germany, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia created the
biggest scoring margin at the 13th Women's World Basketball
Championship by crushing Argentina 107-32 in Wednesday's group A
match here.

The Russians, who scored 13 unanswered points just five minutes
into the game, proved they were too strong to overcome for the
smaller Argentines.
</P>
<P>
After leading the first half 40-21, Russia continued their
domination and used their bench players to extend the gap.
</P>
<P>
Russian had twice as much in rebounds at 46 and outclassed the
South American team with 49 percent against 20 percent in the
field goal percentage.

<P>
CHANGSHA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan province is
preparing against the worst possible floods in history, with
evacuation and rescue exercises under way throughout the province.
</P>
<P>
Hunan has suffered several floods already this year, with more
rainfall than normal. Experts warn that a flood as big as the
disaster in 1954 might take place this year along the Yangtze
River. The 1954 flood killed more than 33,000 people and caused a
crop loss of 12.5 billion kilos of grain.
</P>
<P>
Government leaders at all levels are demanding frequent
inspections of the anti-flood first line and direct responsibility
for flood-control efforts.
</P>
<P>
Rescue facilities will also be allocated to those local people
in the most dangerous areas.

<HEADLINE> Gonggar Airport Towers Above the World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The day barely breaks, yet Gonggar
Airport in this capital of China's Tibet Autonomous Region has
already awakened to another day as its air traffic control,
security and cargo departments are bustling with preparations for
the first flight.
</P>
<P>
The first plane lands at 8:20 just as the first gleam of
morning sunlight shines on the mountains surrounding the airport,
which is 3,500 meters above sea level. Lhasa is two time zones
west of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Among the 190 people disembarking the SZ4001 flight, 3 percent
are Tibetans and 25 percent foreign travelers, with the majority
business people and tourists.
</P>
<P>
One of the passengers is on a tour of China with her husband
and mother-in-law. Before arriving in Lhasa, they had visited
Beijing and Chengdu, with plans to go on to Xi'an and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The whole of my family is fascinated with China," said the
U.S. tourist. She expressed her regret on their short 10-day stay
in China, and looked forward to returning some day.
</P>
<P>
Passenger flow has been on the rise in recent years as more
flights are landing in Lhasa, said Qin Hucheng, deputy director of
Lhasa's Civil Aviation Administration. Last year, Gonggar Airport
handled 160,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
July and August are the airport's peak season with the influx
of tourists and the exodus of Tibetan youths who go to other
cities to continue their education, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Gonggar Airport has opened four domestic routes -- Chengdu,
Chongqing, Beijing and Xi'an -- and one to Katmandu in neighboring
Nepal, meaning 25 regular flights each week.
</P>
<P>
More air routes are scheduled to open between Lhasa and
Guangzhou, Kunming, Xining and Shanghai over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
At 1:40 p.m. the sixth and last flight of the day leaves
Gonggar. As a result of the plateau climate where airflows are
especially active in the latter half of the day, Qin said, there
are seldom an afternoon or an evening flight.
</P>
<P>
Gonggar, one of the world's highest airports, has kept an
impeccable safety record since it went into service in 1964, Qin
said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Calls Parents to Use TV Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore on
Wednesday urged parents to use the TV ratings combined with v-chip
technology to block children's exposure to TV sex and violence, so
as to reduce violent behavior in youngsters.
</P>
<P>
"Of course the recent tragic incidents of children shooting
children give us ever more urgent cause for concern," Gore said
at a news conference on TV ratings survey.
</P>
<P>
"We must explore every option that might help prevent violence
by children and that includes limiting children's exposure to
television violence. To be more specific, helping parents to limit
their own children's exposure to television violence."
</P>
<P>
Gore said, "by the time children complete elementary
school, they will witness more than 8,000 simulated murders and
more than 100,000 simulated acts of violence. By the time the
average child graduates from high school, those numbers double,
and a child will witness almost 20,000 simulated murders, almost
200,000 simulated acts of violence."
</P>
<P>
He said that numerous national experts have demonstrated that
children who do view a large amount of TV violence are
significantly more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said that parents are increasingly
concerned about TV content and more and more of them are
concerned "a great deal" that their children see too much sex
and violence on television.
</P>
<P>
The telephone survey, conducted April 2-26 by Princeton Survey
Research Associates involving 1,358 parents of children ages 2-17,
showed that parents are using TV ratings to help decide what their
children can watch but many can't even name any of the ratings
used for shows.
</P>
<P>
Since October 1, when ABC, CBS, Fox and most cable networks
began using new detailed TV ratings, the letters "V," "S," "L" and
"D" have been showing up on TV screens alongside age-based
ratings, such as "TV-PG" (parental guidance suggested) and "TV-14"
(may be unsuitable for children under 14). The letters stand for
violence, sex, crude language and suggestive dialogue.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Rises Against Mark, Slips Against yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar Wednesday rose
against the mark, largely affected by the crash of the Russian
stock market.
</P>
<P>
The dollar slipped against the yen. In late New York trading,
the dollar was quoted at 137.40 yen, down from 137.83 late
Tuesday. During New York trading Tuesday, the dollar rose briefly
to a seven-year high against the yen.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also was changing hands at 1.7829 German marks, up
from 1.7705.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that when Russia has economic or political
problems, German currency would show its weakness because of the
close economic ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Russian stocks plummeted more than 10 percent Wednesday. The
Russia Trading System is now down more than 50 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The ruble, the nation's currency, recovered from an early fall
Wednesday to ending little changed against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
To protect ruble, the nation's currency, Russia's central bank
raised interest rates from 50 percent to a whopping 150 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday:
1.4711 Swiss francs, down from 1.4717; 5.9740 French francs, up
from 5.9330; 1,755.00 Italian lire, up from 1,743.00; and 1.4564
Canadian dollars, up from 1.4548.
</P>
<P>
The British pound was quoted at 1.6316 U.S. dollars, down from
1.6367 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> New Drug Being Studied May Prevent Transmission of Herpes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A new study being done at
Seattle-based University of Washington offers hope for millions of
herpes sufferers.
</P>
<P>
The UW virology clinic is one of about 20 sites across the
United States participating in an international two-year study of
the drug called valacyclovir, which may prevent transmission of
genital herpes.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very optimistic," the Seattle Times quoted clinic medical
director Anna Wald as saying. The clinic has studied herpes and
its treatment for two decades.
</P>
<P>
Taking orally every day, after five to seven days it prevents
viral shedding, during which the virus can be transmitted. This
indicates, Wald said, the drug will prevent transmission of the
herpes virus.
</P>
<P>
The new study comes at a time when renewed attention is being
paid to herpes, which over the past decade has been overshadowed
by AIDS. In the United States, about 45 million people -- about
one in very five persons 12 years of age and older -- have genital
herpes. According to a report in the New England Journal of
Medicine, from 1974 to 1992 there was a 30 percent increase in the
disease.
</P>
<P>
The initial outbreak of herpes often results in painful sores
in the genital area. For most, recurrences get milder and less
frequent over the years as the immune system builds up antibodies
to fight the virus. But for babies the virus is devastating,
because their immune systems are not developed. Of babies who get
herpes, a third die and half those who survive suffer permanent
brain damage, Wald said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Orders White House Aides to Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge formally ordered
two presidential aides to tell a grand jury about their
discussions with President Bill Clinton about Monica Lewinsky,
according to court documents released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson said that a
president's conversations with aides about such a matter can be
covered by the privilege, including those involving first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
But Johnson ruled that even if the conversations are covered by
executive privilege -- the right of a president to get
confidential advice -- Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr had
proven his need for the information was greater.
</P>
<P>
She ordered that presidential aides Bruce Lindsey and Sidney
Blumenthal answer questions they previously refused to answer on
grounds of executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
In her ruling, Johnson concluded that Starr was entitled to the
evidence in part because it "cannot feasibly be obtained
elsewhere."
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal immediately issued a statement saying he would
testify. "If called before the grand jury, I will testify
truthfully and completely to all questions posed to me by Ken
Starr," he said.
</P>
<P>
In its ruling, the court began with the assumption that
Clinton's claim of executive privilege was valid and then weighed
prosecutors' interest in getting the testimony versus the
president's right to confidential advice.
</P>
<P>
The court said that among the conversations covered by
executive privilege were those between the aides and Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff, in a statement, cast the
judge's opinion as a vindication of White House arguments that
conversations with the president -- and among senior advisers,
including the first lady -- are protected by executive privilege.

<HEADLINE> Global Warming Causes World Glaciers Melting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists said Tuesday
that due to global warming, world-wide glaciers are melting much
faster than scientists had previously thought.
</P>
<P>
According to a study conducted and presented by geologist Mark
Meier and his team at a meeting of the American Geophysical
Union in Boston on Tuesday, "The glaciers are receding and they're
becoming thinner," because of the global warming.
</P>
<P>
Meier and his team at the University of Colorado at Boulder
looked at characteristics of glaciers worldwide during the last
100 years,and then compared the measurements to today's ice caps.
</P>
<P>
They said glaciers outside of Antarctica and Greenland had
retreated and become thinner and thinner.
</P>
<P>
All of the glaciers in Glacier National Park in Montana will
be gone in the next 50 to 70 years, predicted the U.S. scientists.
</P>
<P>
One of the direct results of the glaciers melting, they said,
would lead to the rising of sea levels which cause beach erosion
and more severe inland storms. And rivers will overflow their
banks more than often.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistani delegation is
expected to arrive in Washington on Friday for talks with U.S.
officials on the South Asian situation following India's five
underground nuclear tests, a U.S. official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will be headed by Senator Akram Zaki, who has
close ties with Prime Minister Mawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's willingness to send the delegation to Washington
was the result of discussions between the Pakistani government
and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott who visited
Islamabad after India's surprise nuclear tests earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
The United States has tried hard to persuade Pakistan not to
follow its arch rival India by conducting the same nuclear tests.
President Bill Clinton has spoken three times by telephone with
Sharif on that issue.
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence officials have said Pakistan was nearing
completion of preparations for a nuclear weapon test in a remote
western corner of the country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: E. Africa Pledges to Accomplish Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- East African government
officials, who appear satisfied with the donors' promise to
finance the rehabilitation and construction of a multi-billion
dollars road network, have pledged to manage money well so as to
make the ambitious project a success.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made during a two-day conference in the
northern town of Arusha, where the presidents of Kenya, Uganda
and Tanzania met to ask the donor community to part with 4.664
billion U.S. Dollars to repair or construct 15,273 km of roads in
the region over the next five years to promote regional
integration process.
</P>
<P>
The donor community has promised to grant more than one
billion U.S. Dollars for the first phase of the project, an
amount that has apparently satiated the demands of the three East
African Cooperation (EAC) leaders.
</P>
<P>
The first phase to benefit from the project is the
Mombasa-Malaba-Katuba corridor and Dar es
Salaam-Dodoma-Isaka-Mutukula-Masaka corridor.
</P>
<P>
The executive secretary of the EAC Francis Muthaura said: "A
major leap has been made. We'll make necessary follow-up to make
sure that the roads project is a success."
</P>
<P>
The donor community, he said, has expressed great
understanding and their initial assistance is a great boost to
the development east African nations.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya's Minister for Regional Cooperation, Nicolas Biwott,
was grateful that a start has been made in the roads project,
saying, "the conference has been very fruitful."
</P>
<P>
He said the Western donor countries and multilateral agencies
have respected the desire of the east Africans to have the roads
repaired and built first.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan public works minister, Rebecca Kadaga, the former
foreign minister, said the east African countries are embarking
on a serious project.
</P>
<P>
"We want to put east Africa on the path to prosperity and we
have to start from somewhere," she said. "Roads are very critical
in our context."
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian Minister of Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation, Jakaya Kikwete, who doubles as the chairman of the
EA Tripartite Commission, said, "the conference has recorded a
major success."
</P>
<P>
"We've been highly honored by the donor community, and we
express our gratitude to them," he said. "This is a good
beginning for an EA integration and development."
</P>
<P>
He allayed fears of some people who doubted whether or not the
government will have transparency in managing the funds for the
road project, noting that "we will make sure every cent will go
for the intended purpose. We should not look back."
</P>
<P>
The remarks came in response to the skeptical attitude held by
some donors who said a history of mismanagement argued against
plowing in more cash.
</P>
<P>
A Western ambassador reportedly said that Kenya and Tanzania
lack the capacity to absorb any huge amount of money for roads.
For instance, he said, "work on the damaged Nairobi-Mombasa road
has not started two years after funding was obtained for that
project from the European Union and the World Bank."
</P>
<P>
Donors further blamed that heavy taxes levied specifically for
road maintenance, like the fuel levy in Kenya and Tanzania,
serviced other ambitious government expenditures or were stolen
from government coffers by officials who often went unpunished.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they said negligence of the Ugandan government
has caused setbacks in repairing a road network which cost 350
million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank representative for Tanzania and Uganda, James
Adams, also said the money offered should be made best use of
with transparency.
</P>
<P>
An aide to Kenya's president, however, said the attendance of
the three heads at the conference reflects the seriousness about
the EA roads project.
</P>
<P>
More than 130 delegates from more than 10 countries and
various leading financial institutions in the world have
participated in the conference.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Free Trade Area Achievable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) said Wednesday
that the achievement of a free trade area in the region is not
only realistic but also achievable.
</P>
<P>
Opening the Third Trade and Customs Committee meeting for
COMESA in Lusaka, Enock Kavindele, current chairman for the
Council of Ministers of the 14-member regional body, disclosed
that six member countries have reduced tariffs by 80 percent, two
by 70 percent and three by 60 percent, according to Zambia
National Broadcasting Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, Kavindele, also Minister of Commerce, Trade and
Industry, warned that the free trade area would not be achieved
if non-tariff barriers such as the free movement of people and
the right of residence are not removed.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the need to remove barriers in the
transport and communication sector if the free trade area is to
be achieved by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian minister further commended COMESA for involving
the business community and the private sector in the programs of
the regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier at the meeting, Erastus Mwencha, acting
secretary-general of COMESA, called on member states to adhere to
the timetable for the reduction of tariffs and elimination of
non-tariff barriers.
</P>
<P>
He added that the achievement of a free trade area by the year
2000 is crucial for the regional grouping.

<HEADLINE> UNFPA Hails Brundtland Era at WHO as One of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) looks forward to working closely with Dr.
Gro Harlem Brundtland and the World Health Organization (WHO),
particularly in the areas of providing reproductive health and
rights for all, said Dr. Nafis Sadik, Executive Director of UNEPA,
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Brundtland 's nomination for Director General by the WHO
Executive Board was recently endorsed by the World Health Assembly,
WHO's governing body.
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, Dr. Brundtland and I have enjoyed close
cooperation. Dr. Brundtland and I share a particular concern over
the situation of women and girls around the world, especially for
their sexual and reproductive health and rights," said Dr. Sadik.
</P>
<P>
"Her leadership in this area was extraordinary at the
International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in
1994. The goals and activities of UNFPA are very close in many
ways to those of WHO and I am sure that with the new leadership of
Dr. Brundtland, UNFPA and WHO will continue to work closely and
further strengthen our mutual cooperation," said Dr. Sadik.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA programmes in health, especially in reproductive health,
including adolescent reproductive health, rely on technical
guidance by WHO, said Dr. Sadik. In addition to funding many joint
programmes on reproductive health, UNFPA collaborates closely with
WHO and other United Nations agencies on the Safe Motherhood
Initiative, the Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS, and the campaign to
eliminate female genital multilation.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA is the world's largest internationally funded source of
population assistance to developing countries. It supports efforts
to improve reproductive health and family planning services on the
basis of individual choice, and to formulate population policies
in support of efforts towards sustainable development and
population stability.

UNITED NATIONS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- About 220 million hectares
of land in Europe are being degraded, equaling an area four times
the size of France, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) said.
</P>
<P>
This is due to destruction of forests, excessive use of
fertilizers, manure and pesticides, inappropriate tillage
practices, monoculture and excessive grazing pressure, according
to a FAO press release distributed by the U.N. Department of
Public Information here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A regional FAO project is currently mapping soil and terrain
vulnerability in Central and Eastern Europe while European nations
are discussing the harmonization of soil data and soil maps.

The FAO sees harmonized soil data for the whole of Europe as a
way toward a common basis for policy decisions related to land
use, land management and environmental protection.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Business to Hire More Welfare Recipients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
on Wednesday the federal government is doing its part by hiring
people off the welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
At a White House event marking the first anniversary of his
"Welfare-to-Work Partnership" initiative, Clinton called on private
firms to follow suit, urging businesses to double their welfare
hires this year.
</P>
<P>
Five thousand companies taking part in the "Welfare to Work
Partnership" hired 135,000 welfare recipients in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the federal government is well on the way to
meeting its goal of hiring 10,000 people from welfare by the year
2000. Since March 1997, federal agencies and departments have
hired 4,811 welfare workers, or 45 percent of the objective.
</P>
<P>
The White House has hired seven welfare recipients for clerical
and support work.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said welfare caseloads have fallen to 8.9 million, a
drop of 3.3 million since he signed the welfare reform law two in
the fall of 1996. The percentage of Americans on welfare is at its
lowest level since 1969 -- 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new law, requiring people to leave the welfare rolls in a
maximum of five years and to work after two years, puts states
under increasing pressure to move people into jobs.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, the president has kept calling on the private
sector to hire welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
The 5,000 companies participating in the partnership are each
committed to hiring at least one person.

<HEADLINE> White House Says Gingrich Remarks on Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The White House on Wednesday
condemned House Speaker Newt Gingrich for his attack on
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, saying his comment that
Albright was an agent of the Palestinians was "impugning the
loyalty" of the secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
It was the second day that the Clinton administration hit back
at Gingrich. On Tuesday the State Department denounced
Gingrich's comment on Albright as "appalling and outrageous."
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Gingrich accused the Clinton administration of
pressuring Israel on the issue of withdrawal from the West Bank.
He said: "I think it's wrong for the American secretary of State
to become the agent of the Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Gingrich's remarks
were "wholly inappropriate."
</P>
<P>
"I think it was clear that he was impugning the loyalty of
the secretary of state and that was most unfortunate," McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich has been visiting Israel since last week along with
other members of Congress from both parties. He made public
support to Israel's position on the Middle East peace process
during his visit.
</P>
<P>
He said he supported Jerusalem as the "eternal" and "united"
capital of Israel, even though Palestinians view it as the
capital of a future state.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the speaker was just making "provocative
statements that appear to side with one party against another
party."

<HEADLINE> Boeing Continues 737 Delivery Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Boeing reaffirmed Wednesday
that it will continue to experience delivery delays through this
year on new models of its 737 passenger jets.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle-based airplane manufacturer, in a status report on
its production problems, identified assembly of the newer 737s as
the biggest single problem and the area with the most risk and
uncertainty. But it said the company is making progress in ramping
up the rate of production on the 737, the 747 and other commercial
jetliners.
</P>
<P>
Boeing posted a loss of 178 million U.S. dollars last year as
the cost of fixing its production problems overwhelmed its
earnings. Since last fall, the financial world has monitored
closely Boeing's efforts to get its production on track, which
also have been a source of mounting concern on Wall Street. So
far, the production problem has cost the company more than 2
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Today's report indicates that Boeing has a long way to go to
get back to normal production, although it said it still expects
to meet its goal of delivering 250 commercial jets in the first
half this year. Boeing so far has delivered 180.
</P>
<P>
As of today, Boeing has delivered 33 of the newer-model 737s.
The company said the delay in the program is being caused by parts
shortages, out-of-sequence work and design changes needed to meet
U.S. and European certification requirements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Boeing's 747 assembly line is increasing production
from four to five airplanes a month. But the question is how long
that new rate can be sustained if Asian carriers begin delaying or
canceling deliveries. The company said that most of the airlines
in Asia are taking delivery of their 1998 airplanes, but it
doesn't know what will happen next year. Boeing has indicated that
as many as 60 airplanes already ordered by Asian airlines could be
at risk of delay or cancellation over the next three years.
