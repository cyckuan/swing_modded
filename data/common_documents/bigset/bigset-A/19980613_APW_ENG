	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Not so fast, Chicago Bulls.
	   Michael Jordan missed a last-second 3-pointer that would have
won the championship, and Karl Malone made sure the Bulls would
have to earn their sixth championship away from home.
	   Malone had the kind of dominant, breakout game that had been
absent this series, scoring 39 points as the Utah Jazz won 83-81
and sent the NBA Finals back to Salt Lake City on Friday night.
	   Malone shot 17-for-27 from the field and scored 17 points in the
third when the Jazz took the lead for good, but the Bulls didn't go
quietly or without high drama.
	   Toni Kukoc flung up a knuckleball 3-pointer that swished through
with 5.5 seconds left, making it 82-81, and Jeff Hornacek missed
one of two foul shots with 1.1 seconds left.
	   The Bulls had one last shot, inbounding from midcourt, and the
tension only increased as each team called a timeout as the last
play was almost set to be run.
	   John Stockton deflected the first pass out of bounds, and the
referees reset the clock from 0.3 to 0.8. Jordan then flung up a
3-pointer that hung high in the air but ended up as an airball.
	   The United Center crowd left in stunned silence, and the Jazz
suddenly had new life.
	   Still, they'll need two more wins to prevent the Bulls from
winning their sixth championship this decade.
	   Malone found the touch on his outside shot, and the Jazz found
another offensive option in Antoine Carr. The 13-year veteran
scored 12 points after totaling just four in the first four games.
He made two key free throws with 10.4 seconds left, and the Jazz
barely hung on.
	   Jordan finished with 28 points but shot only 1-for-7 in the
fourth. Kukoc was the player who carried Chicago offensively,
scoring 30 points on 11-for-13 shooting to help make up for a
dismal offensive night by Scottie Pippen, who went 2-for-16.
	   Utah's defense was at its best in the closing seconds. After
Kukoc drained another 3 to bring Chicago within 82-81 with 5.5
seconds left, Stockton ran around before whipping a long pass to
Hornacek. Pippen had to dive to foul Hornacek, picking up his sixth
foul.
	   Hornacek missed his first free throw but made the second. After
three timeouts, the Jazz planted 7-foot-2 (2.18-meter) Greg
Ostertag in front of the 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Ron Harper. Harper
inbounded the ball to Steve Kerr, but it bounced out-of-bounds off
a Utah hand.
	   Chicago got one more chance, but Jordan's long jumper wasn't
even close.
	   Jordan was clearly flustered all game by Utah's aggressiveness.
After just seven fouls over the first four games, he had two with
5:02 left in the first quarter of Game 5. And with Greg Foster and
Russell in his face, he bobbled the ball, dropping it off his foot
and giving it to the Jazz.
	   He didn't score until there was 3:20 left in the first quarter,
and then he missed the first of two free throws. He finally scored
a field goal on a fadeaway jumper with 12 seconds left in the first
quarter.
	   While the Jazz were flustering the Bulls, they had free rein on
Chicago's homecourt. After three games of being utterly confused by
Chicago's shifts and switches, Utah finally figured it out, running
the fast break and getting easy transition baskets.
	   And Longley's inability to guard Malone finally caught up with
him. Malone, who had yet to have a breakout game in the finals,
served notice from the start, hitting a jumper 30 seconds into the
game while Longley stood back helpless.
	   He went anywhere he wanted, knocking down jumpers from outside
and driving inside at will, backing Longley up and out. Not even
Dennis Rodman, who's been effective against Malone this year, could
help. Malone scored 39 points, just five off his career playoff
high.
	   The Bulls were clearly frustrated. Rodman picked up his fourth
foul before the third quarter was over, and when Longley subbed for
him, he quickly got whistled for his fourth, too.
	   Even Jordan got into foul trouble, getting called for four.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Not so fast, Chicago Bulls.
	   Michael Jordan missed a last-second 3-pointer that would have
won the championship, and Karl Malone made sure the Bulls would
have to earn their sixth championship away from home.
	   Malone had the kind of dominant, breakout game that had been
absent this series, scoring 39 points as the Utah Jazz won 83-81
and sent the NBA Finals back to Salt Lake City on Friday night.
	   Malone shot 17-for-27 from the field and scored 17 points in the
third when the Jazz took the lead for good, but the Bulls didn't go
quietly or without high drama.
	   Toni Kukoc flung up a knuckleball 3-pointer that swished through
with 5.5 seconds left, making it 82-81, and Jeff Hornacek missed
one of two foul shots with 1.1 seconds left.
	   The Bulls had one last shot, inbounding from midcourt, and the
tension only increased as each team called a timeout as the last
play was almost set to be run.
	   John Stockton deflected the first pass out of bounds, and the
referees reset the clock from 0.3 to 0.8. Jordan then flung up a
3-pointer that hung high in the air but ended up as an airball.
	   The United Center crowd left in stunned silence, and the Jazz
suddenly had new life.
	   Still, they'll need two more wins to prevent the Bulls from
winning their sixth championship this decade.
	   Malone found the touch on his outside shot, and the Jazz found
another offensive option in Antoine Carr. The 13-year veteran
scored 12 points after totaling just four in the first four games.
He made two key free throws with 10.4 seconds left, and the Jazz
barely hung on.
	   Jordan finished with 28 points but shot only 1-for-7 in the
fourth. Kukoc was the player who carried Chicago offensively,
scoring 30 points on 11-for-13 shooting to help make up for a
dismal offensive night by Scottie Pippen, who went 2-for-16.
	   The Bulls dropped to 5-4 in title clinching games.
	   Malone fed Carr for a jumper that made it 74-69 with 4:45 left,
and Pippen was then called for an offensive foul. Malone backed in
on Dennis Rodman and scored on an underhanded finger-roll _ perhaps
his prettiest bucket of the night _ for a 76-69 lead.
	   But the Bulls weren't done.
	   Jordan's two free throws made it 76-71, and the Bulls had three
chances to get even closer. But Jordan missed two jumpers, Pippen
missed an easy tip and Carr hit a 17-footer to make it 78-71.
	   Kukoc's third 3-pointer of the night came with 1:48 left, making
it a four-point game, and Jordan's two free throws made it 78-76
with 1:13 left.
	   Malone made his final basket on a corner jumper, restoring the
four-point lead. Kukoc was fouled by Malone from 3-point range with
18.9 seconds left, and he made the first two and missed the third.
	   The Bulls scrambled to foul Carr with 10.4 seconds left, and the
journeyman center stepped to the line for the biggest shots of his
life.
	   Good, and good.
	   They two shots made it 82-78, and it ended up being just enough.
	   The series resumes with Game 6 on Sunday night. Game 7 would be
next Wednesday night if necessary.
	   With Malone again scoring almost at will against Luc Longley, it
took until Rodman's first appearance of the night for the Bulls to
catch up. Rodman entered after the Bulls fell behind 14-8, but they
quickly caught up, with Kukoc as their only offensive weapon.
	   His 3-pointer with 2:16 left in the first tied the game at
14-all and gave the Croatian forward _ one of only four Bulls
signed for next season _ 13 of Chicago's first 14 points.
	   Jordan didn't make his first basket until 12.3 seconds remained
in the first, but it gave Chicago an 18-16 lead entering the
second.
	   Utah had seven turnovers in the first 6 1/2 minutes of the
second quarter, and Chicago had four. Both teams were having
trouble scoring, but Jordan hit three straight shots _ the last two
on tough fallaway jumpers from the baseline.
	   Malone drew a technical foul for shoving Rodman after a
breakaway dunk that tied the game at 26-all. Jordan made the foul
shot, then followed with a three-point play. Two foul shots by
Pippen made it 32-26 and the Bulls went into the locker at halftime
ahead 36-30. Kukoc had 17 points, Malone 14 and Jordan 13.
	   The Jazz made their big run early in the third as they
continually gave the ball to Malone and let their best player do
what he could.
	   Malone finally responded, too, with 17 points in the quarter on
6-for-9 shooting in what was easily his finest 12 minutes of the
series.
	   He had 31 points by the time the third quarter ended with Utah
ahead 59-55, and the question was whether he could sustain it in
the fourth. After all, he had scored only one basket in the fourth
quarters of Games 2, 3 and 4 combined.
	   Malone hit his first shot of the fourth, and the Jazz went ahead
by eight points three minutes in when Bryon Russell missed a
breakaway dunk but the ball miraculously spun off the backboard and
in.
	   The Bulls never completely caught them.

Hanson's forces may deadlock election outcome or could lift Labor to power statewide results may not be known for days. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Polls close at 0800 GMT Saturday. But the election is so close
<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ As election day dawned Saturday in
Queensland, the headline in the state's biggest newspaper
proclaimed: ``Too Close To Call!''
	   The right-wing populism of Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party,
with its anti-Aboriginal and anti-Asian overtones, has attracted
more than 20 percent of the state's voters, polls say, possibly
depriving either mainstream party of a governing majority in
Parliament.
	   At the national level, Prime Minister John Howard is watching
the Queensland state outcome closely. Losing Queensland would be a
terrible omen for his conservatives; he has to call a federal
election by March 1999.
	   In Queensland, state Premier Rob Borbidge's governing
conservative coalition of urban and rural parties now holds 44 of
the 89 seats in Parliament, as does the opposition Labor Party.
	   Borbidge has governed only with the alliance of a single
independent conservative member of Parliament.
	   That equation is bound to change after Saturday _ Hanson's One
Nation Party has cut deeply into Borbidge's conservative
constituency, splitting the right-of-center vote.
	   All polls and pundits predict Borbidge will lose the election.
The question is whether Labor will win enough seats _ at least 45 _
to form a government, or if Queensland will have a minority
government, with One Nation's new legislators holding the balance
of power.
	   Various polls indicate One Nation could win as few as four, or
as many as 10 of the 89 state seats. Hanson herself is a member of
the national Parliament, and is not up for re-election in this
state race.
	   The Brisbane Courier-Mail played it safe Saturday, proclaiming
the race ``too close to call.''
	   The Australian national newspaper ran a final poll result
Saturday saying Labor holds a clear lead.
	   The poll, conducted for the Weekend Australian, showed the main
threat to a Labor win was possible losses to One Nation in country
seats offsetting likely gains in Brisbane.
	   ``One Nation has made a staggering debut for a party formed only
last year,'' the newspaper said.
	   ``Newspoll showed its support at only 5 percent in Queensland in
the early months of this year.
	   ``It had tripled to 15 percent two weeks ago and has risen
further to 18.5 percent in this week's Newspoll.''
	   Outside Brisbane, One Nation was capturing 22.5 per cent of the
vote, the poll said.
	   The survey was carried out on Wednesday and Thursday among a
sample of 1,619 voters. The margin of error was not given but it
usually ranges from 1-3 percentage points in a sample this size,
depending on how many people respond to a question.

Aussies fearful of change find a champion in Pauline Hanson 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Australia-Queensland Election
By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GYMPIE, Australia (AP) _ As people strolled into polling booths
at the Gympie Civic Center on Saturday, members of the Salvation
Army sat at an outdoor table selling cakes and cookies to raise
funds for charity work.
	   At the door, campaign workers for Pauline Hanson's One Nation
Party made last-minute appeals to voters to back her anti-gun
control, anti-Aboriginal welfare, anti-Asian immigration policies.
	   The scene summed up the essential contradiction of Gympie, a
community of 24,000 that has emerged as a One Nation stronghold;
this sunny, clean country town has a deep fear that its jobs and
future are slipping away.
	   ``We're just the average country electorate,'' said Kevin
Vincent, a retired teacher helping staff the Salvation Army table
in this town, 140 kilometers (87 miles) north of Brisbane and some
35 kilometers (22 miles) from the Pacific coast.
	   Across the sprawling northeast Australian state of Queensland,
communities like this are deciding whether One Nation will become a
major presence in the next state Parliament, with polls suggesting
it could win as many as eight of the 89 seats contested.
	   Both the major parties _ the governing conservative coalition
and the opposition labor Party _ accept that the economy of
Queensland, and for that matter, Australia, is largely out of their
hands.
	   ``A lot of people around here can't understand how Asian
economic conditions affect us down here,'' Vincent said.
	   Hanson doesn't accept that the economy is beyond the control of
Queenslanders. She wants to set up a state bank to promote local
projects, and restore tariffs and other trade barriers in a bid to
preserve industries and jobs.
	   In Gympie, where the unemployment rate is 15.1 percent overall
and 33 percent for youths, it's a powerful message. Mainstream
politicians and economists say it would backfire, costing
Queensland investment and trade.
	   ``We're very disillusioned with the major parties,'' said Jean
Bentlin, a One Nation partisan who runs a shop selling ``100
percent Australian'' crafts and products, including stuffed
kangaroos and ``Clean up with Pauline'' detergent.
	   Hanson herself is an independent member of the national House of
Representatives from Queensland, and is not running in this state
race. Her One Nation Party, though, is fielding candidates in 47 of
the state's 89 districts, mostly in rural areas.
	   Aside from the job losses, Gympie is a town in transition as
bankrupt farmers and burned-out city dwellers move in, forming a
new underclass of the ``urban'' rural poor. Fully 30 percent of
Gympie's residents have arrived since the last election in 1995.
	   Where there is poverty and frustration, there is crime.
	   Gympie is Queensland's marijuana-growing capital and a string of
lurid murders and drug busts earned this community the label ``Hell
Town.''
	   Hanson also articulates the resentment many country people feel
for welfare programs for Aborigines, and Asian immigration. There
is a highly visible minority of Chinese, Vietnamese and other
Asians in the state.
	   ``Pauline Hanson has tapped into what a lot of Australians
believe, but are afraid to say. If we say `Billy Blackfella is no
good,' we're afraid we can be carted off to jail'' under laws
banning racial slander, Vincent said.
	   Though Vincent plans to vote Labor and doesn't support Hanson,
he echoes what many Australians say about Hanson: ``She has the
guts to say these things.''
	   Hanson also has two core constituencies: anti-gun control
forces, and the far-right wing, including conspiracy theorists, who
had no effective national party to champion them until One Nation's
launch last year.
	   To placate gun owners, Hanson's state candidates are pushing for
the repeal of laws banning ownership of assault rifles,
semiautomatic weapons and combat shotguns, and they would guarantee
homeowners the right to shoot intruders.
	   Speaking to the concerns of the right-wing conspiracy theorists
in her ranks, last week Hanson denounced a draft U.N. declaration
on the rights of indigenous peoples as ``collusion of Aboriginal
separatists, the U.N. and the disloyal and self-seeking globalists
in our midst'' to set up taxpayer-funded separate Aboriginal
states, dismembering Australia.
	   Prime Minister John Howard called that speech ``deranged.''
	   Building on those core groups, Hanson has reaped a bumper crop
of disaffected conservative voters who fear crime, joblessness, and
a future beyond their control.
	   Her One Nation Party was drawing 22 percent support statewide on
the eve of the election, and 30 to 40 percent in some rural
districts, according to a poll.
	   Gympie draws its name from a local stinging bush that grew along
the banks of the Mary River, which Aborigines called ``gimpi
gimpi.'' It stung the legs of the gold miners and early settlers,
hobbling them and entering English slang as a synonym for limping,
``being gimpy.''
	   Now Gympie appears likely to elect One Nation candidate Ian
Petersen on Saturday, helping hobble the mainstream conservatives
in Queensland.
	   On the national level, the prime minister is watching the
``average country electorates'' in Gympie and elsewhere to see if
Hanson's popularity will sting him in the federal election he must
call by March 1999.

PHILADELPHIA: RBI single. Cardinals 9, Diamondbacks 4 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   In Phoenix, Mark McGwire hit his 31st home run, a grand slam
that left the St. Louis star 31 shy of breaking Roger Maris'
record.
	   McGwire, who in batting practice became the first player to hit
a ball completely out of the new Bank One Ballpark, connected off
Andy Benes (4-7) in an eight-run third inning.
	   The Cardinals played their 65th game, of which McGwire has
played in 59. Maris had 26 homers in the New York Yankees' first 65
games in 1961.
	   McGwire's 438-foot (134-meter) slam and Royce Clayton's
three-run homer highlighted the big inning that carried the
Cardinals to only their second victory in nine games. Todd
Stottlemyre (7-5) pitched into the ninth inning and won for the
first time in his last three starts. Andy Fox homered for Arizona.
 &UR; Dodgers 2, Rockies 1 &QC; 
	   In Los Angeles, Eric Young homered in the eighth inning as the
Dodgers beat Colorado for Dave Mlicki's first victory with Los
Angeles.
	   Mlicki (2-4), making his second start since the trade that sent
Hideo Nomo to the New York Mets, gave up one run and five hits in
eight innings. Greg McMichael, also part of the trade, got the
final out for his first save.
	   Young, who played with Colorado last season, hit his second
homer of the season off Darryl Kile (5-9), who lost his sixth
straight start despite allowing just five hits and two runs in
eight innings. Raul Mondesi's 15th homer off Kile in the fifth
accounted for the Dodgers' other run.

By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The 3-point shot hung high in the air and crested
50 feet (15 meters) below millions of pieces of confetti ready to
be released from the rafters.
	   Michael Jordan missed the shot at the buzzer Friday night, and
Chicago Bulls missed a chance to wrap up the NBA Finals with their
sixth title before a raucous hometown crowd.
	   Instead, Karl Malone made sure the Bulls would have to try to
win the championship in Salt Lake City as he led the Jazz to an
83-81 victory. He finally played the kind of dominant game that had
been missing, scoring 39 points as Utah closed to 3-2 in the
best-of-7 series, with Game 6 set for Sunday night.
	   ``I tried not to think about all that was said,'' Malone said.
``Everybody had us written off. We needed to win a game _ and we
did.
	   ``If we continue as a team, we have a chance. We won the game as
a team, not as Karl Malone.''
	   Malone shot 17-for-27 from the field and scored 17 points in the
third when the Jazz took the lead for good. But the Bulls didn't go
quietly or without high drama.
	   Toni Kukoc flung up a knuckleball 3-pointer that swished through
with 5.5 seconds left, making it 82-81, and Jeff Hornacek missed
one of two foul shots with 1.1 seconds left.
	   The Bulls had one last shot, inbounding from midcourt, and the
tension only increased as each team called one timeout as the last
play was almost set to be run.
	   John Stockton deflected the first pass out of bounds, and the
referees reset the clock from 0.3 to 0.8. Jordan then flung up a
3-pointer that hung high in the air but came up a foot short of the
rim.
	   ``No one knew what was going to happen, everyone anticipating a
big shot, and that's the beauty of the game _ the unexpected finish
of a game,'' Jordan said.
	   The United Center crowd left in stunned silence, and the Jazz
suddenly had new life. Still, they'll need two more wins to prevent
the Bulls from winning what could be their last Jordan-era
championship.
	   ``They got what they deserved tonight,'' Jordan said. ``Our
heart and desire and determination was there, but our bodies didn't
move like our minds were telling us.
	   ``We've just got to let it go, forget about it _ kind of like
losing by 42 points,'' he said, referring to the Bulls' blowout win
in Game 3.
	   As Malone found the touch on his outside shot, the Jazz found
another offensive option in Antoine Carr. The 36-year-old veteran
scored 12 points after totaling just four in the first four games,
and made two key free throws with 10.4 seconds left.
	   Jordan finished with 28 points but shot only 1-for-7 in the
fourth. Kukoc was the player who carried Chicago offensively,
scoring 30 points on 11-for-13 shooting to help make up for a
dismal shooting night by Scottie Pippen, who went 2-for-16 with 11
rebounds and 11 assists.
	   The Bulls dropped to 5-4 in title clinching games.
	   ``If we want to blame anybody, we should go home, look in the
mirror and say it was a bad day at the office. Hopefully tomorrow
will be a better day at the office,'' Jordan said.
	   Malone fed Carr for a jumper that made it 74-69 with 4:45 left,
and Pippen was then called for an offensive foul. Malone backed in
on Dennis Rodman and scored on an underhanded finger-roll _ perhaps
his prettiest bucket of the night _ for a 76-69 lead.
	   But the Bulls weren't done.
	   Jordan's two free throws made it 76-71, and the Bulls had three
chances to get even closer. But Jordan missed two jumpers, Pippen
missed an easy tip and Carr hit a 17-footer (5-meter shot) to make
it 78-71.
	   Kukoc's third 3-pointer of the night came with 1:48 left, making
it a four-point game, and Jordan's two free throws made it 78-76
with 1:13 left.
	   Malone made his final basket on a corner jumper, restoring the
four-point lead, but fouled Kukoc from 3-point range with 18.9
seconds left. Kukoc made the first two foul shots but missed the
third.
	   The Bulls scrambled to foul Carr with 10.4 seconds left, and the
journeyman center stepped to the line for the biggest shots of his
life.
	   Good, and good.
	   They two shots made it 82-78, and it ended up being just enough.
	   Rodman's 3-pointer with 2:16 left in the first tied the game at
14-all and gave the Croatian forward _ one of only four Bulls
signed for next season _ 13 of Chicago's first 14 points.
	   The Bulls went into the locker room at halftime ahead 36-30.
	   The Jazz made their big run early in the third as they
continually gave the ball to Malone and let their best player do
what he could.
	   Malone finally responded, too, with 17 points in the quarter on
6-for-9 shooting in what was easily his finest 12 minutes of the
series.
	   ``I realize all the stuff that was being said, and I was able to
get away totally from basketball yesterday,'' Malone said. ``We as
a team knew this was do or die.''
	   Malone hit his first shot of the fourth, and the Jazz went ahead
by eight points three minutes in when Bryon Russell missed a
breakaway dunk but the ball miraculously spun off the backboard and
in.
	   The Bulls never completely caught them.

Cyclone victims heading home penniless 
</HEADLINE>
By RAMOLA TALWAR
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Every time Bhim Khabari tries to catch some
sleep, he sees the tidal wave that swallowed up his friends and his
dreams of sending home money.
	   By Saturday, four days after a cyclone battered Gujarat,
officials say 828 people have been killed. Residents say the figure
is in the thousands as many people were swept away into the sea.
	   Khabari, like the hundreds of salt workers in the prosperous
western state, earned a living trapping sea water into shallow farm
fields where it would evaporate. A fierce summer, temperatures
hovering around 48 Celsius (118 Fahrenheit) for weeks, was good for
business.
	   As the cyclone brewed in the Arabian Sea, Khabari and others
were busy scraping salt off the ground. News of the impending
cyclone _ wind speed touching 120 kph (75 mph) _ never reached the
workers, most of them illiterate and too poor to own even a radio.
Contractors greedy to squeeze out more profits kept the workers in
the dark about the cyclone.
	   A 16-foot (5-meter) tidal wave hit the coast Tuesday, sweeping
away many people. It smashed mud-and-thatch huts, blew away
aluminum roofs, uprooted trees and twisted electric transmission
towers. A few lucky people like Khabari clawed their way out of
their submerged houses or managed to stay afloat on the choppy sea.
	   Most of the casualties were salt workers or employees of the
port at Kandla, 530 kilometers (330 miles) northwest of Bombay.
	   ``There is nothing left,'' Khabari said by telephone Saturday
from a relief camp near Kandla. ``I just want to go home. I'm
returning with nothing.'' Khabari is from the southern state of
Andhra Pradesh and like his friends was returning home penniless.
	   The local government reacted slowly, newspapers reported. Relief
was inadequate or slow or just absent. For two days, Khabari waded
through the water to climb trees to pull down bodies of humans and
animals.
	   ``It kept my mind busy,'' he said. ``But then I got fed up ...
In the villages there is no food, no drinking water, no power.
Everyone is leaving.''
	   Each summer, thousands of people head to the salt pans of
Gujarat from across the country, but mostly from Andhra Pradesh or
the northern state of Bihar, both thousands of kilometers (miles)
away.
	   Aid workers and army soldiers cleared tree branches and debris
from the roads, distributed medicines, and helped restore some
power supply and telecommunication links.
	   Relief workers have warned the government that hunger and
poverty could make villagers restive.
	   ``The situation is getting worse,'' said Pratibha Pandya.
``There is no record of the migrant laborers who work on the coast
and reports we get say that more than 2,000 people are dead.''
	   The Gujarat government based its toll on the number of bodies
recovered. Aid workers said thousands of people, mostly migrants,
were working at the salt pans when the cyclone struck, said aid
worker Khimji, who uses only one name.
	   Many of them probably were swept away by the wave. Their bodies
were never found. And there were no relatives to look for them.
	   ``Their families back home will keep waiting for them to
return,'' Khimji said.

Five senior Khmer Rouge leaders defect to government other details, byline

By KER MUNTHIT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) - Five leaders of the withering Khmer
Rouge guerrilla movement have defected to the government, saying
war in their shattered nation has lasted long enough, official
media said late Friday.
	   A broadcast by Cambodian National Television said the defectors
signed a statement pledging to sever their relations with the
guerrillas June 11.
	   The defections leave the once dreaded and powerful Khmer Rouge
with only a handful of veteran leaders including Nuon Chea, Ta Mok
and nominal head Khieu Samphan.
	   Government military officials flew to the northwestern
Thai-Cambodian border town of Pailin to interview the defectors
Saturday.
	   ``Having seen that it is necessary to end the war which has been
prolonged for many years already, we have decided ... to rejoin our
national society,'' the defectors said. The statement said the five
made their decision May 3.
	   The defectors were listed as Mak Ben, the former minister of
economy and trade, Chan Youran, deputy prime minister, In Sopheap,
minister of immigration and two other members of the ruling circle,
Chuon Cheoun and Kor Bun Heng.
	   ``We recognize Cambodia's constitution and the current royal
government of Cambodia,'' their statement said. ``We recognize the
role of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, who is the symbol and
the cool shade of our Cambodian nation.''
	   According to the television announcement the statement was made
in Pailin, the stronghold of another, earlier Khmer Rouge defector,
Ieng Sary.
	   While Ieng Sary pledges his allegiance to the Phnom Penh
government, he has been allowed to maintain a degree of autonomy in
Pailin where he thrives from a lucrative business in logging and
gems.
	   Only several hundred hardline Khmer Rouge guerrillas are
believed left, most of them near the northern Cambodian border with
Thailand.
	   The hardline leaders each have engaged in revolutionary
activities for decades and were involved in the mid-1970s Khmer
Rouge reign of terror when as many as 2 million Cambodians perished
from disease, starvation and mass execution.
	   Ta Mok, dubbed ``The Butcher'' for his record of killings, is
regarded as the real head of the remaining guerrillas although
Khieu Samphan, a French-educated intellectual, is presented as
their chief.
	   Least is known about Nuon Chea, although he was the no. 2 power
holder after Pol Pot during the heyday of the movement.
	   The Phnom Penh government has vowed to put the three before a
tribunal for genocidal crimes. However, in the past it has pardoned
equally guilty Khmer Rouge veterans who laid down their arms.
	   The Khmer Rouge movement began to unravel following the United
Nations-brokered elections in 1993. Thousands of the weary, jungle
fighters responded to a government amnesty while in-fighting also
broke out among the top leadership.
	   The death in April of Pol Pot, who was deposed in one of the
internal feuds, symbolized the end of the Khmer Rouge, who gained
enough strength in the countryside to march into Phnom Penh in 1975
after a five-year war.

Malaysia's PM woos long-term investors, rebuffs speculators 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said Saturday his government welcomes long-term investors
from overseas but warned foreign speculators to keep their money
elsewhere.
	   Mahathir likely was drumming up support for a key speech to be
delivered at the governing United Malays National Organization
party assembly next week, where many people expect him to chart the
future of their nation's wobbly economy.
	   Over the past decade, international companies such as Siemens,
Intel and Seagate have invested billions of dollars building
factories in the country and provided jobs for thousands of
Malaysians.
	   He described these investors as ``permanent contributors'' to
Malaysia's industrial development.
	   ``We always treat them as special guests of the country,''
Mahathir told a crowd of 2,000 supporters in the central state of
Pahang. ``Their contribution towards Malaysia's industrial
development is very valuable.''
	   To the cheers of supporters, Mahathir told foreign speculators
to keep their funds away from the nation's stock exchange and
financial markets.
	   ``(As for their) hot money, keep it hot elsewhere,'' he told the
crowd who came from nearby villages. ``I want a healthy economic
recovery. We do not want a recovery that is impermanent.''
	   Since the Asian economic crisis pummeled Malaysia's economy and
caused the value of its currency to plummet, Mahathir has singled
out foreign speculators for ruining Southeast Asia's currency
markets.
	   The 72-year old prime minister reiterated that foreign investors
must realize that their investments in the country must benefit not
only them but the host country as well.
	   ``If they come to take over banks and financial institutions
because they are efficient, that is good, but that will not be
received very well by the local people,'' he said.

Reinsdorf says he wants Bulls back if they win AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Chicago Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf insisted
again Friday night he's in no hurry to break the team apart _ if it
wins another championship.
	   ``I certainly hope that if we win that this is not the end of
this run,'' Reinsdorf said in an NBC interview.
	   ``Of course it's not totally up to me. Michael (Jordan) and
Scottie (Pippen) and seven other players are free agents and they
have their own decisions to make,'' Reinsdorf said.
	   ``But I don't want to be the person who breaks up the Chicago
Bulls as long as they are winning championships.''
	   Reinsdorf said he plans to talk with Pippen, who said earlier
this week he wasn't coming back. But he can't do it until after
July 1 and by that time a lockout could be in place.
	   Reinsdorf said there are no stipulations for Jordan's return, as
far as he knows. Jordan said earlier he only wanted to play for
coach Phil Jackson but has softened that stance.
	   ``What Michael has said to me is that he wants to take time over
the summer to decide what he wants to do,'' Reinsdorf said.
	   ``Obviously Scottie Pippen is very very important to Michael
because he knows Scottie is a perfect complement to him. And I
think if Scottie were not to return that might have an impact on
Michael's decision.''
	   Jackson didn't want to discuss it, especially after the Bulls
were beaten 83-81 by the Jazz.
	   ``I don't think it's time to talk about it right now. It's a
moot point (until) after the championships. There is nothing to be
said.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; NICE HANDS: Jazz coach Jerry Sloan had a simple explanation for
starting Antonie Carr in the second half. His hands.
	   ``No. 1 he was able to catch a basketball,'' Sloan said. ``We
had a tremendously tough time trying to catch the ball when we were
trying to drive to the basket,'' Sloan explained of his 14-year
veteran. Carr scored eight of his 12 points in the final quarter.
	   ``The way they were playing Karl (Malone), we just needed to
have somebody step up,'' Sloan said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; NUMBERS: The Bulls' loss means no home team has swept the
middle three games since the format was adopoted for the 1985
finals. ... Toni Kukoc's 30 points were a playoff high. Karl
Malone's 39 was his highest total ever in the finals. ... The Bulls
had won eight straight home games in the finals until Friday night.
... The city of Chicago sent 8,000 police officers to the street to
control crowds in anticipation of the Bulls winning a sixth NBA
title.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; CUTE? Michael Jordan described the final seconds of Friday
night's loss in a strange way: It was cute.
	   ``I had some funny thoughts actually,'' Jordan said after his
last-second 3-pointer was short as the Bulls fell 83-81 to the
Jazz.
	   ``No one knew what was going to happen. Everybody thought I
would make a shot. The unexpected finish of an NBA game. I thought
that was cute just thinking about it,'' said Jordan, known
throughout his career for hitting game-winning shots.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; GOOD BUDDIES: Comrades, teammates and practice adversaries who
share five NBA titles together. Soon, maybe a sixth.
	   Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen could go their separate ways
after the NBA Finals, bringing to an end one of the great tandems
in league history.
	   ``They are close friends and they love this game,'' guard Ron
Harper said. ``When they go into practice, they talk so much trash
it's embarrassing and they go at each other all the time, too.
	   ``They are good for this team and good for each other, too.''
	   Has Pippen been as important against the Utah Jazz as Jordan?
Jordan's done more scoring, as usual. But Pippen's defense, as it
was against Indiana in the Eastern Conference finals, has been a
key for the Bulls.
	   ``I just see us as a basketball team. We don't talk about who
can outdo who,'' Harper said. ``We just go out and play as a
basketball team. They are very close friends and they don't care
(who's been most valuable.)''
	   Harper said he doesn't expect Pippen to return to the Bulls. He
also thinks Jordan can name his price to come back.
	   ``Michael will make as much money as he wants in this game if he
chooses to play this game,'' Harper said. ``I don't know for what
team wants to pay for it.''
	   Bulls coach Phil Jackson said he was watching the Bulls' 1993
finals against Phoenix on TV recently and was amazed to see what a
difference five years can make, even with Pippen and Jordan.
	   ``Just how athletic they were at one time,'' Jackson said.
``They are still great athletes but much has been diminished by
injuries and age. Scottie is still so terrific in his speed and
anticipation. He's always there. He's always harassing.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; FOR STOCK AND KARL: To make their Hall of Fame careers
complete, Utah stars Karl Malone and John Stockton want a
championship ring. No surprise there.
	   But their teammates want one for them just as badly.
	   ``It would be a shame for them not to take a ring into the Hall
of Fame with them,'' Antoine Carr said. ``Because they really
deserve rings.''
	   Carr did his part Friday night, scoring 12 points in the Jazz
victory that cut the Bulls' lead to 3-2.
	   Adam Keefe put it this way: ``Nothing is free. You don't get the
ring because you're a nice guy or a good member of the community or
a great player.
	   ``The Hall of Fame is full of great players who never won an NBA
ring. So they know that and they don't expect to be given rings.
They aren't owed rings by anybody. They know the only way they're
going to get one is to go out and take it.''

PHILADELPHIA: other run. Padres 10, Giants 3 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   In San Diego, Ruben Rivera's three-run homer capped a seven-run
eighth inning for the Giants in an NL West showdown in front of
60,789, the biggest baseball crowd ever in the city.
	   A postgame fireworks show, coupled with the Padres selling seats
they normally don't sell in expanded Qualcomm Stadium, also
accounted for the crowd, the largest in the majors this season.
	   Carlos Hernandez also homered for the Padres, who broke a
first-place tie with San Francisco. Barry Bonds and Rey Sanchez
homered for the Giants.
	   Dan Miceli (6-2) pitched two-thirds of an inning for the
victory. Steve Reed (2-1) took the loss.

Bangladesh's first off-shore gas field starts production 
</HEADLINE>
By FARID HOSSAIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladesh's first off-shore field, a
joint venture of three foreign companies, has begun pumping natural
gas into the domestic market, one of the companies announced
Saturday.
	   A flow of 20 million cubic feet (570,000 cubic meters) of gas
reached the country's national gas supply grid from Sangu-1 field
in the Bay of Bengal on the first day of commercial production
Friday, according to a statement issued by Cairn Energy PLC, a
Scottish company that prospected the reserve.
	   The daily supply to the grid outside southeastern port city of
Chittagong is expected to rise and remain at nearly 160 million
cubic feet (4.5 million cubic meters) during next six to nine
months, the company's Dhaka office said.
	   The increased supply will cut by more than half the country's
current daily deficit of natural gas production.
	   Located 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Chittagong the
field has a proven reserve of 850 billion cubic feet (24.1 billion
cubic meters) gas.
	   Cairn Energy holds 55.25 percent of the stake in the dlrs
260-million project, one of the largest foreign investments in
Bangladesh.
	   Halliburton, based in Houston, Texas, owns 25 percent for laying
the pipe and Shell, a UK-Dutch oil multinational that built the gas
processing plant, holds the rest.
	   The project has been completed in less than 15 months, a record
time for such venture, company officials said.
	   Under the production sharing agreement the gas will be sold to
Petrobangla, Bangladesh's state-run energy company.
	   Petrobangla will then sell the gas to country's power stations
and fertilizer factories.
	   The additional supply will ease the country's demand for natural
gas to generate electricity.
	   Almost all the electricity plants in Bangladesh are gas-based.
	   Bangladesh currently generates nearly 1,700 megawatts of
electricity a day, leaving a deficit of 400 to 500 megawatts.
	   Bangladesh, the world's largest delta, has proven reserve of 13
trillion cubic feet (0.4 trillion cubic meters) of gas found in its
20 gas fields.
	   But few resources have so far been developed because of a lack
of investment and technology.

Chief U.N. weapons inspector opens talks with Iraqi officials 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler
began talks with top Iraqi officials Saturday on steps that Baghdad
must take to satisfy arms monitors.
	   Butler arrived in Baghdad on Thursday accompanied by 18 U.N.
arms experts who were carrying evidence to back the U.N. position
that Iraq is still concealing key information on its banned weapons
programs.
	   ``I am feeling positive about it,'' Butler said as he left his
Baghdad hotel for talks with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   Iraq has insisted that it has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction and has repeatedly lashed out at Butler, calling him a
``mad dog.''
	   Baghdad says it has no more information to give Butler and says
his demands are politically motivated.
	   The dispute between Iraq and the U.N. inspectors has the
potential to provoke a crisis similar to that earlier this year,
when the United States and Britain threatened air strikes against
Iraq if Baghdad refused to open its presidential sites to U.N.
inspections. War was averted only when Iraq agreed to open the
palaces as part of a deal brokered by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan.

South Korea lifts investment restriction on North Korea 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ In a policy shift aimed at luring
North Korea towards peace, South Korean businesses will be allowed
to freely ship industrial facilities to the communist state,
officials said Saturday.
	   A severe financial crisis has idled many plants in South Korea.
And the new policy was expected to entice businesses to relocate
their extra gear to the labor-cheap North.
	   Until now, South Korean companies had to get government
permission when they sent machinery and other production facilities
worth more than dlrs 1 million to the North.
	   ``The government abolishes that restriction, effective next
Wednesday, to boost economic exchanges with the North,'' the
Ministry of National Unification said in a statement.
	   In March, the government of President Kim Dae-jung announced it
will lift virtually all restrictions on investment in North Korea
under its new of strategy of engaging the North, rather than
isolating it.
	   Saturday's move was the first policy follow-up on that
announcement.
	   It also comes in tandem with the planned visit to the North next
week by a South Korean tycoon.
	   Chung Ju-yung, owner of the giant Hyundai group, will drive 500
cows into North Korea Tuesday across the Demilitarized Zone that
separates the two Koreas.
	   The cows are part of a gift Chung has promised to give North
Korea in return for his visit aimed at visiting his native hometown
in the North and looking into business opportunities there.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. Their border is sealed, with nearly 2
million troops deployed on both sides.
	   The past South Korean governments had permitted only piecemeal
investment in the North. Businessmen have had to go through lengthy
government red tape simply to get a permission to discuss a deal in
the North. Such negotiations have often been suspended at the
slightest sign of political tension.
	   Seoul also is prodding the United States to follow suit and ease
its economic sanctions against North Korea.

New Zealand 80 for three at lunch 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Chasing a target of 296, New Zealand
was 80 for three wickets at lunch on the fourth day of the third
and final cricket test against Sri Lanka in Colombo on Saturday.
	   Resuming from an overnight 10 for no loss, New Zealand appeared
to be cruising comfortably until off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan
was brought into the attack.
	   At 44, New Zealand's highest opening stand in the low scoring
series, Muralitharan got a ball to move down the leg side away from
Bryan Young and had him stumped by Romesh Kaluwitharana for 24.
	   Skipper Stephen Fleming followed a few balls later, trapped
leg-before-wicket by Kumar Dharmasena for 3. He appeared surprised
by umpire Peter Manuel's decision, having set off for a run.
	   Muralitharan then took a diving return catch to his left to
dismiss Craig Spearman for a painstaking 22 made in 109 minutes.

Revisionist Japanese academics contest best seller `Rape of Nanking' 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS pvs, adding quotes from author.
By JOJI SAKURAI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Conservative Japanese academics have tried to
counter the accusations in the best-selling ``The Rape of
Nanking,'' calling the book's account of Japanese atrocities in
China in the 1930s misleading, poorly researched and exaggerated.
	   ``The Rape of Nanking,'' by Iris Chang, is a vivid account of
what historians have widely characterized as the murder and the
rape of thousands of civilians by Japanese soldiers in the city now
known as Nanjing.
	   A group of academics accused Chang on Friday of inflating the
magnitude of the killing, basing her book on unreliable sources and
using false captions on the photographs she uses as evidence. Chang
defended her account Friday, and said the revisionists' denials
ultimately only only hurt Japan.
	   Accounts of the December 1937-January 1938 massacre _ part of
Japan's conquest of China _ are a favorite target of Japanese
revisionists, who claim critics have stretched tales of Japanese
brutality as means of putting political pressure on Japan and
winning compensation.
	   ``We don't deny civilians were killed,'' said Akira Nakamura, a
history professor at Dokkyo University. ``But it is doubtful what
happened at Nanjing can be called a `holocaust' or a `massacre.'''
	   The scholars told reporters it was impossible for Japanese
troops to have killed 300,000 civilians in Nanjing _ as claimed by
Chang and the Chinese _ because the civilian population in the city
at the time was only 200,000, not the 600,000 Chang claims.
	   But in a phone interview Friday, Chang cited population studies
of Nanjing by the Chinese historian Sun Zhaiwei, who found that the
city had about 1 million people prior to the Japanese invasion.
Several hundred thousand later fled, leaving between 600,000 and
700,000.
	   In their criticism of Chang's book, the Japanese historians also
blamed some of the killings on the Chinese themselves. For example,
they said Chinese soldiers disguised themselves as townsfolk,
making it hard for Japanese forces to distinguish between civilians
and the Chinese military.
	   In response, Chang said such actions by Chinese soldiers were
hardly license for the Japanese soliders to kill people at will.
	   ``To commit widespread massacres of civilians because there are
some soldiers hiding among them is a clear violation of human
rights laws and established laws of war,'' she said by phone from
Lake Placid, New York.
	   Nobutaka Fujioka, a Tokyo University professor, took aim at
Chang's use of photographs, saying she had misled readers by
attaching false captions to shots presented as depictions of the
massacre.
	   He said a photograph of a Japanese tank setting fire to a house
in Nanjing could not have been authentic because the tank was
produced in 1938, after the Nanking massacre occurred.
	   He also claimed that it was impossible to ascertain where and
when a picture of the severed heads of Chinese men had been taken,
making it useless as evidence of Japanese atrocities.
	   Chang denied manipulating any of the photographs or captions,
adding that all the pictures in the book have been in the public
domain for some time _ in books, newspapers, museums.
	   Reinterpretations of Japan's wartime role are gaining popularity
among Japanese.
	   ``Pride,'' a film that depicts convicted war criminal Gen.
Hideki Tojo as a hero, is the top-earning domestic film in Japan so
far this year, according to its producer.
	   The revisionists on Friday attempted to depict the occupation of
Nanjing as largely benign, citing Japanese newspaper photographs
showing Japanese soldiers playing with children and handing out
medicine.
	   As for witness accounts of unbridled murder, looting and rape,
Nakamura said: ``The Chinese people have a tendency to
exaggerate.''

Chief U.N. weapons inspector opens talks with Iraqi officials 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector began
talks Saturday with top Iraqi officials on steps that Baghdad must
take to convince arms monitors that Iraq has destroyed its weapons
of mass destruction.
	   The U.N. inspectors certification is required for the Security
Council to consider lifting sweeping economic sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Butler arrived Thursday in Baghdad accompanied by 18 U.N. arms
experts carrying evidence that Iraq is still concealing key
information on its banned weapons programs, which is the U.N.'s
position.
	   ``I am feeling positive about it,'' Butler said as he left his
Baghdad hotel for talks with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   Iraq has insisted that it has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction and has repeatedly lashed out at Butler, calling him a
``mad dog.''
	   Baghdad says it has no more information to give Butler and says
his demands are politically motivated.
	   The dispute between Iraq and the U.N. inspectors has the
potential to provoke a crisis similar to that earlier this year,
when the United States and Britain threatened air strikes against
Iraq if Baghdad refused to open its presidential sites to U.N.
inspections. War was averted only when Iraq agreed to open the
palaces as part of a deal brokered by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan.
	   Butler has said that he brought to Baghdad a list indicating
what Iraq must do to satisfy the arms inspectors.
	   The list specifies that Iraq must hand over information on
imported long-range missiles, prove that it has scrapped all
biological and chemical warheads and fully account for its
production of VX nerve gas.

Singapore aims to increase high-end manufacturing services 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore unveiled plans on Saturday to shift
its manufacturing base towards more high-end services so it can
successfully compete in the global economy.
	   ``Hundreds of millions of low-cost workers in third world
countries are entering the world market,'' warned George Yeo,
Second Minister for Trade and Industry, while announcing the new
manufacturing blueprint. ``We will no longer be able to compete in
simple assembly line production.''
	   Speaking at the opening of an electronics factory, Yeo, who is
also Minister of Information and the Arts, said Singapore must
focus instead on high-end aspects of the manufacturing process.
	   He said the sector must shift towards more research and
development, testing services, market research and other high-end
manufacturing services instead of traditional mass production.
	   Yeo said the plan, dubbed Industry 21, calls for ``strengthening
Singapore as a hub for regional headquarters and increasing the
number of companies which are engaged in research and development,
manufacturing, marketing and management on a global basis.''
	   Manufacturing in the small, resource-scarce country of 3.1
million people relies primarily on foreign investment, and is
centered on electronics, chemicals and engineering.
	   The sector currently accounts for about 23 percent of the island
republic's gross domestic product and about 23 percent of jobs held
in Singapore, though high-end manufacturing services only account
for about 3 percent of GDP, according to Yeo.
	   Yeo said the government aims to increase the sector's
contribution to 25 percent of GDP by the millennium, and double the
contribution of high-end services to 6 percent of GDP by 2010.
	   The new blueprint calls for diversifying Singapore's
manufacturing industries; attracting more multi-national
corporations and foreign talent to Singapore; promoting innovation
through greater entrepreneurship and research and development; and
preparing the work force through education and training.
	   Yeo made no reference to the short-term difficulties Singapore's
manufacturing base is likely to encounter. Dragged down by other
Asian countries that are slumping towards recession, Singapore's
vulnerable economy is bracing itself for an extended period of
reduced growth.

World Cup, subway strike could leave London empty AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The captains of London industry aren't even giving
their workers the benefit of the doubt. They've already dubbed it
``Idle Monday.''
	   England plays in its first 1998 World Cup soccer match, against
Tunisia, on Monday, and anybody who wants to stay home and watch
the game on television might not even need to phone in sick.
	   Unions at the London Underground subway system have conveniently
called a strike, giving employees in Europe's financial capital a
ready-made alibi for not showing up.
	   World Cup fever always keeps some soccer fans off the job, as
Brazilian automakers showed last week by bringing production to a
halt at a Volkswagen factory during their team's 2-1 win over
Scotland in the first match of the games in France.
	   But the rare combination of soccer and strike has the London
Chamber of Commerce and Industry warning of a ``double whammy''
expected to cost its businesses 35 million pounds (dlrs 57 million)
Monday.
	   U.S. sports fans have never really gotten an appetite for
soccer, called ``football'' by everybody else in the world, but it
will be hard to pry fans away from their television screens in
England and many other contending countries _ jobs or no jobs.
	   As if all the soccer balls and kickoff times posted on signs
outside London's pubs aren't temptation enough, the nation's
biggest-circulation newspaper, The Sun, fueled the fire Friday with
a huge Page One headline saying everybody in England should have
the day off.
	   ``Why not?'' asked Michael O'Sullivan, a building maintenance
supervisor in central London. ``Other countries do it.''
	   O'Sullivan plans to show up at work Monday morning, then operate
under the assumption that his building will remain standing for a
couple of hours as he slips away to the nearest pub to watch the
match.
	   ``It only happens once every four years,'' O'Sullivan said.
	   But Chamber of Commerce chief executive Simon Sperryn reacted
with outrage at The Sun's suggestion. Business leaders fear that if
England's team gets on a winning streak, the financial losses from
absenteeism will accumulate.
	   ``It would be ridiculous to give England fans time off every
time we play,'' Sperryn said. ``It is also unfair to thousands of
people from other nationalities who work in London. If we did it
for English fans, why not Scots, French, Spanish or Jamaican
football fans?''
	   Nearly a third of British men but just 8 percent of British
women plan to take time off work over the next few weeks to watch
the soccer, according to a survey commissioned by the Institute of
Personnel and Development, a trade group.
	   Sixty-one percent of the fans will take paid vacation time,
while 24 percent will take comp time and 16 percent will take
unpaid leave. Just 3 percent admitted they will ``take a
`sickie.'''
	   The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 to 4
percentage points, depending on the question.
	   Robin Chandler, a customer services manager at a London
information business, called the idea of people staying home to
watch soccer ridiculous.
	   ``The country can't grind to a halt,'' Chandler said. ``I shall
be here. If any of my staff aren't here and they haven't booked a
holiday, I'll be demanding an explanation.''
	   John Woolward, a security manager at a Barclays Bank branch on
Fleet Street, said he'll be working and watching all at once.
	   ``I've got a TV at work, so it's not a problem,'' he said.
``It's better than going sick.''
	   Many employers see his point. Some are setting up televisions so
employees can watch the game, figuring that if they get people into
the office, at least some work might get done.
	   ``However, it is simply naive to think that providing a TV in
every workplace is going to be practical,'' Sperryn said. ``For
those who simply cannot get access to the live coverage, it is for
occasions like this that the video recorder was invented.''

	   LAS MARGARITAS, Mexico (AP) _ While his government is stepping
up mililtary pressure on the Zapatista rebels, President Ernesto
Zedillo is repeating his call for peace talks to end the violence
in Chiapas.
	   Just two days after one of the bloodiest clashes in years,
Zedillo visited the southern state Friday_ his fourth trip in
little over a month.
	   ``We want dialogue. We don't want to defeat anyone. The
government will not abandon this position,'' told residents of Las
Margaritas, 85 miles (135 kilometers) southeast of the state
capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez.
	   In Mexico City, the government's chief negotiator, Emilio Rabasa
Gamboa, asked a mediation group of legislators to help the
government set up a direct dialogue with the Zapatistas.
	   But there was no indication the Zapatistas were willing to
resume talks.
	   A statement late Friday issued by Zapatista civilian leaders and
addressed to Zedillo said: ``You are a killer. That's all.''
	   The Zapatista National Liberation Army staged a brief uprising
in 1994 in the name of greater democracy and Indian rights. A
partial accord was signed in 1996, but peace talks later broke
down. The Zapatistas have refused to resume negotiations, claiming
the government has failed to abide by the 1996 agreement.
	   Tensions have been building recently as foreign human rights
observers have been expelled, the main mediator resigned after
enduring heavy government criticism and the government has raided
at least three parallel town councils set up by the Zapatistas.
	   On Wednesday, government forces trying to evict an unofficial
town council sympathetic to the Zapatistas in the municipality of
El Bosque clashed with apparent rebels. Nine people were killed.
	   U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson said
Friday that the government's actions in El Bosque and recent
violence in Chiapas ``are serious violations of the rights of
indigenous people'' and urged the government to resume dialogue.
	   The Mexican foreign secretariat responded in a statement that
the government has stressed the need to resolve the conflict
through dialogue. It said it will send its ambassador to meet with
Robinson to discuss efforts to restore order and fight poverty in
Chiapas.

	   The Zapatista National Liberation Army staged a brief uprising
in 1994 in the name of greater democracy and Indian rights. A
partial accord was signed in 1996, but peace talks later broke
down. The Zapatistas have refused to resume negotiations, claiming
the government has failed to abide by the 1996 agreement.
	   Tensions have been building recently as foreign human rights
observers have been expelled, the main mediator resigned after
enduring heavy government criticism and the government has raided
at least three parallel town councils set up by the Zapatistas.
	   On Wednesday, government forces trying to evict an unofficial
town council sympathetic to the Zapatistas in the municipality of
El Bosque clashed with apparent rebels. Nine people were killed.
	   U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson said
Friday that the government's actions in El Bosque and recent
violence in Chiapas ``are serious violations of the rights of
indigenous people'' and urged the government to resume dialogue.
	   The Mexican foreign secretariat responded in a statement that
the government has stressed the need to resolve the conflict
through dialogue. It said it will send its ambassador to meet with
Robinson to discuss efforts to restore order and fight poverty in
Chiapas.

Indonesian president says economy could be fixed in one or two years

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's President B.J. Habibie
predicted Saturday that his nation's battered economy could recover
from its deepest crisis in decades within one to two years.
	   But he warned that the goal would be reached only if all
Indonesians worked for sweeping reform.
	   ``I am not a prophet,'' he said in an interview with the
Associated Press when asked how long it would take to fix the
crisis.
	   ``If it depended on me I would want do it immediately,'' he
said. ``To be fair, if we could come out of this crisis, let's say
with the help of everybody, in one to two years.''
	   Habibie said his country's economic problems demanded
``concentrated and concerted action.''
	   He likened the economy to an orchestra. If instruments are out
of sync, a piece by Beethoven would sound like ``strange music.''
	   Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, has been hit
hardest by Asia's financial meltdown.
	   The rupiah has lost more that 80 percent of its value against
the U.S. dollar since July 1997. Inflation is running at more than
50 percent and is rising along with mass employment.
	   The banking sector is in a shambles and many companies are
technically insolvent.
	   The situation has been made worse by weeks of political turmoil,
protests and riots, which climaxed when longtime autocratic
President Suharto stepped down last month after 32 years in power.
	   The uncertainty derailed an dlrs 43 billion bailout by the
International Monetary Fund, which is currently examining how to
restart the rescue plan.
	   Habibie said foreign investors would return if the corruption
and collusion that characterized past was replaced with
transparency in government and business, along with ``credibility
based on law.''
	   He said he planned to enact laws that would guarantee the
ability of the Bank Indonesia, the central bank, to set monetary
policy independent from government influence.
	   The German-educated head of state, said his model for Bank
Indonesia would be the Bundesbank, widely regarded as the world's
most independent central bank.
	   In the meantime his ``highest priority'' would be to ensure that
millions of poor Indonesia could afford basic needs such as rice,
other foods and basic school education for their children.
	   Many fear that economic hardship endured by the poor could spark
another wave of civil unrest.

Eds: Updates with polls closed; quotes from Hanson, Borbidge and
With BC-Australia-Hanson's Heartland
<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ As election day dawned Saturday in
Queensland, the headline in the state's biggest newspaper
proclaimed: ``Too Close To Call!''
	   The right-wing populism of Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party,
with its anti-Aboriginal and anti-Asian overtones, has attracted
more than 20 percent of the state's 2 million voters, polls say,
possibly depriving either mainstream party of a governing majority
in Parliament.
	   At the national level, Prime Minister John Howard is watching
the Queensland state outcome closely. Losing Queensland would be a
terrible omen for his conservatives; he has to call a federal
election by March 1999.
	   If Hanson's forces can deadlock Queensland's Parliament and hold
the balance of power there, they might be able to pull off a
similar victory in a federal election, holding the swing votes in
the nation's Senate and blocking legislation that they disagree
with.
	   Warning Howard of the battle to come, Hanson said Saturday: ``I
don't think it's hit them yet; I don't think they have a clue.''
	   In Queensland, state Premier Rob Borbidge's governing
conservative coalition of urban and rural parties now holds 44 of
the 89 seats in state Parliament, as does the opposition Labor
Party.
	   Borbidge has governed only with the alliance of a single
independent conservative member of Parliament.
	   That equation is bound to change after Saturday _ Hanson's One
Nation Party has cut deeply into Borbidge's conservative
constituency, splitting the right-of-center vote.
	   ``There seems to be a substantial One Nation vote across the
state _ across the state,'' Borbidge said after the polls closed
Saturday evening.
	   All polls and pundits predict Borbidge will lose the election.
The question is whether Labor will win enough seats _ at least 45 _
to form a government, or if Queensland will have a minority
government, with One Nation's new legislators holding the balance
of power.
	   ``It will be historic in terms of what's happened with One
Nation,'' Labor Party opposition leader Peter Beattie said.
	   Various polls indicate One Nation could win between four to ten
of the 89 state seats. Hanson herself is a member of the national
Parliament, and is not up for re-election in this state race.
	   The Brisbane Courier-Mail played it safe Saturday, proclaiming
the race ``too close to call.''
	   The Australian national newspaper ran a final poll result
Saturday saying Labor holds a clear lead.
	   The poll, conducted for the Weekend Australian, showed the main
threat to a Labor win was possible losses to One Nation in country
seats offsetting its likely gains in Brisbane.
	   ``One Nation has made a staggering debut for a party formed only
last year,'' the newspaper said.
	   ``Newspoll showed its support at only 5 percent in Queensland in
the early months of this year,'' it said.
	   Outside Brisbane, One Nation was capturing 22.5 per cent of the
vote, the poll said.
	   The survey was carried out on Wednesday and Thursday among a
sample of 1,619 voters. The margin of error was not given but it
usually ranges from 1-3 percent in a sample this size, depending on
how many people respond.

Dead passenger left for hours in his seat aboard plane 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A Filipino passenger who died of an apparent
heart attack was left in his seat for three hours aboard an
Emirates Airline flight to Hong Kong from Dubai.
	   Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported Friday that
passengers complained they were not moved from nearby seats even
after an onboard medic declared the victim, who was in his 60s,
``unconscious and most probably dead.''
	   The passenger was certified dead after the Boeing 777 touched
down at Hong Kong airport following a 10-hour flight on June 5, the
newspaper said.
	   It quoted Nelson Tam, the airline's station manager in Hong
Kong, as saying that ``in cases like this we would leave the person
in the seat. We need an authorized doctor to certify him dead.''
	   The victim, whose name was not given, was traveling with his
daughter. The plane was enroute to Manila after its stop in Hong
Kong.
	   An airline spokesman had no comment on Saturday, saying the case
was being handled by Emirates in its headquarters in Dubai.
	   Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways told the Post that its
policy was to leave a corpse seated, place a blanket over it and
move passengers.

World Cup: Underdog Japan has nothing to lose against Argentina 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos
By YURI KAGEYAMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ World Cup neophyte Japan plays powerful
Argentina on Sunday in what looks on paper like a gargantuan
mismatch.
	   Oddsmakers list Argentina as an 11-2 favorite to win the World
Cup, just behind defending champion Brazil at 3-1. Japan is rated
last in the 32-team field, along with Iran, at 500-1 odds.
	   Clearly Japan has nothing to lose when it meets the two-time
World Cup winner in their Group H opener. For Argentina, anything
less than a convincing victory would be a major embarrassment.
Still, the South Americans are talking caution.
	   ``We have to be careful with Japan. We can't take them for
granted because they could surprise us,'' said coach Daniel
Passarella. ``I don't want to give anything away. If the other team
knows the entire line-up, they'll be able to analyze our game
plan.''
	   Argentina's offense is based on the powerful trio of Gabriel
Batistuta, Ariel Ortega and Claudio Lopez, who move the ball around
perfectly for clean shots. They look unstoppable.
	   Batistuta, 29, one of Italian league's top strikers for
Fiorentina and now in his second World Cup, praised the Japanese as
``young and combative.''
	   ``Besides, one should never tally points until they've been
earned,'' he said.
	   Passarella promised his team will be aggressive. ``We'll be
pressing forward,'' he said.
	   Argentina also plays impeccable defense, rarely allowing a goal
in recent games.
	   With some understatement, Japanese head coach Takeshi Okada
conceded, ``We believe their ability is above ours.''
	   ``We will naturally play a more defensive game,'' he said.
	   The Japanese players say they are thrilled just to be able to
test how far they can go against Argentina.
	   ``I've always loved Argentina, back from those days when
Maradona was playing,'' said forward Masayuki Okano, 25, whose
golden goal against Iran clinched Japan's World Cup berth. ``I can
barely wait.''
	   Aiming for a credible performance, Japan has reworked its
defense to include one-on-one marking and extra defense in the
midfield.
	   Because its players lack the physical prowess or dazzling
technique of the Argentines, the Japan must play as a cohesive
team, relying on smart passing and quick switchovers to attack by
midfielders Hidetoshi Nakata and Hiroshi Nanami.
	   ``Everything rests on how we can carry out the systematic play
we have been working on,'' said Japan's captain Masami Ihara.
	   ``I expect them to come on strong from the start,'' said
midfielder Motohiro Yamaguchi. ``But we hope to give them one heck
of a surprise.''

Official says Russian government plans spending cutbacks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government plans to cut public
spending by 42 billion rubles (dlrs 6.8 billion) to ease the
country's financial crisis, Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko
said on Saturday.
	   ``Such rigid measures are necessary to put the country's budget
into a realistic frame and not to continue to accumulate debt,'' he
told regional administrators in Chelyabinsk, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Khristenko, the deputy prime minister in charge of state
finances and macroeconomics, said he did not expect the austerity
measures to pay off overnight. He also said he did not expect full
collection of tax revenues.
	   ``Tax debts remain large and fiscal services must step up their
efforts, as an unbalanced budget was a major factor in the
financial crisis,'' Khristenko said.
	   The Russian economy is stagnating, with little or no growth in
most areas. The government has promised deep cuts in public
spending and improved tax collection to try to improve the
situation.
	   The government announced last week that it will lay off 231,100
employees, or 3.6 percent of its work force, as part of the drive
to reduce the budget deficit.
	   Russia's financial crisis began three weeks ago week with a
steep drop in the stock market that many feared could lead to a run
on the ruble _ followed by price rises and possible social unrest.
	   The Russian stock market has fallen more than 50 percent since
the beginning of the year.

World Cup: Yugoslavia prepares for strikes against Iranian goal 
</HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT ETIENNE, France (AP) _ While NATO threatens air strikes
inside their county, the Yugoslav World Cup team plans another kind
of bombardment: the Iranian goal.
	   Highly favored Yugoslavia, led by star striker Predrag
Mijatovic, meets injury-stricken Iran in their opening Group F game
Sunday.
	   The Yugoslav players seem unaffected by ethnic clashes back home
in Kosovo, and NATO threats of air strikes inside the troubled
Serbian province unless a Serb offensive there against ethnic
Albanian separatists is stopped.
	   ``We are here to play soccer, score goals and forget about
politics and wars,'' said Yugoslav star midfielder Vladimir
Jugovic. ``Our first priority now is to `bombard' the Iranian
goal,'' he added, laughing.
	   The Iranians, playing their first World Cup match in 20 years,
seem to be worried by the prospect of facing one of Europe's
highest-scoring teams, especially because of injuries to some key
Iranian players.
	   Iranian goalkeeper and captain, Ahmad Reza Abedzadeh, said he'll
miss the game at St. Etienne because he still has not recuperated
from a knee operation late last year. His place will be taken by
inexperienced reserve goalie Nima Nakissa.
	   Midfielder Reza Shahroudi was carried off the field with an
injury to his left leg during a practice match Friday. Fellow
midfielder Sattar Hamedani walked off the field with an ice pack on
his leg.
	   Iran is expected to adopt a defensive strategy against the
formidable Yugoslav attackers. But Abedzadeh's absence and possible
injuries that could keep out key players, may make Iran's weak
defense even weaker.
	   But Iran places its hopes on the German-based trio of forwards:
Khodadad Azizi, Karim Bagheri and Ali Daei.
	   ``Since I took over less than a month ago, much of what I have
tried to do is to build up the confidence of the players,'' said
Iranian coach Jalal Talebi.
	   ``The presence of our three strikers who play in the German
Bundesliga has been a tremendous source of confidence for the rest
of the team,'' Talebi said.
	   But there is no shortage of confidence among the Yugoslavs who
next play Germany and the United States in Group F.
	   ``Iranians have three or four good players, but overall we are a
much stronger squad,'' said Yugoslav team captain Dragan Stojkovic.
``We should have no problem beating them.''
	   Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac was trying to curb the extreme
optimism by his players.
	   ``There are no easy matches at the World Cup,'' he said. ``We
have to take Iran very seriously, or we could find ourselves in
deep trouble.''
	   What is worrying Santrac the most is probable the absence of
Dejan Savicevic, Yugoslavia's main midfielder, because of a knee
ligament injury. His place is likely to be taken by the 19-year-old
rising star Dejan Stankovic.
	   Yugoslavia's three central defenders _ Sinisa Mihajlovic, Goran
Djorovic and Miroslav Djukic _ have also suffered recent injuries,
but are likely to play Sunday.

Publisher of liberal Iranian newspaper arrested 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The publisher of a liberal Iranian newspaper
has been arrested after he ignored a court summons, newspapers
reported Saturday.
	   Mohammad Mahdavi Khorrami was arrested Wednesday after he failed
to appear before the court, Qods newspaper quoted a Tehran
judiciary spokesman as saying.
	   He is the publisher of Gozaresh-e-Ruz, a new and popular paper
that stopped publication last week after the Press Supervisory
Board charged it with violating press ethics. The Justice Ministry
is reviewing the complaint against Gozaresh-e-Ruz.
	   The action against the publisher of Gozaresh-e-Ruz, or ``Daily
Report,'' is seen as a setback for the press freedom that has been
allowed by moderate President Mohammad Khatami since he took office
in August.
	   The reforms introduced by Khatami are said to enjoy the support
of most Iranians. But conservative elements in the government,
particularly in the judiciary, are opposed to his policies.
	   The Farsi-language newspaper started publishing only last month
and on its third day it printed a front-page color picture of a
teenage boy with a teenage girl wearing a head scarf. The caption
read: ``Friendship Under Fear.''
	   The Culture Ministry warned it to ``respect the Press Law and
the society's ethical and religious standards,'' the
English-language Iran News said.
	   Iran's constitution forbids the media from ``propagating
destructive and anti-Islamic attitudes.''
	   One of Iran's most popular newspapers, Jameah or ``Society,''
had its license revoked Wednesday after its editor was convicted of
defamation. The paper is continuing publication and has said it
will appeal the sentence.

Five African leaders appointed to seek peace in Eritrea, Ethiopia

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Five African leaders will take the lead
role in seeking peace in the Horn of Africa where Ethiopia and
Eritrea are engaged in a deadly border dispute, the Eritrean
government said Saturday.
	   The men appointed by the Organization of African Unity were
tentatively scheduled to go to the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa on
Thursday, and to the Eritrean capital Asmara on Friday,
presidential spokesman Yemane Gebremeskel said.
	   The team will be led by Burkina President Blaise Campaore in his
role as current OAU chairman. Also participating are presidents
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Hassan Gouled Aptidon of Djibouti,
Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda, and OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed
Salim, Yemane said.
	   Their arrival will represent a new phase in efforts to end the
border conflict that has entered a second month and threatens to
explode into full-scale war, Yemane said.
	   There were no reports of new clashes as of midday Saturday.
Eritrean aircraft bombed the Ethiopian town of Adigrat on Thursday,
killing four people and wounding 30, and forces lashed on two
fronts that day.
	   A weeks-old effort by the United States and Rwanda to end the
conflict will take a backseat role, Yemane said.
	   Rwanda became involved in the peace effort because those who
took control after the ethnic slaughter of 1994, including Vice
President Paul Kagame, the de-facto leader of the tiny central
African country, have long been close to both Ethiopian Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, Yemane
said. All three have led successful rebellions.
	   ``And the United States is interested in peace and development.
They are our close friends, so we thought we could resolve our
problems in a familial sort of way, he said. ``But that didn't
work.''
	   ``Now we think it's best to try under the auspices of the OAU,''
he said.
	   A U.S.-Rwandan peace plan, although accepted by Ethiopia, has
foundered because Eritrea says it lacks essential ingredients for
achieving a permanent solution to the long-simmering territorial
dispute.
	   The U.S.-Rwandan proposal includes a call to Eritrea to return
to positions held prior to May 6, when hostilities were first
reported _ in other words, to withdraw from what Ethiopia considers
its territory.
	   Eritrea, wedged between northern Ethiopia and the Red Sea,
however, claims the disputed territory based on boundaries drawn by
Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
	   Italian envoy Rino Serri was scheduled to arrive in Asmara
Saturday evening to also help with negotiations.
	   Yemane said Eritrea continues to press for an immediate
cessation of hostilities; direct talks with between Ethiopia and
Eritrea or indirectly through high-level African mediators; and an
official demarcation of the border, on the ground, probably by the
U.N. Cartographic Unit.

World Cup: South American federation may be clear in ticket scandal, FIFA says AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with FIFA statement; ADDS byline
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A South American soccer federation may be cleared
of any wrongdoing in the international scandal over World Cup
tickets, FIFA said Saturday.
	   While still refusing to identify the country involved, the
international soccer federation said its investigation so far had
found no signs of improper activity.
	   ``Our investigation tends to indicate this federation is
innocent,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said.
	   He gave no indication that the investigation was closed.
	   On Friday, FIFA said it was investigating allegations of illicit
sale or distribution of tickets by soccer federations in Cameroon
and the unidentified South American nation. French reports said the
country was Colombia, although the Colombian federation said it had
been assured by FIFA that it was not involved.
	   FIFA also said it was looking into a scam by an agent for a
branch of its own marketing company, in which a few thousand
non-existing tickets were sold to fans.
	   The actions came as organizers tried to distance themselves from
a growing scandal that has left thousands of fans around the world
searching for World Cup tickets they already had paid for.
	   FIFA and the French World Cup committee said they had followed
the rules and repeatedly warned fans against buying tickets from
any agency other than the 17 licensed ticket bureaus around the
world.
	   The problem is biggest in Japan, where some 12,000 fans were
missing tickets. Other countries reporting similar scandals
included Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Brazil.
	   Some fans, including dozens from Japan, came to France only to
discover that tickets promised in their travel packages won't be
delivered.
	   Bruno Travade, a spokesman for the World Cup organizing
committee, said earlier this week that he could not explain reports
that 12,000 Japanese tickets had gone missing and that five
Japanese travel agencies reportedly were deciding to cancel World
Cup tours.
	   He said that representatives of the only three licensed ticket
agencies for Asia _ JT Travel, Ken R Tours and Prime Sports
International _ picked up their tickets at the organizers' Paris
headquarters between April 27-29.
	   ``We have the receipts, signed by representatives of the tour
operators, that they collected the number and classification of
tickets they had contracted for,'' Travade said.
	   The Japanese aren't the only fans to say they have arrived in
France to find the tickets aren't here.
	   Brazilians and English followers also were caught up, many of
them after travel companies failed to come up with the tickets.
	   Worldwide, Travade said, 138,000 tickets had been distributed to
17 licensed agencies. Other brokers who peddled World Cup tickets
face legal action, the spokesman said.
	   ``We will sue anyone or any organization who undertakes to
damage our image or intentions,'' Travade said. ``And we encourage
individuals to sue the persons who cheated them.''

Sri Lanka to enforce ban on alcohol and tobacco advertising 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka is to enforce a ban on
alcohol and tobacco advertisements in newspapers, radio and
television next year, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   President Chandrika Kumaratunga has ordered her media minister
to enforce the country's existing codes of ethics for state and
private television and radio channels, which forbid promotion of
alcohol and tobacco, the state-owned Daily News reported.
	   In addition Kumaratunga has directed that state newspapers stop
accepting alcohol and tobacco advertisements as well, the newspaper
said. There was no mention of privately owned newspapers.
	   Kumaratunga noted in her letter to Media Minister Mangala
Samaraweera that alcohol and tobacco were being increasingly
portrayed in soap operas and advertisements in recent months.
	   ``An advertisement is an advertisement, whether it promotes a
product or image or a logo or a company associated with alcohol and
tobacco,'' the president noted.
	   The president also said in her letter that the advertising was
contradicting the current worldwide trend to restrict such
promotions.
	   A special committee appointed by Kumaratunga has recommended
banning all types of tobacco and alcohol advertising, including
billboards and sponsoring of sporting events.

Publisher of liberal Iranian newspaper arrested 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The publisher of a liberal Iranian newspaper
has been arrested after he ignored a court summons, newspapers
reported Saturday.
	   Mohammad Mahdavi Khorrami was arrested Wednesday after he failed
to appear before the court, Qods newspaper quoted a Tehran
judiciary spokesman as saying.
	   He is the publisher of Gozaresh-e-Ruz, a new and popular paper
that stopped publication last week after the Press Supervisory
Board charged it with violating press ethics. The Justice Ministry
is reviewing the complaint against Gozaresh-e-Ruz.
	   The action against the publisher of Gozaresh-e-Ruz, or ``Daily
Report,'' is seen as a setback for the press freedom that has been
allowed by moderate President Mohammad Khatami since he took office
in August.
	   The reforms introduced by Khatami are said to enjoy the support
of most Iranians. But conservative elements in the government,
particularly in the judiciary, are opposed to his policies.
	   The Farsi-language newspaper started publishing only last month
and on its third day it printed a front-page color picture of a
teenage boy with a teenage girl wearing a head scarf. The caption
read: ``Friendship Under Fear.''
	   The Culture Ministry warned it to ``respect the Press Law and
the society's ethical and religious standards,'' the
English-language Iran News said.
	   Iran's constitution forbids the media from ``propagating
destructive and anti-Islamic attitudes.''
	   One of Iran's most popular newspapers, Jameah or ``Society,''
had its license revoked Wednesday after its editor was convicted of
defamation. The paper is continuing publication and has said it
will appeal the sentence.

Train bombing kills 15, security forces reportedly kill 20 militants 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, France (AP) _ A bomb exploded under a train west of the
capital, killing 15 people and injuring 33, authorities said
Saturday, while a newspaper reported security forces killed 20
Muslim militants.
	   The bomb, planted on the tracks between Algiers and the western
port of Oran, exploded Thursday and derailed the train's first two
passenger cars, security forces said in a statement.
	   Two other bombs were dismantled by security forces, the
statement said.
	   It was the second time in a month that a train was bombed. In
the past year, 10 bombings have left about 60 dead and 100 injured.
	   There was no claim of responsibility for the latest attack, but
suspicion fell on Muslim militants waging a 6-year-old insurgency
against the military-backed government.
	   Service on the route was to be restored Saturday, newspapers
reported.
	   Meanwhile, security forces killed 20 militants since Wednesday
in operations around the eastern city of M'Sila, the northcentral
city of Medea and the western city of Tlemcen, the daily La Tribune
reported Saturday.

Death toll from virus toll rises to 36 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A killer virus that strikes children has
claimed three more lives, raising the death toll to 36, a
government official said.
	   Hsu Kuo-hsiung, an official of the Health Department, said a boy
died in Taipei, and a girl and a boy died in Taichung, central
Taiwan, early this month.
	   He said the disease caused by the enterovirus 71 virus has shown
signs of abating since it peaked in late May.
	   ``The virus has abated, and I have repeatedly urged the public
not to panic,'' Hsu told reporters.
	   That contradicted a prediction earlier this week by a well-known
doctor that the virus had reached its peak in central Taiwan, but
would now move on to northern Taiwan and could spread to Southeast
Asia and Hong Kong.
	   Separately, a hospital said Saturday that it has found evidence
that the disease was attacking the brains of victims.
	   The Chinese Medical College's affiliate hospital said studies
showed the virus ha	   The d entered the lower part of the brain in some of the
victims. It said 12 children whose brains had been infected had
recovered because of early diagnosis.
	   Lee Ching-yun of the National Taiwan University predicted the
virus could infect up to half a million children, but would kill
only a few.
	   The virus, spread by physical contact, hits Taiwan each summer.
Hsu said an analysis has been conducted on whether this year's
outbreak was caused by a variation of the virus, and results will
be announced next week. Three U.S. experts were conducting a
separate analysis of the virus, he said.
	   No adults were found to have the virus because they have already
been exposed to it and are immune, he said.
	   Health authorities said at least 10,000 cases had been reported
in the past two months, including 269 in Taipei county.
	   Early symptoms are similar to the flu, with fever, headache or
vomiting. Later, ulcers or blisters in the mouth and a rash on the
hands and feet can develop. Complications from the virus can
include encephalitis, meningitis, and acute inflammation of the
heart muscle.
	   Officials told anxious parents to keep their young children at
home or to be sure they washed their hands frequently and had clean
changes of clothing.
	   Authorities have conducted disinfection at nursery and
elementary schools.
	   Chen Yen-chueh, principle of Taipei's Yenai Elementary School,
said students were taught to report to teachers any fellow students
developing blisters or other symptoms, and were asked to wash their
hands before entering the classroom.

World Cup: Yugoslavia prepares for strikes against Iranian goal 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS throughout
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Highly favored Yugoslavia, led by
star striker Predrag Mijatovic, meets injury-stricken Iran in their
opening Group F game Sunday.
	   The Iranians, playing their first World Cup match in 20 years,
seem to be worried by the prospect of facing one of Europe's
highest-scoring teams, especially because of injuries to some key
Iranian players.
	   Iranian goalkeeper and captain, Ahmad Reza Abedzadeh, said he'll
miss the game at St. Etienne because he still has not recuperated
from a knee operation late last year. His place will be taken by
inexperienced reserve goalie Nima Nakissa.
	   Midfielder Reza Shahroudi was carried off the field with an
injury to his left leg during a practice match Friday. Fellow
midfielder Sattar Hamedani walked off the field with an ice pack on
his leg.
	   There is no shortage of confidence among the Yugoslavs who next
play Germany and the United States in Group F.
	   ``Iranians have three or four good players, but overall we are a
much stronger squad,'' said Yugoslav team captain Dragan Stojkovic.
``We should have no problem beating them.''
	   Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac was trying to curb the extreme
optimism by his players.
	   ``There are no easy matches at the World Cup,'' he said. ``We
have to take Iran very seriously, or we could find ourselves in
deep trouble.''
	   What is worrying Santrac the most is the probable the absence of
Dejan Savicevic, Yugoslavia's main midfielder, because of a knee
ligament injury. His place is likely to be taken by the 19-year-old
rising star Dejan Stankovic.
	   Yugoslavia's three central defenders _ Sinisa Mihajlovic, Goran
Djorovic and Miroslav Djukic _ have also suffered recent injuries,
but are likely to play Sunday.
	   Iran is expected to adopt a defensive strategy against the
formidable Yugoslav attackers. But Abedzadeh's absence and possible
injuries that could keep out key players, may make Iran's weak
defense even weaker.
	   But Iran places its hopes on the German-based trio of forwards:
Khodadad Azizi, Karim Bagheri and Ali Daei.
	   ``Since I took over less than a month ago, much of what I have
tried to do is to build up the confidence of the players,'' said
Iranian coach Jalal Talebi.
	   ``The presence of our three strikers who play in the German
Bundesliga has been a tremendous source of confidence for the rest
of the team,'' Talebi said.
	   The Yugoslav players seem unaffected by ethnic clashes back home
in Kosovo, and NATO threats of air strikes inside the troubled
Serbian province unless a Serb offensive there against ethnic
Albanian separatists is stopped.
	   ``We are here to play soccer, score goals and forget about
politics and wars,'' said Yugoslav star midfielder Vladimir
Jugovic.

Five African leaders appointed to seek peace in Eritrea, Ethiopia 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Five African leaders will take the lead
role in seeking peace in the Horn of Africa where Ethiopia and
Eritrea are engaged in a deadly border dispute, the Eritrean
government said Saturday.
	   The men appointed by the Organization of African Unity were
tentatively scheduled to go to the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa on
Thursday, and to the Eritrean capital Asmara on Friday,
presidential spokesman Yemane Gebremeskel said.
	   The team will be led by Burkina President Blaise Campaore in his
role as current OAU chairman. Also participating are presidents
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Hassan Gouled Aptidon of Djibouti,
Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda, and OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed
Salim, Yemane said.
	   Their arrival will represent a new phase in efforts to end the
border conflict that has entered a second month and threatens to
explode into full-scale war, Yemane said.
	   There were no reports of new clashes as of midday Saturday.
Eritrean aircraft bombed the Ethiopian town of Adigrat on Thursday,
killing four people and wounding 30, and forces lashed on two
fronts that day.
	   A weeks-old effort by the United States and Rwanda to end the
conflict will take a backseat role, Yemane said.
	   Rwanda became involved in the peace effort because those who
took control after the ethnic slaughter of 1994, including Vice
President Paul Kagame, the de-facto leader of the tiny central
African country, have long been close to both Ethiopian Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, Yemane
said. All three have led successful rebellions.
	   ``And the United States is interested in peace and development.
They are our close friends, so we thought we could resolve our
problems in a familial sort of way, he said. ``But that didn't
work.''
	   ``Now we think it's best to try under the auspices of the OAU,''
he said.
	   A U.S.-Rwandan peace plan, although accepted by Ethiopia, has
foundered because Eritrea says it lacks essential ingredients for
achieving a permanent solution to the long-simmering territorial
dispute.
	   The U.S.-Rwandan proposal includes a call to Eritrea to return
to positions held prior to May 6, when hostilities were first
reported _ in other words, to withdraw from what Ethiopia considers
its territory.
	   Eritrea, wedged between northern Ethiopia and the Red Sea,
however, claims the disputed territory based on boundaries drawn by
Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
	   Italian envoy Rino Serri was scheduled to arrive in Asmara
Saturday evening to also help with negotiations.
	   Yemane said Eritrea continues to press for an immediate
cessation of hostilities; direct talks with between Ethiopia and
Eritrea or indirectly through high-level African mediators; and an
official demarcation of the border, on the ground, probably by the
U.N. Cartographic Unit.

	   HAMILTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand A fly-half Lee
Stensness scored a decisive try early in the second half to lift
the shadow All Blacks to an 18-10 win over England on Saturday.
	   England produced a markedly improved effort from last week's
record 76-0 test loss to Australia in Brisbane and held a 10-8
half-time lead.
	   Giant winger Jonah Lomu, trying to prove his fitness for the All
Blacks test against the tourists next Saturday, had a quiet game,
kept under control by dreadful weather conditions.
	   Belting rain and high winds made it an uncomfortable experience
for both sides.
	   Center Caleb Ralph also crossed for a try for the home team
while Adrian Cashmore kicked two penalties and a conversion.
Gloucester lock Rob Fidler scored England's try while fly-half Josh
Lewsey kicked one penalty and one conversion.
	   After the humiliation against Australia, England coach Clive
Woodward's side looked more competitive and were better
defensively.
	   Lomu was taken off 21 minutes before the end and is no certainty
to be picked next week.
	   Scorers:
	   New Zealand A 18 (Caleb Ralph, Lee Stensness tries; Adrian
Cashmore 1 goal, 2 penalty goals) def. England 10 (Rob Fidler try;
Josh Lewsey pen con).

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police have interrogated and threatened three
dissidents who urged U.S. President Bill Clinton to press Chinese
leaders on human rights during their summit later this month, a
rights group reported Saturday.
	   Groups of police, in one case as many as seven officers, went to
the homes of Leng Wanbao, Tang Yuanjuan and Li Wei in the northeast
industrial city of Changchun on Friday, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
reported.
	   Police ransacked the homes of Leng and Tang, confiscated their
computers and took the two to local precincts for two hours of
questioning, the group said.
	   Leng was told an open letter he, Tang, Li and 20 other
dissidents around China sent to Clinton and Chinese President Jiang
Zemin violated public order regulations on spreading rumors, the
group said. Police gave him a warning before letting him go.
	   The letter, sent Tuesday, noted that the ruling Communist Party
has routinely disregarded human rights since coming to power in
1949. Suppression of dissent has worsened since March with a new
round of detentions, the letter said.
	   The dissidents appealed to Clinton and Jiang to make human
rights a priority in their late June talks and specifically
requested they discuss authorities' refusal to allow two dissidents
to set up a human rights monitoring group.
	   Clinton's trip to China, the first by a U.S. president since the
Chinese military violently quelled student-led demonstrations
centered on Tiananmen Square in 1989, has drawn fire from critics
in Congress. In a speech in Washington Thursday, Clinton promised
to push for improvements in human rights and religious freedom.
	   Leng, Tang and Li all worked at Changchun's massive First Auto
Works and organized sympathy protests with the Beijing
demonstrations in 1989. In the nationwide crackdown, they were
sentenced to 8, 20 and 13 years in jail respectively, but a court
commuted those punishments to time served last year.

McGuire leads by four strokes in Suntory Ladies Open 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KOBE, Japan (AP) _ Marnie McGuire shot a par-round of 72 in
windy and rainy weather Saturday to extend her lead to four shots
going into the final round of the Suntory Ladies Open.
	   The 29-year-old New Zealander, in contention for her fifth title
in Japan, began the day with a two-stroke lead and with a
confidence-boosting eagle.
	   McGuire knocked in a 76-yard (69-meter) wedge shot for the eagle
on the 512-yard (466-meter), par-5 first hole. She then had an
up-and-down day shooting four bogeys and two birdies as the wind
kicked up.
	   After the third round McGuire stayed at 5-under 211.
	   ``Today I just tried to play conservatively,'' said McGuire.
``The condition was tough and I knew few players would have a solid
round.''
	   McGuire, seeking her first victory since winning the 1996
Mitsubishi Cup, has led since the opening round.
	   Fuki Kido was the day's only player to break par with six
birdies and four bogeys en route to a 70. She was tied for second
place at 215 with Aki Nakano, who shot a 72.
	   South Korean Kim Ae-sook, winner of the Daikin Orchid in March,
fired a 74 for 216, followed by Yuri Kawanami who shot a 74 for
217.
	   The 50 million yen (dlrs 352,000) event offers a top prize of 9
million yen (dlrs 63,300).

Train bombing kills 15, security forces reportedly kill 20 militants 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A bomb exploded under a train west of
the capital, killing 15 people and injuring 33, authorities said
Saturday, while a newspaper reported security forces killed 20
Muslim militants.
	   The bomb, planted on the tracks between Algiers and the western
port of Oran, exploded Thursday and derailed the train's first two
passenger cars, security forces said in a statement.
	   Two other bombs were dismantled by security forces, the
statement said.
	   It was the second time in a month that a train was bombed. In
the past year, 10 bombings have left about 60 dead and 100 injured.
	   There was no claim of responsibility for the latest attack, but
suspicion fell on Muslim militants waging a 6-year-old insurgency
against the military-backed government.
	   Service on the route was to be restored Saturday, newspapers
reported.
	   Meanwhile, security forces killed 20 militants since Wednesday
in operations around the eastern city of M'Sila, the northcentral
city of Medea and the western city of Tlemcen, the daily La Tribune
reported Saturday.

President adamant East Timor to stay part of Indonesia 
</HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ East Timor would remain part of
Indonesia despite growing protests and international calls for
self-determination for the disputed territory, Indonesian President
B.J. Habibie said Saturday.
	   ``We are going to keep East Timor what it is, an integrated part
of Indonesia,'' Habibie said in an interview with The Associated
Press.
	   He suggested East Timor had about as much chance of gaining
independence from Indonesia as a descendant of the Romanov dynasty
would have of becoming czar of Russia again, or for a state to
break away from the United States.
	   However, in a separate interview with Japanese reporters
Saturday, Habibie signalled that he was considering the release of
Xanana Gusmao, East Timor's rebel guerrilla commander who is
serving a 20-year term in an Indonesian prison.
	   Gusmao's freedom remains a key demand of protesters, as well as
of rebels who continue to fight a hit-and-run war against
Indonesian forces in East Timor's rugged interior.
	   ``I tell you I'm really, really honestly considering to release
him and to integrate all the Timorese, who are still in the
mountains, (into) the society and to take care of them the same as
other Indonesian people to work for the whole of the Republic of
Indonesia, including (East) Timor,'' the Kyodo news agency quoted
Habibie as saying.
	   Until now Indonesian authorities have flatly rejected calls to
set Gusmao free, saying that he is a violent criminal.
	   Earlier this week Habibie released 15 East Timorese political
prisoners and suggested that special status could be bestowed upon
the territory in return for peace.
	   The former Portuguese colony was invaded by Indonesia in 1975
and was annexed as its 27th province a year later.
	   Habibie's peace offering has been rejected by East Timorese
activists.
	   In Jakarta on Friday, police and army personnel beat and kicked
protesters who staged a pro-independence rally outside Indonesia's
Foreign Ministry.
	   In East Timor Saturday, about 1,000 protesters staged a noisy
demonstration calling for a referendum of their political future
and the release of Xanana.
	   It was the second protest held in the territory's capital, Dili,
this week.
	   Habibie, who replaced long time President Suharto last month,
said while he would not bend to the protesters' demands he would
tolerate their demonstrations as part of his push to reform
Indonesia's political system.
	   ``If you want democracy you have to live with it,'' he said of
the protests.
	   Earlier this week Habibie ordered the armed forces to respect
the human rights of dissenters.
	   ``I don't want them to killed or slaughtered,'' he said
Saturday.
	   Although human rights groups have regularly criticized the
behavior of Indonesia's military, Habibie defended his government's
record in East Timor.
	   He said Indonesia has done more for East Timor's development in
the past 20 years than the former colonial master Portugal had down
in the previous 300 years.

China says officials punished for coercive family planning 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Family planning officials have used force to
carry out China's unpopular one-child policy but have been punished
for doing so, a state-run newspaper quoted a senior administrator
as saying Saturday.
	   The admission of coercive tactics to limit population growth
follows allegations in the United States this week by a former
family planning administrator that nighttime raids, forced
abortions and other strong-arm measures were used to meet birth
limits.
	   Gao Xiao Duan told a U.S. congressional panel that her office in
a Fujian province township relied on paid informants to uncover
unauthorized pregnancies. Families were threatened and their houses
sometimes destroyed unless the woman submitted to abortions or
sterilizations, she said.
	   Gao's testimony supported years of often piecemeal reports about
abuses in enforcing the 20-year-old policy that limits most
families to one child.
	   Beijing has insisted that its policy does not condone coercion.
But local officials are under pressure to meet strict birth quotas
set by the government.
	   Li Honggui, vice minister of the State Family Planning
Commission, reportedly told China Daily that some local officials
have been punished for using coercion. The report gave no details
on the types of force or the punishments.
	   The commission ``made it a principle to ban coercion at any
level,'' China Daily reported.
	   Family planning policy now stresses education, better
contraceptive services and improved reproductive health care in
meeting family limits, Li was quoted as saying.
	   The one-child policy has slowed population growth in China, the
world's most populous nation with 1.2 billion people. About 20
million babies are born every year, and, with deaths taken into
account, China adds 13 million more people annually, the newspaper
said.

Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with One Nation running well in rural areas.
With BC-Australia-Hanson's Heartland
<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ No matter who ultimately grabs the
most votes in Saturday's Queensland state elections, Pauline
Hanson's right-wing One Nation Party has already emerged as the
contest's big winner.
	   Her year-old party, which is considered anti-Aboriginal and
anti-Asian, dominated the campaign and early returns showed it
pulling 26 percent of the state's 2 million voters, possibly
depriving either mainstream party of a governing majority in
Parliament.
	   In at least 12 of the state's 89 electoral districts, One Nation
was leading in the early partial returns with 40 percent of the
vote or more. In one district, it was carrying 51 percent.
	   ``There seems to be a substantial One Nation vote across the
state _ across the state,'' Queensland's conservative Premier Rob
Borbidge said after the polls closed Saturday evening.
	   ``It will be historic in terms of what's happened with One
Nation,'' Labor Party opposition leader Peter Beattie said. Labor
was also doing well in the urban districts of Brisbane.
	   At the national level, Prime Minister John Howard is watching
the Queensland outcome closely. Losing Queensland would be a
terrible omen for his conservatives; he has to call a federal
election by March 1999.
	   If Hanson's forces can deadlock Queensland's Parliament and hold
the balance of power there, they might be able to pull off a
similar victory in a federal election, holding the swing votes in
the nation's Senate and blocking legislation that they disagree
with.
	   Warning Howard of the battle to come, Hanson said Saturday: ``I
don't think it's hit them yet; I don't think they have a clue.''
	   In Queensland, Borbidge's governing conservative coalition of
urban and rural parties now holds 44 of the 89 seats in state
Parliament, as does the opposition Labor Party.
	   Borbidge has governed only with the alliance of a single
independent conservative member of Parliament.
	   That equation is bound to change after Saturday _ Hanson's One
Nation Party has cut deeply into Borbidge's conservative
constituency, splitting the right-of-center vote.
	   All polls and pundits predict Borbidge will lose the election.
The question is whether Labor will win enough seats _ at least 45 _
to form a government, or if Queensland will have a minority
government, with One Nation's new legislators holding the balance
of power.
	   Various polls indicate One Nation could win as many as 10 or
more of the 89 state seats. Hanson herself is a member of the
national Parliament, and is not up for re-election in this state
race.

Humanitarian airlift for Albania starts from Sarajevo 
</HEADLINE>
By AIDA CERKEZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The first humanitarian
flight took off Saturday from Sarajevo airport bound for Tirana,
carrying relief for thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees who fled
fighting in Kosovo.
	   The leading U.N. aid agency and NATO set up a limited airlift,
carrying tents, Jerry cans, mattresses, blankets and other non-food
items to be distributed to the up to 13,000 Kosovo Albanians who
sought shelter in northern Albania by crossing the Yugoslav border.
	   ``It has a certain symbolic value that Bosnia-Herzegovina is
today providing help to its neighbors,'' said on Saturday Arnuev
Torbjornsen, deputy chief of mission of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees in Bosnia.
	   Sarajevo itself survived the 1992-95 Bosnian Serb siege thanks
to a UNHCR airlift - the longest in history. The aid items for the
Albanians will come from stocks originally brought in for Bosnians.
	   According to the UNHCR, this delivery to Tirana will not affect
the Bosnian operation.
	   ``I find it very, very positive that we can do this operation
from Sarajevo to other people that are today in need,''
Torbjornsen, said.
	   The Norwegian military transport C-130 Hercules airplane will
make two flights a day and a total number of eight flights in four
days, flying from Bosnia all the way over Italian airspace to
Albania.
	   ``I believe we have not obtained the permission to fly across
the FRY (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia),'' which would be a
shorter route, he said.
	   UNHCR was grateful for the lone Norwegian government plane. The
aid agency hopes other governments will follow by providing more
aircraft, since the Norwegian aircraft will be needed elsewhere
after four days.
	   The agency also cares for tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians
displaced inside Kosovo.
	   ``These people live with the host families for the time being.
If more people cross the border we will have to consider camps, but
we hope to avoid that,'' Torbjornsen, said.
	   Some 500 tons of food were provided by the World Food Program
from their stocks in the Croatian port of Ploce. Albanian
businessmen from Albania and abroad also have donated relief items
to the refugees.
	   Due to the bad roads in Albania, the aid likely will be going to
be transported by several American NATO helicopters from Tirana to
the north of the country, where the refugees are settled.

Shoot-out leaves one Civil Guard dead and another seriously injured

<TEXT>
	   JAEN, Spain (AP) _ Police were searching Saturday for a
Frenchman, a Spanish man and two female Colombian twins who fled a
routine highway checkpoint after shooting dead one Civil Guard and
seriously injuring another, authorities said.
	   Manuel Saenz Santiago, 37, died from bullet wounds received when
he approached the rented car at about 4 a.m. (0200GMT) in which the
four fugitives were traveling near this southern Spanish city, a
police spokesman said.
	   After the shoot-out the suspect car sped off and the injured
agent was rushed to hospital for surgery, Jose Manuel Fernandez
said.
	   Fernandez said the four fugitives were common criminals not
linked to terrorism, but did not confirm news reports that they
were associated with a drug trafficking or prostitution ring.
	   The Spanish Civil Guard was created in the 19th century to
police Spain's vast countryside, but now also serve as national
highway police, coast guards, and have a special anti-terrorist
units.
	   Only those Civil Guards posted outside public buildings still
wear the characteristic patent leather tri-cornered hat.

Pro-government daily says dissolving parliament will solve little 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A pro-government newspaper said Saturday that
dissolving the Gulf's only elected parliament will not end the
crisis between the Cabinet and the legislature.
	   The editorial in Al-Anba is an indication that Kuwait's emir,
Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, may not disband parliament after his
Saturday meeting with the Cabinet.
	   Prime Minister Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah has complained
that his Cabinet can no longer cooperate with the 50-member
legislature, which he has accused of blocking economic reforms and
showing disrespect for members of his Cabinet.
	   ``We strongly believe that resorting to the disbanding of
parliament is neither the ideal nor the possible solution to our
current political crisis,'' the newspaper said.
	   Al-Anba added that new elections were likely to bring the same
legislators back to parliament.
	   Relations between the Cabinet and parliament plummeted earlier
this month when a lawmaker decided to grill the interior minister,
Sheik Mohammed al-Khaled al-Sabah, accusing him of inefficiency in
fighting drugs and crime.
	   Sheik Mohammed is a member of the ruling family.
	   Lawmakers have accused the government of wasting public funds
and spending huge amounts of money to buy weapons that are
unsuitable for Kuwait.
	   ``The right solution is to explore the causes of the crisis with
absolute neutrality ... and to set up a new methodology for
cooperation,'' the editorial said.
	   The newspaper said although parliament has achieved little in
the two years since it was elected, the Cabinet also has failed to
take action on vital issues.
	   The government wants to privatize the economy to curb budget
deficits. But that would entail parliament approving measures that
are unpopular with voters, such as introducing taxes and fees for
services that have been heavily subsidized or offered free of
charge for decades.
	   Two Kuwaiti parliaments have been dissolved for severely
criticizing the government.
	   In both cases, in 1976 and 1986, the constitution was suspended
and elections were not called for years.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Spin twins Muttiah Muralitharan and
Niroshan Bandaratilleke ripped through New Zealand on a helpful
pitch to propel Sri Lanka to a 164 run win on the fourth day of the
third and final cricket test in Colombo on Saturday.
	   The win gave Sri Lanka a 2-1 series win after losing the first
match by 167 runs.
	   None of the Kiwi batsmen was able to come to grips with the two
spinners and paid the price for not using their feet to get to the
pitch of the ball.
	   Muralitharan finished with figures of five for 30 and was
adjudged man of the series for a haul of 19 wickets, while his
partner took four for 52 to collect 16 scalps in the three matches.
	   Needing 296 to win, New Zealand lost its last seven wickets for
just 51 runs, after taking lunch at 80 for three from an overnight
10 for no loss.
	   Wicket keeper Romesh Kaluwitharana was declared man-of-the-match
for his top score of 88 which turned the game in Sri Lanka's favor
the previous day.
	   At 44, New Zealand's highest opening stand in the low scoring
series, Muralitharan got a ball to move down the leg side away from
Bryan Young and had him stumped by Romesh Kaluwitharana for 24.
	   Skipper Stephen Fleming followed a few balls later, trapped
leg-before-wicket by Kumar Dharmasena for 3. He appeared surprised
by umpire Peter Manuel's decision, having set off for a run.
	   Muralitharan then took a diving return catch to his left to
dismiss Craig Spearman for a painstaking 22 made in 109 minutes.
	   Bandaratilleke triggered the collapse in the second over after
lunch by having Mathew Horne caught behind for 12.
	   The left-armer then clean bowled Chris Cairns for 26 and Mark
Priest for 2, both in one over. Cairns, who top scored for New
Zealand, earlier clobbered two sixes over Bandaratilleke's head.
	   The game was all over an hour before tea when Muralitharan
bowled Daniel Vettori for three.

World Cup: Croatia confident of beating unheralded Jamaica 
</HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) - To hear the Croatians tell it, only the
size of their victory against upstart Jamaica is in question at
Sunday's World Cup debut for both countries.
	   Despite injury troubles, Croatia has the vastly more experienced
team, relying on the international stars that paced it to the
quarterfinals of the 1996 European Championship. Jamaica, coached
out of laid-back Caribbean obscurity by Brazilian Rene Simoes for
the last four years, has the underdog's hunger to be taken
seriously.
	   ``We respect Jamaica, but we are the firm favorites,'' said
Croatian defender Slaven Bilic. ``It would be nice to predict a
5-0, but I'll be happy with a 1-0. We just need the three points.''
	   Still, in a group also comprising Japan and Argentina, Croatia's
best chance to fill up its goal account is against the ``Reggae
Boyz.''
	   Croatia needs to prove its form after an inconsistent World Cup
qualifying campaign.
	   Also, doubts linger about the fitness of some of its stars.
	   Bilic, the team's most experienced defender, is recovering from
a muscle injury, while Robert Prosinecki, a gifted but moody
playmaker who has returned to champion Croatia Zagreb after several
frustrating years in Spain, is fighting flu.
	  ink up with Parma's Mario Stanic, a strapping
player equally at home in the attack and in midfield.
	   Coach Miroslav Blazevic, who has predicted a Croatia-France
final, has no self-confidence problem ahead of Sunday's game at
Lens.
	   ``We will play our game,'' he said. ``I don't adapt to other
teams' style.''
	   Blazevic is trying to motivate his millionaire-laced squad with
martial talk.
	   ``We will play with fanatical commitment,'' he promised
Saturday. ``This is a battle.''
	   The Jamaicans, staying in a chateau in eastern France, have one
clear ambition: to avoid becoming a laughing stock like the
nation's Olympic bobsled team in its debut a decade ago.
	   ``That stigma has been attached to us by people who are
expecting the football team to be just as much of a joke,''
midfielder Fitzroy Simpson said.
	   So the team is ``eager to do well and to impress, and that is
bound to work in our favour because there is unlikely to be another
squad who want to win as much as we do,'' said teammate Paul Hall.
	   With most of the squad playing for home teams with names like
Galaxy United and Violet Kickers, Jamaica is counting on
England-based players such as Simpson and Hall, who both play for
Portsmouth, and Wimbledon striker Marcus Gayle for experience at a
higher level.
	   In a training session Friday, Simoes brought together what is
expected to be his opening lineup. The most surprising omission was
veteran defender Linval Dixon.
	   Chelsea defender Frank Sinclair appeared to aggravate a groin
injury during the workout.
	   But Jamaica is giving little away. After a recent training
session, a TV crew had its film confiscated by Jamaican officials
and the normally talkative Simoes left without speaking to the
media.

World Cup: Blazevic muses: Super Mario, up, back or middle? With Sports-Soccer-Jamaica-Croatia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ ``Mario: Jack of all trades,'' a Zagreb
newspaper headlined. Who else but do-everything Mario Stanic? He
could be the key to Croatia's World Cup success.
	   Croatian news media welcomed coach Miroslav Blazevic's newest
idea of nudging Stanic closer to the attack, confident that the
midfielder could rise to the occasion.
	   Reliable in defense, industrious in the middle and downright
pesty in front of the opposition, Stanic is Croatia's most
versatile player.
	   Now that star striker Alen Boksic is out of the World Cup due to
an injury and defender Slaven Bilic may not be in peak form in the
opening game against Jamaica Sunday, the mercurial coach is
pondering various combinations.
	   In all of those, Super Mario features prominently.
	   ``I've never felt like our game depends in any special way on my
performance,'' the 26-year-old Stanic told national radio in an
interview Friday from the team's training camp in Vittel, France.
``Only teamwork can propel an individual to the stars.''
	   Stanic is an attacking midfielder by trade, a position he takes
up in Italian Seria A club side, Parma. But in Croatia's charge to
France, Blazevic was prompted to utilise his unique grit and verve
on virtually every patch of the paddock.
	   Blazevic said he mulled over the idea of pushing Stanic closer
to the opposition goal mouth to give his side more width and menace
in offense against Jamaica and Japan, their first opponents in
Group H.
	   ``I'm sure it's possible, but I'll make up my mind after another
two or three training sessions,'' Blazevic told national radio
Friday.

Russian border guards seize Ukrainian ship 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian border guards on Saturday detained a
Ukrainian freighter and seized about 1 million excise stamps for
Russian alcohol products.
	   The freighter Kafa was boarded in Russia's southern territorial
waters on the Black Sea and border guards found the excise stamps
in bags hidden under a wooden floor, border guards' spokesman
Dmitry Romantovsky said.
	   He said the stamps, worth about 7 million rubles (dlrs 1.1
million), were most likely counterfeit.
	   The Ukrainian ship was heading for Ukraine from the Georgian
port of Poti, when the captain decided to put in for water at the
Russian port of Novorossiisk, when border guards boarded the vessel
in Russian waters and conducted the search, Romantovsky said.
	   The freighter's crew was unable to produce a bill of lading for
the excise stamps, and the Kafa was turned over to the port's
customs service for further investigation, he said.

Five senior Khmer Rouge leaders defect to government from defector, other details 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS lead to update with defectors welcomed, ADDs quotes
By KER MUNTHIT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The government welcomed five former
leaders of the withering Khmer Rouge guerrillas Saturday, saying
their defection had ``profound significance'' for an end to
Cambodia's decades of war.
	   One of the defectors, former Deputy Premier Chan Youran, said
their switch of allegiance signified the end of the
three-decade-old revolutionary movement.
	   But a trio of veteran leaders still remains in the jungle, along
with perhaps several hundred followers while smaller bands of Khmer
Rouge roam remote areas of the country.
	   The five gave up the fight in the northwestern Cambodian-Thai
frontier town of Pailin where they met Phnom Penh military
officials Saturday.
	   ``We are very happy to rejoin society because all of us are also
children of our nation,'' Chan Youran said at Pailin.
	   When asked by a journalist whether their defections meant the
true end of the Khmer Rouge, he replied: ``Yes, clearly it is. The
reason it collapsed so quickly is because our nation and people
don't want to see war any more.''
	   Official Phnom Penh media said late Friday the five had severed
their relations with the fast-dwindling hold-outs June 11.
	   ``I have already received your statement which was of profound
significance for national reconciliation and ending the war,'' said
Premier Hun Sen said in a statement. ``I would like to congratulate
and warmly welcome the return of all of you.''
	   The other defectors were listed as Mak Ben, the former minister
of economy and trade, In Sopheap, minister of immigration and two
other members of the ruling circle, Chuon Cheoun and Kor Bun Heng.
	   Of the once dreaded and powerful Khmer Rouge leaders, only Nuon
Chea, Ta Mok and nominal head Khieu Samphan are still at large.
	   Chan Youran said Tak Mok and Noun Chea were living on a jungled
hill near Anlong Veng, the onetime Khmer Rouge headquarters close
to the northern Cambodian border with Thailand. He said he did not
know the whereabouts of Khieu Samphan.
	   ``Having seen that it is necessary to end the war which has been
prolonged for many years already, we have decided ... to rejoin our
national society,'' the defectors said in a statement. It said they
made their decision May 3.
	   ``We recognize Cambodia's constitution and the current royal
government of Cambodia,'' their statement said. ``We recognize the
role of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, who is the symbol and
the cool shade of our Cambodian nation.''
	   It was uncertain whether the five would remain in Pailin, the
stronghold of another, earlier Khmer Rouge defector, Ieng Sary.
	   While Ieng Sary pledges his allegiance to the Phnom Penh
government, he has been allowed to maintain a degree of autonomy in
Pailin where he thrives from a lucrative business in logging and
gems.
	   The Cambodian government has in the past accused Thailand of
allowing the remaining guerrillas to slip back and forth across the
border and sustain themselves by doing businesses with Thais.
	   Thailand says its official ties to the Khmer Rouge ended years
ago, although it admits private business has been conducted with
them.
	   The three hardline leaders each have engaged in revolutionary
activities for decades and were involved in the mid-1970s Khmer
Rouge reign of terror when as many as 2 million Cambodians perished
from disease, starvation and mass execution.
	   Ta Mok, dubbed ``The Butcher'' for his record of killings, is
regarded as the real head of the remaining guerrillas although
Khieu Samphan, a French-educated intellectual, is presented as
their chief.
	   Least is known about Nuon Chea, although he was the no. 2 power
holder after Pol Pot during the heyday of the movement.
	   The Phnom Penh government has vowed to put the three before a
tribunal for genocidal crimes. However, in the past it has pardoned
equally guilty Khmer Rouge veterans who laid down their arms.
	   And Thailand's position, should they seek asylum there, has not
been clearly spelled out. Military officials along the border say
that should guerrillas like Ta Mok enter the country they would be
disarmed and treated like other political refugees.
	   The Khmer Rouge movement began to unravel following the United
Nations-brokered elections in 1993. Thousands of the weary, jungle
fighters responded to a government amnesty while in-fighting also
broke out among the top leadership.
	   The death in April of Pol Pot, who was deposed in one of the
internal feuds, symbolized the end of the Khmer Rouge, who gained
enough strength in the countryside to march into Phnom Penh in 1975
after a five-year war.

Finland, Sweden to cooperate in defense, rule out NATO membership 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finland and Sweden plan to increase
military cooperation including in international peace efforts, but
rule out membership in NATO, the countries' defense ministers said
Saturday.
	   The two countries should jointly buy military materials to save
costs and increase patrolling of their joint borders, Finnish
Defense Minister Anneli Taina and her Swedish colleague, Bjoern von
Sydow, said in a joint newspaper article.
	   In an unusual move, the defense ministers said their countries
may, at a later date, reconsider their policies of neutrality.
	   ``Military non alliance is a means and not an end in itself. It
is not necessarily a permanent state,'' the ministers said in an
article published in Finland's Helsingin Sanomat and Sweden's
Dagens Nyheter.
	   However, if Finland and Sweden ``were now to reconsider their
non alliance, it would not increase the security of our countries
or stability in the region,'' the article said. ``That is why there
is no need for Finland or Sweden to join NATO.''
	   But, NATO continues to be the main military body of cooperation
in Europe, Taina and von Sydow said. ``The commitment of the United
States to Europe, not least to northern Europe, is decisively
important for maintaining stability.''
	   Finland and Sweden, which have provided more than 120,000
peacekeepers, will continue to participate in international efforts
to bring peace to crisis areas.
	   The two countries will increase joint patrols of their marine
borders on the Baltic Sea, and plan to jointly buy military
equipment, including helicopters, to save costs, the article said.

Indonesian president says he won't help Suharto fend off allegations 
</HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ New President B.J. Habibie said
Saturday he remains a friend of his predecessor Suharto, but
indicated that he would not intercede to help the ex-autocrat fend
off corruption allegations.
	   Habibie replaced Suharto last month when the old president
resigned after protests and riots shook the world's fourth most
populous nation, now battling its worst economic crisis in 30
years.
	   Critics claim the Suharto family amassed billions of dollars and
built huge business empires by abusing their power and position
during Suharto's 32 years in power.
	   Habibie, who served as a Suharto Cabinet minister for 20 years
and later as his vice president, has ordered a broad inquiry into
allegations of state corruption during the Suharto era.
	   He said that inquiries into the wealth of the Suharto clan must
be carried out according to the law and that human rights and the
presumption of innocence must be respected as they would be for any
other Indonesian citizen.
	   ``We are real friends,'' Habibie said of Suharto.
	   ``But the problem that he is facing with his family, that is his
problem, okay. And he has the right to defend that.''
	   Habibie said that he has known Suharto for 49 years, since he
was a boy.
	   He said that during his two decades in the Cabinet, neither man
did the other a favor in regard to their respective family
businesses.
	   Since Suharto's departure from office the government has
canceled many contracts with companies linked to Suharto family
members. Once close business partners have also sought to distance
themselves from the Suhartos.

Taiwan feels pain from Asian economic crisis 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan, which has largely weathered Asia's
economic crisis, felt the sting of regional turbulence this week
when its currency was dragged down by the falling Japanese yen,
analysts said Saturday.
	   After falling to a 11-year low against the U.S. dollar, the
Taiwan dollar stabilized Friday as the Central Bank sold an
estimated U.S. dlrs 500 million in the past two trading days to
defend the local currency.
	   But traders said selling pressure was still heavy because people
were uncertain when the Central Bank, which manages Taiwan's U.S.
dlrs 80 billion of foreign exchange reserves, would give up the
defense of the local currency.
	   The Taiwan dollar closed 34.892 to the U.S. dollar Friday, a
20.3 percent drop since last July when the Asian financial crisis
began.
	   Taiwan has so far escaped the regional crisis largely unscathed.
It recorded a 5.92 percent economic growth in the first three
months this year, with the growth being sustained by increased
spending in infrastructural projects despite a 5.6 percent drop in
exports.
	   But analysts said Japan's ailing economy could cut its imports
from Taiwan. The Economics Ministry predicted Taiwan's trade
deficit with Japan will reach a record high U.S. dlrs 20 billion
this year.
	   They said the financial markets were also hurt by uncertainties
over the currency status in China and Hong Kong, Taiwan's two other
major trading partners.
	   Industry leaders say the local currency's depreciation could
raise costs in importing equipment from the United States and
Europe and thus hamper their expansion projects.
	   On Friday, Wang Yung-ching, chairman of the Formosa Plastics
Group, said the group has suffered 10 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S.
dlrs 285 million) in exchange rate losses since last July. Much of
the loss was incurred from U.S. dollar loans obtained earlier to
build a major chemical complex, which were being paid back later,
he said.
	   Wang, who heads Taiwan's largest conglomerate, urged the
government to prop up the local currency, noting its devaluation
could fan inflation and cause a shrinkage of people's assets.
	   Central Bank deputy governor Shea Jia-dong urged the public to
have confidence in Taiwan's economy.
	   ``Our economic fundamentals are sound,'' Shea told a news
conference Friday. ``The Taiwan dollar shouldn't fall along with
the Japanese yen.''
	   Shea vowed the government will stabilize the Taiwan dollar and
the interest rates to leave speculators little room to manipulate
the foreign exchange and stock markets.

Saddam sacks Baghdad mayor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein has dismissed the
mayor of Baghdad, state-controlled newspapers said Saturday.
	   The newspapers, quoting a presidential decree signed by Saddam,
said Nouri Faisal al-Shaher was sacked because ``he failed to
comply with the law and adhere to the meanings of responsibility.''
	   The decree gave no further details.
	   For months, al-Shaher has been the target of scathing criticism
by the official media. He has been blamed for the lack of a pure
water supply in the capital and for the city's crumbling sewage
system.
	   The papers did not say who will fill al-Shaher's post.
	   Al-Shaher served as mayor of Iraq's largest city for only about
a year.

Humanitarian airlift for Albania starts from Sarajevo 
</HEADLINE>
By AIDA CERKEZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The first humanitarian aid
flight for thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees who fled fighting
in Kosovo took off Saturday from Sarajevo airport bound for Tirana.
	   The leading U.N. aid agency and NATO set up a limited airlift,
carrying tents, Jerry cans, mattresses, blankets and other non-food
items to be distributed to the up to 13,000 Kosovo Albanians who
sought shelter in northern Albania by crossing the Yugoslav border.
	   ``It has a certain symbolic value that Bosnia-Herzegovina is
today providing help to its neighbors,'' Arnuev Torbjornsen, deputy
chief of mission of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in
Bosnia, said Saturday.
	   Sarajevo itself survived the 1992-95 Bosnian Serb siege thanks
to a UNHCR airlift _ the longest in history. The aid items for the
Albanians will come from stocks originally brought in for Bosnians.
	   According to the UNHCR, this delivery to Tirana will not affect
the Bosnian operation.
	   ``I find it very, very positive that we can do this operation
from Sarajevo to other people that are today in need,''
Torbjornsen, said.
	   The Norwegian military transport C-130 Hercules airplane will
make two flights a day and a total number of eight flights in four
days, flying from Bosnia all the way over Italian airspace to
Albania.
	   ``I believe we have not obtained the permission to fly across
the FRY (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia),'' which would be a
shorter route, he said.
	   UNHCR was grateful for the lone Norwegian government plane. The
aid agency hopes other governments will follow by providing more
aircraft, since the Norwegian aircraft will be needed elsewhere
after four days.
	   The agency also cares for tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians
displaced inside Kosovo.
	   ``These people live with the host families for the time being.
If more people cross the border we will have to consider camps, but
we hope to avoid that,'' Torbjornsen, said.
	   About 500 tons of food were provided by the World Food Program
from their stocks in the Croatian port of Ploce. Albanian
businessmen from Albania and abroad also have donated relief items
to the refugees.
	   Due to the poor roads in Albania, aid likely will be transported
by several American NATO helicopters from Tirana to the north of
the country, where the refugees are settled.

As election looms, old issues resurface in South Africa

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ In the first years after
apartheid, South Africa strove to create an aura of harmony and
make a place for everyone.
	   But millions of blacks oppressed under the old racial separation
laws are becoming angry over the slow pace of change and fed up
with demands for sacrifice in the name of reconciliation.
	   With an eye to next year's election, politicians are heating up
a divisive tone with campaign rhetoric. Recent well-publicized
attacks, political wrangles and other racially tinged incidents are
nourishing doubts about progress.
	   A white man fired shots that killed a 6-month-old black infant.
Black sports officials threatened an international boycott of the
white-dominated national rugby team. Attacks on white farmers
continue, and some right-wing whites are reviving war talk in
retaliation for an unending upward spiral of crime.
	   The government is warning that unless South Africa's whites do
more to help eliminate the disparities lingering from the apartheid
era, they will face a backlash.
	   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, the heir apparent to the
conciliatory President Nelson Mandela, underlined the country's
racial divide during a recent Parliament debate on mounting black
rage.
	   ``We are not one nation, but two nations,'' Mbeki said. ``And
neither are we becoming one nation.''
	   To some extent, the heated rhetoric is a reflection of political
jockeying before South Africa's second all-race election next year,
rather than a sign of a disintegrating society.
	   Mandela will retire at age 80 after the election, likely to be
held next April or May. His almost certain successor is Mbeki, who
succeeded Mandela as head of the governing African National
Congress in December.
	   But both Mandela and Mbeki sounded warnings at the December ANC
conference that South Africa's formal reconciliation era will end
with Mandela's term. A second ANC-led government will take stronger
steps to improve the lives of millions of blacks neglected under
apartheid, they said.
	   Mandela used his final speech as ANC leader to launch a
wide-ranging attack that accused just about everyone, including
some ANC leaders, of failing to put national needs above personal
gain.
	   His caustic tone seemingly launched the election campaign a full
15 months before the voting, hardening attitudes on all sides and
perhaps halting any momentum in his effort to bring South Africans
together.
	   To Steven Friedman, director of the independent Center for
Policy Studies, the rhetoric shows South Africa has failed to
resolve deep-rooted differences despite the political compromise
that set up the first all-race election in 1994.
	   ``What we're seeing now is the evidence that those differences
are coming to the surface,'' Friedman said. ``All the election is
going to do is make the debate more strident.''
	   During his presidency, Mandela has held off on radical
transformation, choosing to appease the white minority and promote
reconciliation by allowing the privileged a few years' grace.
	   That will change under Mbeki. The civil service, a bastion of
Dutch-descended Afrikaners under apartheid, will be forced to shed
white workers for blacks. An affirmative action bill heading to
Parliament will require companies to show what steps they are
taking to make their work forces reflect the national racial
breakdown.
	   At the same time, Mbeki isn't likely to adopt policies that
would frighten whites, particularly businessmen and skilled
professionals who are crucial to the economy. Lacking widespread
support and finances for radical social changes, he probably will
choose a large money-raising initiative _ such as a major tax
increase on corporations.
	   Mbeki's speech in Parliament was in essence a final warning for
the still white-dominated business community to voluntarily
contribute to improve the lot of blacks with training programs,
scholarships, profit-sharing plans and other programs.
	   The ANC is expected to win the 1999 election easily. But the
party is calling on supporters to produce a two-thirds majority in
Parliament, which would allow it to change the constitution and
govern with little opposition.
	   The ANC says it needs such power to overcome resistance to
overhauling social structures. But opposition parties are rallying
their followers with warnings that the ANC is seeking virtual
one-party rule.

Four Muslim extremists, soldier killed in gunbattle 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ At least four Muslim extremists
and a soldier have been killed in gunbattles in the southern
Philippines, the military said Saturday.
	   Clashes between soldiers and members of the fundamentalist Abu
Sayyaf group in Lantawan town on Basilan island erupted Friday and
continued through Saturday, forcing hundreds of villagers to flee.
	   Troops recovered rifles and a global positioning system from the
slain extremists, said Col. Glicerio Sua, commander of the Army's
103rd Infantry Brigade based in Basilan, about 890 kilometers (556
miles) south of Manila.
	   Sua said soldiers were sent to check a report Friday that about
50 armed men were seen in a village when they were fired upon by
members of the extremist group, triggering the clash.
	   The group has been blamed for numerous acts of violence,
including ransom kidnappings of foreigners, bombings and murders,
in the southern Philippines.
	   It is the smaller of two armed groups fighting for an Islamic
state in the south.
	   The bigger group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, has agreed
to a cease-fire with the government and is holding peace talks.
	   The Abu Sayyaf has been regarded as a bandit gang by the
government.
	   The mainstream rebel group, the Moro National Liberation Front,
signed a peace accord in 1996.
	   Meanwhile, about 200 former MNLF guerrillas returned to an army
training camp they left last Tuesday to protest alleged strictness
and mistreatment by trainers, military and MNLF officers said.
	   The former rebels are undergoing training prior to their
integration as regular members of the armed forces.
	   A total of 7,500 former Muslim rebels are to be accepted into
the country's military and police forces under the peace accord
that ended a quarter-century rebellion that killed more than
120,000 people on southern Mindanao Island.
	   At least three of the trainers, including one officer, were
reportedly relieved. The military's Southern Command, which
supervises the integration, refused to comment.

Hamas says it being asked to participate in Arafat government 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The radical Islamic group Hamas
said Saturday it is weighing an invitation to become part of Yasser
Arafat's government.
	   Hamas, which bitterly opposes the Oslo peace accords and has
killed scores of Israelis in suicide bombing attacks, has never
before sought any official position in Arafat's Palestinian
Authority.
	   However, Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said representatives of
the group had been asked to meet Tuesday with Arafat to discuss
participation in the next government.
	   ``This offer is being studied in Hamas right now, and we will
respond in the right time,'' he said.
	   Earlier this week, Arafat announced plans to reshuffle his
Cabinet, and senior PLO official Assad Abdel Rahman said all
Palestinian political groups, including Hamas, would be consulted.
	   The potential rapprochement could signal a bid by Arafat to
neutralize the growing Hamas challenge to his authority.
	   However, that could complicate Arafat's dealings with Israel and
the United States, who have been pressuring the Palestinian leader
to crack down on militant groups like Hamas.
	   Relations between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas have been
badly strained in recent months.
	   Hamas is angry over the death in March of its chief bombmaker,
which the Palestinian Authority blamed on a power struggle within
the group. Arafat's police launched a widespread arrest campaign in
Hamas' ranks after the mystery killing.
	   Arafat's allies, meanwhile, have been worried over the highly
successful regional lobbying and fundraising tour of Hamas
spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin, who is expected to return to
Gaza sometime in the next week.
	   On Saturday in Gaza, Hamas staged a sit-in protest of about 100
local leaders demanding the release of Hamas spokesman Abdel Aziz
Rantisi, who has been jailed since April, when he made statements
critical of Arafat's government.
	   Rantisi was charged with endangering national security, but the
Palestinian Supreme Court last week ordered him freed for lack of
evidence.
	   Palestinian security forces usually ignore court orders and keep
detainees in custody until their release is approved by Arafat.
	   Rantisi was arrested after he blamed the Palestinian Authority
and several high-ranking Palestinian officials and security chiefs
for collaborating with Israel in the March 29 death of Hamas
bombmaker Mohiyadine Sharif.
	   Sharif was found dead at the scene of a car explosion in the
West Bank city of Ramallah.

England loses to New Zealand A Eds; ADDS quotes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand A fly-half Lee
Stensness scored a decisive try early in the second half to lift
the shadow All Blacks to an 18-10 win over England on Saturday.
	   England produced a markedly improved effort from last week's
record 76-0 test loss to Australia in Brisbane and held a 10-8
half-time lead.
	   Giant winger Jonah Lomu, trying to prove his fitness for the All
Blacks test against the tourists next Saturday, had a quiet game,
kept under control by dreadful weather conditions.
	   Belting rain and high winds made it an uncomfortable experience
for both sides.
	   Center Caleb Ralph also crossed for a try for the home team
while Adrian Cashmore kicked two penalties and a conversion.
Gloucester lock Rob Fidler scored England's try while fly-half Josh
Lewsey kicked one penalty and one conversion.
	   England captain Matt Dawson said it was impossible to string
together any decent moves as the ball often popped from their grip.
	   ``It was difficult to get any sort of continuity,'' Dawson said.
``I was very proud the way our forwards worked but we're
disappointed with the loss.''
	   After the humiliation against Australia, England coach Clive
Woodward's side looked more competitive and were better
defensively.
	   Lomu was taken off 21 minutes before the end and is no certainty
to be picked next week.
	   ``It was good to see the boys enter the dressing room with their
heads down. They knew they could have won it tonight,'' Woodward
said.
	   `I think if we were more streetwise in the second half, as we
were in the first half, we would have won tonight,'' he said.
	   Scorers:
	   New Zealand A 18 (Caleb Ralph, Lee Stensness tries; Adrian
Cashmore 1 goal, 2 penalty goals) def. England 10 (Rob Fidler try;
Josh Lewsey pen con).

Death toll from virus toll rises to 36

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A killer virus that strikes children has
claimed three more lives, raising the death toll to 36, a
government official said Saturday.
	   Hsu Kuo-hsiung, an official of the Health Department, said a boy
died in Taipei, and a girl and a boy died in Taichung, central
Taiwan, early this month.
	   He said the disease caused by the enterovirus 71 virus has shown
signs of abating since it peaked in late May.
	   ``The virus has abated, and I have repeatedly urged the public
not to panic,'' Hsu told reporters.
	   That contradicted a prediction earlier this week by a well-known
doctor that the virus had reached its peak in central Taiwan, but
would now move on to northern Taiwan and could spread to Southeast
Asia and Hong Kong.
	   Separately, a hospital said Saturday that it has found evidence
that the disease was attacking the brains of victims.
	   The Chinese Medical College's affiliate hospital said studies
showed the virus had entered the lower part of the brain in some of
the victims. It said 12 children whose brains had been infected had
recovered because of early diagnosis.
	   Lee Ching-yun of the National Taiwan University predicted the
virus could infect up to half a million children, but would kill
only a few.
	   The virus, spread by physical contact, hits Taiwan each summer.
Hsu said an analysis has been conducted on whether this year's
outbreak was caused by a variation of the virus, and results will
be announced next week. Three U.S. experts were conducting a
separate analysis of the virus, he said.
	   No adults were found to have the virus because they have already
been exposed to it and are immune, he said.
	   Health authorities said at least 10,000 cases had been reported
in the past two months, including 269 in Taipei county.
	   Early symptoms are similar to the flu, with fever, headache or
vomiting. Later, ulcers or blisters in the mouth and a rash on the
hands and feet can develop. Complications from the virus can
include encephalitis, meningitis, and acute inflammation of the
heart muscle.
	   Officials told anxious parents to keep their young children at
home or to be sure they washed their hands frequently and had clean
changes of clothing.
	   Authorities have conducted disinfection at nursery and
elementary schools.
	   Chen Yen-chueh, principle of Taipei's Yenai Elementary School,
said students were taught to report to teachers any fellow students
developing blisters or other symptoms, and were asked to wash their
hands before entering the classroom.

New regime denies seizing Nigerian military brass 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military regime has refuted
reports that key members of Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar's inner circle
were arrested for planning a mutiny.
	   In a statement issued late Friday, military spokesman Col.
Godwin Ugbo dismissed accusations that high-ranking military brass
had been seized for plotting insurrection against the new regime
led by Abubakar.
	   ``The story is a lie and should be discounted by all
Nigerians,'' Ugbo said.
	   Officials who asked to remain anonymous earlier told The
Associated Press that the two top military officials had been
placed under house arrest. The report could not be independently
confirmed.
	   Since Abubakar was sworn in Tuesday just a day after military
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha died of heart failure, pro-democracy
protests have been quelled with teargas and warning shots in the
commercial hub of Lagos.
	   Abacha's five-year regime was marked by severe repression of
critics.

Companies in Singapore using pay cuts, compulsory leave to avoid layoffs 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore companies are cutting wages and
ordering employees to take time off as the effects of the Asian
economic crisis begin to be felt in this island republic, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The measures are in line with recent government recommendations
for ``wage restraint'' and other cost cutting moves to bolster
ailing businesses and avoid excessive layoffs.
	   But the guidelines have come amid warnings that the number of
layoffs this year will likely exceed the record high of 20,000
registered during a recession in the mid-80's.
	   A report in The Straits Times said that in order to contain
unemployment, about 40,000 new jobs must be created each year,
because 56,000 graduates and other workers seek jobs annually,
while only 16,000 leave the work force.
	   Unemployment grew to 2.2 percent in the first quarter of 1998,
due in part to more than 7,000 layoffs caused by the economic
crisis that has gripped Asia.
	   U.S. multinational Motorola, which employs about 1,500 people in
its Singapore plant, told the newspaper that it hoped to save as
many jobs as possible.
	   Instead of cutting pay, the electronics giant has encouraged its
workers to begin using their annual leave, and has reduced work
days. In March, Motorola employees were asked to take one day off
each week, and the company will shut down its plant five days this
month.
	   But such flexible work schemes may be the exception for
cost-cutting measures in Singapore businesses.
	   The newspaper said some companies are already resorting to pay
cuts, rather than compulsory leave, to avoid layoffs and to stay
profitable.

Four hostages reported released in Dagestan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Four women who were among 10 Russian military
personnel taken hostage in the Caucasus republic of Dagestan have
been released, a news report said Saturday.
	   A military bus carrying the personnel was seized Thursday night
in a suburb of the Dagestani capital Makhachkala, Russian
television said. The women were ordered off the bus, which then was
taken in the direction of neighboring Chechnya with the remaining
six servicemen, the report said.
	   A wave of kidnappings has recently broken out in the Caucasus
republics of Dagestan, Ingushetia and North Ossetia.
	   On Friday, three Ingush were abducted in North Ossetia, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said, and two residents of the Ossetian
village of Zamankul were kidnapped by masked gunmen.
	   Earlier this week, North Ossetian villagers detained five Ingush
bus passengers in apparent retaliation for the kidnapping of seven
of their neighbors in the Ossetian village of Batako.
	   The abduction of the Russians on Thursday was apparently
retribution for the kidnapping of the Batako residents, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Predominantly Orthodox Christian North Ossetia and Muslim
Ingushetia fought a short but bloody war in 1992. Hundreds of
people were killed and most ethnic Ingush were expelled from North
Ossetia.

category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The United States may sidestep the United
Nations if it decides that only force will compel Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to end an offensive against Albanian
ethnics in troubled Kosovo. ``A resolution may be desirable but is
not required,'' U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Friday in London as U.S. allies imposed a boycott on Yugoslav
commercial flights to and from their countries. They withheld
tougher action until Milosevic meets Tuesday in Moscow with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin. ``The Russians are as concerned as we
are,'' Albright said. ``We are all working together as much as we
can on this.'' (US-KOSOVO)
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Five African leaders will take the lead
role in seeking peace in the Horn of Africa where Ethiopia and
Eritrea are engaged in a deadly border dispute, the Eritrean
government said Saturday. The men appointed by the Organization of
African Unity were tentatively scheduled to go to the Ethiopian
capital Addis Ababa on Thursday, and to the Eritrean capital Asmara
on Friday, presidential spokesman Yemane Gebremeskel said. The team
will be led by Burkina President Blaise Campaore in his role as
current OAU chairman. Also participating are presidents Robert
Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Hassan Gouled Aptidon of Djibouti, Pasteur
Bizimungu of Rwanda, and OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim,
Yemane said. (ERITREA-ETHIOPIA)
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Government troops from the former
Portuguese colony of Guinea-Bissau kept up their siege of a group
of renegade soldiers as tens of thousands of people fled the
fighting, according to media reports. As many as 40,000 people in
the West African nation on foot along clogged roads to the northern
border with Senegal, a Portuguese journalist reported on Friday.
Senegal closed the border on Thursday, and medical teams were
dispatched to vaccinate the refugees against yellow fever and
meningitis, Pedro Rosa Mendes told Portuguese state radio Antena 1.
Government troops, supported by soldiers from neighboring Senegal
and the Republic of Guinea, kept up their siege of a military
garrison in a northern suburb of the capital, Bissau, where the
rebels have been holed up since their coup attempt Sunday.

Hanson's right-wing One Nation Party has already emerged as the
contest's big winner. Her year-old party, which is considered
anti-Aboriginal and anti-Asian, dominated the campaign and early
returns showed it pulling 26 percent of the state's 2 million
voters, possibly depriving either mainstream party of a governing
majority in Parliament. In at least 12 of the state's 89 electoral
districts, One Nation was leading in the early partial returns with
40 percent of the vote or more. In one district, it was carrying 51
percent. (AUSTRALIA-QUEENSLAND ELECTION)
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Four days after a cyclone battered western
India, officials have raised the official death toll to 828 people.
But residents say the figure is in the thousands, with many people
swept into the sea. Most of the casualties of the storm were salt
workers or employees of the port at Kandla, 530 kilometers (330
miles) northwest of Bombay. The Gujarat government based its death
toll on the number of bodies recovered. But thousands of people,
mostly migrants, were working at the salt pans when the cyclone
struck, said aid worker Khimji, who uses only one name. Many of
them probably were swept into the sea. While the cyclone brewed in
the Arabian Sea, Khabari and others were busy scraping salt off the
ground, news of the impending cyclone _ with 120 kph (75 mph) winds
_ never reached the workers, most of them illiterate and too poor
to own even a radio. (INDIA-CYCLONE)

Price of corn meal staple rises by 12 percent 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Private millers hiked the price of corn
meal by 12 percent Saturday, rejecting government pleas to keep
down the price of Zimbabwe's staple food.
	   A rise in the price of corn sold by the state Grain Marketing
Board, the biggest supplier, forced the increase, milling companies
said.
	   The board raised the price by 8 percent from 2,400 Zimbabwe
dollars (dlrs 130) to 2,600 Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 140) a ton ,
said Ephraim Hwingwiri, head of the Small Scale Millers
Association.
	   ``Our price increments have now been adjusted to about 12
percent,'' he said.
	   It was unclear why private millers exceeded the marketing
board's percentage hike.
	   Prices in the shops on Saturday reflected the hike.
	   Large milling firms increased ordinary corn meal from 89.11
Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 4.80) to 99.80 Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 5.40)
for a 20 kilogram (44 pound) bag.
	   Since food riots in January left at least six people dead, the
government has repeatedly appealed to food producers to hold down
prices.
	   But producers and the grain board say they are facing viability
problems and prices were set by market conditions in the troubled
economy.
	   Troops backed by armored cars and helicopters quelled the
January riots that were triggered by food price increases of more
than 25 percent.
	   Since the Zimbabwe dollar plunged by nearly 60 percent in value
against the U.S. currency in November, inflation has exceeded 30
percent.

French prosecutors say they'll investigate ticket scandal AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with local authorities initiating criminal probes
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities said for the first time Saturday
that they were ready to investigate the growing international
scandal involving World Cup tickets.
	   The Paris prosecutor's office said fans in France who were
cheated by ticket brokers or tour operators should file a complaint
including ``evidence to determine how and where the events
occurred.''
	   A local marketing arm of the company that handles sponsors and
TV contracts for soccer's ruling body filed its own complaint in
the case.
	   ISL Marketing France, which is partly owned by the Swiss-based
ISL company, said it was ``a victim of fraud'' by a consultant who
apparently sold thousands of tickets to which he had no access.
	   FIFA, the international soccer body, and the French World Cup
organizing committee said earlier in the week that they would file
lawsuits against companies or individuals found to have taken part
in frauds, which have left thousands of fans without tickets they
had been promised or even paid for.
	   The organizers also urged victims of the frauds to files
lawsuits themselves.
	   Saturday's actions were the first steps to initiate criminal
prosecution and underscored the impact the ticket scandal was
having on the World Cup, which began Wednesday and runs until July
12.
	   For more than a year, organizers have defended their
ticket-distribution plan against criticism that it was unfairly
weighted toward French fans and sponsors. Of the 2.7 million
tickets printed, almost 1.5 million were earmarked for interests in
the host country, with the rest distributed through tightly
licensed channels.
	   Soccer federations worldwide and commercial sponsors of the
World Cup received almost 1.2 million tickets to distribute through
their own channels, leaving only 138,000 for the general public.
	   Fans were told to deal with 17 approved agencies worldwide to
get those tickets. But officials said the problem now exploding in
France as fans arrive for matches without tickets they thought
would be waiting for them came from unlicensed brokers and tour
operators, especially in Japan, where some 12,000 fans were left
ticketless.
	   Similar, although smaller, cases have been reported in Britain,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Brazil.
	   Although just two of the first seven games had capacity crowds,
all tickets have been sold, and officials have told fans not to
expect last-minute buys.
	   ``Do not come to France. It is no use'' to try to buy tickets
now, said Jacques Lambert, managing director of the French
organizing committee.
	   FIFA has another ticket problem on its hands _ national soccer
leaders who turn their access to legal tickets into illicit
profits.
	   FIFA said Friday it was investigating Cameroon, where soccer
federation president Vincent Onana was detained as he tried to
leave his country with the national team. He was placed under
investigation this week for embezzlement of public funds, accused
of supplying an English agency with 3,000 tickets worth dlrs
660,000.
	   FIFA also said it was investigating a ticket case in an
unidentified South American country, but on Saturday it said early
evidence indicated that country might be cleared.
	   ``Our investigation tends to indicate this federation is
innocent,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said. He gave no indication
that the investigation was closed.
	   French reports have identified the country as Colombia. The
Colombian soccer federation has denied that and said FIFA told
officials that it was not involved.

Solidarity wants to ban former top communist officials from politics 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Solidarity parliament members are to
discuss next week a plan to ban former communist party and secret
service officials from public and political life, a newspaper said
Saturday.
	   The Zycie rightist daily said a group of Solidarity deputies
want a 10-year ban for communist government members and top party
leaders before 1989. Lesser activists, administration and security
officials would be banned from posts in the media, public firms and
state administration for five years.
	   Officials who would not resign their posts, would face criminal
charges, the report said.
	   Solidarity, the senior partner in the coalition government of
Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, is to discuss the plan early next week,
Zycie said.
	   It was not yet known when it could be debated by the powerful,
rightist-dominated lower house, or Sejm. But the authors of the
plan expect ex-communist President Aleksander Kwasniewski would
veto it.
	   Stefan Niesiolowski, one of the plan's authors, said that
``regardless of its chances, we owe such a bill to the nation. This
is why Solidarity won the elections,'' last fall.
	   After they were ousted from power in 1989, the former communists
secured their well-being in private businesses. They were voted
back for four years in 1993 and further secured their position
linking business with politics. They are the second largest
parliamentary caucus now.
	   Efforts to screen former communists out failed last year after
judges refused to sit on a screening panel. Parliament is close to
voting on an optional solution.

Australians beat Scotland 
</HEADLINE>
By TONY HARPER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian fullback Matthew Burke
scored 25 points as the Wallabies overwhelmed a committed Scottish
team 45-3 in their first rugby union test at the Sydney Football
Stadium on Saturday.
	   Scotland proved a far tougher opponent for the Wallabies than
England, which was swept aside in a record 76-0 Australian win a
week earlier. But the Wallabies were able to post another record by
finishing over top of the tired Scots _ it was their highest ever
score and best winning margin against Scotland.
	   The Wallabies, playing the second test of long season of 13
matches, were stifled by an impressive Scottish defensive display,
but the tourists let themselves down with ill-discipline and poor
ball control.
	   Burke scored one of Australia's three tries and kicked four
penalties and three conversions as Scotland kept giving up vital
penalties within scoring range.
	   ``Scotland came out very fired up and we knew they would _ their
defense was outstanding, they swamped us, but we stuck to our
game,'' said Wallaby captain John Eales.
	   Australian fly-half Stephen Larkham took a few hard knocks in
the first half as Scotland's captain Rob Wainwright made good his
promise to tackle the new pivot.
	   Loose forwards Wainwright, Eric Peters and Gordon Simpson choked
Australia's backline and the Scots also deserved plaudits for their
attacking intentions.
	   Scotland ran the ball from the first touch, deep inside their
half, and continued to throw the ball around as the game slipped
further out of reach.
	   While the Scots struggled to please South African referee Andre
Watson, they were further unsettled by the early loss of hooker
Gordon Bulloch with a dislocated shoulder. Replacement Kevin
McKenzie was unable to control his lineout throws as Eales
continually picked him off.
	   Burke opened the scoring on 15 minutes with his second penalty
attempt and missed another before edging Australia to a 6-0 gap.
	   Tim Horan crossed for his 25th try in tests on 35 minutes after
a great run by fellow center Daniel Herbert.
	   Derrick Lee opened Scotland's account in the final minute of the
half, booting his only penalty attempt.
	   Another Burke penalty restored Australia's 13-point lead shortly
after the break before winger Joe Roff sent him over for a try.
	   Roff regathered a chip ahead down the flank and passed inside to
give Burke an easy passage to the line.
	   Right winger Ben Tune, who scored a hat-trick against England,
added Australia's third try when he scooped up a loose ball after
some good Wallaby buildup and crossed untouched.
	   Burke's intervention in the backline made the break that led to
Tune's second while David Wilson rounded off the victory with a
last minute touch down to mark his 50th test.
	   Scotland gave debuts to New Zealand born duo Glenn Metcalfe and
Gordon Simpson, who qualified for Scotland through their
grandparents. The second test between the teams will be played at
Ballymore in Brisbane on June 20.
	   Scorers:
	   Australia 45 (Ben Tune 2, Tim Horan, Matthew Burke, David Wilson
tries; Burke 4 goals, 4 penalty goals) def. Scotland 3 (Derrick Lee
1 penalty goal).
	   Australia: Matthew Burke, Ben Tune, Daniel Herbert, Tim Horan,
Joe Roff, Stephen Larkham, George Gregan, Toutai Kefu, David
Wilson, Matt Cockbain, John Eales (captain), Tom Bowman, Andrew
Blades, Phil Kearns, Richard Harry. Reserves: Chris Whitaker,
Nathan Grey, Jason Little, Willie Ofahengaue, Owen Finegan, Dan
Crowley, Jeremy Paul.
	   Scotland: Glenn Metcalfe, Derrick Lee, Cameron Murray, Rowen
Shepherd, Shaun Longstaff, Gregor Townsend, Bryan Redpath, Eric
Peters, Gordon Simpson, Robert Wainwright (captain), Stuart Grimes,
Scott Murray, Matthew Proudfoot, Gordon Bulloch, David Hilton.
Reserves: Craig Joiner, Duncan Hodge, Graeme Burns, Adam Roxburgh,
Stewart Campbell, Gordon McIlwham, Kevin McKenzie.

Sri Lanka delays lifting censorship of foreign reporting of civil war 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka has delayed an end to
censorship of foreign reporting of its civil war, officials said
Saturday.
	   Rebels among Sri Lanka's minority Tamils want a homeland in the
north and the east to end what they call discrimination by the
majority Sinhalese. The war, which started in 1983, has killed more
than 52,000 people.
	   Journalists had expected an announcement Friday since President
Chandrika Kumaratunga approved lifting the restrictions, but legal
officials have not finished drafting the new regulation in the
three national languages _ Sinhalese, English and Tamil _ said
government officials, who requested anonymity.
	   The announcement is likely to come Monday, officials said.
	   Journalists would still have to submit all military news to a
censor before publication. The government does not allow
journalists into war zones, except on conducted tours. With few
telephones in northeastern Sri Lanka, reporters have to rely on
news from travelers and handouts from the military and rebels.
	   The government imposed censorship on June 5 after heavy fighting
in northern Sri Lanka against Tamil Tiger guerrillas.
	   Media watchdogs and human rights groups criticized the
regulation. The Foreign Correspondents Association said the
decision was a denial of a basic human rights and could precipitate
rumors and false reporting.
	   Deputy Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte told Parliament on
Wednesday that 208 soldiers and 225 rebels were killed in 10 days
of fighting starting May 28 for control of a strategic highway.
	   Ratwatte said the censorship was a temporary measure aimed at
not letting the enemy know about government operations.
	   Among the items deleted from stories was the ethnic composition
of Sri Lanka and statements by the defense ministry spokesman. At
one point, the censor instructed news agencies to substitute the
word ``terrorists'' for ``rebels.''
	   Government troops, backed by the artillery and air force, were
fighting near Mankulam, the last Tamil rebel-held town on a road
that troops have been trying to capture since May, 1997.

450 graduates fail test to join Egyptian foreign service

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt gave its foreign service test to 450
government employees who aspire to be diplomats. All of them
failed, an official said Saturday.
	   The candidates were probably not prepared for such ``a tough
examination,'' said a foreign ministry official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   The test, which was administered last month, included questions
on current affairs, international law and foreign languages.
	   Egypt's Foreign Ministry is looking to expand the foreign
service as it opens new missions abroad. Diplomats are usually
recruited from the civil service.

Guinea-Bissau rebels say they will use tanks to break siege 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Rebels in Guinea-Bissau, in West Africa,
on Saturday said they would use tanks to break the government's
siege of their positions in the capital Bissau, according to
reports.
	   The rebels broadcast their intention to deploy tanks in downtown
areas on a private Bissau radio station they captured last week,
Portuguese radio RDP-Africa said.
	   RDP-Africa reported heavy fighting early Saturday in the
capital.
	   Government troops, supported by soldiers from neighboring
Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, pinned an unknown number of
renegade soldiers in a military garrison in a northern suburb of
Bissau following their attempted powergrab last Sunday.
	   Some rebels also held positions near a barracks on the south
side of the coastal city.
	   Guinea-Bissau Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva
described the rebel strongholds as ``strategic defensive
positions.''
	   Fighting between the two sides has been characterized by the
lobbing of shells, punctuated by exchanges of automatic gunfire. No
figures were available for the number of casualties.
	   The military garrison where most of the rebels are holed up was
reportedly used by a tank battalion, supporting the besieged
soldiers' claim to be able to break out.
	   But Delfim da Silva told The Associated Press in Lisbon where he
was stranded due to flight cancellations that ``The tanks have not
been maintained. They're old, Soviet-built tanks.''
	   The rebels, led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, demanded that the foreign troops be withdrawn from the
country and that international phone lines, cut on Thursday, be
restored, RDP-Africa said.
	   They also offered to negotiated an end to the coup attempt with
the government at a foreign venue and suggested Gambia, according
to the report.
	   Mane is from Gambia. He gained renown as a guerilla fighter in
the war against Portuguese colonial rule from 1961 to 1974. He was
later appointed head of the armed forces after independence even
though he spoke no Portuguese, the country's official language.
	   Mane, who as fired in January amid allegations of arms smuggling
to rebels in Senegal, has accused President Joao Bernardo Vieira of
corruption and called on him to step down so that early elections
can be held.
	   Vieira himself came to power in a 1980 coup. He was elected in
the country's first democratic elections for president and
parliament four years ago.
	   Portuguese daily Publico reported that many thousands of
refugees were traveling on foot along the road between Bissau and
the northern border with Senegal.
	   Senegalese officials reportedly were allowing the refugees into
the country after they were vaccinated against yellow fever and
meningitis by medical teams at the border post.
	   More than 2,200 foreigners were evacuated from Bissau by a
Portuguese container ship on Thursday. They were taken to Dakar,
Senegal, where planes were waiting to fly them home on Friday.
	   More than 600 Portuguese were due to arrive Saturday at Lisbon
airport.

New regime's force hints that change may come slowly in Nigeria arrested suspected mutineers in Abubakar's inner circle. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with new military regime denying it

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The protesters came to march for
democracy. What they got was a strong dose of tear gas _ and a
warning that Nigeria's new military leader could be as intolerant
of opposition as its old.
	   Police and soldiers firing tear gas and bullets into the air
turned back hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators Friday as they
tried to mark the anniversary of annulled presidential elections
and call for a return to civilian rule.
	   The main demonstration never really got going, though; the
security forces stopped the marchers from getting to the bus
terminal where they'd planned to gather, as well as other spots
where they had come together in the Yaba district on Lagos' north
side.
	   The clashes came just three days after Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar
came to power following the death of Gen. Sani Abacha, whose
five-year dictatorship was marked by brutal repression of its
critics. Friday's violence seemed to indicate that things may not
change quickly.
	   ``We want the world to know that Nigerians want an end to
military rule,'' said Dele Alabai, a student at the University of
Lagos who turned out for the protest. ``This is not about Abacha or
about Abubakar. It is a struggle for democracy.''
	   The new regime, meanwhile, refuted reports that two key members
of Abubakar's inner circle had been arrested for planning a mutiny.
	   In a statement issued late Friday, military spokesman Col.
Godwin Ugbo denied that high-ranking military officials had been
seized earlier in the week for plotting an insurrection. ``The
story is a lie,'' Ugbo said.
	   Gani Fawehinmi, the fiery Lagos attorney who lead calls for the
demonstrations, was arrested when he arrived for Friday's protests.
Police also arrested Dupe Abiola, one of the wives of imprisoned
businessman Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of canceled 1993
elections. Both were charged with unlawful assembly and later
released, as were five other people known to have been arrested in
Lagos.
	   ``This new government shows signs of repression reminiscent of
Gen. Sani Abacha's diabolical regime,'' Fawehinmi said in an
interview after his release. ``It appears nothing has changed.''
	   Some democracy supporters saw hope in what had happened _
noticeably that the people arrested were quickly freed. During the
Abacha years, arrested people would often simply disappear for
months, and scores still languish in Nigerian prisons.
	   ``I think it's a good sign,'' said Clement Nwankwo, a prominent
human rights lawyer, adding that Friday's detainees may have been
freed to signal pro-democracy activists that things are changing
under Abubakar.
	   Demonstrators clashed with police a handful of times in Lagos on
Friday afternoon _ and each time the police drove them away with
tear gas and gunshots in the air.
	   About 15 kilometers (10 miles) west of the city, students from
the Lagos State College of Education clashed briefly with police
after running into the streets and burning tires, witnesses said.
They were subdued with tear gas, and 10 were arrested.
	   Protests were also held in a number of other cities around the
country, though all were reportedly broken up by authorities.
	   Authorities had repeatedly warned demonstrators that the Lagos
gathering was illegal and would be dealt with severely. Fearing
violence, many Lagos residents stayed home Friday, and the city's
normally crowded streets had only light traffic.
	   Friday's protests were initially organized to mark the
anniversary of the annulled elections and to call for freedom for
Abiola. But they took on added significance, coming only days after
Abubakar was appointed leader of this oil-rich but impoverished
West African country.
	   Abubakar already has infuriated the opposition by offering only
a vague pledge to move forward with democratic reforms and a
transition to civilian rule by Oct. 1.

Fernand Sastre, head of French World Cup committee 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Fernand Sastre, the co-president of the French
World Cup organizing committee who led France's drive to host the
championship, died of lung cancer Saturday, the committee said. He
was 74.
	   Sastre, a longtime official with the French Football Federation
(FFF), co-led the World Cup 1998 organizing committee with Michel
Platini. Hospitalized at Pitie-Salpetriere in Paris, Sastre died
three days after the soccer championship began.
	   It was under his leadership that France began campaigning in
1989 to host the World Cup, which paid off in 1992 when France was
chosen by the world federation FIFA.
	   The son of a farmer in French colonial Algeria, Sastre was born
Oct. 1, 1923 in the city of Kouba, where he became head of the
city's sports association in 1946.
	   Sastre was a member of the board of directors of the Algiers
Soccer League from 1955 to 1962, when Algeria won independence.
	   He was a member of the commission of the French Cup of the FFF
from 1962-68, secretary general of the FFF in 1969, president of
the federation from 1973-84 and honorary president since 1985. He
was vice-president of the national Olympic organizing committee in
1988.
	   His career in French government began as a tax inspector in
Algiers in 1948. Sastre went on to become a financial inspector at
the Ministry of Youth and Sports in 1977.
	   Sastre was decorated as an officer of the Legion of Honor and as
a commander of the National Order of Merit.
	   Funeral arrangements were pending.

Japan to give Laos 5.1 billion yen for Mekong bridge 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan has agreed in principle to loan
Laos 5.148 billion yen (dlrs 126 million) to construct a second
Mekong River bridge linking the land-locked country to neighboring
Thailand, the official Lao press said Saturday.
	   Japan is expected to approve the loan next month, and the
construction of the bridge should begin by the end of the year
2000, the news agency KPL said.
	   The financial arrangement for the 1.44 kilometer-long
(1,574-yard) bridge was agreed upon last Friday between the Lao
Ministry of Communication and Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund, KPL said.
	   The second international bridge will link Thailand's Mukdahan
Province, 640 kilometers (387 miles) to the northeast of Bangkok,
to Laos' Savanakhet. The Lao city lies on Highway 9 that runs to
the ports of Hue and Danang in central Vietnam.
	   In a separate development, Japan has agreed to grant 822.32
million yen (dlrs 20 million) in aid. The funds will be used for
the construction of an afforestation center and malaria control as
well as for debt relief for the first half of this year.
	   An agreement was signed last Wednesday between Foreign Minister
Somsavat Lengsavad and Japan's ambassador to Vientiane Hiroomi
Sakai.
	   Laos, one of the least developed country in the world, is
emerging from two decades of communist isolation, and is courting
foreign investment to help it upgrade infrastructure.

World Cup: Blazevic muses: Super Mario, up, back or middle? With Sports-Soccer-Jamaica-Croatia 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING TO ADD BC- DESIGNATOR
<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ ``Mario: Jack of all trades,'' a Zagreb
newspaper headlined. Who else but do-everything Mario Stanic? He
could be the key to Croatia's World Cup success.
	   Croatian news media welcomed coach Miroslav Blazevic's newest
idea of nudging Stanic closer to the attack, confident that the
midfielder could rise to the occasion.
	   Reliable in defense, industrious in the middle and downright
pesty in front of the opposition, Stanic is Croatia's most
versatile player.
	   Now that star striker Alen Boksic is out of the World Cup due to
an injury and defender Slaven Bilic may not be in peak form in the
opening game against Jamaica Sunday, the mercurial coach is
pondering various combinations.
	   In all of those, Super Mario features prominently.
	   ``I've never felt like our game depends in any special way on my
performance,'' the 26-year-old Stanic told national radio in an
interview Friday from the team's training camp in Vittel, France.
``Only teamwork can propel an individual to the stars.''
	   Stanic is an attacking midfielder by trade, a position he takes
up in Italian Seria A club side, Parma. But in Croatia's charge to
France, Blazevic was prompted to utilise his unique grit and verve
on virtually every patch of the paddock.
	   Blazevic said he mulled over the idea of pushing Stanic closer
to the opposition goal mouth to give his side more width and menace
in offense against Jamaica and Japan, their first opponents in
Group H.
	   ``I'm sure it's possible, but I'll make up my mind after another
two or three training sessions,'' Blazevic told national radio
Friday.

Eds: UPDATES with plane arriving in Albania; food supplies arriving
<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The first humanitarian flight carrying
relief for thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees who fled fighting
in Kosovo arrived here Saturday from Sarajevo.
	   The leading U.N. aid agency in the Bosnian capital and NATO set
up a limited airlift, carrying tents, Jerry cans, mattresses,
blankets and other non-food items to be distributed to the up to
13,000 Kosovo Albanians who sought shelter in northern Albania by
crossing the Yugoslav border.
	   ``It has a certain symbolic value that Bosnia-Herzegovina is
today providing help to its neighbors,'' said on Saturday Arnuev
Torbjornsen, deputy chief of mission of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees in Bosnia.
	   The plane landed at Tirana's Rinas airport around 1 p.m. (1100
GMT.
	   Meanwhile, Sasha Zarkovacki, a logistics officer of the U.N.
World Food Program in Tirana, said his agency received on Friday 47
tons of high-protein biscuits that arrived by ship in the port of
Durres. The food was taken from emergency stocks in Italy.
	   Zarkovacki said he expected 500 tons of food, including 430 tons
of flour and 70 tons of oil and beans, to arrive in Durres later
Saturday,to be distributed among the Kosovo refugees in the north.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Rebels in in the former Portuguese
colony of Guinea-Bissau said Saturday that they would use tanks to
break the government's siege of their positions in the capital
Bissau, according to reports.
	   The rebels broadcast their intention to deploy tanks in downtown
areas on a private Bissau radio station they captured last week,
Portuguese radio RDP-Africa said.
	   RDP-Africa reported heavy fighting early Saturday in the
capital.
	   Government troops, supported by soldiers from neighboring
Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, pinned an unknown number of
renegade soldiers in a military garrison in a northern suburb of
Bissau following their attempted powergrab last Sunday.
	   Some rebels also held positions near a barracks on the south
side of the coastal city in West Africa.
	   Guinea-Bissau Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva
described the rebel strongholds as ``strategic defensive
positions.''
	   Fighting between the two sides has been characterized by the
lobbing of shells, punctuated by exchanges of automatic gunfire. No
figures were available for the number of casualties.
	   The military garrison where most of the rebels are holed up was
reportedly used by a tank battalion, supporting the besieged
soldiers' claim to be able to break out.
	   But Delfim da Silva told The Associated Press in Lisbon where he
was stranded due to flight cancellations that ``The tanks have not
been maintained. They're old, Soviet-built tanks.''
	   The rebels, led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, demanded that the foreign troops be withdrawn from the
country and that international phone lines, cut on Thursday, be
restored, RDP-Africa said.
	   They also offered to negotiated an end to the coup attempt with
the government at a foreign venue and suggested Gambia, according
to the report.
	   Mane is from Gambia. He gained renown as a guerilla fighter in
the war against Portuguese colonial rule from 1961 to 1974. He was
later appointed head of the armed forces after independence even
though he spoke no Portuguese, the country's official language.
	   Mane, who as fired in January amid allegations of arms smuggling
to rebels in Senegal, has accused President Joao Bernardo Vieira of
corruption and called on him to step down so that early elections
can be held.
	   Vieira came to power in a 1980 coup. He was elected in the
country's first democratic elections for president and parliament
four years ago.
	   Portuguese daily Publico reported that many thousands of
refugees were traveling on foot along the road between Bissau and
the northern border with Senegal.
	   Senegalese officials reportedly were allowing the refugees into
the country after they were vaccinated against yellow fever and
meningitis by medical teams at the border post.
	   More than 2,200 foreigners were evacuated from Bissau by a
Portuguese container ship on Thursday. They were taken to Dakar,
Senegal, where planes were waiting to fly them home on Friday.
	   More than 600 Portuguese were due to arrive Saturday at Lisbon
airport.

Engineer faulted for collision of regional trains 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ An regional train engineer was faulted
by officials Saturday for the day earlier collision of two commuter
trains that injured 37 people, two of them seriously.
	   Horst Stammler, spokesman for the transportation office
investigating the accident, said the engineer on the train headed
southwest from Oestringen-Odenheim about 35 kilometers (20 miles)
northeast of Karlsruhe, failed to wait at a switch for orders to
continue.
	   Shortly thereafter, at about 4:25 p.m. Friday, another regional
train coming from the other direction collided headon with the
first train, Stammler said.
	   Stammler said that alcohol apparently played no role in the
accident, which he said was caused by an experienced engineer, who
was still being treated for shock. He has been suspended pending
further investigation and possible charges.
	   None of the 37 people hurt, including two still listed as
seriously injured, was in a life-threatening condition, Stammler
said.
	   Damage, including to the demolished diesel locomotives, was
estimated at about 500,000 marks (dlrs 282,500), he said.
	   The accident came just 10 days after a high-speed ICE passenger
train derailed 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover,
collapsing an overpass and killing 100 people in Germany's worst
post-war railway accident.

Death toll in Armenian bus fire rises to seven 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ A student died Saturday from burns
suffered in a bus fire last weekend, bringing the death toll in the
accident to seven.
	   More than 20 people were badly burned when the bus, carrying 40
students, teachers and parents returning from a picnic, exploded
last Sunday on a country road near the village of Bartsrashen, 30
kilometers (19 miles) south of Yerevan.
	   Officials said the explosion was apparently caused by a gas
leak.
	   Most buses and other vehicles in Armenia run on natural gas.
Gasoline is in short supply due to an economic blockade imposed by
neighboring Azerbaijan because of the two countries' territorial
conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.

Kosovo Albanians in Switzerland protest to United Nations 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The Kosovo Albanian community in Switzerland on
Saturday demanded that the United Nations help arm the ethnic
Albanian separatists warring with Serbs in the troubled Yugoslav
province.
	   Scores of people waving colorful banners emblazoned with the
words Solidarity with Kosovo gathered outside the U.N.'s European
headquarters to chant their demand for the partial lifting of the
U.N. arms embargo on Yugoslavia to help the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   More than 250 people have died in the escalating clashes between
Yugoslav government forces and the KLA, the armed wing of the
Albanian independence movement.
	   The protestors called for international recognition of the KLA
and also demanded the deployment of NATO troops within Kosovo.
	   The U.N. Security Council agreed to impose an arms embargo on
Yugoslavia in March, shortly after fighting broke out.
	   Under measures decided by defense ministers Thursday, NATO will
conduct simulated air attacks over Albania and Macedonia which may
start as soon as Sunday.
	   Ministers will also study options for further action ranging
from accelerated planning for military exercises to direct air
strikes inside Yugoslavia and use of ground troops.
	   Kosovo, which Serbs consider vital to their identity as a
people, has a population of 2 million. Nine out of 10 are
Albanians, most of whom seek autonomy, something Yugoslavia's
leader, Slobodan Milosevic, has refused.
	   Meanwhile, the Swiss government announced Friday it would delay
until the end of July further returns of people from Kosovo who
have been refused asylum in Switzerland.
	   The Bern authorities had said earlier this week the returns
would continue, but using scheduled flights, not charter jets.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Newly elected Archbishop Christodoulos
of Greece paid a courtesy visit to the spiritual leader of the
world's 300 million Orthodox Christians on Saturday, in a goodwill
gesture to mend ties with the ecumenical patriarch.
	   Relations with Patriarch Bartholomew I were strained during the
24-year reign of Christodoulos' predecessor, Archbishop Seraphim,
who often hinted that Bartholomew was trying to turn himself into a
pope-like figure with absolute power.
	   Christodoulos was formally welcomed by a religious ceremony at
the patriarchate, filled with priests and throngs of worshippers.
Bartholomew received him in the throne room later.
	   The patriarchate said in a statement that the visit of newly
elected archbishops to the Patriarchate was customary.
	   The ecumenical patriarch, based in Istanbul, is considered the
``first among equals'' with the other Orthodox patriarchs.
	   But Greece's Orthodox Church is independent and does not swear
allegiance to the patriarch.
	   Viewed as a reformer Christodoulos, 59, was enthroned in May as
the new head of the Greek Orthodox Church following his election
after the death of Seraphim.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A local bridge collapsed and firefighters
were pumping water from flooded basements on Saturday in some
southern Polish mountain villages, after rivers overflowed
following heavy rain.
	   A flood committee was formed in the region's central city of
Bielsko-Biala, some 32 kilometers (20 miles) east of the Czech
border, the state news agency PAP said.
	   A bridge collapsed and streets were flooded in Jaworze and
Jasienica threatening evacuation of residents. Water in the Olza
river, on the Polish-Czech border, rose above alarm level by 30
centimeters (12 inches), the report said.
	   The region is still recovering from floods last July that killed
55 people and caused nearly dlrs 3 billion in damage.

Eds: INSERTS new 7th graf to ADD Iran's strict Islamic code
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The publisher of a liberal Iranian newspaper
has been arrested after he ignored a court summons, newspapers
reported Saturday.
	   Mohammad Mahdavi Khorrami was arrested Wednesday after he failed
to appear before the court, Qods newspaper quoted a Tehran
judiciary spokesman as saying.
	   He is the publisher of Gozaresh-e-Ruz, a new and popular paper
that stopped publication last week after the Press Supervisory
Board charged it with violating press ethics. The Justice Ministry
is reviewing the complaint against Gozaresh-e-Ruz.
	   The action against the publisher of Gozaresh-e-Ruz, or ``Daily
Report,'' is seen as a setback for the press freedom that has been
allowed by moderate President Mohammad Khatami since he took office
in August.
	   The reforms introduced by Khatami are said to enjoy the support
of most Iranians. But conservative elements in the government,
particularly in the judiciary, are opposed to his policies.
	   The Farsi-language newspaper started publishing only last month
and on its third day it printed a front-page color picture of a
teenage boy with a teenage girl wearing a head scarf. The caption
read: ``Friendship Under Fear.''
	   Iran's strict Islamic code prohibits dating.
	   The Culture Ministry warned the newspaper to ``respect the Press
Law and the society's ethical and religious standards,'' the
English-language Iran News said.
	   Iran's constitution forbids the media from ``propagating
destructive and anti-Islamic attitudes.''
	   One of Iran's most popular newspapers, Jameah or ``Society,''
had its license revoked Wednesday after its editor was convicted of
defamation. The paper is continuing publication and has said it
will appeal the sentence.

	   ADIGRAT, Ethiopia (AP) _ Under the shade of eucalyptus trees
along Ethiopia's road to the front, young and old farmers waved
assault rifles Saturday as they danced in a circle and sang of war.
	   ``We will protect our country from Eritrean invasion,'' sang one
man in the circle's center. ``Yes,'' chanted the armed dancers,
several hundred unarmed men joining in with claps and cheers.
	   Raggedly dressed, some in shorts, these men were among what the
Ethiopian government says are thousands of volunteers for civil
militias, putting down their hoes for guns to help the army fight
Eritrean troops at the border.
	   Clashes that erupted between Eritrea and Ethiopia in early May
have spread to three fronts in confrontations both sides blame the
other for instigating.
	   Local militias formed mostly by retired rebels, who with the
assistance of Eritrean rebels overthrew Ethiopia's military
dictatorship in 1991, have remained over the years to police their
areas. Now, feeling betrayed by former friends, younger militiamen
came to take up arms and veterans prepared to fight again.
	   The support of the militia volunteers is encouraging to the
Ethiopian military.
	   ``They are extremely helpful to us and are boosting our
morale,'' Col. Ephrem Bangee said at the Zala Ambessa front on
Friday. ``The Ethiopian people are famous for defending their
country.''
	   In a roadside clearing about 35 kilometers (22 miles) south of
Zala Ambessa, several hundred new recruits prepared to go to the
front or to begin combat training.
	   ``Our country was invaded and I came to save it,'' said
26-year-old farmer Redaye, who like many Ethiopians goes by a
single name.
	   ``If I didn't protect them from the invaders, then how could I
face my children? How could I keep them safe?'' said the father of
two, holding a Kalashnikov assault rifle in one hand and a pack of
crackers in the other.
	   The militiamen are preparing to assist the soldiers at the front
lines in guard duty, collecting the wounded or even fighting, said
Zanabe, a local official in charge of the area's militia recruits.
	   Redaye, like all the militia volunteers in the group Saturday,
is from the northern Tigray region, whose fighters composed much of
the Ethiopian rebel force that fought along with Eritrean rebels to
oust a 17-year military dictatorship and bring Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi to power.
	   Eritrean rebels fought a 30-year-war for independence from
Ethiopia, which they then gained in 1993, leaving most to believe
the two countries were solid friends and neighbors. But economic
differences, especially over the establishment last year of the
Eritrean currency, the nafka, strained relations.
	   Still, Ethiopians said they were shocked and angered by the
Eritrean bombing of civilian targets; first hitting a school in the
town of Makele 120 kilometers (80 miles) south of Adigrat last,
killing 35 people, mostly children; then dropping bombs on Adigrat
on Thursday, leaving another four dead and 30 wounded.
	   ``The people feel that if things end peacefully it is good
because these people know what war is,'' Zanabe said. ``But if
things continue, and the bombings go on, then these people are
ready to fight.''
	   ``Even if they bombed Adigrat and Makele ten times, the
Ethiopian people won't be afraid,'' said Semingay, 23, sporting
bushy hair, a colorful scarf draped over his torn jacket, a T-shirt
and shorts. ``We are 100 percent sure we will succeed in the war.''

Japan to give Laos 5.1 billion yen for Mekong bridge

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan has agreed in principle to loan
Laos 5.148 billion yen (dlrs 36.5 million) to construct a second
Mekong River bridge linking the land-locked country to neighboring
Thailand, the official Lao press said Saturday.
	   Japan is expected to approve the loan next month, and the
construction of the bridge should begin by the end of the year
2000, the news agency KPL said.
	   The financial arrangement for the 1.44 kilometer-long
(1,574-yard) bridge was agreed upon last Friday between the Lao
Ministry of Communication and Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund, KPL said.
	   The second international bridge will link Thailand's Mukdahan
Province, 640 kilometers (387 miles) to the northeast of Bangkok,
to Laos' Savanakhet. The Lao city lies on Highway 9 that runs to
the ports of Hue and Danang in central Vietnam.
	   In a separate development, Japan has agreed to grant 822.32
million yen (dlrs 5.8 million) in aid. The funds will be used for
the construction of an afforestation center and malaria control as
well as for debt relief for the first half of this year.
	   An agreement was signed last Wednesday between Foreign Minister
Somsavat Lengsavad and Japan's ambassador to Vientiane Hiroomi
Sakai.
	   Laos, one of the least developed country in the world, is
emerging from two decades of communist isolation, and is courting
foreign investment to help it upgrade infrastructure.

Opposition leader on hunger strike to protest home arrest 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The leader of Tunisia's main opposition
party promised Saturday not to break his hunger strike until the
government ends his house arrest and harassment of his family.
	   Mohamed Mouadda, president of the Movement of Socialist
Democrats, began the strike June 3 after the government accused him
of undermining state security and conspiracy to assassinate unnamed
political figures.
	   Mouadda appealed to President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to end his
house arrest and drop the accusations against him. He promised to
continue the strike until the government met the demands, according
to a copy of the letter sent to The Associated Press.
	   Mouadda said his telephone line was cut and friends were banned
from paying him visits.
	   Mouadda was sentenced to 11 years in prison in February 1996,
then given a conditional pardon in December and placed under house
arrest. Mouadda's conviction for ``intelligence with a foreign
state'' has largely been viewed by human rights groups as an effort
to discredit him.
	   Human rights organizations have condemned Tunisia for what they
consider a systematic harassment of human rights activists and have
called for an end to practices that impinge on basic freedoms.
	   They cite harassment, denial of passports and arbitrary arrests
as common practice in Tunisia.

Fernand Sastre, head of French World Cup committee 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with minute of silence, ADDS background
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Fernand Sastre, who turned France's hopes of
staging the World Cup into reality and became co-president of the
organizing committee, died of lung cancer Saturday, the committee
said. He was 74.
	   Former soccer star Michel Platini, the other president of the
organizing committee, was among thousands who observed a minute of
silence for Sastre before the Saturday afternoon match between
Spain and Nigeria at a stadium in Nantes.
	   Sastre, who died three days after the World Cup kicked off, was
the often faceless but tireless administrator and businessman who
was instrumental in setting up the world's biggest single-sport
event.
	   Over the past months, with the organizational structure already
well in place, Sastre was seen less and less in public as he was
fighting lung cancer.
	   Last weekend he was rushed to Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in
Paris for emergency treatment. It was the same hospital where
Princess Diana died of her injuries from a car crash last year.
	   Sastre had been the driving force behind France candidacy for
the World Cup since 1983, when the French soccer federation, which
he presided, first started considering the project.
	   He headed France's bid committee from 1989 to 1992, when it beat
Morocco with a 12-7 vote to organize the 1998 edition.
	   The CFO organizing committee employs 640 people during the World
Cup and uses some 12,000 volunteers.
	   It was not Sastre's only major victory during his long career in
soccer.
	   When he was federation president, Les Bleus won the 1984
European Championships, with Platini the undisputed star, and the
French added the Olympic title in Los Angeles later that summer.
	   In 1982, the French also reached the semifinals of the World Cup
in Spain.
	   The son of a ``pied-noir'' farmer in French colonial Algeria,
Sastre was born Oct. 1, 1923 in the city of Kouba, where he became
head of the city's sports association in 1946.
	   Sastre was a member of the board of directors of the Algiers
Soccer League from 1955 to 1962, when Algeria won independence.
	   He was a member of the commission of the French Cup of the FFF
from 1962-68, secretary general of the FFF in 1969, president of
the federation from 1973-84 and honorary president since 1985. He
was vice-president of the national Olympic organizing committee in

Pro-government daily says dissolving parliament will solve little 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A pro-government newspaper said Saturday that
dissolving the Gulf's only elected parliament will not end the
crisis between the Cabinet and the legislature.
	   The editorial in Al-Anba is an indication that Kuwait's emir,
Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, may not disband parliament after his
Saturday meeting with the Cabinet.
	   Prime Minister Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah has complained
that his Cabinet can no longer cooperate with the 50-member
legislature, which he has accused of blocking economic reforms and
showing disrespect for members of his Cabinet.
	   ``We strongly believe that resorting to the disbanding of
parliament is neither the ideal nor the possible solution to our
current political crisis,'' the newspaper said.
	   Al-Anba said new elections were likely to bring back the same
legislators.
	   Relations between the Cabinet and parliament plummeted earlier
this month when a lawmaker decided to grill the interior minister,
Sheik Mohammed al-Khaled al-Sabah, accusing him of inefficiency in
fighting drugs and crime.
	   Sheik Mohammed is a member of the ruling family.
	   Lawmakers have accused the government of wasting public funds
and spending huge amounts of money to buy weapons that are
unsuitable for Kuwait.
	   ``The right solution is to explore the causes of the crisis with
absolute neutrality ... and to set up a new methodology for
cooperation,'' the editorial said.
	   The newspaper said although parliament has achieved little in
the two years since it was elected, the Cabinet also has failed to
take action on vital issues.
	   The government wants to privatize the economy to curb budget
deficits. But that would entail parliament approving measures that
are unpopular with voters, such as introducing taxes and fees for
services that have been heavily subsidized or offered free of
charge for decades.
	   Two Kuwaiti parliaments have been dissolved for severely
criticizing the government.
	   In both cases, in 1976 and 1986, the constitution was suspended
and elections were not called for years.

Hamas says it being asked to participate in Arafat government 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The radical Islamic group Hamas
said Saturday it is weighing an invitation to become part of Yasser
Arafat's government.
	   Hamas, which bitterly opposes the Oslo peace accords and has
killed scores of Israelis in suicide bombing attacks, has never
sought any official position in Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
	   Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said representatives of the group
were asked to meet Tuesday with Arafat to discuss participation in
the next government.
	   ``This offer is being studied in Hamas right now, and we will
respond in the right time,'' he said.
	   Earlier this week, Arafat announced plans to reshuffle his
Cabinet. Senior PLO official Assad Abdel Rahman said all
Palestinian political groups, including Hamas, would be consulted.
	   The potential rapprochement could signal a bid by Arafat to
neutralize the growing Hamas challenge to his authority.
	   However, that could complicate Arafat's dealings with Israel and
the United States, who have been pressuring the Palestinian leader
to crack down on militant groups like Hamas.
	   Relations between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas have been
badly strained in recent months.
	   Hamas is angry over the death in March of its chief bombmaker,
which the Palestinian Authority blamed on a power struggle within
the group. Arafat's police launched a widespread arrest campaign in
Hamas' ranks after the mystery killing.
	   Arafat's allies, meanwhile, have been worried over the highly
successful regional lobbying and fundraising tour of Hamas
spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin, who is expected to return to
Gaza sometime in the next week.
	   On Saturday in Gaza, Hamas staged a sit-in protest of about 100
local leaders demanding the release of Hamas spokesman Abdel Aziz
Rantisi, who has been jailed since April, when he made statements
critical of Arafat's government.
	   Rantisi was charged with endangering national security, but the
Palestinian Supreme Court last week ordered him freed for lack of
evidence.
	   Palestinian security forces usually ignore court orders and keep
detainees in custody until their release is approved by Arafat.
	   Rantisi was arrested after he blamed the Palestinian Authority
and several high-ranking Palestinian officials and security chiefs
for collaborating with Israel in the March 29 death of Hamas
bombmaker Mohiyadine Sharif.
	   Sharif was found dead at the scene of a car explosion in the
West Bank city of Ramallah.

Burundi's two vice presidents, Cabinet sworn in 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHE NKURUNZIZA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ President Pierre Buyoya urged his new
Cabinet at a swearing-in ceremony Saturday to forget ethnic
differences that have bloodied Burundi and work for peace and
reconciliation.
	   ``Your work is not for Hutus or Tutsis,'' Buyoya said. ``Your
work is for the Burundians _ to bring them peace. You must seek all
ways to bring about peace and reconciliation.''
	   At least 200,000 people, most of them civilians, have been
killed in fighting that began in 1993 after elements of the
Tutsi-dominated military assassinated the country's first
democratically elected president, a Hutu, in a failed coup.
	   Tutsis, who make up just 14 percent of Burundi's population of 6
million, have controlled the country for all but four months since
independence in 1962. Hutus make up 85 percent of the population
and their attempts to ascend to power have erupted into widespread
killings.
	   On Friday, Buyoya appointed two vice presidents, a Hutu and a
Tutsi, and 22 ministers, 12 of them Hutus. They were sworn in by
the Supreme Court at the National Assembly building.
	   Two members of the Cabinet, Foreign Minister Severin
Ntahomvukiye and Epepitas Beyegankandi, transport, posts and
telecommunications, missed the ceremony because they are out of the
country.
	   The new government was formed two days before peace talks
involving Burundi's political parties are scheduled to begin in the
northern Tanzania town of Arusha.
	   Julius Nyerere, Tanzania's former president, will preside over
the talks and has threatened to pack and go home if the Burundians
are not serious this time.
	   Buyoya boycotted last year's talks, saying Tanzania was not
neutral. He also alleged that Burundi's eastern neighbor permitted
Hutu extremists of the National Council for the Defense of
Democracy to mount cross border raids, a charge Tanzania denied.
	   Buyoya, a retired Tutsi army major, ousted a civilian government
in 1996. He said he was the only one capable of ending the spiral
of violence, but so far has failed to do so.
	   Angry regional leaders reacted to the coup by imposing sanctions
in order to force Buyoya to hand over power back to civilians.
	   On Saturday, Buyoya indicated he would ask that sanctions be
lifted when he goes to Arusha.
	   ``We have done what the leaders of the sub-region want,'' he
said.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The protesters came to march for
democracy. What they got was a strong dose of tear gas _ and a
warning that Nigeria's new military leader could be as intolerant
of opposition as its old.
	   Police and soldiers firing tear gas and bullets into the air
turned back hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators Friday as they
tried to mark the fifth anniversary of annulled presidential
elections and call for a return to civilian rule.
	   The main demonstration never really got going; the security
forces stopped the marchers from getting to the bus terminal where
they'd planned to gather, as well as other spots where they had
come together in the Yaba district on Lagos' north side.
	   The clashes came just three days after Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar
came to power following the death of Gen. Sani Abacha, whose
five-year dictatorship was marked by brutal repression of its
critics. Friday's violence seemed to indicate that things may not
change quickly.
	   ``We want the world to know that Nigerians want an end to
military rule,'' said Dele Alabai, a student at the University of
Lagos who turned out for the protest. ``This is not about Abacha or
about Abubakar. It is a struggle for democracy.''
	   The new regime, meanwhile, refuted reports that two key members
of Abubakar's inner circle had been arrested for planning a mutiny.
	   In a statement issued late Friday, military spokesman Col.
Godwin Ugbo denied that high-ranking military officials had been
seized earlier in the week for plotting an insurrection. ``The
story is a lie,'' Ugbo said.
	   Gani Fawehinmi, the fiery Lagos attorney who lead calls for the
demonstrations, was arrested when he arrived for Friday's protests.
Police also arrested Dupe Abiola, one of the wives of imprisoned
businessman Moshood
	   Abiola, the presumed winner of canceled 1993 elections. Both
were charged with unlawful assembly and later released, as were
five other people known to have been arrested in Lagos.
	   ``This new government shows signs of repression reminiscent of
Gen. Sani Abacha's diabolical regime,'' Fawehinmi said in an
interview after his release. ``It appears nothing has changed.''
	   Some democracy supporters saw hope in what had happened _
noticeably that the people arrested were quickly freed. At least 55
people reportedly were arrested across Nigeria, but most, if not
all, were believed to have been released by Saturday.
	   During the Abacha years, arrested people would often simply
disappear for months, and scores still languish in Nigerian
prisons.

Sanctions can't undo what's already done : Pakistan says 
</HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan warned Saturday that
economic sanctions by other countries cannot undo what has been
done in the nuclear arena.
	   ``The policy to punish in order to push the (nuclear)
non-proliferation agenda will not succeed,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Tariq Altaf told a news conference. ``It is unrealistic
and based on a fictional notion of the realities in South Asia.
	   Instead, Altaf said the international community should move
quickly to draw up a blueprint to resolve the 51-year-old Kashmir
dispute that has been the flash point of two wars between India and
Pakistan.
	   The uneasy neighbors fought a third war in 1971 over Bangladesh
or what was then East Pakistan.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this week,
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub warned that a fourth conflagration on
the Asian subcontinent would escalate into a nuclear war.
	   Calling India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party
government ``trigger happy,'' Ayub said, ``where such threats are
being made by Hindu fundamentalists, you can expect a nuclear
launch and a nuclear escalation.''
	   At a meeting in London on Friday, the world's leading
industrialized nations decided to deny non-humanitarian loans to
Pakistan and India in retaliation for their nuclear tests.
	   India detonated five nuclear tests on May 11 and 13. Pakistan
followed with six tests two weeks later.
	   ``Any sanctions will continue to remain unproductive,'' Altaf
said.
	   Both Pakistan and India have called for talks, but the offers
have deteriorated into accusations. Pakistan says India is
insincere and Altaf said ``Pakistan has lost faith in bilateral
talks with New Delhi.''
	   Successive attempts at bilateral talks to settle the Kashmir
dispute, a former princely state divided between the two countries,
have failed, said Altaf.
	   ``For 50 years the bilateral dialogue between Pakistan and India
has produced no results,'' he said, criticizing the industrialized
nations' call for more talks between the South Asian enemies.
	   ``To prescribe more of the same amounts to an abrogation of
responsibilities under the United Nations charter and international
law,'' Altaf said.
	   ``We do not have faith in this process any more . . .
nevertheless we are willing to resume these talks,'' he said. ``We
are making our best effort . . . we are not stopping at anything.''
	   The world's leading nations also warned Pakistan and India
against developing nuclear weapons, but Altaf said until the
outstanding issue of Kashmir is settled, the specter of war hangs
over the region.
	   ``That will be disastrous nor just for South Asia but it will
have much wider ramifications,'' he said. ``It is time for the
international community to translate promises of assistance into
practical measures which can be seen by everyone.''

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The first humanitarian flight carrying
relief for thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees who fled fighting
in Kosovo province arrived in neighboring Albania on Saturday from
Sarajevo.
	   The leading U.N. aid agency in the Bosnian capital and NATO set
up a limited airlift, carrying tents, mattresses, blankets and
other non-food items to be distributed to the up to 13,000 Kosovo
Albanians who sought shelter in northern Albania by crossing the
Yugoslav border.
	   ``It has a certain symbolic value that Bosnia-Herzegovina is
today providing help to its neighbors,'' Arnuev Torbjornsen, deputy
chief of mission of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees in Bosnia, said Saturday.
	   The plane landed at Tirana's Rinas airport around 1 p.m. (1100
GMT).
	   Meanwhile, Sasha Zarkovacki, a logistics officer of the U.N.
World Food Program in Tirana, said his agency received 47 tons of
high-protein biscuits on Friday that arrived by ship in the port of
Durres. The food was taken from emergency stocks in Italy.
	   Zarkovacki said he expected 500 tons of food, including 430 tons
of flour and 70 tons of oil and beans, to arrive in Durres later
Saturday,to be distributed among the Kosovo refugees in the north.

Ramos says democracy and development works in the Philippines 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ One day after the Philippines
celebrated 100 years of independence from Spain, a jubilant
President Fidel Ramos said Saturday that Filipinos have shown that
economic growth is possible in a young democracy.
	   The Philippines on Friday marked the centennial anniversary of
its declaration of independence from 333 years of Spanish rule in
nationwide festivities ushered in by the pealing of church bells
early in the morning.
	   Hundreds of thousands gathered around Manila's Rizal Park to
watch a parade depicting the country's struggle against Spanish
colonialism and a massive fireworks display over Manila Bay.
	   Speaking to reporters Saturday, Ramos said the celebration has
given a boost to this nation of 70 million and earned the goodwill
many countries.
	   ``In terms of our being a model as a democracy that has evolved
through self-determination and our people's struggle for democracy
and nation-building, there is plenty to begin by that because we're
showing that we have proven democracy and sustainable development
can go hand in hand,'' Ramos said.
	   During a centennial dinner late Friday, Ramos said the ``best is
yet to come'' for the Philippines as his successor, president-elect
Joseph Estrada, leads the country into the next century.
	   Ramos steps down on June 30 after six years in office.
	   The Philippines regained its reputation as the most freewheeling
democracy in Southeast Asia after Filipinos ousted the one-man rule
of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos in a ``people power'' revolt
in 1986.
	   Ramos has been credited with leading the country out of
political instability and economic stagnation.
	   The anti-Spanish revolution broke out in 1896 led by a secret
society of Filipino nationalists called the Katipunan.
	   Revolutionary leader Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo proclaimed
independence on June 12, 1898 in Kawit in Cavite province south of
Manila and established Asia's first republic under a democratic
republic.

French worry about Guivarc'h after great win over South Africa 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ After putting on a great show in a 3-0
thrashing of South Africa, France worried Saturday it could be
without striker Stephane Guivarc'h for much of the World Cup.
	   The center forward hobbled off early in the game with a badly
swollen left knee and it will take up to four days before the full
extent of the injury to the French league top scorer is known.
	   ``I hope to get him back before the end of the World Cup,'' said
French coach Aime Jacquet. ``He's in a lot of pain now.''
	   Guivarc'h left the match after only 26 minutes when he injured
himself desperately trying to reach a cross in the goalmouth.
``It's a pity because he had a great start to the game,'' said
Jacquet.
	   The unfortunate incident was quickly forgotten when his
replacement Christophe Dugarry scored France's first goal eight
minutes later and followed it up with an assist on the second goal.
	   The team that finished the game in Marseille is now expected to
start against Saudi Arabia on Thursday. In the other Group C match
Friday, Denmark beat Saudi Arabia 1-0 with a less that convincing
performance.
	   ``Now we have to stay united and keep on the pressure,'' said
Jacquet.
	   From defense to attack, everything came together for Les Bleus
Friday during their opening game. If the players found each other
almost blindly in those swirling Mistral winds off the
Mediterranean, hopes are that the quality of play can only improve.
	   ``Now that we are past that first test, we have confidence,''
said Jacquet.
	   France had not played a competitive match since a semifinal
shootout loss to the Czech Republic in the 1996 European
championships, and doubts abounded whether the team would have that
competitive edge for the World Cup.
	   After putting on the best collective performance of the finals
so far, Jacquet answered his many critics.
	   One shadow on France's performance was that key players Zinedine
Zidane and Didier Deschamps both earned their first yellow card. A
second one will earn them a one-game suspension.
	   While the attack performed much better than expected, with
20-year-old Thierry Henry finally providing penetration on the
wings, the defense was as solid as ever.
	   Marcel Desailly and Laurent Blanc didn't yield a single chance
to the South Africans and Fabien Barthez didn't have to stop a
single shot.
	   With the nation won over, it will be much easier now to face the
fickle Parisian crowds, who have whistled Les Bleus in the past.
	   In Marseille, the fiery Mediterranean crowd was behind the team
from the outset, and with fluent, open play, they cheered on wave
after wave of attacks.
	   ``We knew we could count on the Marseillais crowds,'' said
Jacquet.

Steel plant in southern Spain likely source of rise in radiation levels in Europe 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A steel mill in the southern Spanish city
of Algeciras was the probably source of a rise in radiation levels
detected in France, Switzerland and Italy in early June, a
spokeswoman for the national nuclear authorities said Saturday.
	   Radioactive scrap metal of unknown origin was melted down at the
Acerinox plant probably around the end of May, Spanish Nuclear
Security Council spokeswoman Fatima Rojas said.
	   The evidence suggests that the incident was linked with detected
increases of Cesium 137 in the atmosphere at the beginning of the
month primarily in France but also in Switzerland and Italy, Rojas
said.
	   According to the Council, the radioactive cloud moving north
from southern Spain went unnoticed because it was well below
``worrying'' levels.
	   It was not until Acerinox reported radiation in the ashes of its
foundry on June 9, that the connection was made between the
privately-owned Spanish steel mill and the growing concern in
Europe over the unexplained cloud, Rojas said.
	   The affected area of the plant has been sealed off and workers
called for a medical evaluation due Monday.
	   The Italian government has accused Spain of failing to inform it
about the leak. Environment Minister Edo Ronchi said the government
learnt the news following inquiries to the French.
	   ``We are not responsible for the lack of details about the
matter'' he said, responding to environmentalists' criticism in
Italy that the government held back information.

President of disputed region fires prime minister, appoints successor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ The president of the disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh region dismissed the prime minister on Saturday
and appointed a cabinet deputy in his place.
	   The dismissal of Prime Minister Leonardo Petrosyan was the
culmination of a leadership crisis that had roiled the region,
which is Armenian by ethnicity but located inside Azerbaijan.
	   Petrosyan, under fire from Parliament for his economic policies,
had submitted his resignation to President Arkady Gukasian last
week. Gukasian finally acted on the offer, appointing Zhirair
Pogasyan as the new premier.
	   Pogasyan, an electromechanical engineer by profession, had been
deputy chairman of the region's Council of Ministers since 1992. He
is charged with forming a new government within 10 days.
	   Earlier in the week, a senior Armenian official had traveled to
Nagorno-Karabakh in a failed effort to heal the split in its
leadership.
	   Nagorno-Karabakh enjoys close relations with Armenia. It
declared independence in early 1988 and drove Azerbaijani troops
out with Armenia's help.
	   Despite a 1994 truce, occasional skirmishes have broken out.
Internationally brokered talks to end the conflict have stalled.

Organizers of Brenner freeway blockade fall short of their aims 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A 28-hour blockade of the Brenner Pass on
the Austrian-Italian border in protest against increasing truck
traffic ended Saturday, but its organizers fell far short of their
objectives.
	   Only about 1,000 participants _ including Tyrol province
governor Wendelin Weingartner _ took part in a political rally on
Friday. The rainy, chilly weather kept the crowd far below
organizers' expectations.
	   Organizers claimed that a total of 7,000 people had attended
rallies on the Brenner pass on both days, but the figure appeared
overblown.
	   More importantly, the predicted traffic snarls on both sides of
the border did not materialize.
	   On both days, police and the Austrian automobile club reported
there were no serious problems on highways in Austria and Italy
despite the blockade.
	   Ferdinand Knapp, the highest police officer in Tyrol province,
said that German tourists had been advised to plan their arrivals
and departures at northern Italian resorts to avoid the blockade.
	   The protest was directed against what are seen as intolerable
noise and pollution levels plaguing residents along the main
north-south artery as a result of increasing truck traffic and
against European Union traffic policy in general.
	   Austria's transit agreement with the European Union expires in
2002 when existing curbs on truck traffic on the main thoroughfares
would be lifted unless a new agreement is reached.
	   Fritz Gurgiser, the chairman of Transit Forum Tirol Austria, the
protest organizers, also warned that according the recent European
Union forecasts truck traffic on the Brenner pass is expected to
increase from a current 1.2 million to 2.8 million trucks a year by
the year 2010.
	   Austrian transport Minister Caspar Einem on Friday also showed
understanding for the grievances of the protesters, who included
local residents and environmentalists. He called for increasing
road trucking tolls.
	   But Sebastian Lechner, head of the Bavarian road haulage
association in neighboring Germany, indicated his organization may
seek damages in court, claiming the financial loss of Bavarian
haulage companies suffered by the blockade totaled up to 15 million
German marks (dlrs 8 million).

Weather grim, mood cautiously confident ahead of Chile match 
</HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARGAUX, France (AP) _ The weather was grim Saturday in the
Austrian training camp but the mood was low-key optimism. Chile,
the next opponent, is tough _ but then there's always that element
of luck.
	   Chile surprised the Italians on Thursday, forcing the group
favorites to accept a 2-2 draw. In contrast, the Austrians
struggled against Cameroon, getting the equalizer only in the last
minute.
	   Happiness with the draw against Cameroon had dissipated by
Saturday, four days before the Chile match. ``It's time to win a
game,'' said midfielder Heimo Pfeifenberger.
	   Still, the Austrians were upbeat coming off a wet and windy
training session on a squishy field.
	   ``If we have a good day, we can beat Chile,'' defender Mario
Haas said. ``Even though they're a level upwards of Cameroon.''
	   The Austrians took it easy in their first full day of training
after Thursday's draw, with the likely starters spending most of
their time on warmup exercises while the subs played an hour's game
on a shortened field.
	   Defender Wolfgang Feiersinger quit the field early, complaining
about calf pains from a light injury he sustained against Cameroon,
but trainers said it would not keep him from playing the South
Americans on Wednesday.
	   Pfeifenberger, who also suffered a bruised calf Thursday, was on
the field for the full session. He complained of ``light pains''
but said the bruise did not constitute an injury.
	   Andreas Herzog, who was yanked Thursday in the 83rd minute,
refused to talk to reporters, reflecting his continued unhappiness
with Coach Herbert Prohaska's decision to replace him.
	   Herzog, who is still recuperating from an operation on his big
toe months ago, appeared to slow down late in the game Thursday but
was a likely starter against Chile.
	   Fellow-forward Anton Polster, whose goal gave Austria the draw
against Cameroon in the last minute, said Chilean forwards Ivan
Zamorano and Marcelo Salas _ who accounted for both goals against
Italy _ would be hard to contain.
	   One of Salas' two goals came from a header. Polster said the
Chileans were particularly dangerous because they ``not only jump
high, they seem to hover in the air.''
	   Asked if he were afraid of the Chileans, Polster said: ``Afraid
no, but we respect them.''
	   Pfeifenberger said that with a draw not good enough on
Wednesday, ``we have to go out there prepared to take more risks.
We have to continue playing defensively but also develop our
offense more.''

World Cup: Hierro, Adepoju goals give Spain, Nigeria 1-1 halftime draw 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Fernando Hierro and Mutiu Adepoju traded
first-half goals off dead-ball situations, and Spain and Nigeria
shared a 1-1 draw at halftime Saturday in the opening World Cup
match for both sides.
	   Nigeria weathered two chances by Raul Gonzalez in the first five
minutes before settling down to make the first half more even.
	   But Hierro curled a free kick around the right side of the wall
from 25 meters in the 21st minute to give Spain the lead. Nigerian
defender Mobi Oparaku set up the free kick when he climbed over the
back of Alfonso Perez to get to a high ball.
	   Then Nigerian keeper Peter Rufai seemed to misplace himself to
the inside of the wall, enabling Hierro to bend his ball well
inside the right post.
	   It took only four minutes for Nigeria to respond.
	   After creating several chances that Spanish keeper Andoni
Zubizarreta handled easily, Adepoju outleapt the Spanish defense at
the near post to get his head to a Garba Lawal corner and redirect
it into the net.
	   The match started with a moment of silence at the start for
Fernand Sastre, the French World Cup organizing committee
co-president who died earlier Saturday of lung cancer.
	   Former soccer star Michel Platini, the other president of the
organizing committee, was among thousands who observed the tribute.
	   At the start, it looked like Spain would crush the Nigerians
early. Raul volleyed a bouncing ball after only 25 seconds that
forced Rufai to dive to his left to get a hand on.
	   Four minutes later, Raul got his head to a cross from Alberto
Ferrer to put a shot that bounced off the crossbar.
	   Many see Nigeria as Africa's best chance at creating a stir in
France '98, having reached the second round in the United States
four years ago and being eliminated only in extra time by eventual
finalist Italy.
	   It took nearly 11 minutes before the Africans generated any
serious offense, and then limited their chances to easily handled
shots by Zubizarreta.
	   Victor Ikpeba had two blasts in four minutes at the Spanish
keeper, one from each side of the penalty area, and Jay-Jay Okocha
had another from the top of the area.

Kuwaiti emir calls for strengthening democracy byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with emir unlikely to dissolve parliament, ADDS

By DIANA ELIAS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's emir called Saturday for strengthening
democracy, a strong indication that he will not dissolve the Gulf's
only elected parliament.
	   Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah met Saturday with the Cabinet to
discuss the growing crisis between the Cabinet and the legislature.
	   A Cabinet statement said Sheik Jaber hoped ``everybody would
realize the size of responsibilities and challenges,'' they have to
deal with, and the need to pool all efforts for the good of the
country.
	   The emir ``stressed the need for strengthening the pillars of
democracy,'' the statement said.
	   A pro-government newspaper said Saturday that dissolving
parliament would not end its crisis with the Cabinet.
	   Prime Minister Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah has complained
that his Cabinet can no longer cooperate with the 50-member
legislature, which he has accused of blocking economic reforms and
showing disrespect for members of his Cabinet.
	   Under the 1962 constitution, the emir may dissolve parliament
when the prime minister says he can no longer work with the
legislature.
	   ``We strongly believe that resorting to the disbanding of
parliament is neither the ideal nor the possible solution to our
current political crisis,'' the al-Anba newspaper said.
	   Al-Anba said new elections were likely to bring back the same
legislators.
	   Relations between the Cabinet and parliament plummeted earlier
this month when a lawmaker decided to grill the interior minister,
Sheik Mohammed al-Khaled al-Sabah, accusing him of inefficiency in
fighting drugs and crime.
	   Sheik Mohammed is a member of the ruling family.
	   Lawmakers have accused the government of wasting public funds
and spending huge amounts of money to buy weapons that are
unsuitable for Kuwait.
	   ``The right solution is to explore the causes of the crisis with
absolute neutrality ... and to set up a new methodology for
cooperation,'' the editorial said.
	   The newspaper said although parliament has achieved little in
the two years since it was elected, the Cabinet also has failed to
take action on vital issues.
	   The government wants to privatize the economy to curb budget
deficits. But that would entail parliament approving measures that
are unpopular with voters, such as introducing taxes and fees for
services that have been heavily subsidized or offered free of
charge for decades.
	   Two Kuwaiti parliaments have been dissolved for severely
criticizing the government.
	   In both cases, in 1976 and 1986, the constitution was suspended
and elections were not called for years.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Representatives of 108 Egyptian companies
have arrived in Iraq to prepare for a trade exhibition and to
secure food deals with the Iraqi government.
	   The exhibition, scheduled for Tuesday, will showcase products
from companies in areas like construction, oil, electronic
appliances, foodstuffs and tourism.
	   It is to be attended by the Egyptian trade minister.
	   The businessmen will also be looking for opportunities to clinch
food deals with the Iraqi government as part of the U.N.
oil-for-food deal.
	   The deal allows Iraq, which is under tough U.N. sanctions, to
sell oil to purchase food and medicines.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan plans to lay off 2 percent of
government employees, a Cabinet minister said Saturday.
	   The announcement by Minister of Administrative Development
Bassam Amoush coincides with mounting speculation that the planned
job cuts are dictated by the International Monetary Fund.
	   The IMF is supervising economic reforms introduced in 1989 to
offset a multibillion dollar foreign debt. Although the economy
improved under the state-controlled austerity measures, Jordanians
suffered from the harsh measures, which included lifting subsidies
on several essential staples.
	   Amoush told a news conference the job cut plan was presented to
the Cabinet for approval.
	   He said the layoffs will ``apply to public sector employees who
fail to carry out their duties, take leaves without permission or
obstruct the course of work.'' He did not elaborate.
	   The Jordanian labor force is estimated at 1.4 million _ the bulk
of whom hold government posts _ in a country of 3.8 million people.
Foreign workers make up around 320,000 of the total.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Rebels in Guinea-Bissau, in West Africa,
on Saturday said they would use tanks to break the government's
siege of their positions in the capital Bissau, according to
reports.
	   The rebels broadcast their intention to deploy tanks in downtown
areas on a private Bissau radio station they captured last week,
Portuguese radio RDP-Africa said.
	   RDP-Africa reported heavy fighting early Saturday in the capital
and footage broadcast on Portuguese state television RTP showed
houses already reduced to rubble and streets full of shell holes.
	   Government troops, supported by soldiers from neighboring
Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, pinned an unknown number of
renegade soldiers in a military garrison in a northern suburb of
Bissau following their attempted powergrab last Sunday.
	   Some rebels also held positions near a barracks on the south
side of the coastal city.
	   Guinea-Bissau Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva
described the rebel strongholds as ``strategic defensive
positions.''
	   Fighting between the two sides has been characterized by the
lobbing of shells, punctuated by exchanges of automatic gunfire. No
figures were available for the number of casualties.
	   Portuguese evacuees arriving in Lisbon Saturday from Bissau said
the shelling had struck embassies, ministries, Bissau's main
hospital and the Bissau phone company building.
	   The military garrison where most of the rebels are holed up was
reportedly used by a tank battalion, supporting the besieged
soldiers' claim to be able to break out.
	   But Delfim da Silva told The Associated Press in Lisbon where he
was stranded due to flight cancellations that ``The tanks have not
been maintained. They're old, Soviet-built tanks.''
	   The rebels, led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, demanded that the foreign troops be withdrawn from the
country and that international phone lines, cut on Thursday, be
restored, RDP-Africa said.
	   They also offered to negotiated an end to the coup attempt with
the government at a foreign venue and suggested Gambia, according
to the report.
	   Mane is from Gambia. He gained renown as a guerilla fighter in
the war against Portuguese colonial rule from 1961 to 1974. He was
later appointed head of the armed forces after independence even
though he spoke no Portuguese, the country's official language.
	   Mane, who as fired in January amid allegations of arms smuggling
to rebels in Senegal, has accused President Joao Bernardo Vieira of
corruption and called on him to step down so that early elections
can be held.
	   Vieira himself came to power in a 1980 coup. He was elected in
the country's first democratic elections for president and
parliament four years ago.
	   Portuguese daily Publico reported that many thousands of
refugees were traveling on foot along the road between Bissau and
the northern border with Senegal.
	   Senegalese officials reportedly were allowing the refugees into
the country after they were vaccinated against yellow fever and
meningitis by medical teams at the border post.
	   More than 2,200 foreigners were evacuated from Bissau by a
Portuguese container ship on Thursday. They were taken to Dakar,
Senegal, where planes were waiting to fly them home on Friday.
	   One of the more than 600 Portuguese evacuees who arrived
Saturday at Lisbon airport recounted how shells were landing in the
port while the foreigners were boarding the ship. ``Everyone was
throwing themselves onto the ground. Some people fell into the
sea,'' he said.

	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) _ Foreigners fleeing Guinea-Bissau in
overcrowded navy and merchant ships docked in Senegal's capital
Saturday with frightening tales of bombardments and street fighting
between government and rebel troops.
	   Fifty-eight expatriates _ Brazilians, Argentines and Chinese and
one U.S. citizen _ were aboard a small Chinese vessel, the fourth
boat to drop anchor in Dakar since the exodus began.
	   Earlier boats were filled with Portuguese, Canadians, French,
Germans, Senegalese and U.S. nationals. It was unclear how many
American citizens remained in Guinea-Bissau, although embassy
officials said Friday night they believed most had been evacuated
from the West African country.
	   The ships, most without food and water supplies, were met by
embassy officials and family members, some weeping with relief and
others sobbing in frustration at failing to see their loved ones on
board.
	   At least one more ship was expected later Saturday.
	   Fighting has raged in Guinea-Bissau's capital of Bissau since
last Sunday, when government troops supported by soldiers from
neighboring Senegal and Republic of Guinea pinned an unknown number
of renegade soldiers in a military garrison.
	   Judy Byers, a missionary from Apple Valley, California, who
arrived on the Chinese ship, told of a steady rain of mortar shells
and small arms fire in her neighborhood in a Bissau suburb after
the fighting began.
	   Most civilians in the area had fled, said Byers, who works for
the Christian group Youth with a Mission.
	   Some of the heaviest fighting occurred near the U.S. embassy in
Bissau, which has been left with a skeleton staff, several of the
evacuees said.
	   Communications with much of Bissau have been cut due to the
fighting and it was unclear which side had gained the upper hand in
the street battles.
	   An Argentine medical doctor, Abel Vallejos, described how he,
his wife and two children had been turned away from a Portuguese
cargo ship in Bissau as mortar shells landed in the water around
the boat.
	   Eventually, a small Chinese skiff docked and took them to an
awaiting merchant vessel.
	   ``The ship is a miracle,'' Vallejos said. ``There were more than
40 booms in the water all around us, and the booms were getting
louder.''
	   Canadian diplomats said of the 23 Canadians registered in
Guinea-Bissau, two families were on the first boat to arrive in
Dakar on Friday night and more were expected on Saturday.
	   Brazilian consul Ronald Small said of the 150 Brazilians
registered in Guinea-Bissau, about 50 were known to have left the
country by Friday evening.
	   A Sierra Leonean woman, Margaret Horton, who arrived in Dakar in
a Senegalese navy ship late Friday, told of being separated from
her husband, a Christian missionary, while trying to escape from
their church in Bissau under heavy shelling last Sunday.
	   ``I have not seen my husband since,'' she said. ``I will never
return. It was like seeing your death. Like facing a firing
squad.''

World Cup: Midfielder open to European offers

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Hidetoshi Nakata, Japan's standout
midfielder, is awaiting offers from European leagues and hasn't
ruled any out any possibilities.
	   Nakata is considered one Japanese player who has a strong chance
of receiving an offer from a European league. No Japanese except
for striker Kazuyoshi Miura, 31, who was dropped from the World Cup
squad at the last minute, has every played in a European league.
Miura played in 1994 with Genoa in Serie A.
	   Nakata was surrounded by foreign media after the team's loose
practice at the World Cup stadium in Toulouse where they will play
their opener against Argentina Sunday.
	   The Argentine team had excellent shooting abilities, Nakata
acknowledged. ``But it's hard to tell until you play them,'' he
said.
	   Although coach Takeshi Okada refused to announce his lineup, he
told reporters Saturday, ``I can promise Nakata will be a
starter.''
	   Nakata, 21, is rarely trailed by the Japanese media because he
refuses to talk to them.
	   He said he would consider offers with the right terms, including
from Japanese clubs, only if the terms were right, suggesting he
was not about to sign if a foreign club couldn't match offers back
home.
	   Asked if he considered himself an individualist, the
orange-haired Nikata replied, ``I'm just a normal person. Everybody
has their own personality.''

	   HILVERSUM, Netherlands (AP) _ Two small single-engine aircraft
collided in midair Saturday, injuring four people on board, two
seriously.
	   The incident occurred when the two planes, a Cessna and a Rally,
were both making their approaches to land at the airport in
Hilversum, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of Amsterdam,
said police spokesman Dick Bakker.
	   The collision did not spark a fire.
	   Both planes, which are usually used for recreational purposes,
carried the pilot and one passenger each.
	   Bakker said two people were seriously injured, and two others
were lightly wounded.

Australians beat Scotland

Eds: ADDS quotes from Scottish coach
By TONY HARPER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian fullback Matthew Burke
scored 25 points as the Wallabies overwhelmed a committed Scottish
team 45-3 in their first rugby union test at the Sydney Football
Stadium on Saturday.
	   Scotland proved a far tougher opponent for the Wallabies than
England, which was swept aside in a record 76-0 Australian win a
week earlier. But the Wallabies were able to post another record by
finishing over top of the tired Scots _ it was their highest ever
score and best winning margin against Scotland.
	   The Wallabies, playing the second test of long season of 13
matches, were stifled by an impressive Scottish defensive display,
but the tourists let themselves down with ill-discipline and poor
ball control.
	   Burke scored one of Australia's three tries and kicked four
penalties and three conversions as Scotland kept giving up vital
penalties within scoring range.
	   ``Scotland came out very fired up and we knew they would _ their
defense was outstanding, they swamped us, but we stuck to our
game,'' said Wallaby captain John Eales.
	   Scottish coach Jim Telfer agreed with Eales that the scoreline
flattered the hosts.
	   ``Australia deserved to win well but I don't think they were 45
points better than us,'' Telfer said. ``I think we did actually
gift them one or two tries because we were trying to play an
expansive game. To be fair to the Aussies, they sussed it out very
well, they seemed to know what we were trying to do especially in
the lineout.''

Moroccan coach hopes team will create problems for Brazil 
</HEADLINE>
By TAREK EL-TABLAWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ The long arm of the law came
through for 5-year-old soccer fan Karim Mohammed.
	   Too shy to approach Moroccan forward Salaheddine Bassir for an
autograph, the boy was led hand-in-hand through a throng of team
supporters by a French policeman.
	   ``I can't believe it,'' said Mohammed, excitedly skipping away
with an autographed poster of the team. ``I've finally met a real,
live professional football player. It's always been my dream.''
	   If Morocco has its way against Brazil in their Group A match
Tuesday in Nantes, the boy won't be the only one who sees his
dreams come true.
	   ``I dream, I hope that we can show our skills, the abilities of
Moroccan football, and come away with a good result,'' said team
coach Henri Michel Saturday. ``At the very least, I hope to create
problems for the Brazilian team.''
	   But with two star players still recovering from injuries, it may
be Morocco that has the problems.
	   Atlas Lions team captain Noureddine Naybet's leg is swollen and
Deportive La Coruna midfielder El-Moustafa Hadji's right toe is
slightly fractured and swollen. Doctors say it will take about
three weeks for these injuries to heal.
	   ``There is a danger in placing him (Naybet) on the official
lineup, but I have to accept that danger,'' Michel told The
Associated Press.
	   ``Morocco ... is not Brazil. We have 11 excellent players and I
can't replace any of them,'' he said.
	   He adding that if Brazil did not play up to its usual standard
against Scotland last Wednesday, ``this doesn't mean anything. It
should always be feared.''
	   If the team is worried, they're not showing it. After a rigorous
training session Saturday morning, some of the players, decked out
in sandals and track suits wandered out of their hotel to mingle
with about 100 excited supporters.
	   Scores of children, ranging from 5 to 15, flocked around each
player. Sporting the team's red and green uniform, they waved
pictures, asking weary, but patient players for their autograph and
then compared how many they got. Adult fans, who at first stood
aside, attempting to look calm and collected, soon gave up the
charade and joined in the crowd.
	   ``When it comes to football, there's no difference between man
or boy,'' said Radwan Bouhmeida, 36, after having his picture taken
with forward Bassir. ``You can't be real fan without being kind of
childish about it, too.''

Defense of Tojo was top priority in war crimes trial: Report 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan put top priority on defending wartime Prime
Minister Hideki Tojo and other leaders in war tribunals after World
War II in an effort to shield the emperor from responsibility for
war crimes, a news report said Saturday, quoting newly declassified
government documents.
	   The documents, which contain details of trials of Japanese
accused of crimes against humanity, were among 120 items that were
declassified Saturday by the Foreign Ministry, Kyodo News agency
reported.
	   Government officials felt the defense of Tojo and 27 other
wartime leaders would be crucial in preventing Emperor Hirohito
from being targeted in the tribunals, Kyodo said.
	   The government was so concerned with the defense of Class-A war
criminals that they largely ignored those accused of lesser war
crimes and made no efforts to procure lawyers for them, Kyodo said.
	   The documents also showed that Japan requested allied forces to
release Korean and Taiwanese defendents on the grounds they were no
longer considered Japanese citizens, Kyodo said, but the request
was denied.
	   Many war tribunal defendants were Koreans and Taiwanese, who
were forcibly drafted into the army under Japanese colonial rule.
	   Tojo and six other top leaders were convicted of the most
serious war crimes and executed. Other Class-A defendents were
sentenced to prison terms which were later reduced.

	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ No matter who ultimately grabs the
most votes in Saturday's Queensland state elections, Pauline
Hanson's right-wing One Nation Party has already emerged as the
contest's big winner.
	   Her year-old party, which ran on an anti-Aboriginal and
anti-Asian platform, dominated the campaign and early returns
showed it pulling 26 percent of the state's 2 million voters,
possibly depriving either mainstream party of a governing majority
in Parliament.
	   In at least 12 of the state's 89 electoral districts, One Nation
was leading in the early partial returns with 40 percent of the
vote or more. In one district, it was carrying 51 percent.
	   Australian Broadcasting Corp. TV predicted a hung Parliament,
with One Nation capturing 10 seats, the conservative coalition 34,
independents 2 and Labor 43 seats _ one short of a majority.
	   ``There seems to be a substantial One Nation vote across the
state _ across the state,'' Queensland's conservative Premier Rob
Borbidge said after the polls closed Saturday evening.
	   ``It will be historic in terms of what's happened with One
Nation,'' Labor Party opposition leader Peter Beattie said. Labor
was also doing well in the urban districts of Brisbane.
	   At the national level, Prime Minister John Howard is watching
the Queensland outcome closely. Losing Queensland would be a
terrible omen for his conservatives; he has to call a federal
election by March 1999.
	   If Hanson's forces can deadlock Queensland's Parliament and hold
the balance of power there, they might be able to pull off a
similar victory in a federal election, holding the swing votes in
the nation's Senate and blocking legislation that they disagree
with.
	   Warning Howard of the battle to come, Hanson said Saturday: ``I
don't think it's hit them yet; I don't think they have a clue.''
	   In Queensland, Borbidge's governing conservative coalition of
urban and rural parties now holds 44 of the 89 seats in state
Parliament, as does the opposition Labor Party.
	   Borbidge has governed only with the alliance of a single
independent conservative member of Parliament.
	   That equation is bound to change after Saturday _ Hanson's One
Nation Party has cut deeply into Borbidge's conservative
constituency, splitting the right-of-center vote.
	   All polls and pundits predict Borbidge will lose the election.
The question is whether Labor will win enough seats _ at least 45 _
to form a government, or if Queensland will have a minority
government, with One Nation's new legislators holding the balance
of power.
	   Various polls indicate One Nation could win as many as 10 or
more of the 89 state seats. Hanson herself is a member of the
national Parliament, and is not up for re-election in this state
race.

World Cup: Japan focusing on defense against Argentina 
</HEADLINE>

By YURI KAGEYAMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Japan is thinking defense. The team
knows that holding powerhouse Argentina scoreless in the first half
is critical for their World Cup opener Sunday.
	   ``We absolutely cannot allow a goal early in the game,'' said
Japan's captain Masami Ihara.
	   The team disclosed little of their defense strategy at an open
practice Saturday, their first at the Toulouse stadium, spending
most of the time on shooting exercises.
	   Their serious practices, including those at their training camp
in the resort town of Aix-Les-Bains, have all been behind closed
doors.
	   Japan usually played a basic 4-4-2 formation during qualifiers.
	   Okada has not announced his lineup but in the last several
months, he has switched to two defenders in addition to Ihara mark
the opposing forwards one-on-one. The two defenders on the right
and left move into a fortified midfield.
	   ``Well, it's tomorrow. I'm going go make a point of getting a
good rest,'' said Naoki Soma, 26, the left side-back who has played
midfield in the new system. ``It's our first so the outcome is
going to be important for our later matches.''
	   Assistant coach Takeshi Ono, the team's strategist, said Japan
has come up with specific ways to ``break the teeth'' of the
Argentine offense.
	   Ono said the team is strengthening their defense precisely
because they believe they have a chance to win.
	   But when asked whether he was confident he could hold Argentina
scoreless, 22-year-old goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi said, ``I
can't comment on that.''
	   Coach Takeshi Okada said that his last words to his players,
ahead of their World Cup debut, would be to encourage them to play
at 100 percent of their ability.
	   ``I will tell them to do what they have always done and to
believe in ourselves,'' he said.

American Jewish Committee demands Nokia stop ad campaign in Germany 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The American Jewish Committee has demanded that
the Finnish producer of mobile telephones, Nokia, stop its
advertising campaign in Germany claiming it insults the victims of
the Holocaust, a Berlin newspaper said Saturday.
	   Signs and newspaper ads in Germany for new Nokia mobile phones
bear the slogan ``Jedem das Seine,'' which translates to ``Everyone
gets his due.''
	   The same slogan was posted on a sign at the entrance of the
Nazis Buchenwald concentration camp and Jews in Germany find it an
insult, the Berlin-based Tageszeitung daily said.
	   Wendy Kloke, spokeswoman for the American Jewish Committee in
Germany, called Nokia's use of the slogan a ``lack of sense of
history and deriding to victims,'' the newspaper said.
	   Marjut Kaituri, a Nokia spokeswoman in Duesseldorf, was quoted
by the newspaper as saying that for the time being the ad campaign
would not be stopped because it is ``very difficult.''
	   ``It is bit problematic, but that was so long ago and it was not
meant that way,'' the report quoted Kaituri as saying.
	   Neither Nokia nor the advertising agency Gramm, which developed
the campaign were aware that the slogan had been used at
Buchenwald, the newspaper quoted Kaituri as saying. At the same
time the report said the company had received telephone complaints
about their advertisement.
	   Volker Beck, spokesman for the Greens party in federal
parliament told the newspaper that it was possible the ad writers
didn't know that the slogan was used at Buchenwald, but now they're
aware of it.
	   ``If Nokia holds on to the campaign, then people buying mobile
phones should not choose that brand in the future,'' the newspaper
quoted Beck as saying.
	   According to Ursula Haertl of the Buchenwald camp memorial,
companies thinking of using the slogan in the past quickly dropped
the idea, Tageszeitung said.
	   ``It served only to mock the prisoners and make it clear to them
that they as less than humans deserved no better treatment,'' the
report quoted Haertl as saying.
	   Some 56,000 people, mostly Jews, died at Buchenwald under the
Nazis.
	   Attempts to independently confirm the Tageszeitung report
Saturday were not immediately successful.

Chief U.N. weapons inspector talks with Iraqi officials lost credibility 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with first round of talk over, Iraq saying Butler has
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq and United Nations weapons inspectors
held a tense meeting Saturday with neither side giving ground on
their dispute over Baghdad's compliance with a U.N. weapons ban.
	   Neither chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler nor Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz spoke to reporters after their morning
meeting, but diplomats reported the atmosphere at the talk was
strained, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   Iraq expressed strong reservations about Butler's list of what
it must do to satisfy the United Nations that it has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction, MENA said.
	   Butler planned to meet Aziz again Saturday evening, and
lower-level technical talks were also scheduled.
	   Butler and his team believe that Iraq is still concealing key
information on its banned weapons programs. Iraq has insisted that
it has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction and its
government-run newspapers have repeatedly lashed out at Butler,
calling him a ``mad dog.''
	   Baghdad says his demands are politically motivated.
	   ``The tide is running against Mr. Butler,'' said Al-Jumhouriya,
an Iraqi government newspaper. ``If he is wise, he should either
resign or declare Iraq has met all obligations to get the sanctions
lifted.''
	   ``During the current meetings, Iraq will supply more evidence to
prove that Butler's mission in Iraq has ended,'' it added.
	   The dispute between Iraq and the U.N. inspectors has the
potential to provoke a crisis similar to one earlier this year,
when the United States and Britain threatened air strikes against
Iraq if it refused to open its presidential sites to U.N.
inspections. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan brokered a deal to
open the palaces to inspections.
	   Butler has said he wants Iraq to hand over information on
imported long-range missiles, prove that it has scrapped all
biological and chemical warheads and fully account for its
production of VX nerve gas.
	   The U.N. inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before the Security Council will
consider lifting the sweeping economic sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

Chief Judge kidnapped in southeastern Iran 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Five gunmen kidnapped the chief judge of a
southeast Iranian city, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Amir Meijani was abducted Friday evening from his home in the
city of Jiroft in southeastern Kerman province, the Farsi-language
newspaper Kayhan reported.
	   Meijani has been chief judge of Jiroft, 1,100 kilometers (682
miles) southeast of Tehran, for five years, the paper said. It gave
no other details.
	   Kerman is a main transit route for smugglers of narcotics, who
take drugs such as opium, hashish and heroin from neighboring
Pakistan and Afghanistan to the Gulf Arab states and beyond.
	   Drug smugglers face the death penalty under Iranian law.
Hundreds have been hanged since the law was passed 10 years ago.

World Cup: organizers pleased with matches, fans AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Big scores, big crowds, and no signs of rowdy fans
or dirty players. What more could you want from a World Cup?
	   ``Tickets!'' some fans scream, and organizers acknowledge there
are not enough to go around, although they say an international
ticket scandal is not their fault.
	   But overall, the first three days of soccer's month-long world
championship, one of the most closely watched sports event in
history, have provided the elements officials hoped for on the
field and in the stands.
	   The games have been wide open, from Brazil's 2-1 victory that
began defense of its fourth title Wednesday to the 3-0 victory by
France over South Africa in windblown Marseille Friday night.
	   The first seven games averaged 2.428 goals, marginally higher
than at the same point four years ago, and even a scoreless tie
between Bulgaria and Paraguay had plenty of action around the net.
	   Stadiums have been sold out, with only a few no-shows. And the
crowds have behaved themselves, with none of the hooliganism some
feared would invade the return of the Cup to Europe.
	   Players have behaved, too. Through the first seven games, no
players have been expelled for flagrant fouls.
	   FIFA and the French organizers sought all these things as they
laid down plans for the 16th edition of the Cup, which is expected
to attract 37 billion TV viewers by the time it ends July 12.
	   ``We're very happy with the pace of scoring and the attacking
spirit,'' Keith Cooper, spokesman for the international soccer
federation, said Saturday.
	   After the 1990 World Cup in Italy deteriorated into a series of
dull defensive struggles marked by foul play, FIFA looked for ways
to make the game more attractive as it headed for its toughest sell
_ 1994 in the United States.
	   It urged coaches and players to think goals _ ``more
spectacle,'' as FIFA's newly elected president Sepp Blatter likes
to call it _ and moved against tackling from behind, a dangerous
tactic generally used when a defender is beaten.
	   Cooper said that idea came eight years ago from Michel Platini,
the former French striker and now co-president of this year's World
Cup organization.
	   ``I think it was indicative that it came from a player who loved
to run with the ball and was a free spirit,'' Cooper said.
	   In 1994, referees cracked down on the backside tackle and red
cards _ soccer's key to an early shower _ popped up from the
Meadowlands to the Rose Bowl. This year, FIFA warned that the calls
would be even tighter, and the players appear to have listened. No
single-incident expulsions or even close calls were recorded
through the first, although Bulgarian defender Anatoli Nankov was
thrown out of Friday's 0-0 draw with Paraguay with two lesser
fouls.
	   Two red-card expulsions were registered on the very first day in
'94.
	   ``People express surprise at the lack of red cards, but it
doesn't surprise us at all,'' Cooper said. ``We have merely created
an opportunity for players to play football without the possibility
of being tackled from behind. We're very happy that it's working.''
	   Crowd control is working, too. No trouble was reported in the
stands or around the stadiums so far. Officials are hoping for a
Cup as free of hooliganism as the U.S. version.

Chirac backs military threat but wants Contact Group approval 
</HEADLINE>

By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac on Saturday voiced
support for possible NATO military intervention in the restive
Yugoslav republic of Kosovo, but he insisted on unanimous Contact
Group approval.
	   It appeared Chirac's position could clash with Washington, which
has said U.N. approval may not be necessary to take such action.
The Contact Group of nations includes Russia, which has been
reluctant to act against Serb-led Yugoslavia.
	   Chirac spoke after meeting with Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, while NATO prepared aerial exercises in Albania and
Macedonia, and a day after the leading industrialized nations
imposed new sanctions on Serb-led Yugoslavia.
	   ``Anyone can see there is brutal Serbian intervention, which has
led to an exodus of people from Kosovo,'' Chirac told reporters.
``That has meant conflicts, dead and injured people, and a
willingness to carry out ethnic cleansing again.
	   ``That's not acceptable to us Western countries,'' he said.
``Consequently, that has to be stopped.''
	   France, he said, backs ``all means of pressure, including
military ones, to have peace again.'' But he said France wants that
any action, ``which might include military ones, will be decided
unanimously within the Contact Group. And we think it's possible.''
	   But the Contact Group could be blocked by Russia, which has deep
historical links with fellow-Slavic Serbia. Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic is to meet with Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Monday.
	   The growing violence has aroused fears among Western powers that
a new Balkan war is in the making, one that could spread to
neighboring states.
	   ``If the situation in Kosovo doesn't improve, if nobody
intervenes, a big destabilisation is to be expected there in
Albania, Macedonia, Grece, and maybe in some other countries
nations have imposed economic sanctions against Serbia,'' Rugova
said.

Jingle writer Johnny Johnston dead at 79 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Johnny Johnston, known in the world of British
television and radio commercials as the ``king of the jingles,''
died Wednesday at the age of 79.
	   He died after a long illness, his familly said in an
announcement published in The Daily Telegraph.
	   Johnston was famed for the creating the ``Beanz Meanz Heinz!''
slogan for the baked beans. He wrote more than 4,500 jingles,
including the one for the first ever color commercial in 1969. He
also wrote more than 500 commercials.
	   Born July 10, 1919 as John Reine, he became a songwriter after
serving as an army major in World War II. His works included
``Don't Ringa Da Bell'' and ``The Wedding of Lilli Marlene'' for
the 1953 movie of the same title.
	   In his early career, he composed songs for the British
Broadcasting Corp. in the 1940s and formed three vocal groups,
including the Keynotes, which backed-up stars such as Sam Browne
and Gracie Fields and became popular in itself.
	   Johnston got in on the budding market for advertising jingles
with the opening of commercial television in Britain in 1956. He
composed and produced 30-second sing-alongs in his first year for
products such as Kleenex tissues and New Zealand butter, before
setting up Johhny Johnston Jingles Ltd.
	   He is survived by his daughter, Vicki. A funeral service was
planned at Golders Green Crematorium on June 17.

World Cup: Croatia confident of beating unheralded Jamaica 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING TO ADD SOCCER IN SLUG

<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) - To hear the Croatians tell it, only the
size of their victory against upstart Jamaica is in question at
Sunday's World Cup debut for both countries.
	   Despite injury troubles, Croatia has the vastly more experienced
team, relying on the international stars that paced it to the
quarterfinals of the 1996 European Championship. Jamaica, coached
out of laid-back Caribbean obscurity by Brazilian Rene Simoes for
the last four years, has the underdog's hunger to be taken
seriously.
	   ``We respect Jamaica, but we are the firm favorites,'' said
Croatian defender Slaven Bilic. ``It would be nice to predict a
5-0, but I'll be happy with a 1-0. We just need the three points.''
	   Still, in a group also comprising Japan and Argentina, Croatia's
best chance to fill up its goal account is against the ``Reggae
Boyz.''
	   Croatia needs to prove its form after an inconsistent World Cup
qualifying campaign.
	   Also, doubts linger about the fitness of some of its stars.
	   Bilic, the team's most experienced defender, is recovering from
a muscle injury, while Robert Prosinecki, a gifted but moody
playmaker who has returned to champion Croatia Zagreb after several
frustrating years in Spain, is fighting flu.
	   Sometimes dubbed Europe's Brazilians because of their fluid
passing, the Croatians will look for inspiration to Prosinecki and
AC Milan midfielder Zvonimir Boban.
	   In attack, top scorer Davor Suker, from European champion Real
Madrid, will likely link up with Parma's Mario Stanic, a strapping
player equally at home in the attack and in midfield.
	   Coach Miroslav Blazevic, who has predicted a Croatia-France
final, has no self-confidence problem ahead of Sunday's game at
Lens.
	   ``We will play our game,'' he said. ``I don't adapt to other
teams' style.''
	   Blazevic is trying to motivate his millionaire-laced squad with
martial talk.
	   ``We will play with fanatical commitment,'' he promised
Saturday. ``This is a battle.''
	   The Jamaicans, staying in a chateau in eastern France, have one
clear ambition: to avoid becoming a laughing stock like the
nation's Olympic bobsled team in its debut a decade ago.
	   ``That stigma has been attached to us by people who are
expecting the football team to be just as much of a joke,''
midfielder Fitzroy Simpson said.
	   So the team is ``eager to do well and to impress, and that is
bound to work in our favour because there is unlikely to be another
squad who want to win as much as we do,'' said teammate Paul Hall.
	   With most of the squad playing for home teams with names like
Galaxy United and Violet Kickers, Jamaica is counting on
England-based players such as Simpson and Hall, who both play for
Portsmouth, and Wimbledon striker Marcus Gayle for experience at a
higher level.
	   In a training session Friday, Simoes brought together what is
expected to be his opening lineup. The most surprising omission was
veteran defender Linval Dixon.
	   Chelsea defender Frank Sinclair appeared to aggravate a groin
injury during the workout.
	   But Jamaica is giving little away. After a recent training
session, a TV crew had its film confiscated by Jamaican officials
and the normally talkative Simoes left without speaking to the
media.

World Cup: Nigeria stuns Spain 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Sunday Oliseh rocketed a 30-meter blast in
off the left post in the 78th minute and Nigeria stunned Spain 3-2
Saturday in the World Cup opener for both teams.
	   The goal completed a second rally from a one-goal deficit for
the Olympic champion and gave credence to those who have predicted
a surprise from one of the African nations.
	   Many see Nigeria as Africa's best chance for creating a stir in
France '98, having reached the second round in the United States
four years ago and being eliminated only in extra time by eventual
finalist Italy.
	   Oliseh's goal came only five minutes after Spanish goalkeeper
Andoni Zubizarreta inadvertently knocked in Garbal Lawal's cross at
the near post to knot the game 2-2.
	   Lawal chased down a ball from Rasheed Yekini on the left side of
the penalty area and drove the ball parallel to the end line.
Zubizarreta, standing about 1 1-2 meters from the near post and
facing Lawal, reached down with his right hand and deflected the
ball into his own net.
	   The rally came after Raul Gonzalez had given Spain a 2-1 lead 72
seconds into the second half on clearly what has been the goal of
the World Cup.
	   Fernando Hierro launched a ball from just outside the center
circle in the Nigerian half and Raul outraced Mobi Oparaku to latch
onto to it in full stride. His outstretched left foot six meters
from the left post richoceted the ball across the goal and gave
Nigieran keeper Peter Rufai no chance to react.
	   It was only the latest in a series of chances for Raul, who
opened the first half with two shots in the first 4 1-2 minutes and
threatened to blow Nigeria out of the game.
	   Hierro curled a free kick around the right side of the wall from
25 meters in the 21st minute to give Spain the lead. Oparaku set up
the free kick when he climbed over the back of Alfonso Perez to get
to a high ball.
	   Rufai seemed to misplace himself to the inside of the wall,
enabling Hierro to bend his ball well inside the right post.
	   But Nigeria weathered the two chances by Raul in the first five
minutes and the goal to tie the game four minutes after Hierro's
free kick and make the first half more even.
	   After creating several chances that Zubizarreta handled easily,
Mutiu Adepoju outleapt the Spanish defense at the near post to get
his head to a Lawal corner and redirect it into the net.
	   The match started with a moment of silence at the start for
Fernand Sastre, the French World Cup organizing committee
co-president who died earlier Saturday of lung cancer.
	   Former soccer star Michel Platini, the other president of the
organizing committee, was among thousands who observed the tribute.

NATO to conduct air exercises over Albania and Macedonia Monday 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO aircraft from several nations will
conduct air exercises over Albania and Macedonia on Monday in a
show of force aimed at pressuring Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to stop his campaign against ethnic Albanians in the
province of Kosovo, NATO said Saturday.
	   The exercise, code-named Determined Falcon, was ordered by the
alliance's defense ministers Thursday during their meeting at NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
	   ``The objective of the exercise is to demonstrate NATO's
capability to project power rapidly into the region,'' said NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana. ``A variety of aircraft will be
participating in this exercise including fighters, reconnaissance,
airborne early warning and helicopters.''
	   More than 250 people have died in recent months as Milosevic has
stepped up his offensive with troops and police against ethnic
Albanians in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo. Ethnic
Albanians make up 90 percent of the population in the region.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting the Yugoslav
government for independence, an aspiration not supported by NATO.
	   The alliance has been very careful to condemn the violence on
both sides and to note that while it supports a return to the
autonomy Kosovo enjoyed prior to 1989, it does not back
independence.
	   The Fifth Allied Tactical Air Force Combined Air Operations
Centre at Vicenza, Italy will be responsible for the exercise.

Another opposition figure arrested in Belarus

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A Belarusian opposition leader was
arrested Saturday for spray-painting a political slogan on the wall
of the Interior Ministry headquarters.
	   Valery Shchukin was a communist member of the democratically
elected parliament dissolved by authoritarian President Alexander
Lukashenko in 1996. He was arrested after writing ``Freedom to
Deputy Klimov'' in green spray paint on the ministry's wall
following a meeting of members of the ousted parliament.
	   Andrei Klimov, another member of the disbanded parliament, was
arrested in February on suspicion of misappropriating funds and
fraud. Opposition leaders maintain that the arrest was political.

Usual celebrations _ plus rain _ for official birthday of the monarch 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The weather gave Queen Elizabeth II a break for
her official birthday celebrations on Saturday.
	   The rain stopped just as the queen left Buckingham Palace for
the annual Trooping the Color ceremony at Horse Guards Parade.
	   And it stayed dry as the queen joined her family later on the
balcony of the palace to see a flypast by a variety of modern and
vintage aircraft, including an AWACS communications and
surveillance aircraft, Harrier jet fighters and a Spitfire.
	   On the way to the Trooping the Color ceremony, the queen _
wearing a white and navy cotton dress with coat and matching hat _
rode in an open carriage, behind another open carriage carrying her
mother, Queen Mother Elizabeth, and the queen's sister, Princess
Margaret.
	   Riding behind the queen, three abreast, were Prince Charles,
Prince Andrew and the Duke of Kent.
	   The queen actually marked her 72nd birthday on April 21, but the
official birthday is marked on the second Saturday of June.

Italian phone exec steps aside, to stay at mobile phone division 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The chief operating officer of Italy's phone
company, Vito Gamberale, is stepping aside to concentrate on its
highly profitable mobile phone division, news reports said
Saturday.
	   Gamberale informed his boss, Telecom Italia Chairman Gianmario
Rossignolo, of the decision in a letter Friday, the Milan daily
Corriere della Sera said.
	   The newspaper and the ANSA news agency said the move came
because of friction between the two men.
	   Rossignolo appointed Gamberale to the job in February, but
relations soured and hit bottom in May when the Telecom chairman
criticized his subordinate in a newspaper interview.
	   Gamberale said he would stay on as chairman of Telecom Italia
Mobile SpA (TIM), which provides much of the parent company's
earnings.
	   TIM, with 11 million clients in Italy, is the largest mobile
phone operator in Europe.
	   Telecom Italia in 1996, the last year figures were available,
had revenues of 40.52 trillion lire (dlrs 22.89 billion), and
earned 3.16 trillion lire (dlrs 1.79 billion).
	   It is the world's fifth largest phone company.

Kafelnikov, Larsson win semifinals at Gerry Weber Open tennis 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HALLE, Germany (AP) _ Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the defending
champion, and Magnus Larsson of Sweden qualified for the finals of
the Gerry Weber Open lawn tennis tournament on Saturday.
	   Kafelnikov needed more than two hours to overcome Sweden's
Thomas Johansson 7-6, 6-7, 6-3 in a hard fought battle in which the
Swede battled leg cramps but powered in 17 aces to six for the
Russian.
	   Larsson overcame Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands 7-6, 6-2 in
just 55 minutes.
	   Kafelnikov's win came despite an unfaithful first serve and 11
double faults to Johnsson's four throughout the 2-hour, 7-minutes
match that left him make good on only one of seven break chances.
	   But the break came at the right moment with Johansson serving
the eighth game of the third set after the two had held service
through the seventh, and Kafelnikov jumped to a 5-3 lead.
	   Johnsson fought off two match balls before Kafelnikov moved a
point ahead, then won the match on a controversial long return that
the line judge failed to call out as the Swede covered his mouth
with his hand to prevent screaming in frustration.
	   In an interview after the match, Kafelnikov acknowledged he was
struggling with his game, which he said was ``off for the past four
months ... I'm just glad to be in the finals.''
	   Shown a video replay of the long return Kaafelnikov confirmed it
was a bad call. ``Now when I see it, but I couldn't see it out
there ... It was definitely out.''
	   The winner of the Gerry Weber Open in Sunday's final takes home
dlrs 122,000, with the runner-up getting dlrs 72,400.

Fernand Sastre, chief campaigner for France's World Cup bid 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with prime minister's comment

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Fernand Sastre, who spearheaded France's campaign
to host the World Cup but became too ill to attend the opening,
died of lung cancer Saturday. He was 74.
	   Former soccer star Michel Platini, the other president of the
organizing committee, was among thousands who observed a tearful
minute of silence for Sastre before the Saturday afternoon match
between Spain and Nigeria at a stadium in Nantes.
	   Sastre was the often faceless but tireless administrator and
businessman who was instrumental in setting up the world's biggest
single-sport event.
	   ``The national sporting community, like the World Cup 98, are
mourning,'' Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said in a statement.
Sastre ``served his favorite sport as he served the government:
with rigor, devotion and competence.''
	   Over the past months, with the organizational structure already
well in place, Sastre was seen less and less in public as he was
fighting lung cancer. But Platini insisted that Sastre's seat be
left vacant out of respect.
	   Last weekend, Sastre was rushed to Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in
Paris for emergency treatment. It was the same hospital where
Princess Diana died of her injuries from a car crash last year.
	   Sastre had been the driving force behind France candidacy for
the World Cup since 1983, when the French soccer federation, which
he presided, first started considering the project.
	   He headed France's bid committee from 1989 to 1992, when it beat
Morocco with a 12-7 vote to organize the 1998 edition.
	   The CFO organizing committee employs 640 people during the World
Cup and uses some 12,000 volunteers.
	   It was not Sastre's only major victory during his long career in
soccer.
	   When he was federation president, Les Bleus won the 1984
European Championships, with Platini the undisputed star, and the
French added the Olympic title in Los Angeles later that summer.
	   In 1982, the French also reached the semifinals of the World Cup
in Spain.
	   The son of a ``pied-noir'' farmer in French colonial Algeria,
Sastre was born Oct. 1, 1923 in the city of Kouba, where he became
head of the city's sports association in 1946.
	   Sastre was a member of the board of directors of the Algiers
Soccer League from 1955 to 1962, when Algeria won independence.
	   He was a member of the commission of the French Cup of the FFF
from 1962-68, secretary general of the FFF in 1969, president of
the federation from 1973-84 and honorary president since 1985. He
was vice-president of the national Olympic organizing committee in
1988.
	   His career in French government began as a tax inspector in
Algiers in 1948. Sastre went on to become a financial inspector at
the Ministry of Youth and Sports in 1977.
	   Sastre was decorated as an officer of the Legion of Honor and as
a commander of the National Order of Merit.
	   Funeral arrangements were pending.

Albania, Macedonia strengthen ties to face conflict in Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Worried about the escalation of violence
in neighboring Kosovo, Albanian Premier Fatos Nano declared
Saturday that Balkan countries should start looking for allies
among their neighbors.
	   ``Albania and Macedonia are building a model of coexistence
between two peoples of the Balkans, which have always looked for
allies outside the Balkans,'' Nano after meeting with his
Macedonian counterpart Branko Cervenkovski in Tirana.
	   Both countries approved on Friday NATO exercises that will allow
Alliance planes to fly simulated bombing raids over their countries
in an effort to halt the violence in Kosovo.
	   Albania has been pressing for weeks for NATO actions to stem
bloodshed in Kosovo, where Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one.
More than 800 people, including Albanians and Serbs, have been
killed in raids and in fighting.
	   The government of Macedonia, where the Slav majority has closer
ties to Yugoslavs than ethnic Albanians, also approved a one-time
``flyover through Macedonia's airspace'' of NATO planes, but said
future NATO requests would be considered separately.
	   Cervenkovski told reporters his country supports a peaceful
solution to the crises in Kosovo, achieved through dialogue between
the parties in the conflict.

American Jewish Committee demands Nokia stop ad campaign in Germany 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING FOR SOME POINTS
<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The American Jewish Committee has demanded that
the Finnish producer of mobile telephones, Nokia, stop its
advertising campaign in Germany claiming it insults the victims of
the Holocaust, a Berlin newspaper said Saturday.
	   Signs and newspaper ads in Germany for new Nokia mobile phones
bear the slogan ``Jedem das Seine,'' which translates to ``Everyone
gets his due.''
	   The same slogan was posted on a sign at the entrance of the
Nazis Buchenwald concentration camp and Jews in Germany find it an
insult, the Berlin-based Tageszeitung daily said.
	   Wendy Kloke, spokeswoman for the American Jewish Committee in
Germany, called Nokia's use of the slogan a ``lack of sense of
history and deriding to victims,'' the newspaper said.
	   Marjut Kaituri, a Nokia spokeswoman in Duesseldorf, was quoted
by the newspaper as saying that for the time being the ad campaign
would not be stopped because it is ``very difficult.''
	   ``It is bit problematic, but that was so long ago and it was not
meant that way,'' the report quoted Kaituri as saying.
	   Neither Nokia nor the advertising agency Gramm, which developed
the campaign were aware that the slogan had been used at
Buchenwald, the newspaper quoted Kaituri as saying. At the same
time the report said the company had received telephone complaints
about their advertisement.
	   Volker Beck, spokesman for the Greens party in federal
parliament told the newspaper that it was possible the ad writers
didn't know that the slogan was used at Buchenwald, but now they're
aware of it.
	   ``If Nokia holds on to the campaign, then people buying mobile
phones should not choose that brand in the future,'' the newspaper
quoted Beck as saying.
	   According to Ursula Haertl of the Buchenwald camp memorial,
companies thinking of using the slogan in the past quickly dropped
the idea, Tageszeitung said.
	   ``It served only to mock the prisoners and make it clear to them
that they as less than humans deserved no better treatment,'' the
report quoted Haertl as saying.
	   Some 56,000 people, mostly Jews, died at Buchenwald under the
Nazis.
	   Attempts to independently confirm the Tageszeitung report
Saturday were not immediately successful.

President says he won't intervene to help Suharto fight corruption charges

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ New President B.J. Habibie said
Saturday he remains close to his predecessor Suharto, but indicated
that he would not intercede to help the ex-autocrat fend off
corruption allegations.
	   ``The problem that he is facing with his family, that is his
problem, okay. And he has the right to defend that,'' Habibie said
in an interview with The Associated Press.
	   Habibie became head of state last month after the old president
quit, overwhelmed by protests and riots that were partly triggered
by the worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Critics say Suharto's family amassed a fortune under his
patronage during his 32 years in power.
	   Habibie said he will not intervene in legal proceedings as long
as they are pursued lawfully and in accordance with human rights
and the presumption of innocence.
	   Habibie also predicted Saturday that his nation's battered
economy could recover from its deepest crisis in decades within one
to two years.
	   But he warned that the goal would be reached only if all
Indonesians worked for sweeping reform.
	   ``I am not a prophet,'' he said when asked how long it would
take to fix the crisis.
	   ``If it depended on me I would want do it immediately,'' he
said. ``To be fair, if we could come out of this crisis, let's say
with the help of everybody, in one to two years.''
	   Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, has been hit
hardest by Asia's financial meltdown.
	   The rupiah has lost more that 80 percent of its value against
the U.S. dollar since July 1997. Inflation is running at more than
50 percent and is rising along with mass employment.
	   On the issue of East Timor, Habibie ruled out the possibility of
independence for the disputed territory despite growing protests
for self-determination.
	   ``We are going to keep East Timor what it is, an integrated part
of Indonesia,'' Habibie said.
	   In a separate interview with Japanese reporters Saturday,
Habibie signaled that he was considering the release of Xanana
Gusmao, East Timor's rebel guerrilla commander who is serving a
20-year term in an Indonesian prison.
	   Gusmao's freedom remains a key demand of protesters, as well as
of rebels who continue to fight a hit-and-run war against
Indonesian forces in East Timor's rugged interior.
	   ``I tell you I'm really, really honestly considering to release
him and to integrate all the Timorese, who are still in the
mountains, (into) the society and to take care of them the same as
other Indonesian people to work for the whole of the Republic of
Indonesia, including (East) Timor,'' Habibie was quoted as saying
by the Kyodo news agency.
	   Until now Indonesian authorities have flatly rejected calls to
set Gusmao free, saying that he is a violent criminal.
	   Earlier this week Habibie released 15 East Timorese political
prisoners and suggested that special status could be bestowed upon
the territory in return for peace.
	   But Habibie's offer was rejected by East Timorese activists.
	   In Jakarta on Friday, police and army personnel beat and kicked
protesters who staged an East Timor pro-independence rally outside
Indonesia's Foreign Ministry.
	   In East Timor Saturday, about 1,000 protesters held a noisy
demonstration calling for a referendum of their political future
and the release of Xanana.
	   It was the second protest held in the territory's capital, Dili,
this week.

Guerrilla priest begins to serve house arrest 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A Capuchin monk sentenced to 20
years for participating in a 1989 guerrilla assault on an army base
has been released from prison to serve the rest of his time under
house arrest.
	   Friar Antonio Puigjane, 70, left the Buenos Aires prison late
Friday where he spent nine years. He was taken to a Capuchin
convent in the Argentine capital.
	   Argentine law allows prisoners over 70 to serve house arrest.
	   The priest, who met with human rights leaders, said he would
spend his first days outside prison in meditation.
	   Puigjane never denied his involvement with the group of leftists
that attacked the Tablada army barracks outside the capital in
January 1989.
	   The assault was quelled after more than 30 hours of fighting
that left 28 attackers and 11 army and police officers dead.
	   Twenty guerrillas were caught and most were sentenced to life in
prison.
	   Human rights groups including Amnesty International requested
Puigjane's freedom because he did not participate in the action
itself.

World Cup: Nigeria rallies to stun Spain 3-2 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Nigeria chose a perfect time to put the
``super'' back in Super Eagles.
	   Outhustled and outplayed by Spain for 70 minutes, Nigeria struck
twice in five minutes to rally for a 3-2 victory Saturday in the
World Cup opener for both teams.
	   Wearing black arm bands on their green jerseys because of the
death Monday of their country's ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, the
Nigerians looked for much of the game like a distracted team and
one that had lost its last three tuneups before heading to France
'98.
	   But after digging themselves a 2-1 hole Saturday, the 1996
Olympic champions fought back on goals by Garba Lawal and Sunday
Oliseh to move atop Group D and give credence to those who have
predicted a surprise from one of the African nations.
	   ``It was a well-deserved victory,'' said Oliseh, who slammed in
the winner from 30 meters (yards) with 12 minutes left. ``We
dedicate it to all our compatriots. This win was for 150 million
Nigerians.''
	   Lawal evened the score in the 73rd minute, gathering a pass from
Rasheed Yekini on the left side of the box and firing the ball
parallel to the goalline. Veteran keeper Andoni Zubizarreta,
standing about 1 1-2 meters from the near post and facing Lawal,
reached down with his right hand and deflected the ball into his
own net.
	   ``We had the match in our grasp, but, well, now we have to
continue fighting,'' Spanish coach Javier Clemente said. ``We
could've won 3-1, but it got away from us, We just got careless.''
	   The white-and-green clad band of Nigerian supporters, several of
whom beat drums throughout the game at the packed Beaujoire
Stadium, had not quieted down five minutes later when Oliseh
struck.
	   The Ajax of Amsterdam midfielder, given time to calibrate his
shot, blasted a low drive that glanced in off the post.
	   ``I have to congratulate Nigeria. That third goal was just
sensational,'' added Clemente, whose team lost for just the second
time in 35 outings.
	   The country is perennially one of Europe's strongest and has
qualified for six World Cup finals in a row, yet its best-ever
showing was fourth place in 1950.
	   Nigeria made its cup debut four years ago and threw a scare into
eventual finalist Italy in the second round. Its victory at the
Atlanta Games only increased expectations.
	   But beset by injuries _ neither Nwankwo Kanu (ankle) nor Daniel
Amokachi (knee) played Saturday _ the team dropped recent World Cup
warmup games to Germany, Yugoslavia and Netherlands by a combined
9-1.
	   And Spain exploited Nigeria's inconsistency to take the lead
Saturday through a Fernando Hierro free kick and a goal by Raul
Gonzalez off an assist from his Real Madrid teammate.
	   The spot kick, in the 21st minute, was awarded when Mobi Oparaku
fouled Alfonso Perez as they went up for a floating ball. Hierro
curled his shot around the defensive wall, and keeper Peter Rufai,
who seemed to be poorly positioned, watched as the ball bounced
inside the right post.
	   The Nigerians struck right back, tying the match in the 25th as
midfielder Mutiu Adepoju stepped in front of Alfonso at the near
post and leaped to head home Lawal's corner kick.
	   The Iberians' ball control frustrated Nigeria and it was 2-1 two
minutes into the second half, when Raul flashed in on the left side
and volleyed home a long through ball from Hierro.
	   ``The worst part is that we had the game won,'' Hierro said.
``Now we have to go on, we still have two games left and we must
play at full steam.
	   ``Nigeria is a great team physically. They've got very strong
players. We didn't slow down the game and they were able to beat us
with their speed.''
	   Nigerian coach Bora Milutinovic, with his record fourth
different country at the World Cup, looked to spark the attack in
the 70th minute by sending on Yekini for the ineffective Oparaku,
who was repeatedly beaten down the flank by Raul.
	   The move paid immediate dividends, with Yekini setting up the
equalizer and creating more space for the Nigerian attack.
	   The match started with a moment of silence for Fernand Sastre,
the French World Cup organizing committee co-president who died
earlier Saturday of lung cancer.
	   Former soccer star Michel Platini, the other co-president, was
among those who observed the tribute.
	   Spain produced two great chances for Raul in the opening five
minutes of the game by exploiting the inexperience of right back
Oparaku, who was placed on the roster Wednesday because of Jore
Shakpore's broken collarbone.

Nigeria rallied to beat Spain; ticket scandal continues byline; WILL be UPDATED with South Korea-Mexico and Netherlands-Belgium BY JOSEPH WHITE AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ There was no letup in the run of glorious goals and
wide-open soccer Saturday at the World Cup, led by Nigeria's
come-from-behind victory over Spain.
	   In Bora Milutinovic's World Cup debut as Nigerian coach, Sunday
Oliseh rocketed a 30-meter (yard) blast off the left post in the
78th minute to give the Africans a 3-2 victory over a Spanish team
often cited as a contender for the title.
	   Later Saturday, South Korea faced Mexico at Lyon and neighboring
rivals Belgium and the Netherlands played at Saint-Denis. On
Sunday, it's Jamaica-Croatia at Lens, Yugoslavia-Iran at
Saint-Etienne and Argentina-Japan at Toulouse.
	   At Nantes, Oliseh's goal came five minutes after Spanish
goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta inadvertently knocked in Garbal
Lawal's cross at the near post to tie the game 2-2.
	   Early in the second half, Raul Gonzalez scored one of the most
picturesque goals of the tournament, catching Fernando Hierro's
pass on his outstretched leg at full stride to give Spain a 2-1
lead.
	   Hierro's 25-meter (yard) free kick in the first half was the
first goal of the game, but Mutiu Adepoju answered for Nigeria.
	   Milutinovic, the U.S. coach in the 1994 tournament, was only
hired in December by Nigeria, the fourth country he's led into a
World Cup.
	   The match was preceded by a moment of silence for Fernand
Sastre, the French World Cup organizing committee co-president.
Sastre, 74, who was chiefly responsible for turning France's hopes
of staging the tournament into reality, died early Saturday of lung
cancer.
	   The exciting soccer _ after four days of competition, scoring is
prevalent and rowdy fans and dirty play aren't _ does have its
downside: It makes fans who are victims of a ticket scams even more
incensed that they're missing out on the action.
	   French authorities said for the first time Saturday that they
were ready to investigate the growing international ticket scandal.
	   FIFA and the World Cup organizing committee have earlier pledged
to file lawsuits against companies or individuals found to have
taken part in the scams, which have left thousands of fans without
tickets.
	   The problem is now exploding in France. Fans who dealt with
unlicensed brokers and tour operators are arriving without tickets
they thought would be waiting for them. It's estimated that some
12,000 Japanese fans are ticketless, although most have stayed
home.
	   Similar, although smaller, cases have been reported in Britain,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Brazil.

EDS: UPDATES with search called off
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Eric Tabarly, one of France's best-known sailors,
was reported lost off Wales Saturday after falling off his yacht
during the night.
	   Coastguards at Milford Haven in southwest Wales confirmed that
they had abandoned the search for the yachtsman. His identity was
not confirmed by British authorities, but the French Transport
Ministry announced that it was the 67-year-old Tabarly.
	   He was reported missing 55 kms (35 miles) south-southeast of
Milford Haven.
	   ``This chap has been missing now for over 12 hours and that is
three times the expected survivability in conditions such as these.
We also understand he wasn't wearing any lifejacket, which would
have assisted him,'' said Chris Raley, deputy district controller
for Milford Haven Coastguard.
	   The four crew members on the yacht have no communications
equipment, and speak little or no English. Rescuers were not
alerted until seven hours after the man disappeared. The yacht
crew, who reportedly had little experience at sea, fired a flare to
attract a passing boat.
	   The reportedly were headed for Belfast, Northern Ireland.
	   A Royal Air Force rescue helicopter joined several merchant
ships in the search Saturday, but found no trace of the missing
yachtsman. The Coastguard said seas were moderate with waves up to
13 feet (4 meters).
	   Tabarly, born July 24, 1931 in Nantes, became a naval officer in
1959.
	   He won several races with boats named Pen Duick, a Breton phrase
meaning ``blackheaded tomtit.''
	   Among his victories were a transatlantic solo race from Plymouth
to Newport, 5,390 kms in 27 days in 1964; the Morgan Cup in 1967,
the Gotland Round, Channel Race and the Fasnet, the race from
Plymouth to La Rochelle, all in 1967. He won a transpacific solo
race in the Pen Duick V in 39 days in 1969, and won the Los
Angeles-Tahiti race in 1972. Aboard the Pen Duick VI he won the
Plymouth-Newport race in 23 days and 20 hours in 1976.
	   He was awarded the Legion of Honor, was a member of the Maritime
National Order of Merit, and wrote several books including ``Solo
Victory'' in 1964 and ``Pen Duick'' in 1990.

Usual celebrations _ plus rain _ for official birthday of the monarch 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: ADDS history of event
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The weather gave Queen Elizabeth II a break for
her official birthday celebrations on Saturday.
	   The rain stopped just as the queen left Buckingham Palace for
the annual Trooping the Color ceremony at Horse Guards Parade.
	   And it stayed dry as the queen joined her family later on the
balcony of the palace to see a flypast by a variety of modern and
vintage aircraft, including an AWACS communications and
surveillance aircraft, Harrier jet fighters and a Spitfire.
	   On the way to the Trooping the Color ceremony, the queen _
wearing a white and navy cotton dress with coat and matching hat _
rode in an open carriage, behind another open carriage carrying her
mother, Queen Mother Elizabeth, and the queen's sister, Princess
Margaret.
	   Riding behind the queen, three abreast, were Prince Charles,
Prince Andrew and the Duke of Kent.
	   The queen actually marked her 72nd birthday on April 21, but the
official birthday is marked on the second Saturday of June.
	   Queen Victoria, who liked to celebrate her birthday of May 24 in
private, started the custom of having an official celebration in
June 1843. The day has been marked on a Saturday since in 1959, to
accommodate the crowds who come to see the pageantry, according to
``Monarchy and the Royal Family,'' by Graham and Heather Fisher.

Coast guards abandon search for French yachtsman Eric Tabarly 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with search called off
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Eric Tabarly, one of France's best-known sailors,
was reported lost off Wales Saturday after falling off his yacht
during the night.
	   Coastguards at Milford Haven in southwest Wales confirmed that
they had abandoned the search for the yachtsman. His identity was
not confirmed by British authorities, but the French Transport
Ministry announced that it was the 67-year-old Tabarly.
	   He was reported missing 55 kms (35 miles) south-southeast of
Milford Haven.
	   ``This chap has been missing now for over 12 hours and that is
three times the expected survivability in conditions such as these.
We also understand he wasn't wearing any lifejacket, which would
have assisted him,'' said Chris Raley, deputy district controller
for Milford Haven Coastguard.
	   The four crew members on the yacht have no communications
equipment, and speak little or no English. Rescuers were not
alerted until seven hours after the man disappeared. The yacht
crew, who reportedly had little experience at sea, fired a flare to
attract a passing boat.
	   The reportedly were headed for Belfast, Northern Ireland.
	   A Royal Air Force rescue helicopter joined several merchant
ships in the search Saturday, but found no trace of the missing
yachtsman. The Coastguard said seas were moderate with waves up to
13 feet (4 meters).
	   Tabarly, born July 24, 1931 in Nantes, became a naval officer in
1959.
	   He won several races with boats named Pen Duick, a Breton phrase
meaning ``blackheaded tomtit.''
	   Among his victories were a transatlantic solo race from Plymouth
to Newport, 5,390 kms in 27 days in 1964; the Morgan Cup in 1967,
the Gotland Round, Channel Race and the Fasnet, the race from
Plymouth to La Rochelle, all in 1967. He won a transpacific solo
race in the Pen Duick V in 39 days in 1969, and won the Los
Angeles-Tahiti race in 1972. Aboard the Pen Duick VI he won the
Plymouth-Newport race in 23 days and 20 hours in 1976.
	   He was awarded the Legion of Honor, was a member of the Maritime
National Order of Merit, and wrote several books including ``Solo
Victory'' in 1964 and ``Pen Duick'' in 1990.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Overnight, skies were mostly cloudy across southeast Puerto Rico
and adjacent waters and partly to variably cloudy elsewhere across
Puerto Rico eastward through the U.S. Virgin Islands. Predawn
Doppler radar indicated locally heavy showers around Yabucoa and
isolated to widely scattered light showers elsewhere, all drifting
westward across the east third of Puerto Rico through the Virgin
Islands. Coastal temperatures ranged from near 70 across west
Puerto Rico to the upper 70s across northeast sections as well as
over the U.S. Virgin Islands.
	   The higher levels of the local atmosphere remained relatively
dry despite the presence of a nearly stationary middle- to
upper-level trough across the northeast Caribbean. However, the
lower levels were quite unstable. Therefore expect continued active
afternoon weather across Puerto Rico during the rest of this
weekend. Some of this precipitation will be heavy and may once
again generate flooding across mainly the north central and
northwest sections of the island.
	   The next tropical wave is expected into the eastern Caribbean on
Tuesday. Therefore expect normal winds and seas across the local
coastal waters through the weekend.

Players want to strut their stuff for NFL at World Bowl 
</HEADLINE>
By ROY KAMMERER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Sunday's World Bowl could hinge on
which backup quarterback can step up and turn in a big game.
	   NFL Europe's top-rated quarterback, Mike Quinn of the
Duesseldorf Rhein Fire, is limping on a sprained ankle and is
questionable for the league's championship game between the Fire
and Frankfurt Galaxy.
	   Damon Huard of the pass-happy Galaxy has been called home by the
NFL's Miami Dolphins after separating his shoulder last week.
	   Huard's backup, Chris Dittoe, already feels the pressure. He's
been signed and cut several times by the Detroit Lions and played
just one half for the Galaxy.
	   But it was a big half. It came last weekend when he helped
engineer the Galaxy's 20-17 win over the Rhein Fire to clinch the
World Bowl and a quick rematch.
	   ``Of course there's pressure because I'm sort of unknown,'' said
Dittoe. ``We throw a lot. This is an offense that just sort of puts
the ball in the quarterback's hands.''
	   Like every other player, Dittoe is hoping a big game will wow an
NFL club. It's happened before.
	   Scott Mitchell of the Detroit Lions and the Vikings' Brad
Johnson are two alumni of the NFL developmental league who later
signed multi-million dollar contracts.
	   ``Do I think about that?'' said Quinn, likely to be fighting for
the Pittsburgh Steelers' backup job next season. ``Oh yeah, this is
definitely a step in that direction.''
	   The two teams are expected to play in front of a NFL Europe
record-crowd of 50,000 at Waldstadium, buoyed by an American
football boom in Germany that not even soccer's ongoing World Cup
can deflate.
	   Both teams finished 7-3 with the Galaxy claiming first place in
the regular season because they had the best head-to-head record
against the Rhein Fire and Amsterdam Admirals. The Admirals were
also 7-3.
	   The two German teams' arrival in the World Bowl wasn't hurt by
the fact they enjoy the league's best home support by far.
Frankfurt averaged 34,000 and the Rhein Fire 25,000.
	   With the usual NFL hoopla, the game will feature a three-hour
pre-game show with mechanical bulls and sky diving. Hot dog and
hamburger stands will be plentiful and the crowd is expected to be
about 35 percent female.
	   ``First people come to party. Then they get into the game and
learn the rules,'' said Birgitt Schoen, 36. ``Besides the guys are
beautiful to look at.''
	   The Rhein Fire appear to have the better weapons, stumbling to a
lackluster finish only after they had gone to 6-0 and cinched a
World Bowl berth.
	   Quinn boasted the league's top quarterback rating at 87.2,
Derrick Clark was the leading rusher with 739 yards on 177 carries
in the 10 games, and wide receiver Marcus Robinson turned enough
heads with Jerry Rice-like smoothness to be voted the offensive
MVP.
	   ``This is a very good football team when we're healthy. Right
now we're a little crippled,'' said Coach Galen Hall, who could
have four starters missing.
	   Throw in defensive tackle Ed Philion, with a league-best nine
sacks and former NFL rookie-of-the-year Mike Croel making a solid
comeback, and the Rhein Fire appear to be the favorites.
	   But only if Quinn plays.
	   His backup, Seattle Seahawks' allocated player Jim Arellanes,
has thrown only one pass all season.
	   Galaxy coach Dick Curl, a former offensive coordinator with the
Barcelona Dragons, doesn't plan to stop throwing without Huard. The
Galaxy have only an average running game, and their other main
offensive threat is veteran Mario Bailey, a receiver who hopes to
hook up next season with an NFL team.
	   ``They (Rhein Fire) have more guys that you could call stars,''
said Curl. ``But we've got a good bunch of guys that work together
well. I think, honestly, that's how you win.''

Death toll in Kosovo stands at well over 300 since late February fighting, comments by foreign minister, Orthodox church; edits throughout. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMS. RECASTS and UPDATES with new casualty figures, minor

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The casualty toll in Serbia's
embattled Kosovo province has risen well over 300 dead and dozens
wounded, while many are missing, latest figures from Serb and
Albanian sources showed Saturday.
	   The pro-Albanian Board for the Protection of Human Rights based
in Pristina, capital of the Serbian secessionist republic, said a
total of 272 ethnic Albanians had died in the fighting, including
31 women and 17 children.
	   It had no Serbian casualty toll, but the pro-government Serbian
Media Center in Pristina listed 22 dead Serbian policemen, another
four officers kidnapped and presumed dead as well as 59 missing.
	   The Yugoslav army, which has been involved in the fighting while
guarding the border between Yugoslavia and Albania has lost four
soldiers, according to official records.
	   Serb sources also said that a total of five Serb civilians have
died and 24 have been wounded this year. In addition, several
ethnic Albanians loyal to Serbia have been found dead in recent
months.
	   The Serbian police, including special forces, have been at the
forefront of government efforts to suppress the increasingly
radical independence movement spearheaded by the underground Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Ethnic Albanians, most of whom want secession from Serbia,
outnumber Serbs in Kosovo 9 to 1.
	   It has become increasingly difficult to obtain reports on
fighting in Kosovo, parts of which are inaccessible because of
roadblocks put up by police and the KLA, respectively. Some 40
percent of the province are believed under rebel control.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported Saturday
some small-scale exchange of gun and grenade fire between police
and the KLA in the border area near the town of Djakovica.
	   Some ``more serious'' shelling was reported against two Albanian
villages, Morina and Smolica, in the same area.
	   No casualties have been reported there, and the area is still
sealed off. ``Considerable movement of police and army troops has
been noticed,'' the center said.
	   Fighting in Kosovo escalated in late February when police
mounted an offensive against the Kosovo Liberation Army, which now
claims to have 15,000 men under arms.
	   Popular support for the KLA's militancy has grown, making it
more difficult to envisage the negotiated settlement the United
States and other Western nations seek.
	   Last week's Serb offensive in western Kosovo prompted NATO to
announce Thursday it would stage a show of air power to persuade
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to halt the assaults.
	   NATO is planning simulated air attacks in Albania and Macedonia
beginning Monday to try to persuade Milosevic to halt military
action in Kosovo.
	   On Friday, Western foreign ministers met in London with their
Russian counterpart to step up pressure on Milosevic. Britain,
which is weighing a U.N. move to back use of NATO force in Kosovo,
urged Milosevic to pull back his troops immediately.
	   The United States, Canada, Britain, France, Italy and Germany
also said they would move to ban flights by Yugoslav Airlines to
underline their concern about the violence in Kosovo, British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said.
	   Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said the sanctions
``buy time for terrorists'' and are against the government ``which
seeks a political solution'' to the Kosovo problem.
	   But at the end of a two-day meeting, a convention of the main
Serb Orthodox Church said in a statement that the current regime
``should be denied the right to make any decision or any any
agreement on Kosovo.''
	   It said that if Kosovo were ultimately lost it would be because
of repression of the Albanians by the Milosevic regime.

<TEXT>
	   HALLE, Germany (AP) _ Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the defending
champion, and Magnus Larsson of Sweden qualified for the finals of
the Gerry Weber Open lawn tennis tournament on Saturday.
	   Kafelnikov needed more than two hours to overcome Sweden's
Thomas Johansson 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (4-7), 6-3 in a hard fought battle
in which the Swede battled leg cramps but powered in 17 aces to six
for the Russian.
	   Larsson overcame Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands 7-6 (7-5), 6-2
in just 55 minutes.
	   Kafelnikov's win came despite an unfaithful first serve and 11
double faults to Johnsson's four throughout the 2-hour, 7-minutes
match that left him make good on only one of seven break chances.
	   But the break came at the right moment with Johansson serving
the eighth game of the third set after the two had held service
through the seventh, and Kafelnikov jumped to a 5-3 lead.
	   Johnsson fought off two match balls before Kafelnikov moved a
point ahead, then won the match on a controversial long return that
the line judge failed to call out as the Swede covered his mouth
with his hand to prevent screaming in frustration.
	   In an interview after the match, Kafelnikov acknowledged he was
struggling with his game, which he said was ``off for the past four
months ... I'm just glad to be in the finals.''
	   Shown a video replay of the long return Kaafelnikov confirmed it
was a bad call. ``Now when I see it, but I couldn't see it out
there ... It was definitely out.''
	   The winner of the Gerry Weber Open in Sunday's final takes home
dlrs 122,000, with the runner-up getting dlrs 72,400.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The ruling political movement in Sudan
came out Saturday in support of Palestinian extremist group Hamas,
which has killed scores of civilians in suicide bombings.
	   In a statement published in the Al-Rai Al-Aam newspaper, the
National Congress called for support for ``the jihad (holy war) of
Hamas.''
	   ``The liberation of Palestine, Jerusalem and the holy mosque of
Al-Aqsa should be placed in the forefront of the concerns of the
people, future generations of Muslims and the Arab nation as
well,'' said the statement which the National Congress issued
jointly with Hamas.
	   The spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, is currently
in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, the last stop of a 3 1/2-month
tour of Muslim countries to drum up funds and support for his
group. He is apparently waiting for permission to return to the
Gaza Strip via Egypt.
	   The National Congress is the grassroots organization of the
government, which officially proscribes political parties. Its
leader is President Omar el-Bashir and its secretary general is
Hassan Turabi, the speaker of Parliament who is widely regarded as
the chief ideologue in the administration.
	   Hamas and the Sudanese government are opposed to the
Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. About 80 people died in
suicide-bomb attacks that Hamas operatives carried out in Israel in
1996-97.
	   Yassin, a 61-year-old quadriplegic, told Israeli television
Friday, in an interview conducted by satellite, that he will return
to Gaza next week whether Israel agrees or not.
	   Some Israeli legislators are known to oppose Yassin's return
because of the statements he has made on tour expressing support
for armed struggle against the Jewish state. Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will decide in a few days whether to
allow Yassin to enter Gaza.

Nigeria rallies to beat Spain; ticket scandal continues Korea-Mexico and Netherlands-Belgium AP Sports Writer

By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ There was no letup in the run of glorious goals and
wide-open soccer Saturday at the World Cup, led by Nigeria's
come-from-behind victory over Spain.
	   Wearing black arm bands on their green jerseys because of the
death Monday of their country's ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, the
Nigerians scored twice in five minutes to give Bora Milutinovic a
victorious tournament debut with his fourth World Cup team.
	   ``We dedicate it to all our compatriots,'' said Sunday Oliseh,
who blasted home the winner from 30 meters (yards) in the 78th
minute. ``This win was for 150 million Nigerians.''
	   Spain, often cited as a contender for the title, controlled the
game for more than 70 minutes before its goalkeeper, Andoni
Zubizarreta, inadvertently knocked in Garbal Lawal's cross at the
near post to tie the game 2-2 in the 73rd.
	   ``We had the match in our grasp, but, well, now we have to
continue fighting,'' Spanish coach Javier Clemente said. ``We
could've won 3-1, but it got away from us. We just got careless.
... That third goal was just sensational.''
	   Later Saturday, South Korea faced Mexico at Lyon and neighboring
rivals Belgium and the Netherlands played at Saint-Denis. On
Sunday, it's Jamaica-Croatia at Lens, Yugoslavia-Iran at
Saint-Etienne and Argentina-Japan at Toulouse.
	   Spain's defeat at Beaujoire Stadium in Nantes was just its
second in 35 games and marked a triumphant return for Milutinovic,
who coached the U.S. in the 1994 tournament, Costa Rica in 1990,
and Mexico in 1996. He was hired in December by Nigeria after he
was fired during a second stint with the Mexicans.
	   Early in the second half, Raul Gonzalez scored one of the most
picturesque goals of the tournament, catching Fernando Hierro's
pass on his outstretched leg at full stride to give Spain a 2-1
lead.
	   Hierro's 25-meter (yard) free kick in the first half was the
first goal of the game, but Mutiu Adepoju answered for the Super
Eagles.
	   The match was preceded by a moment of silence for Fernand
Sastre, the French World Cup organizing committee co-president.
Sastre, 74, who was chiefly responsible for turning France's hopes
of staging the tournament into reality, died early Saturday of lung
cancer.
	   The exciting soccer _ after four days of competition, scoring is
prevalent and rowdy fans and dirty play aren't _ does have its
downside: It makes fans who are victims of a ticket scams even more
incensed that they're missing out on the action.
	   French authorities said for the first time Saturday that they
were ready to investigate the growing international ticket scandal.
	   FIFA and the World Cup organizing committee have earlier pledged
to file lawsuits against companies or individuals found to have
taken part in the scams, which have left thousands of fans without
tickets.
	   The problem is now exploding in France. Fans who dealt with
unlicensed brokers and tour operators are arriving without tickets
they thought would be waiting for them. It's estimated that some
12,000 Japanese fans are ticketless, although most have stayed
home.
	   Similar, although smaller, cases have been reported in Britain,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Brazil.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Troops battled rebels pinned in a
military garrison in Guinea Bissau's capital on Saturday,
reportedly tightening the siege of downtown areas decimated by days
of shell attacks.
	   Rebels in the former Portuguese colony in West Africa vowed,
meanwhile, to use tanks to break the government's siege of their
positions, news reports said. Tank movements would escalate attacks
that until now have been limited to mortar and machine gun fire.
	   The rebels broadcast their intention to deploy tanks on a
private Bissau radio station they captured last week, Portuguese
radio RDP-Africa said.
	   RDP-Africa reported heavy fighting early Saturday in the capital
and footage broadcast on Portuguese state television RTP showed
homes reduced to rubble and streets full of shell holes.
	   Portuguese evacuees arriving Saturday in Lisbon from Bissau said
the shelling struck embassies, ministries, Bissau's main hospital
and the Bissau phone company building.
	   Government troops, supported by soldiers from neighboring
Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, surrounded an unknown number of
renegade soldiers in a military garrison in a northern suburb of
Bissau. The rebels, who attempted a coup last week, also held
positions near a barracks on the south side of the coastal city.
	   No figures were available for the number of casualties in the
week of fighting.
	   Guinea-Bissau Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva
described the rebel strongholds as ``strategic defensive
positions.''
	   The military garrison used by the rebels was reportedly used by
a tank battalion, supporting the besieged soldiers' claim to be
able to break out.
	   But Delfim da Silva told The Associated Press in Lisbon where he
was stranded due to flight cancellations that ``The tanks have not
been maintained. They're old, Soviet-built tanks.''
	   The rebels, led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, demanded that the foreign troops be withdrawn from the
country and that international phone lines, cut on Thursday, be
restored, RDP-Africa said.
	   They also offered to negotiate an end to the coup attempt with
the government at a foreign venue and suggested Gambia, according
to the report.
	   Mane is from Gambia. He was a guerilla fighter in the war
against Portuguese colonial rule from 1961 to 1974. He was later
appointed head of the armed forces after independence even though
he spoke no Portuguese, the country's official language.
	   Mane, who was fired in January amid allegations of arms
smuggling, has accused President Joao Bernardo Vieira of corruption
and called on him to step down so that early elections can be held.
	   Vieira himself came to power in a 1980 coup. He was elected in
the country's first democratic elections for president and
parliament four years ago.

World Cup: Tunisians out to prove strength of national and Arab football 
</HEADLINE>
By TAREK EL-TABLAWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ With its sights locked on Group G
rival England as its most powerful adversary, Tunisia believes it
has the arsenal to advance out of the first round of the World Cup.
	   ``We're shooting for making it into the second round,'' Ali
el-Selmi, the assistant coach, told The Associated Press by
telephone from the training camp in Montellimar, before the team
headed to Marseille on Saturday.
	   ``Our immediate focus, however, has been on the England match.
It will be a difficult, but good match,'' el-Selmi said.
	   But no one expects Monday's match to be easy for Tunisia. The
North African team will do well to give the English a close battle.
As for advancing to the second round, few soccer experts expect it
to happen.
	   Still, the team's managers are confident that they have brought
with them a group of players who can help transform their bold
predictions into fact.
	   ``We have a group of young, strong, ambitious players who have
been tested on the field in the 1996 African Nations Cup and the
Atlanta Olympics,'' he said. In the ANC competition, the team went
all the way to the finals before losing to host South Africa.
	   ``We are here to show the new strength of Tunisian and Arab
football,'' said el-Selmi.
	   The Tunisians played several games in preparation for the World
Cup, facing off against the Chilean and Austrian national teams,
and losing 3-2 and 2-1, respectively.
	   ``They were good games, nonetheless, and they show that we can
hold our own in competition of this caliber,'' said el-Selmi,
noting that they defeated a French team made up of some top league
players.
	   El-Selmi said that the starting lineup will be announced the day
of the match, but added that all the players are ``fit and ready.''
	   Goalie Chokri el-Ouaer is ``fighting off the flu,'' said
el-Selmi. ``However, he will be fit come match-time.''
	   Having the odds against the two-time Arab Nations Cup winners
will at least take the pressure of expectation of the team.
	   ``We have nothing to lose and everything to gain at this World
Cup,'' the team's Polish coach, Henri Kasperczak said earlier.

Albania, Macedonia strengthen ties to face conflict in Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Worried about the escalation of violence
in neighboring Kosovo province, Albanian Premier Fatos Nano
declared Saturday that Balkan countries should start looking for
allies among their neighbors.
	   ``Albania and Macedonia are building a model of coexistence
between two peoples of the Balkans, which have always looked for
allies outside the Balkans,'' Nano said after meeting with his
Macedonian counterpart Branko Cervenkovski in the Albanian capital
of Tirana.
	   On Friday, Albania and Macedonia approved NATO exercises that
would allow Alliance planes to fly simulated bombing raids over
their countries in an effort to halt the violence in Kosovo, where
more than 250 people have died in recent months as Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic has stepped up his offensive with
troops and police against ethnic Albanians in the southern Serbian
province.
	   Albania has been pressing for weeks for NATO actions to stem
bloodshed in Kosovo, where Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1. More
than 800 people, including Albanians and Serbs, have been killed in
raids and in fighting.
	   The government of Macedonia, where the Slav majority has closer
ties to Yugoslavs than ethnic Albanians, also approved a one-time
``flyover through Macedonia's airspace'' of NATO planes, but said
future NATO requests would be considered separately.
	   Cervenkovski told reporters his country supports a peaceful
solution to the crises in Kosovo.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The ruling political movement in Sudan

Death toll in Kosovo stands at well over 300 since late February comments by foreign minister, Orthodox church; edits throughout. No pickup 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with new casualty figures, minor fighting,
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The casualty toll in Serbia's
embattled Kosovo province has risen well over 300 dead, with dozens
wounded and many missing, latest figures from Serb and Albanian
sources showed Saturday.
	   The pro-Albanian Board for the Protection of Human Rights based
in Pristina, capital of the separatist province, said 272 ethnic
Albanians had died in fighting, including 31 women and 17 children.
	   It had no Serbian casualty toll, but the pro-government Serbian
Media Center in Pristina listed 22 dead Serbian policemen, another
four officers kidnapped and presumed dead as well as 59 missing.
	   Serbian police, including special forces, have been at the
forefront of government efforts to suppress the increasingly
radical independence movement spearheaded by the underground Kosovo
Liberation Army. Ethnic Albanians, most of whom want secession from
Serbia, outnumber Serbs in Kosovo 9 to 1.
	   The Yugoslav army, involved in the fighting while guarding the
border between Yugoslavia and Albania, has lost four soldiers,
according to official records.
	   Serb sources also said a total of five Serb civilians have died
and 24 have been wounded this year. In addition, several ethnic
Albanians loyal to Serbia have been found dead in recent months.
	   It has become increasingly difficult to obtain reports on
fighting in Kosovo, parts of which are inaccessible because of
roadblocks put up by police and the KLA, respectively. Some 40
percent of the province are believed under rebel control.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported Saturday
some small-scale exchange of gun and grenade fire between police
and the KLA in the border area near the town of Djakovica. Some
``more serious'' shelling was reported against two Albanian
villages, Morina and Smolica, in the same area.
	   No casualties have been reported there, and the area is still
sealed off. ``Considerable movement of police and army troops has
been noticed,'' the center said.
	   Fighting in Kosovo escalated in late February when police
mounted an offensive against the Kosovo Liberation Army, which now
claims to have 15,000 men under arms.
	   Popular support for the KLA's militancy has grown, making it
more difficult to envisage the negotiated settlement the United
States and other Western nations seek.
	   Last week's Serb offensive in western Kosovo prompted NATO to
announce Thursday it would stage a show of air power to persuade
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to halt the assaults.
	   NATO is planning simulated air attacks in Albania and Macedonia
beginning Monday to try to persuade Milosevic to halt military
action in Kosovo.
	   On Friday, Western foreign ministers met in London with their
Russian counterpart to step up pressure on Milosevic. Britain,
which is weighing a United Nations move to back use of NATO force
in Kosovo, urged Milosevic to pull back his troops immediately.
	   The United States, Canada, Britain, France, Italy and Germany
also said they would move to ban flights by Yugoslav Airlines to
underline their concern about the violence in Kosovo, British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said.
	   Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said the sanctions
``buy time for terrorists'' and are against the government ``which
seeks a political solution.''
	   But at the end of a two-day meeting, a convention of the main
Serb Orthodox Church said in a statement that the current regime
``should be denied the right to make any decision or any any
agreement on Kosovo.''
	   It said that if Kosovo were ultimately lost, it would be because
of repression of the Albanians by the Milosevic regime.

World Cup: Italian players fret about next match with Cameroon 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ With African teams continuing to shine,
and good results becoming less surprising, Italy now squirms
somewhat when Cameroon, its second opponent, is mentioned.
	   ``Cameroon is a very dangerous team. We must play for victory,
but we will need to be careful against such an unpredictable
opponent,'' Italian keeper Gianluca Pagliuca said Saturday.
	   Pagliuca's comments came after he said he was impressed by the
speed and athleticism of the Indomitable Lions in Thursday's 1-1
draw against Austria.
	   ``All big teams have been off to difficult starts in this World
Cup,'' AC Milan veteran defender Alessandro Costacurta said.
	   ``This means that the quality has leveled and that easy
opponents no longer exist. African teams such as Nigeria, Morocco
and Cameroon could produce big surprises.''
	   He noted that many African players have been gaining experience
with European clubs, helping their national teams to develop better
tactics and improving the overall technical ability of the sides.
	   Italy plays Cameroon in Montpellier on Wednesday after escaping
a near upset by Chile in its opening World Cup match.
	   Italy only managed a 2-2 draw on a late, controversial penalty
by Roberto Baggio.
	   The possibility to consider the 31-year-old Baggio, originally
thought of only as a substitute, as a strike partner with the
Alessandro Del Piero was expected to torment to be coach Cesare
Maldini's until kickoff.
	   ``Del Piero and Baggio are two great players and can start
together,'' said Filippo Inzaghi, the 24-year-old Juventus forward
who played a late portion of the match against Chile.
	   A teammate of Del Piero at Juventus, Inzaghi suggested himself
as a third starting forward against Cameroon.
	   ``We will have to be more aggressive than against Chile. If we
win against Cameroon, qualification for the second round is almost
certain. A victory will also dispel all criticism about the team,''
Inzaghi said.
	   Italy's defense and midfield came under deluge of criticism for
allowing Chile to press its offense _ and two goals.
	   ``Two shots, two goals. A quite amazing record for a
goalkeeper,'' said Pagliuca. ``Certainly Chile proved our strongest
opponent in Group B. It can rely on two great strikers such as
(Ivan) Zamorano and (Marcelo) Salas.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq and United Nations weapons inspectors
held a tense meeting Saturday with neither side giving ground on
their dispute over Baghdad's compliance with a U.N. weapons ban,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Troops battled rebels pinned in a
military garrison in Guinea Bissau's capital on Saturday,
reportedly tightening the siege of downtown areas decimated by days
of shell attacks.
	   Rebels in the former Portuguese colony in West Africa vowed,
meanwhile, to use tanks to break the government's siege of their
positions, news reports said. Tank movements would escalate attacks
that until now have been limited to mortar and machine gun fire.
	   The rebels broadcast their intention to deploy tanks on a
private Bissau radio station they captured last week, Portuguese
radio RDP-Africa said.
	   RDP-Africa reported heavy fighting early Saturday in the capital
and footage broadcast on Portuguese state television RTP showed
homes reduced to rubble and streets full of shell holes.
	   Portuguese evacuees arriving Saturday in Lisbon from Bissau said
the shelling struck embassies, ministries, Bissau's main hospital
and the Bissau phone company building.
	   Government troops, supported by soldiers from neighboring
Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, surrounded an unknown number of
renegade soldiers in a military garrison in a northern suburb of
Bissau. The rebels, who attempted a coup last week, also held
positions near a barracks on the south side of the coastal city.
	   No figures were available for the number of casualties in the
week of fighting.
	   Guinea-Bissau Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva
described the rebel strongholds as ``strategic defensive
positions.''
	   The military garrison used by the rebels was reportedly used by
a tank battalion, supporting the besieged soldiers' claim to be
able to break out.
	   But Delfim da Silva told The Associated Press in Lisbon where he
was stranded due to flight cancellations that ``The tanks have not
been maintained. They're old, Soviet-built tanks.''
	   The rebels, led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, demanded that the foreign troops be withdrawn from the
country and that international phone lines, cut on Thursday, be
restored, RDP-Africa said.
	   They also offered to negotiate an end to the coup attempt with
the government at a foreign venue and suggested Gambia, according
to the report.
	   Mane is from Gambia. He was a guerilla fighter in the war
against Portuguese colonial rule from 1961 to 1974. He was later
appointed head of the armed forces after independence even though
he spoke no Portuguese, the country's official language.
	   Mane, who was fired in January amid allegations of arms
smuggling, has accused President Joao Bernardo Vieira of corruption
and called on him to step down so that early elections can be held.
	   Vieira himself came to power in a 1980 coup. He was elected in
the country's first democratic elections for president and
parliament four years ago.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Worried about the escalation of violence
in neighboring Kosovo, Albanian Premier Fatos Nano declared
Saturday that Balkan countries should start looking for allies
among their neighbors.
	   ``Albania and Macedonia are building a model of coexistence
between two peoples of the Balkans, which have always looked for
allies outside the Balkans,'' Nano after meeting with his
Macedonian counterpart Branko Cervenkovski in Tirana.
	   Both countries approved on Friday NATO exercises that will allow
Alliance planes to fly simulated bombing raids over their countries
in an effort to halt the violence in Kosovo.
	   Albania has been pressing for weeks for NATO actions to stem
bloodshed in Kosovo, where Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one.
More than 300 people, including Albanians and Serbs, have been
killed in raids and in fighting.
	   The government of Macedonia, where the Slav majority has closer
ties to Yugoslavs than ethnic Albanians, also approved a one-time
``flyover through Macedonia's airspace'' of NATO planes, but said
future NATO requests would be considered separately.
	   Cervenkovski told reporters his country supports a peaceful
solution to the crises in Kosovo, achieved through dialogue between
the parties in the conflict.

Buthelezi launches election campaign, elephant symbol for 1999 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Zulu nationalist leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi on Saturday launched the party's campaign for the 1999
elections, attacking alleged corruption and impotence in President
Nelson Mandela's government.
	   Buthelezi, who is Mandela's home affairs minister, also launched
a new logo of two adult elephants and a calf for the Inkatha
Freedom Party in this Indian Ocean port city.
	   ``I see our people being pulled apart by the greed and the
ambition of the few, rather than coming together in joint
efforts,'' he told the 3,000 people gathered for the launch.
	   Inkatha nearly boycotted 1994's first all-race elections, then
won 11 percent of the seats in Parliament. Inkatha favors a federal
system that would allow more autonomy in KwaZulu-Natal, where the
party governs provincial affairs.
	   Buthelezi claims Mandela reneged on a promise before the 1994
elections to discuss more power for local governments. The
disagreement lead to the threatened boycott.
	   The Zulu leader called for a ``revolution of goodwill'' to
foster a moral rebuilding of the country from the bottom up to weed
out ``a culture of corruption and abuses'' that he says prevails in
government.
	   Last month, Buthelezi opened 15 new branches in the black
township of Soweto outside Johannesburg, a 1994 stronghold for
Mandela's African National Congress.
	   The new branches tripled the number of local Inkatha offices to
a total of 22.
	   Many of the country's 8 million Zulus have migrated to Gauteng
to work in the gold mines and other industries.
	   More than 10,000 people have died in fighting between ANC and
Inkatha supporters in KwaZulu-Natal over the past decade. As
elections approach in 1999, Inkatha-ANC violence is expected to
increase.
	   Peace talks have been held over the past year between the two
groups.

World Cup: Korean goalscorer becomes first ejected under new rule 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Ha Seok-ju became the first victim of FIFA's
new directive to eject anyone for a foul tackle from behind,
ejected in the 30th minute of South Korea's World Cup opener
against Mexico on Saturday.
	   Ha's sliding challenge on the sideline wiped out Ramon Ramirez
and _ after three yellow cards earlier in the match _ Austrian
referee Guenther Benko flashed the Korean midfielder a red card.
	   The ejection came only two minutes after Ha had put Korea ahead
1-0 on a 30-meter free kick that glanced off the head of Duilio
Davino in the Mexican wall.
	   FIFA increased the penalty for the sliding, studs-up tackles
from behind with the start of this World Cup by instructing
referees to send off any player who attempts such a challenge and
commits a foul.
	   Some criticized the world body saying the quadrennial
championship was not the place for experiments and predicted a
flood of ejections in the early games.
	   But while some tackles which appeared to fit FIFA's target went
unpunished, Ha's ejection was the first after eight games.
	   Anatoli Nankov was ejected from Bulgaria's 0-0 draw with
Paraguay, but his red was after accumulating two yellows, neither
of them a tackle from behind.

Pooches abound -- 15,600 -- at largest World Dog Show

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ There was a lot of sniffing,
scratching, barking and tail wagging when 15,600 mutts met in the
Finnish capital at the biggest World Dog Show ever.
	   Dog owners from 44 countries entered their prize pooches in
group competitions ranging from miniature schnauzers, Great Danes
and Rottweilers; to the less common East Siberian laikas, Peruvian
hairless dogs and the Thai ridgeback.
	   The competitions, which end Sunday, were held in 60 rings in a
hall with 36,000 square meters (43,200 sq. yards) of floor space,
and in tents outside.
	   ``This is a great event, but the ring for Rottweilers is too
small,'' said Elena Rebecchi, from Milan, Italy, whose dog, Xari
von Bickesheim, came fifth in the Rottweiler champion class.
	   In an adjacent ring, a German shepherd named Capo lunged after
someone posing as an escaping thief, tugged at his wrist and
brought him to a stop.
	   Capo, belonging to the Finnish police force, was part of one of
many sideshows in the event that included obedience, agility and
tracking displays.
	   The four-day event sold out Helsinki hotels.
	   ``Our Taishi loves it, but we don't let him sleep on the bed,''
said Serena Burnett of Los Angeles about her massive Japanese tosa.
	   The Holiday Inn, located next to the Helsinki Fair Center where
the dog show was held, housed some 70 dogs and their owners, and
more than 100 international show judges.
	   ``We got reservations in spring 1997 when there was just a big
hole in the ground because we were still building the foundations
of the hotel,'' said Johanna Tyynela, a Holiday Inn manager.
	   A night at the hotel costs some 900 markkaa (dlrs 166 dollars)
for humans. Dogs got a special deal _ 25 markkaa (dlrs 4.60).
	   ``Our manager is a dog lover,'' Tyynela said Saturday. ``And the
barking hasn't seem to have disturbed anyone _ not yet anyway.''
	   Near the fair center, balls of fur and fluff blew in the breeze
as proud owners combed their hairy hounds. Also, participants and
fans had to watch where they stepped, although pooper scoopers were
in abundant use.
	   ``Feces can be a problem with so many dogs in such a small area,
but we have lots of collection points and owners really do watch
what their own dogs get up to,'' said Kaija Unhola, from the show
committee.

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ With stability in the Horn of Africa at
stake, five African leaders are moving to take charge of frantic
efforts to foster peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
	   Since early May, tank and artillery battles have flared on three
fronts, and warplanes' bombs have killed civilians on both sides of
the disputed border. No skirmishes were reported Saturday.
	   It will be difficult to avert full-scale war unless a plan can
be found to allow both Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and
Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki to back down with honor.
	   ``We've got to find a face-saving forumla,'' said Patrick
Glikes, a London-based Africa expert. ``They can't afford a
protracted war.''
	   Eritrean rebels, who fought a 30-year war to secede from
Ethiopia, joined Ethiopian rebels in a 17-year fight to oust
Ethiopia's Marxist government. In 1993, Eritreans voted for
independence and Meles' government let the region secede.
	   ``Normally, their relationship should be a positive aspect,''
said Mario Baldi, chief of mission at the Italian Embassy. ``Of
course, the worst wars have been fought between brothers.''
	   Italian envoy Rino Serri, before arriving in Asmara Saturday to
help negotiate, told the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera,
``Their positions are still far apart.''
	   Ethiopian government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse said Saturday
that the government was roudnign up for questioning Eritrean
residents who have had military training
	   ``Eritreans who live and work peacefully in Ethiopia will not be
questioned,'' she added. About 550,000 Eritreans live in Ethiopia.
	   The impasse in resolving the conflict is that Ethiopia continues
to insist Eritrea withdraw its troops from disputed areas before
peace talks can begin. Eritrea refuses, claiming the disputed
territory is based on boundaries drawn by Italy when it occupied
Eritrea in 1885.
	   Eritrea is pressing for an immediate cessation of hostilities;
direct talks with Ethiopia and Eritrea or indirectly through
high-level African mediators; and an official demarcation of the
border, probably by United Nations experts.
	   ``Let's demarcate the whole border, lay stones and posts so
there will be no more disputes,'' said Eritrean presidential
spokesman Yemane Gebremeskel.
	   All-out war could be disastrous not only for the two countries,
which are still rebuilding from the civil war, but also for the
stability of the entire region.
	   A team appointed by the Organization of African Unity was
tentatively scheduled to go to the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa on
Thursday, and to the Eritrean capital Asmara on Friday, Yemane
said. There was no immediate confirmation from the Ethiopian side.
	   The team will be led by Burkina Faso President Blaise Campaore
in his role as current OAU chairman. Also participating are
presidents Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Hassan Gouled Aptidon of
Djibouti; Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda, and OAU Secretary-General
Salim Ahmed Salim, Yemane said.
	   Their arrival will represent a new phase in efforts to end the
conflict, building on a U.S.-Rwanda effort that has foundered.
	   ``The U.S. plan has been overtaken by events,'' Yemane said.
``Then we were trying to avert war, now we have a war on our
hands.''
	   A team led by Robert Houdek, a former U.S. ambassador to
Eritrea, departed from Asmara for Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian
capital, on Saturday without comment.
	   Ethiopia and Eritrea are close American allies who have
bolstered Washington's policy of isolating the Islamic government
in Sudan and have sought without success to end clan wars in
Somalia.
	   The battles center on more than a half-dozen disputed patches of
land, the largest of which is the 400-square-kilometer
(160-square-mile) Yirga triangle.
	   But businessmen say the root causes of the conflict are
economic. Relationships worsened in November when Eritrea
introduced its own currency, setting off a trade spat that has hurt
both economies, reducing cross-border trade to a trickle.
	   The conflict surprised most diplomats, Eritreans and Ethiopians.
The two governments had been close allies. They had peacefully
disagreed over the border since Eritrea became independent.
	   In the past five years, Eritrea ha had an armed border conflict
with Sudan, a border dispute with Djibouti and another with Yemen
over control of Red Sea islands.

NATO to carryout out air exercises Monday over Albania, Macedonia 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with fresh details; ADDS byline
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO will send fighters, helicopters
and reconnaissance aircraft into the air over Albania and Macedonia
Monday in a show of force to impress Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
	   The military exercise, code-named Determined Falcon, is aimed at
pressuring Milosevic into backing off from his armed campaign
against ethnic Albanians in the southern Serbian province of
Kosovo, scene of violent clashes that have killed more than 300
people, Albanian and Serb, in recent months.
	   ``The objective of this exercise is to demonstrate NATO's
capability to project power rapidly into the region,'' said NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana in a statement from NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
	   ``A variety of aircraft will be participating in this exercise
including fighters, reconnaissance, airborne early warning, tankers
and helicopters,'' he said. ``The aircraft are provided by a number
of nations.''
	   The get-tough NATO exercises will probably come before Russian
President Boris Yeltsin has had a chance to talk to Milosevic, who
is in Moscow Monday for talks with his long-time allies. The
Russians, who oppose any direct action against Yugoslavia, feel not
all diplomatic means have been exhausted.
	   Yeltsin has promised to use his personal influence to try to
defuse the situation, which risks spilling over into Yugoslavia's
Balkan neighbors.
	   The aircraft in the exercise will originate from bases in many
NATO countries and fly to the exercise area for specific tasks,
then return to their originating bases. They will be under the
control of the Fifth Allied Tactical Air Force Combined Operations
Center at Vicenza, Italy.
	   The show of power was one of several decisions by NATO defense
ministers during their meeting here Thursday.
	   The ministers also ordered military planners to study options
for further action ranging from accelerated planning for other
military exercises in the region to direct air strikes inside
Yugoslavia and use of ground troops.
	   NATO officials stress that direct military intervention is
merely one option under study, but U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said Friday that there is ``a very short time frame ... to
solve this peacefully.''
	   ``NATO continues to support a political solution which brings an
end to the violence in Kosovo, provides an enhanced status for
Kosovo, preserves the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia and safeguards the human and civil rights of all
inhabitants of Kosovo,'' Solana said.
	   NATO is walking a thin line between getting tough with
Milosevic, who is after all a leader forced to deal with an
insurrection in his own country, and giving aid and comfort to
rebel forces the alliance does not support.
	   Albania has been pressing for weeks for NATO action to stem
bloodshed in Kosovo, where Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one.
	   The government of Macedonia, where the Slav majority has closer
ties to Yugoslavs than ethnic Albanians, also has approved a
one-time ``flyover through Macedonia's airspace'' of NATO planes,
but said future NATO requests would be considered separately.

and Rottweilers; to the less common East Siberian laikas, Peruvian
hairless dogs and the Thai ridgeback.
	   The competitions, which end Sunday, were held in 60 rings in a
hall with 36,000 square meters (43,200 sq. yards) of floor space,
and in tents outside.
	   ``This is a great event, but the ring for Rottweilers is too
small,'' said Elena Rebecchi, from Milan, Italy, whose dog, Xari
von Bickesheim, came fifth in the Rottweiler champion class.
	   In an adjacent ring, a German shepherd named Capo lunged after
someone posing as an escaping thief, tugged at his wrist and
brought him to a stop.
	   Capo, belonging to the Finnish police force, was part of one of
many sideshows in the event that included obedience, agility and
tracking displays.
	   The four-day event sold out Helsinki hotels.
	   ``Our Taishi loves it, but we don't let him sleep on the bed,''
said Serena Burnett of Los Angeles about her massive Japanese tosa.
	   The Holiday Inn, located next to the Helsinki Fair Center where
the dog show was held, housed some 70 dogs and their owners, and
more than 100 international show judges.
	   ``We got reservations in spring 1997 when there was just a big
hole in the ground because we were still building the foundations
of the hotel,'' said Johanna Tyynela, a Holiday Inn manager.
	   A night at the hotel costs some 900 markkaa (dlrs 166 dollars)
for humans. Dogs got a special deal _ 25 markkaa (dlrs 4.60).
	   ``Our manager is a dog lover,'' Tyynela said Saturday. ``And the
barking hasn't seem to have disturbed anyone _ not yet anyway.''
	   Near the fair center, balls of fur and fluff blew in the breeze
as proud owners combed their hairy hounds. Also, participants and
fans had to watch where they stepped, although pooper scoopers were
in abundant use.
	   ``Feces can be a problem with so many dogs in such a small area,
but we have lots of collection points and owners really do watch
what their own dogs get up to,'' said Kaija Unhola, from the show
committee.

Report: Ex-foreign minister's transactions fuel judicial suspicions 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Constitutional Council President Roland Dumas was
fighting off newly publicized evidence in a kickback investigation,
showing he received large amounts of cash in his bank account after
the sale of frigates to Taiwan.
	   The head of one of France's highest legal bodies, Dumas was
questioned again Friday by authorities who have placed him under
formal investigation _ one step short of being charged _ for his
alleged role in the scandal.
	   The respected daily Le Monde reported Saturday that the longtime
Socialist politician was questioned about financial transactions.
Among them, he received 2,674,000 francs (dlrs 445,000) in mostly
cash deposits while he was foreign minister in 1992.
	   Dumas, 75, received the money at a time when he was barred from
working as a lawyer and earned an annual salary of 460,000 francs
(dlrs 76,000) as foreign minister, the newspaper said.
	   ``Everything will be explained,'' Le Monde quoted Dumas as
saying. Dumas has refused to step down during the probe.
	   Although the origin of the money in handbags was not clear,
``the chronology of the deposits appear troublesome,'' Le Monde
said.
	   Dumas has said he dealt in large amounts of cash at the time
because he was selling off artwork to prepare the inheritances for
his family.
	   But investigators suspect the money was a kickback from
Elf-Aquitaine, the then state-owned company that served as a
mediator for the frigate sale, and was paid to Dumas friend
Christine Deviers-Joncour.
	   During Friday's questioning, Dumas told Le Monde: ``I forcefully
indicated that I never received any amount of money, whatever the
sum, directly or indirectly from Elf, nor from Madame
Deviers-Joncour.''
	   Le Monde said Deviers-Joncour received 31 million francs (dlrs
5.1 million) in a Swiss bank account on Feb. 5, 1992, for helping
engineer the frigate sales. Most of the deposits Dumas received
that year came between February and July.
	   The newspaper said that among dates that ``fed the suspicion of
judges,'' bank records seized by Swiss authorities show
Deviers-Joncour withdrew 84,000 Swiss francs and converted them to
300,000 French francs (dlrs 50,000) on March 17, 1992.
	   Three days later, Dumas' account at a Credit Lyonnais branch on
the Left Bank received 250,000 francs (dlrs 41,000) in cash.
	   Deviers-Joncour, who reportedly received a total of 66 million
francs (dlrs 10.1 million) for the sale, also is under formal
investigation in the scandal. But she insists Dumas never received
any of the money.
	   Dumas has denied he influenced France's foreign policy to sell
the frigates, though France had sought to maintain good relations
with China by avoiding arms sales to Taiwan.

Parliament in Kyrgyzstan calls for investigation into cyanide spill 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The parliament of Kyrgyzstan voted Saturday to
create an international commission to investigate a cyanide spill
that has been blamed for four deaths and hundreds of injuries, a
Russian news agency reported.
	   Lawmakers also said they would consider asking for compensation
from Canada for damage to the environment. The cyanide was being
delivered to a Canadian mining company when it spilled into a river
last month.
	   Parliament voted to launch a ``credible investigation of the
effects of the environmental crisis'' following a three-day
extraordinary session called to discuss the disaster, ITAR-Tass
reported.
	   The accident occurred May 20 when a truck, carrying 20 tons of
highly toxic sodium cyanide powder to a mine operated by Canada's
Cameco Co., veered off a mountain road and crashed into the
Barskaan River, which feeds into Lake Issyk Kul.
	   An estimated 1,700 kilograms (3,400 pounds) of sodium cyanide
leaked into the river and some of it reached the lake, which
includes a valuable nature preserve and is home to several rare
species.
	   A resolution passed by Parliament urged the government to
scrutinize the general agreement with Cameco and ``make all the
necessary changes and amendments'' to it.
	   President Askar Akayev urged Parliament not to fan political
passions, ITAR-Tass said. The agency quoted presidential press
secretary Kanybek Imanaliyev as warning that Parliament could
``deprive the republic of ... investors'' by reacting strongly in
the cyanide case.
	   Cameco is the world's largest publicly traded uranium company.

World Cup: Nigeria rallies to stun Spain 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with West, Milutinovic quotes. TRIMS.
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Nigeria chose a perfect time to put the
``super'' back in Super Eagles.
	   Outhustled and outplayed by Spain for 70 minutes, Nigeria struck
twice in five minutes to rally for a 3-2 victory Saturday in the
World Cup opener for both teams.
	   Wearing black arm bands on their green jerseys because of the
death Monday of their country's ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, the
Nigerians looked for much of the game like a distracted team and
one that had lost its last three tuneups before heading to France
'98.
	   But after digging themselves a 2-1 hole Saturday, the 1996
Olympic champions fought back on goals by Garba Lawal and Sunday
Oliseh to move atop Group D and give credence to those who have
predicted a surprise from one of the African nations.
	   ``This win was for 150 million Nigerians,'' said Oliseh, who
slammed in the winner from 30 meters (yards) with 12 minutes left.
	   Lawal evened the score in the 73rd minute, gathering a pass from
Rasheed Yekini on the left side of the box and firing the ball
parallel to the goal line. Veteran keeper Andoni Zubizarreta,
standing about 1 1-2 meters from the near post and facing Lawal,
reached down with his right hand and deflected the ball into his
own net.
	   ``We had the match in our grasp,'' Spanish coach Javier Clemente
said. ``We could have won 3-1, but it got away from us, We just got
careless.''
	   Oliseh, given time to calculate his shot, blasted a low drive
that glanced off the post and past Zubizarreta, playing in his
fourth World Cup.
	   ``I have to congratulate Nigeria. That third goal was just
sensational,'' added Clemente, whose team lost for just the second
time in 35 outings.
	   Spain is perennially one of Europe's strongest teams and has
qualified for six World Cup finals in a row, yet its best showing
was fourth place in 1950.
	   The Super Eagles made their cup debut four years ago and threw a
scare into eventual finalist Italy in the second round. Victory at
the Atlanta Games only increased expectations.
	   But beset by injuries _ neither Nwankwo Kanu (ankle) nor Daniel
Amokachi (knee) played Saturday _ the team dropped recent World Cup
warmup games to Germany, Yugoslavia and Netherlands by a combined
score of 9-1.
	   ``We showed Nigeria is not dead,'' Oliseh said. ``Our problem
now is to keep our heads.''
	   Spain exploited Nigeria's inconsistency to take the lead through
a Fernando Hierro free kick and a goal by Raul Gonzalez off an
assist from his Real Madrid teammate.
	   ``We let in some silly goals,'' defender Taribo West said. ``But
I never doubted for one minute we could win.''
	   The spot kick, in the 21st minute, was awarded when Mobi Oparaku
fouled Alfonso Perez as they went up for a floating ball. Hierro
curled his shot around the defensive wall, and keeper Peter Rufai
watched as the ball bounced inside the right post.
	   Nigeria tied it at 1-1 in the 25th as midfielder Mutiu Adepoju
leaped to head home Lawal's corner kick, but two minutes into the
second half Raul made it 2-1 by flashing in on the left side and
spectacularly volleying home a long through ball from Hierro.
	   ``The worst part is that we had the game won,'' Hierro said.
``Nigeria is a great team physically. They've got very strong
players. We didn't slow down the game and they were able to beat us
with their speed.''
	   Nigerian coach Bora Milutinovic, with his record fourth
different country at the World Cup, sparked the attack in the 70th
by sending on Yekini for the ineffective Oparaku, who was
repeatedly beaten down the flank by Raul.
	   The move paid immediate dividends, with Yekini setting up the
equalizer and creating more space for the Nigerian attack.
	   ``The game is 90 minutes and you have to be aware you won't play
well the whole time,'' said Milutinovic, draped in an ``agbada,''
an embroidered white Nigerian dress team officials gave him before
the match. ``What's important is to play well at the end, and we
did.
	   ``The way we fought back to win was a very, very valuable,
especially against a team like Spain.''
	   The match started with a moment of silence for Fernand Sastre,
the French World Cup organizing committee co-president who died
earlier Saturday of lung cancer.
	   Former soccer star Michel Platini, the other co-president, was
among those who observed the tribute.

World Cup: thousands of soccer fans victimized by ticket fraud AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Thousands of Japanese jammed this lovely
old city, having flown halfway around the world to cheer Japan in
its first World Cup. Most, however, found themselves without
tickets.
	   And nearly as many Argentines, soccer-mad veterans of the game
who hosted and won the Cup in 1978 and repeated in 1986, were in
the same position for the game Sunday, for different reasons.
	   Neither group of fans was happy about it.
	   Kazu Ito, 30, cried in the Place Capitole, as he held up a sign
in French reading, ``Bon jour, France. I'll buy two tickets.'' Like
thousands of others, he'd been caught in a mysterious scam.
	   Japanese tour operators sold packages with hotel, flight and
match tickets, but the tickets never materialized. If it remains
unclear who was responsible, the victims are obvious enough.
	   ``I learned the day before I left that we'd have no tickets,''
Ito said, in blue football jersey and bare legs. ``But if I didn't
come anyway, I'd have had no chance at all.''
	   A Tokyo hotel worker of limited means, he was ready to pay the
equivalent of a thousand dollars. But scalpers were holding out for
more.
	   Nearby, Kenji Yoshiba, a 28-year-old clerk with shocking blue
dyed hair, could afford no more than a few hundred dollars. ``I'd
like to believe that somewhere tickets are out there,'' he said.
	   If so, a lot of people wanted them.
	   Satoshi Hasegawa, 27, figured out the problem the minute he
reached Toulouse. He sent out a taxi driver, who bought back a
ticket for 3,000 francs (dlrs 500), before prices soared. ``It's
worth it,'' he said.
	   Masumi Kawase, 30, an interpreter living in Spain, came with
four busloads of Japanese from Barcelona. They paid for tickets
there but did not find them here.
	   ``I can't believe this could happen,'' she said, outside the
stadium where she hoped scalpers might appear.
	   All around her, furious Argentines paced and shouted, exchanging
rumors about where black market tickets might be found. About 5,000
came, knowing that entries to the games would be a problem.
	   ``The Argentine football association gave the tickets to big
tour operators who sell expensive packages, and individual
supporters couldn't get any,'' said Ruben Carpio, a Cordoba
businessman.
	   Downtown on the Place Capitole, Alfredo Gandanjelo, 64, in blue
and white satin overalls and a bow tie, held up a Argentine banner
and smiled for passing cameras.
	   His daughters and sons bought him an airline ticket to France,
but he still had no ticket to the match.
	   FIFA, the World Cup organizing body, condemned the ticket
scandal in Japan and said that as a result, three families of three
players would miss their games.
	   In Japan, tourist agencies blamed the ticket distribution
procedures.
	   The issue had been tense from the beginning, when European Union
partners made a formal complaint against France for keeping too
many tickets for Frenchmen.
	   Each national football association received a block of tickets
for their own supporters. But that left tens of thousands of soccer
fanatics out in the cold, if they did not live in their own
country.
	   Brazilians who live in Europe, for instance, complained bitterly
at missing the opening match with Scotland.
	   City officials in Toulouse offered to set up huge video screens
so disappointed fans could watch the game outside the stadium.
Neither the Japanese nor the Argentines thought much of the idea.
	   ``These people flew 20 hours to see Japan play,'' said Takehito
Ito, a reporter for Japan's Soccer Weekly. ``If they wanted to
watch the game on TV, they could have stayed home.''

World Cup: Ha gives South Korea lead, gets red card 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Ha Seok Ju scored in the 28th minute to give
South Korea a surprising 1-0 halftime lead in Saturday's match
against Mexico, then two minutes later became the first player at
World Cup '98 to be expelled for a tackle from behind.
	   South Korea, seeking its first-ever World Cup victory, took the
lead when Ha's 30-meter (yard) free kick ricocheted off the head of
Mexico's Duilio Davino, who was part of the defensive wall. The
deflection left goalkeeper Jorge Campos helpless to stop the shot.
	   Then, in the 30th minute, Ha was given the red card by Austrian
referee Guenther Benko for a late, sliding tackle that upended
Jesus Ramirez near midfield. Ha's ejection came in the ninth game
of the tournament, making the the Korean midfielder the first
victim of the FIFA dictate to punish fouls on tackles from behind
with instant expulsion.
	   The tackle-from-behind rule had already been tested earlier in
the match. Lee Min Sung was given only a yellow after making hard,
backside contact on Cuauhtemoc Blanco's leg in the 20th minute. Two
Mexicans, Alberto Garcia Aspe and Jaime Ordiales, were also given
yellows for less vicious fouls.
	   Mexico missed a great opportunity to take the lead in the 21st
minute after Korean goalkeeper Kim Byung-ji made a superb stop on
Luis Hernandez. With Kim out of the way, the rebound went to
Blanco, who had plenty of open net before him but instead drove a
soft shot right at Lee, who stopped it with his body.
	   Korea's Ko Jong Soo nearly made it 2-0 on a long drive just
before halftime, but Campos dove right to the save.

World Cup: Hoddle knows lineup but won't let on 
</HEADLINE>
By MORLEY MYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ Glenn Hoddle at last has a fully fit
squad of World Cup players. Yet only he knows who will face Tunisia
in England's first game Monday.
	   Hoddle's team will be one of the last of the 32 to start their
World Cup campaigns and has given few hints about his starting
lineup.
	   Will Liverpool's Michael Owen start alongside Alan Shearer in
attack or will it be Teddy Sheringham? Will Manchester United's
Gary Neville play in defense or will it be fit-again Sol Campbell?
Will Darren Anderton play on the right side of midfield and will
Paul Scholes get the role that would have gone to Paul Gascoigne,
had the erratic, injury-prone midfielder made the squad?
	   Two days before the game in Marseille, the players suggested
that only Hoddle had the answers to those questions and they
understood the delay.
	   ``It's something we have had to accept, we have known about it
for a long time,'' said Chelsea left-back Graeme Le Saux.
	   ``Of course, we would like to have started two weeks ago even,
but this delay allows you an extra insight as the tournament
progresses. This is time to take advange of.''
	   Ray Clemence, a former Liverpool and Tottenham star who is
England's goalkeeping coach here, said Friday that Hoddle knew who
would start against Tunisia but wasn't saying.
	   ``I think I have a good idea of the team, but Glenn will name it
when it is right for the players,'' said England's goalkeeping
coach Ray Clemence following the training session.
	   ``Glenn has rightly concluded that in a World Cup situation like
this we don't want to give any advantage to the opposition. If you
know the team you are going to be playing against you can plan
accordingly, so why give any side that advantage.''
	   Campbell, Tottenham's tall, powerfully-built central defender,
showed no reaction from the dead leg injury which has kept him on
the sidelines since England's friendly international against
Morocco on May 24.
	   The 23-year-old Londoner only re-started training Tuesday and,
unlike the rest of his teammates, was pleased that England was
scheduled for a late opening game, five days after defending
champion Brazil kicked off the tournament.
	   ``It has been good for me because of my injury and it gave me
time to recover. If our first game had been Wednesday (June 10) it
would have been touch and go for me, but now I am in good shape,''
Campbell said.
	   Tunisia may lack the World Cup pedigree of England's other Group
G opponents, Romania and Colombia. But England will not make the
mistake of underestimating Monday's task.
	   ``There has been a great leveling in the quality of play,'' said
Le Saux. ``The gap between the best sides and the worst sides are
getting smaller.
	   ``We have seen videos of Tunisia and we know the style they like
to play. We know their strengths and also their weaknesses. They
show great flair going forward. They are a tough side and the World
Cup is a big stage for anyone to make a name for themselves.''

<TEXT>
	   MELUN-SENART, France (AP) _ Mohammed Al-Deayea is an all-star
goalkeeper and he wants the world to know it, even if it means
playing in a jersey that competes with that of his team's official
sponsor.
	   The Saudi keeper has a different look from his peers _ a jersey
he wore last year as part of a FIFA-picked all-star team in Hong
Kong.
	   Not only does the shirt carry the FIFA ``Fair Play'' logo, along
with the Saudi emblem, it is manufactured by Adidas.
	   Saudi Arabia's jerseys are made by Saudi firm Chamel.
	   ``He was so proud (to be picked for the all-star team) that he
has worn this sweater ever since,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper
said. ``It seems to have gone even beyond the contractual
obligations of his team. That's refreshing at a time when some say
there is over commercialization.''
	   Cooper said FIFA has no objections to the jersey as long as his
team approves.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Germany doesn't have particularly good memories of
the Parc des Princes, the Paris stadium where it will kick off its
World Cup campaign Monday against the United States.
	   In the summer of 1984, the Germans conceded a late goal in
losing 1-0 to Spain, a result that kept them out of the second
round of the European Championship.
	   Coach Jupp Derwall was sacked and replaced by Franz Beckenbauer,
who also has bad memories of the Paris stadium.
	   Beckenbauer's last game for Germany, his 103rd, also ended in a
1-0 defeat at Parc des Princes, against France, in February 1977.
	   Three current members of the German coaching staff were part of
that 1977 team: coach Berti Vogts, his assistant Rainer Bonhof and
goalkeeping coach Sepp Maier.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italy's goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca hopes
to come face-to-face with Inter Milan teammate Ivan Zamorano of
Chile for a second time at the World Cup.
	   Chile and Italy, which drew 2-2 in their first match in Bordeaux
on Thursday, could meet later in the tournament if both countries
qualify from Group B.
	   ``I hope it can happen,'' Pagliuca said Saturday. ``For sure we
will meet at (Inter training camp) Appiano Gentile when we begin
preparation for next season.''
	   The keeper said he and Zamorano had opposite opinions about the
penalty that gave Italy a late equalizer against Chile.
	   ``Ivan claimed the penalty was non-existent. The hands of the
Chilean, on the cross by (Roberto) Baggio, was very evident for me,
and for the referee,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Defender Moreno Torricelli is prepared to
leave Italian league champion Juventus but said Saturday he's
unwilling to join English club Middlesbrough.
	   ``As a national team player, I think I can have a better
chance,'' than move to the unfashionable English outfit, Torricelli
said at Italy's training camp.
	   Juventus has put Torricelli on the transfer market, and is
reportedly negotiating his transfer to Middlesbrough, after
acquiring defenders Zoran Mirkovic and Dario Simic.
	   However, transfers of Italian national team players can't be
finalized until the World Cup is over.

Precede MARSEILLE World Cup: McCarthy likely to miss Denmark match 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: NEW throughout; UPDATES McCarthy injury situation.
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ Reeling from a humiliating 3-0 loss to
France in its World Cup debut, South Africa got more bad news
Saturday _ striker Benni McCarthy will probably miss this week's
crucial match against Denmark.
	   McCarthy, the 20-year-old who plays for Ajax Amsterdam, went
down with an injured left ankle late in the Friday match in
Marseille and was carried off the field on a stretcher. He was
diagnosed with a bad sprain that damaged the ligaments, and team
officials said he was unlikely to play Thursday in Toulouse against
the Danes.
	   South Africa sits at the bottom of the Group C standings after
its loss, with France on top ahead of Denmark, which defeated Saudi
Arabia 1-0 on Friday.
	   For South Africa, its first appearance in the global soccer
showcase after being banned from international soccer for 28 years
because of apartheid went terribly awry. France controlled the
match after the first 20 minutes, dominating possession by being
quicker and stronger on the ball.
	   Both McCarthy and fellow striker Phil Masinga of Bari were
ineffective for most of the match, as French defenders constantly
beat them to counter passes and kept them outside the penalty area.
	   Masinga said after the match he took a knock on the shin early
that limited his effectiveness.
	   ``It was difficult, but I stayed on because this was the World
Cup,'' he said.
	   The loss disappointed the hundreds of South African fans in
Marseilles, including Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who sat with
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and World Cup organizing
committee chairman Michel Platini.
	   ``They tried very well, but I think they will understand the
mistakes they have made,'' said Mbeki, who visited the dressing
room after the match to console the players.
	   Back home, where soccer is followed and played zealously by most
of the black majority, the reaction was more critical.
	   The black nationalist Pan Africanist Congress, a small political
party, called for the immediate dismissal of coach Philippe
Troussier, who is a white Frenchman, and for former coach Jomo Sono
or assistant coach Trott Moloto to take over. Both are black and
South African.
	   Others accepted Troussier's assessment that France was a
favorite to win the tournament, and that South Africa never
expected to win. Instead, he said, the team must focus on beating
Denmark and Saudi Arabia in order to advance.
	   ``We are right where we thought we would be,'' he said.

NATO to carryout out air exercises Monday over Albania, Macedonia 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with number of aircraft, other details
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO will send fighters, helicopters
and reconnaissance aircraft into the air over Albania and Macedonia
Monday in a show of force to impress Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
	   The military exercise, code-named Determined Falcon, is aimed at
pressuring Milosevic into backing off from his armed campaign
against ethnic Albanians in the southern Serbian province of
Kosovo, scene of violent clashes that have killed more than 300
people, Albanian and Serb, in recent months.
	   ``The objective of this exercise is to demonstrate NATO's
capability to project power rapidly into the region,'' said NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana in a statement from NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
	   ``A variety of aircraft will be participating in this exercise
including fighters, reconnaissance, airborne early warning, tankers
and helicopters,'' he said. ``The aircraft are provided by a number
of nations.''
	   The get-tough NATO exercises will probably come before Russian
President Boris Yeltsin has had a chance to talk to Milosevic, who
is in Moscow Monday for talks with his long-time allies. The
Russians, who oppose any direct action against Yugoslavia, feel not
all diplomatic means have been exhausted.
	   Yeltsin has promised to use his personal influence to try to
defuse the situation, which risks spilling over into Yugoslavia's
Balkan neighbors.
	   The 40 or so aircraft in the exercise will originate from bases
in many NATO countries and fly to the exercise area for specific
tasks, then return to their originating bases. They will be under
the control of the Fifth Allied Tactical Air Force Combined
Operations Center at Vicenza, Italy.
	   The exercise is scheduled to last from early morning to noon and
involve simulated attack runs at high altitude -- high enough that
the planes probably won't be seen by the naked eye from the ground,
a U.S. Navy official said in Naples, Italy. They are designed for
Yugoslav radar screens.
	   Countries sending aircraft include the United States, France,
Spain, Turkey, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium.
	   A senior military official traveling with U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said in Copenhagen, Denmark that a three-ship group
led by the USS Wasp was en route to the Adriatic Sea to participate
in the exercise.
	   The Wasp, an amphibious helicopter assault ship, is outfitted
with at least a half-dozen Harrier jump-jets. The official said the
United States also will supply F-16s, KC-135 tankers and EA-6B
airborne early warning planes.
	   The show of power was one of several decisions by NATO defense
ministers during their meeting here Thursday.
	   The ministers also ordered military planners to study options
for further action ranging from accelerated planning for other
military exercises in the region to direct air strikes inside
Yugoslavia and use of ground troops.
	   NATO officials stress that direct military intervention is
merely one option under study, but Cohen said Friday that there is
``a very short time frame ... to solve this peacefully.''
	   ``NATO continues to support a political solution which brings an
end to the violence in Kosovo, provides an enhanced status for
Kosovo, preserves the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia and safeguards the human and civil rights of all
inhabitants of Kosovo,'' Solana said.
	   NATO is walking a thin line between getting tough with
Milosevic, who is after all a leader forced to deal with an
insurrection in his own country, and giving aid and comfort to
rebel forces the alliance does not support.
	   Albania has been pressing for weeks for NATO action to stem
bloodshed in Kosovo, where Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one.
	   The government of Macedonia, where the Slav majority has closer
ties to Yugoslavs than ethnic Albanians, also has approved a
one-time ``flyover through Macedonia's airspace'' of NATO planes,
but said future NATO requests would be considered separately.

Bosnian Croat truck drivers block roads, demand proper documents 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Truck drivers from the
Croat-controlled central Bosnian town of Zepce Saturday kept area
roads blocked, demanding new common license plates for their
vehicles, which Bosnian Croat authorities refuse to issue.
	   The first vehicles parked on the roads leading to Zepce on
Friday, and by Saturday long lines built up, causing traffic to
collapse, Bosnian state radio reported.
	   The anger of the truckers was prompted by authorities' refusal
to comply with an order from top international official in Bosnia,
Carlos Westendorp, for everybody in Bosnia to have common license
plates and car documents.
	   Those documents are written in both the Latin - the alphabet
used by Bosnian Croats and Muslims - and Cyrillic, the alphabet
used by Bosnian Serbs.
	   Bosnian Croat authorities refused to have the Serb alphabet in
the documents, and officials in regions under Croat control issued
their own version of documents, which have been invalid at borders
since June 1.
	   People with such documents are turned back at the border.
	   The authorities' intransigence harms mainly Bosnian Croat
truckers who are out of business because they cannot leave the
country any more.
	   Despite the 30-hour blockade, authorities in Zepce remained
firm, refusing to issue internationally accepted documents.

Chief U.N. weapons inspector talks with Iraqi officials special warheads, details; ADDS byline, DELETES outdated material; trims. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with progress on accounting for Iraq's
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq promised Saturday to provide visiting
chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler with evidence that it has
complied with a U.N. weapons ban.
	   Neither Butler nor Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz commented
publicly after a first round of talks Saturday, but officials on
the delegations suggested that progress had been made.
	   Iraqi weapons officials said a team of U.N. arms monitors had
unearthed enough weapons parts to verify Iraq's claims that it
destroyed and buried its biological and chemical missile warheads.
	   The pieces were gathered by a team of 27 experts under German
Jean Jan at al-Nibai, 45 kilometers (28 miles) north of the capital
Baghdad, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The parts are sufficient to reconstruct 48 warheads Iraq
unilaterally scrapped in 1991, they said.
	   U.N. officials in Baghdad confirmed that parts were recovered,
but said they required analysis.
	   Butler, who arrived in Baghdad on Thursday accompanied by 18
U.N. arms experts, planned to meet Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
again Saturday. Lower-level technical talks were also held.
	   Butler and his team believe that Iraq is still concealing key
information on its banned weapons programs. Iraq has insisted that
it has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction and a
government-run newspaper has repeatedly lashed out at Butler,
calling him a ``mad dog.''
	   Baghdad says his demands are politically motivated.
	   ``Circumstances have changed and the tide is running against Mr.
Butler,'' said Al-Jumhouriya, an Iraqi government newspaper. ``If
he is wise he should either resign or declare Iraq has met all
obligations to get the sanctions lifted.''
	   ``During the current meetings, Iraq will supply more evidence to
prove that Butler's mission in Iraq has ended,'' it added.
	   Earlier this year, the United States and Britain threatened air
strikes if Iraq refused to open its presidential sites to U.N.
inspections. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan brokered a deal to
open the palaces to inspections.
	   Butler has said that he came to Baghdad with a list of what Iraq
must do to satisfy the arms inspectors.
	   The list specifies that Iraq must hand over information on
long-range missiles, prove it has scrapped biological and chemical
warheads, and fully account for its production of VX nerve gas.
	   The U.N. inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before the Security Council will
consider lifting the sweeping economic sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

French, Germans suggest mandate before NATO action

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ European support for unilateral NATO action in
Serbia's Kosovo appeared to waver Saturday, with France insisting
on Contact Group approval and the Germans divided over whether a
U.N. mandate was needed.
	   Behind the positions were concern over the Russians, who have
opposed military action against the Serb's repression of the
independence-minded republic. Washington has said U.N. approval may
not be necessary for NATO to act.
	   French President Jacques Chirac called for unanimous approval by
the Contact Group on the Balkans, after he met Saturday with Kosovo
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   The meeting took place while NATO prepared aerial exercises in
Albania and Macedonia, and a day after the leading industrialized
nations imposed new sanctions on Serb-led Yugoslavia.
	   ``Anyone can see there is brutal Serbian intervention, which has
led to an exodus of people from Kosovo,'' Chirac told reporters.
``That has meant conflicts, dead and injured people, and a
willingness to carry out ethnic cleansing again.''
	   France, he said, backs ``all means of pressure, including
military ones, to have peace again.'' But he said France wants that
any action, ``which might include military ones, will be decided
unanimously within the Contact Group. And we think it's possible.''
	   The Contact Group could be blocked by member Russia, which has
deep historical links with fellow-Slavic Serbia. Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic is to meet with Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Monday.
	   In Germany, top officials appeared divided on whether NATO had
the authority to act without approval by the U.N. Security Council,
in which Russia has veto power. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said
a U.N. mandate was needed, but Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said
only sufficient legal basis was needed.
	   The growing violence has aroused fears among Western powers that
a new Balkan war is in the making, one that could spread to
neighboring states.
	   ``If the situation in Kosovo doesn't improve, if nobody
intervenes, a big destabilization is to be expected there in
Albania, Macedonia, Greece, and maybe in some other countries
nations have imposed economic sanctions against Serbia,'' Rugova
said.

World Cup: Zico says Ronaldo's the best and getting better 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ Ronaldo may be the delight of
soccer fans and the terror of opposing backs. But team coordinator
Zico isn't satisfied.
	   ``He has to improve,'' Zico says. ``He's an exceptional player.
We just have to find the best way to use him.''
	   Zico knows how NOT to use the young Inter Milan striker _ as the
point man, battling opposing fullbacks up front. If Brazilians are
sure the ball will find Ronaldo, opponents know it too.
	   ``Ronaldo has to move more,'' says Zico, so talented in his
playing days that he was known as ``the white Pele.'' ``If he's
stopped at the front of the attack, that makes the coverage easier.
If he moves, he complicates things for the defense. It requires
some sacrifice.''
	   Wasn't that asking too much? After all, Ronaldo was a standout
in Brazil's 2-1 win over Scotland on Wednesday. His assortment of
dribbles, feints and driving shots was nearly a game-highlight film
in itself.
	   But Zico simply echoed the high expectations that surround the
two-time FIFA Player of the Year. At 21, Ronaldo is at the top of
his profession _ and getting better.
	   Midfielder Cesar Sampaio, who scored a goal against Scotland,
said Rivaldo, Giovanni, Leonardo and other players in his sector
stand to benefit most.
	   ``The strong coverage on Ronaldo is good for players coming from
behind,'' Sampaio said. ``He leaves the penalty area, the defenders
follow and leave spaces for us.''
	   Zico feels that concentrating the offense on one player is a bad
idea, no matter how good he is.
	   ``Even when Brazil had players like Pele and Garrincha, it
didn't centralize plays on one player, but rather had an entire
system of tactics,'' he says.
	   Gerson, the playmaker on Brazil's World Cup champions in 1970,
recalls how the team took advantage of Pele's fame.
	   ``In 1970, one player wasn't enough to mark Pele,'' he recalled.
``OK, then use two. Great. Two on Pele, and we have one player
uncovered.''
	   Of course, the 1970 squad also had Jairzinho, Tostao and
Rivelino up front. Today's team is still searching for the
complement to Ronaldo, ever since the No. 1 choice _ Romario _ was
cut with a calf injury a week before the opener.
	   The attack pivoted around Romario, whose presence near the goal
tied down at least one opposing back and made life easier for
Ronaldo. But now, none of Romario's possible substitutes can do
what he did.
	   Bebeto, who inherited the No. 2 striker spot, moves well but
isn't a dominating presence in the penalty area. Denilson is
essentially a wing attacker, and Edmundo generally plays back near
the midfield.
	   The comparisons with Pele have been a constant since Ronaldo
burst on to the national soccer stage with Cruzeiro in 1993. At the
ripe age of 16, he had 55 goals in the same number of games _ a
better average than the young Pele.
	   From Cruzeiro to PSV Eindhoven to FC Barcelona to Internazionale
of Milan, titles have come and scoring records fallen. In 1994, he
was on Brazil's World Cup champion team at age 17, although he
didn't play.
	   What has he got left to learn? Heading, for one thing. Ronaldo
admits it's his weak point.
	   But if scoring goals is what he does best, winning is what
matters. And it doesn't matter how.
	   ``It's not me that scores, it's the team,'' Ronaldo said. ``If I
don't score and we win, I'm happy.''

NATO to carryout out air exercises Monday over Albania, Macedonia 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with new details. No pickup. ADDS byline
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO will send fighters, helicopters
and reconnaissance aircraft into the air Monday over Albania and
Macedonia in a show of force against Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
	   The exercise is aimed at pressuring Milosevic into backing off
from his armed campaign against ethnic Albanians in the neighboring
southern Serbian province of Kosovo, scene of violent clashes that
have killed more than 300 ethnic Albanians and Serbs in recent
months.
	   ``The objective of this exercise is to demonstrate NATO's
capability to project power rapidly into the region,'' NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said in a statement from NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
	   ``A variety of aircraft will be participating in this exercise
including fighters, reconnaissance, airborne early warning, tankers
and helicopters,'' he said. ``The aircraft are provided by a number
of nations.''
	   The exercises will probably come before Russian President Boris
Yeltsin has had a chance to talk to Milosevic, who is in Moscow on
Monday for talks with his long-time allies. The Russians, who
oppose direct action against Yugoslavia, feel not all diplomatic
means have been exhausted.
	   Yeltsin has promised to use his personal influence to try to
defuse the situation, which threatens spreading violence in the
Balkans.
	   The 40 or so aircraft in the exercise will originate from bases
in many NATO countries and fly to the exercise area for specific
tasks, then return to their originating bases. They will be under
the control of the Fifth Allied Tactical Air Force Combined
Operations Center at Vicenza, Italy.
	   The exercise is scheduled to last from early morning to noon and
involve simulated attack runs at high altitude, high enough that
the planes probably won't be seen by the naked eye from the ground,
a U.S. Navy official said in Naples, Italy. They are designed for
Yugoslav radar screens.
	   Countries sending aircraft include the United States, France,
Spain, Turkey, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium.
	   The military exercise was one of several decisions by NATO
defense ministers who also ordered military planners to study
options for further action, ranging from accelerated planning for
other military exercises to direct air strikes inside Yugoslavia
and use of ground troops.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday that there is
``a very short time frame ... to solve this peacefully.''
	   ``NATO continues to support a political solution, which brings
an end to the violence in Kosovo, provides an enhanced status for
Kosovo, preserves the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia and safeguards the human and civil rights of all
inhabitants of Kosovo,'' Solana said.
	   NATO is walking a thin line between getting tough with
Milosevic, who is dealing with an insurrection in his own country,
and giving aid and comfort to rebel forces the alliance does not
support.
	   Albania has been pressing for weeks for NATO action to stem
bloodshed in Kosovo, where Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   The government of Macedonia, where the Slav majority has closer
ties to Yugoslavs than ethnic Albanians, also has approved a
one-time ``flyover through Macedonia's airspace'' of NATO planes,
but said future NATO requests would be considered separately.

Death toll in Kosovo stands at well over 300 since late February 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Serbian government pledges.
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The casualty toll in Serbia's
embattled Kosovo province has risen well over 300 dead and dozens
wounded, while many are missing, latest figures from Serb and
Albanian sources showed Saturday.
	   The pro-Albanian Board for the Protection of Human Rights based
in Pristina, capital of the Serbian secessionist republic, said a
total of 272 ethnic Albanians had died in the fighting, including
31 women and 17 children.
	   It had no Serbian casualty toll, but the pro-government Serbian
Media Center in Pristina listed 22 dead Serbian policemen, another
four officers kidnapped and presumed dead as well as 59 missing.
	   The Yugoslav army, which has been involved in the fighting while
guarding the border between Yugoslavia and Albania has lost four
soldiers, according to official records.
	   Serb sources also said that a total of five Serb civilians have
died and 24 have been wounded this year. In addition, several
ethnic Albanians loyal to Serbia have been found dead in recent
months.
	   The Serbian police, including special forces, have been at the
forefront of government efforts to suppress the increasingly
radical independence movement spearheaded by the underground Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Ethnic Albanians, most of whom want secession from Serbia,
outnumber Serbs in Kosovo 9 to 1.
	   It has become increasingly difficult to obtain reports on
fighting in Kosovo, parts of which are inaccessible because of
roadblocks put up by police and the KLA, respectively. Some 40
percent of the province are believed under rebel control.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported Saturday
some small-scale exchange of gun and grenade fire between police
and the KLA in the border area near the town of Djakovica.
	   Some ``more serious'' shelling was reported against two Albanian
villages, Morina and Smolica, in the same area.
	   No casualties have been reported there, and the area is still
sealed off. ``Considerable movement of police and army troops has
been noticed,'' the center said.
	   Following a session on Saturday, the Serbian government issued a
statement meant to woo ethnic Albanians displaced inside Kosovo to
return to their homes and to show officials are ready to redress
grievances.
	   The statement, published at home and abroad, said authorities
would alleviate the consequences of ``terrorist attacks on the
civilian population.''
	   The Serbian government pledged ``financial resources for the
restoration of houses damaged during terrorist attacks.'' It also
promised transportation, health care and ``all forms of
humanitarian aid to ensure normal energy supply, the functioning of
other public utilities and the regular supply of shops ...''

With Yugoslavia-Kosovo German defense minister warns Milosevic to back off Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ With NATO air maneuvers in Albania and
Macedonia imminent, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe has warned
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic a direct intervention could
follow in neighboring Kosovo, a newspaper said Saturday.
	   The Hamburg-based Bild am Sonntag quoted Ruehe as saying ``If he
(Milosevic) doesn't immediately stop his criminal ethnic cleansing
through expulsion and murder and show he is willing for a political
solution, it won't stop at air maneuvers.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said Saturday in Brussels
that aircraft from several nations will hold exercises over Albania
and Macedonia on Monday in a show of force to pressure Milosevic to
stop his campaign against ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia's southern
Kosovo province.
	   More than 300 people have died in recent months and many are
reported missing as Milosevic has stepped up his offensive with
troops and police against ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent
of Kosovo's population and want independence.
	   The international public expects not only a sharper political
and economic pressure be put on Milosevic, but also that NATO take
concrete steps to help the threatened people, Bild am Sonntag
quoted Ruehe as saying.
	   Ruehe said the German military was sending six Tornado fighter
jets to Italy to take part in the air maneuvers in Albania and
Macedonia, and that it was a meaningful warning to Milosevic, the
newspaper reported.
	   In a separate interview appearing in Saturday's editions of the
Oldenburg-based Nordwest Zeitung, Ruehe was quoted as saying that a
``sufficient legal basis,'' must be obtained before NATO takes any
military action in Kosovo. Previously Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
had said a U.N. mandate would be necessary.
	   In an early release of an interview to appear in the weekly
Focus magazine Monday, opposition Social Democratic faction leader
in parliament, Rudolf Scharping, was quoted as saying that in an
emergency NATO could intervene in Kosovo without a U.N. mandate.
	   While a mandate is desired, in an extreme case military
intervention earlier may be necessary for the protection the people
and the borders to keep the conflict from spreading, Focus quoted
Scharping as saying.
	   ``We must avoid that the horrible experiences of Bosnia are
again repeated,'' the report quoted Scharping as saying.
	   The 3 1/2 year war that largely stopped after NATO-led
intervention in Bosnia in late 1995 left 200,000 people dead or
missing in that former Yugoslav province.

Chief U.N. weapons inspector talks with Iraqi officials warheads, details, DELETES outdated material, Trims. No pickup. ADDS byline. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with progress on accounting for Iraq's special
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq promised Saturday to provide visiting
chief United Nations arms inspector Richard Butler with evidence
that it has complied with a U.N. weapons ban.
	   Neither Butler nor Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz commented
publicly after a first round of talks Saturday, but officials on
the delegations suggested that progress had been made.
	   Iraqi weapons officials said a team of U.N. arms monitors had
unearthed enough weapons parts to verify Iraq's claims that it
destroyed and buried its biological and chemical missile warheads.
	   The pieces were gathered by a team of 27 experts under German
Jean Jan at al-Nibai, 45 kilometers (28 miles) north of the capital
Baghdad, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The parts are sufficient to reconstruct 48 warheads Iraq
unilaterally scrapped in 1991, they said.
	   U.N. officials in Baghdad confirmed that parts were recovered,
but said they required analysis.
	   Butler, who arrived Thursday in Baghdad accompanied by 18 U.N.
arms experts, planned to meet Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
again Saturday. Lower-level technical talks were also held.
	   Butler and his team believe that Iraq is still concealing key
information on its banned weapons programs. Iraq has insisted that
it has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction and a
government-run newspaper has repeatedly lashed out at Butler,
calling him a ``mad dog.''
	   Baghdad says his demands are politically motivated.
	   ``Circumstances have changed and the tide is running against Mr.
Butler,'' said Al-Jumhouriya, an Iraqi government newspaper. ``If
he is wise he should either resign or declare Iraq has met all
obligations to get the sanctions lifted.''
	   ``During the current meetings, Iraq will supply more evidence to
prove that Butler's mission in Iraq has ended,'' it said.
	   Earlier this year, the United States and Britain threatened air
strikes if Iraq refused to open its presidential sites to U.N.
inspections. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan brokered a deal to
open the palaces to inspections.
	   Butler has said he came to Baghdad with a list of what Iraq must
do to satisfy the arms inspectors.
	   The list specifies that Iraq must hand over information on
long-range missiles, prove it has scrapped biological and chemical
warheads, and fully account for its production of VX nerve gas.
	   The U.N. inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before the Security Council will
consider lifting the sweeping economic sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Forget the fact that a new military
strongman has just replaced the old dictator. Forget the
hard-to-find gasoline, the rampant crime and the crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators.
	   Only one thing mattered Saturday in this embattled West African
nation, and that was Nigeria's jubilant victory over Spain in its
first World Cup match, a welcome reprieve for a country in crisis.
	   ``Football is something people are really crazy about here,''
Edet Ojo, director of the watchdog group Media Rights Agenda, said
as he settled down in front of his television. ``On a day like this
you're going to have a hard time getting anyone to talk about
politics.''
	   There were even reports that leaders of Nigeria's new junta were
allowed to leave important meetings in Lagos late Friday and early
Saturday, just so they could get home in time for the match.
	   By game time, the commercial hub of Lagos was all but deserted,
and it stayed that way until Nigeria managed to down Spain 3-2. The
streets, normally a maze of nightmarish traffic jams, were
practically deserted _ noticeably more so than on Friday, when half
the motorists stayed home, fearing violence between opposition
demonstrators and the police.
	   Buses were half-full, sidewalks were all but empty. In this
ridiculously crowded city, the only crowds to be seen were jammed
into small shops that had set up televisions on their patios.
	   It even turned out to be a good day to buy gasoline.
	   Filling up is normally a challenge of Everest-like proportions
in Nigeria, which suffers a critical shortage despite being the
world's sixth-largest oil producer. But Saturday, drivers could
head directly to the pumps at stations where lines often lasted for
12 hours or more.
	   Nigeria's economy has been crippled by corruption over the past
few years and little in the country functions anymore, from the
water supply to the telephones. The only people who live
comfortably are those who can afford to buy generators, truck in
their own water and hire security guards to fend off the rampant
robbers.
	   Such troubles were forgotten Saturday in the middle class Lagos
neighborhood of Surulere. There, more than 50 men crammed beneath
the red awning of a beauty parlor, yelling with joy at every
Nigerian goal and clicking their teeth after every point against
their team.
	   With every goal, battered buildings erupted with dancing,
cheering Nigerians who would briefly fill Surulere's streets.
	   ``Let's see, let's see. I think we can do it now, I think we can
do it,'' rambled Francis Okoy after Nigeria forged ahead with what
would be the winning goal.
	   ``Nigeria!'' he bellowed.
	   Chuks Adigwu, a missionary trying to enlarge his flock, was
getting little response walking through the city.
	   ``Nigerians only care about football today,'' he said after
stopping by the beauty parlor to check the score. ``Nobody's even
talking about politics.''
	   It came as something of a surprise, considering this past week
of upheaval.
	   On Monday, the brutal five-year dictatorship of Gen. Sani Abacha
came to an end with his heart attack death, ushering in within
hours the rule of Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar. Almost immediately, the
new leader was at odds with many pro-democracy activists, who
refused to call off demonstrations set for Friday, the five-year
anniversary of annulled presidential elections.
	   After name-calling and threats from both sides, the police and
military eventually quashed protests in Lagos and elsewhere around
the country. In Lagos, security officers scattered hundreds of
demonstrators by firing tear gas and bullets into the air. About 55
people were reportedly arrested across the country; all were
believed to have been released by Saturday morning.
	   Among those detainees was Nike Ransome-Kuti, who said not even
soccer could distract her from worrying about an uncertain future.
	   A corporate lawyer whose father has been jailed on political
charges for the past few years, she spent her Saturday throwing a
party for the young children of other political prisoners.
	   ``There are more important things today,'' she said.

Tajik opposition leader complains of delays in reconciliation 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leader of the opposition in Tajikistan
complained Saturday that the president is dragging his heels in the
appointment of opposition candidates to government positions, a
news agency said.
	   In a letter to President Emomali Rakhmonov, opposition leader
Said Nuri resubmitted the names of eight candidates for top
positions in the Central Asian country's government, ITAR-Tass
reported.
	   Nuri also reminded Rakhmonov that such appointments are one of
the fundamental elements of the Tajik reconciliation accord, the
agency said.
	   Under a 1997 peace agreement ending Tajikistan's five-year civil
war, the government is supposed to give 30 percent of its executive
positions to the opposition.

Russian foreign minister repeats Moscow opposition to NATO intervention in Yugoslavia 
</HEADLINE>
BC-Lithuania-Primakov
By LIUDAS DAPKUS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Russia's foreign minister Yevgeny
Primakov on Saturday repeated Moscow's opposition to NATO military
intervention against Yugoslavia.
	   ``We are not opposed if NATO is preparing some kind of
surveillance flights to prevent arms smuggling to Kosovo
province,'' Primakov told reporters at the national palace after
meeting with President Valdas Adamkus.
	   ``But if the operation means a preparation for military action
against Yugoslavia, we are strictly against it,'' he added.
	   The NATO military alliance of U.S. and European governments
plans to send jet fighters, helicopters and other aircraft over
territory close to Yugoslavia on Monday as a sign of its commitment
to compel, if necessary, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
curtail his violent campaign against ethnic Albanians in troubled
Kosovo province.
	   Primakov stopped briefly in this Baltic nation, which won
independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991, en route home
from London. He used the opportunity to note that Moscow prefers
Lithuania and its Baltic Sea neighbors, Latvia and Estonia, to
remain outside NATO.
	   ``We do not have anything against Lithuanian membership in the
European Union,'' he told reporters. ``But Moscow is strictly
opposed to Lithuania's bid for the (NATO) alliance.''

India accuses industrialized nations of ignoring its peace efforts 
</HEADLINE>
By HEMA SHUKLA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India, responding angrily to the
``pressure'' of new anti-nuclear sanctions, said Saturday that
industrialized nations have ignored its recent efforts to reduce
tension in the Asian subcontinent.
	   In the weeks following its nuclear tests last month, New Delhi
announced a moratorium on further tests, proposed a no-first-use
agreement with neighboring rival Pakistan, and offered to hold
peace talks with Pakistan on the disputed territory of Kashmir and
other issues.
	   ``These gestures reflect both our desire to further the cause of
global disarmament and nonproliferation as well as our dedication
to promoting peace and stability in the region,'' according to a
statement released Saturday by India's Foreign Ministry.
	   But the world's eight leading industrialized nations, known as
the Group of Eight or G-8, fear the consequences of India's and
Pakistan's nuclear testing. Pakistan responded to India's tests
with its own tests last month. The two neighbors, separated by
religion and territorial disputes, have fought three wars in the
last 50 years _ two over Kashmir.
	   The two countries clashed Friday over whose plans for peace
talks should prevail.
	   At a meeting Friday in London, Britain, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States agreed to postpone all
development loans to India and Pakistan, two of the poorest
countries in the world. Money from the industrialized world that
helps meet ``basic human needs'' was exempted from the U.S.-led
sanctions.
	   India has already seen more than dlrs 1 billion in loans delayed
because of its tests.
	   ``It is a matter of regret that the G-8 Foreign Minister's Joint
Communique has ... repeated unrealistic prescriptions couched in
the language of pressure,'' India said.
	   The G-8 urged India and Pakistan to halt further tests, refrain
from building nuclear weapons, and resume a dialogue ``without
delay'' to address the root causes of tensions in the region.
	   It also urged both countries to avoid threatening military
movements, discourage terrorist activity and develop new
confidence-building measures.
	   ``Coercive and intrusive prescriptions are not only ill-advised
but also counter-productive,'' the Indian foreign ministry
statement said.
	   Pakistan too has said sanctions will not help solve the problem
of nuclear proliferation in the region.
	   India reiterated its call for dialogue with Pakistan but
repeated that it would stand for no outside mediation in such
talks. Pakistan wants outside involvement on the Kashmir issue,
believing it is at a disadvantae in one-on-one talks with its much
larger and more powerful neighbor.

Riots break out at military training camp, dozens flee 
</HEADLINE>
By MOHAMED OSMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Riots in a military training camp near
Khartoum have caused more than 70 recruits to flee the base where
dozens of conscripts died in April, Sudan's official news agency
reported Saturday.
	   The riots began Friday night when ``nine students woke up the
conscripts in their barracks to protest the military training
program,'' the supervisor of military service in Khartoum province,
Adel Mohammed Osman, told SUNA.
	   ``This led to confusion in the camp in which some belongings
were destroyed and 76 students left the camp,'' Osman said.
	   But the local correspondent of Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported more than 1,000 conscripts fled.
	   The students burnt the car of the camp's commander and several
tents to protest ``the bad treatment of one of their colleagues
while training,'' sources told MENA.
	   Osman said Saturday that control had been restored in the camp.
	   The nine students ``will be dealt with firmly,'' he said.
	   This is the second time in three months when conscripts have
mutinied in Ailafoon camp, 25 kilometers (15 miles) southeast of
Khartoum.
	   In April, a large number of conscripts drowned in the Blue Nile
as they fled the camp in a boat which capsized. The government put
the death toll at 52, but opposition groups said at least 129 died.
The incident generated widespread criticism of the the
controversial program, which may involve deploying students in the
war zones of southern and eastern Sudan.
	   Many of the April casualties were believed to have been forcibly
conscripted to fight the insurgency in southern Sudan.
	   In April, President Omar el-Bashir said his government planned
to draft 655,000 students over three years.
	   The 1998 conscripts began enrolling in camps last week. Some
90,000 high school students are expected to report for service.
	   Rebels from the predominantly Christian and animist south of the
country have been fighting since 1983 for more autonomy from the
Islamic north. More than 1.3 million people have died in the war
and consequent famines.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Government troops battled rebels pinned
in a military garrison in Guinea Bissau's capital on Saturday, as
the mutineers threatened to launch a major offensive within 24
hours.
	   The rebels, broadcasting on a private radio station they
captured last week, said they would break out of their besieged
positions in Bissau to attack government troops and the
reinforcements sent from Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   There were reports of heavy fighting early Saturday, and footage
broadcast on Portuguese state television RTP showed houses reduced
to rubble and the capital's streets full of shell holes.
	   The rebel broadcast was quoted as claiming evident military
superiority and ``stocks of heavy ammunition allowing for mass
destruction.''
	   Fighting between the two sides has so far been characterized by
the lobbing of shells, punctuated by exchanges of automatic
gunfire. No figures were available for the number of casualties.
	   Portuguese evacuees arriving in Lisbon Saturday from Bissau said
the shelling had struck embassies, ministries, Bissau's main
hospital and the Bissau phone company building.
	   Portuguese radio RDP-Africa reported that about 100 children
were stranded in a compound near the military garrison where most
of the rebels are holed up.
	   The garrison was reportedly used by a tank battalion, supporting
the besieged soldiers' claim to be able to break out.
	   But Guinea-Bissau Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva told
The Associated Press in Lisbon where he was stranded due to flight
cancellations that ``The tanks have not been maintained. They're
old, Soviet-built tanks.''
	   Delfim da Silva described the rebel strongholds as ``strategic
defensive positions.''
	   The rebel stronghold is a colonial building surrounded by high
walls that can be entered by one main, and several minor, roads,
Delfim da Silva said. At least one warehouse in rebel control was
believed to hold food supplies.
	   Other mutineers held positions near a barracks on the south side
of the coastal city.
	   Led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane Mane, the
dissident soldiers had previously demanded that the foreign troops
be withdrawn from the country and that international phone lines
cut on Thursday be restored, according to a report by Portuguese
radio RDP-Africa.
	   Lines were restored Saturday.
	   The country's former President, Luis de Almeida Cabral said
Saturday he was willing to mediate in the conflict.
	   Almeida Cabral, who was ousted by current President Joao
Bernardo Vieira in a 1980 coup and now lives in Lisbon, said he had
not been contacted by either side.
	   The rebels had earlier offered negotiations at a foreign venue,
suggesting Gambia, RDP reported.
	   Mane is from Gambia. He gained renown as a guerilla fighter in
the war against Portuguese colonial rule from 1961 to 1974. He was
later appointed head of the armed forces after independence even
though he spoke no Portuguese, the country's official language.
	   Mane, who as fired in January amid allegations of arms smuggling
to rebels in Senegal, has accused President Vieira of corruption
and called on him to step down so that early elections can be held.
	   After coming to power via the 1980 coup, Vieira was elected in
the country's first democratic elections for president and
parliament four years ago.
	   Portuguese daily Publico reported that many thousands of
refugees were traveling on foot along the road between Bissau and
the northern border with Senegal.
	   Senegalese officials reportedly were allowing the refugees into
the country after they were vaccinated against yellow fever and
meningitis by medical teams at the border post.
	   More than 2,200 foreigners were evacuated from Bissau by a
Portuguese container ship on Thursday. They were taken to Dakar,
Senegal, where planes were waiting to fly them home on Friday.
	   One of the more than 600 Portuguese evacuees who arrived
Saturday at Lisbon airport recounted how shells were landing in the
port while the foreigners were boarding the ship. ``Everyone was
throwing themselves onto the ground. Some people fell into the
sea,'' he said.
	   In their broadcast Saturday, the rebels said they would allow
foreigners to leave the city by via the airport road, ``because we
consider that President Vieira is using them as a shield,'' Lusa
reported.

World Cup: Mexico rallies to beat 10-man Koreans 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Mexico winning; ADDS byline
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ With South Korea down to 10 men after
suffering the first tackle-from-behind ejection of World Cup '98,
Mexico rallied with three second-half goals for a come-from-behind
3-1 victory Saturday.
	   Substitute Ricardo Pelaez scored in the 51st minute and Luis
Hernandez in the 75th and 84th minutes for the Mexicans, ending
South Korea's hopes for its first-ever World Cup victory in its
fifth appearance in the tournament.
	   South Korea, controlling the early tempo with a conservative,
pass-orientated attack, took the lead in the 28th minute when Ha
Seok-ju's 30-meter (yard) free kick ricocheted off the head of
Mexico's Duilio Davino, who was part of the defensive wall.
	   Then, in the 30th minute, Ha was given the red card by Austrian
referee Guenther Benko for a late, sliding tackle that upended
Jesus Ramirez near midfield. Ha's ejection came in the ninth game
of the tournament, making the the Korean midfielder the first
victim of the FIFA dictate to crack down on foul tackles from
behind.
	   With a man advantage, Mexico made two substitutes at halftime
and instantly went on the attack. It took only six minutes for one
of the subs, Pelaez, to find the mark with an opportunistic chance
that came when Ramirez' corner kick banked off the foot of Korean
captain Yoo Sang-chul.
	   Mexico kept the pressure on, and it paid off with Hernandez' two
goals, both set up by Cuauhtemoc Blanco, and several more chances
that could have made the margin of victory greater.
	   Even before Ha's red card, the tackle-from-behind rule had
already been tested early in the match. Lee Min-sung was given only
a yellow after making hard, backside contact on Blanco's leg in the
20th minute. Two Mexicans, Alberto Garcia Aspe and Jaime Ordiales,
were also given yellows for less vicious fouls.

Rain washes out play in DFS Classic 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ The DFS Classic grass-court
tournament, where Steffi Graf has reached the semifinals as she
prepares for Wimbledon, was washed out Saturday by all-day rain.
	   After a five-hour delay, the weather broke and Graf and opponent
Nathalie Tauziat tried briefly to warm up but decided after a few
minutes that the court was too wet to play safely.
	   Organizers will try playing both the semifinals and finals on
Sunday _ Graf's 29th birthday _ if the weather cooperates.
	   Graf is to face Tauziat and Elena Likhovtseva of Russia plays
Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia in the other.
	   Graf, playing only her third event in a year following knee
surgery and various injuries, has won six of seven sets en route to
three match victories on grass.

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Contestants sniffed, scratched, barked
and wagged their tails in the World Dog Show in the Finnish
capital,
	   Dog owners from 44 countries entered 15,600 canines in
competitions ranging from miniature schnauzers, Great Danes and
Rottweilers, to the less common East Siberian laikas, Peruvian
hairless dogs and the Thai ridgeback.
	   The four-day competition, which ends Sunday, were held in 60
rings in tents and the Helsinki Fair Center, a hall with 36,000
square meters (43,200 sq. yards) of floor space.
	   ``This is a great event, but the ring for Rottweilers is too
small,'' said Elena Rebecchi, of Milan, Italy, whose dog, Xari von
Bickesheim, came fifth in the Rottweiler champion class.
	   In an adjacent ring, a German shepherd named Capo lunged after
someone posing as an escaping thief, tugged at his wrist. Capo,
belonging to the Finnish police force, was part of one of many
sideshows in the event that included obedience, agility and
tracking displays.
	   The event filled Helsinki hotels.
	   ``Our Taishi loves it, but we don't let him sleep on the bed,''
said Serena Burnett of Los Angeles about her massive Japanese tosa.
	   One hotel near the dog show housed some 70 dogs and their
owners, and more than 100 international show judges.
	   ``We got reservations in spring 1997 when there was just a big
hole in the ground because we were still building the foundations
of the hotel,'' said Johanna Tyynela, the hotel manager.
	   A night at the hotel costs some 900 markkaa (dlrs 166 dollars)
for humans. Dogs got a special deal _ 25 markkaa (dlrs 4.60).
	   ``Our manager is a dog lover,'' Tyynela said Saturday. ``And the
barking hasn't seem to have disturbed anyone _ not yet anyway.''
	   Near the fair center, balls of fur and fluff blew in the breeze
as proud owners combed their hairy hounds. Also, participants and
fans had to watch where they stepped, although pooper scoopers were
in abundant use.
	   ``Feces can be a problem with so many dogs in such a small
area,'' said Kaija Unhola, from the show committee. ``But we have
lots of collection points and owners really do watch what their own
dogs get up to.''

World Cup: Mexico rallies to beat 10-man Koreans 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS quotes from Hernandez; optional lead upcoming
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ With South Korea down to 10 men after
suffering the first tackle-from-behind ejection of World Cup '98,
Mexico rallied with three second-half goals for a come-from-behind
3-1 victory Saturday.
	   Substitute Ricardo Pelaez scored in the 51st minute and Luis
Hernandez in the 75th and 84th minutes for the Mexicans, ending
South Korea's hopes for its first-ever World Cup victory in its
fifth appearance in the tournament.
	   ``Basically, we didn't lose our cool,'' Hernandez said. ``We
paid attention and we didn't become desperate.''
	   The victory was a measure of vindication for Mexico, which had
come under criticism for its lackluster results leading up to the
World Cup. After qualifying, the team fired coach Bora Milutinovic
and replaced him with Manuel Lapuente.
	   ``We unloaded all that energy that had built up,'' Hernandez
said of the pressure back home. ``We got a great win.''
	   South Korea, controlling the early tempo with a conservative,
pass-orientated attack, took the lead in the 28th minute when Ha
Seok-ju's 30-meter (yard) free kick ricocheted off the head of
Mexico's Duilio Davino, who was part of the defensive wall.
	   Then, in the 30th minute, Ha was given the red card by Austrian
referee Guenther Benko for a late, sliding tackle that upended
Jesus Ramirez near midfield. Ha's ejection came in the ninth game
of the tournament, making the the Korean midfielder the first
victim of the FIFA dictate to crack down on foul tackles from
behind.
	   With a man advantage, Mexico made two substitutes at halftime
and instantly went on the attack. It took only six minutes for one
of the subs, Pelaez, to find the mark with an opportunistic chance
that came when Ramirez' corner kick banked off the foot of Korean
captain Yoo Sang-chul.
	   Mexico kept the pressure on, and it paid off with Hernandez' two
goals, both set up by Cuauhtemoc Blanco, and several more chances
that could have made the margin of victory greater.
	   Even before Ha's red card, the tackle-from-behind rule had
already been tested early in the match. Lee Min-sung was given only
a yellow after making hard, backside contact on Blanco's leg in the
20th minute. Two Mexicans, Alberto Garcia Aspe and Jaime Ordiales,
were also given yellows for less vicious fouls.

French search for yachtsman Eric Tabarly, lost off Welsh coast aircraft. CORRECTS Tabarly's age to 66 sted 67.

EDS: Updates throughout with search re-started after French send
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ French sports hero Eric Tabarly, the country's
best-known yachtsman, was reported lost off Wales Saturday after
falling off his boat during the night.
	   Coastguards at Milford Haven in southwest Wales gave up their
search for the 66-year-old Tabarly 12 hours after he fell
overboard, but later re-started when the French navy sent a search
and rescue aircraft.
	   Tabarly, one of the world's top solo sailors, was reported
missing 55 kms (35 miles) south-southeast of Milford Haven. It was
not clear how he fell overboard, but he apparently was not wearing
a lifejacket.
	   The four crew members on the yacht have no communications
equipment, and speak little or no English. Rescuers were not
alerted until seven hours after Tabarly disappeared. The yacht
crew, who reportedly had little experience at sea, fired a flare to
attract a passing boat. They also reportedly threw a life preserver
in his direction, but did not know whether their skipper was able
to catch it.
	   At about midday, the search was called off and Chris Raley,
deputy district controller for Milford Haven Coastguard, said 12
hours was three times the expected survivability in the existing
conditions.
	   But in the evening, Raley announced a renewed search after the
``generous offer of an Atlantique search and rescue aircraft ''
from France. A Royal Air Force aircraft was also made available to
assist, he said.
	   ``We are giving both aircraft a search pattern of the area,''
Raley said. ``We have a few hours of daylight left and we will
continue until dusk and then look at the situation again.''
	   During the morning search, an RAF rescue helicopter
criss-crossed area and several merchant ships joined the search,
but found no trace of the missing yachtsman. The Coastguard said
seas were moderate with waves up to 13 feet (4 meters).
	   Tabarly, born July 24, 1931 in Nantes, became a naval officer in
1959.
	   He won several races with boats named Pen Duick, a Breton phrase
meaning ``blackheaded tomtit.''
	   Among his victories were a transatlantic solo race from Plymouth
to Newport, 5,390 kms in 27 days in 1964; the Morgan Cup in 1967,
the Gotland Round, Channel Race and the Fasnet, the race from
Plymouth to La Rochelle, all in 1967. He won a transpacific solo
race in the Pen Duick V in 39 days in 1969, and won the Los
Angeles-Tahiti race in 1972. Aboard the Pen Duick VI he won the
Plymouth-Newport race in 23 days and 20 hours in 1976.
	   He was awarded the Legion of Honor, was a member of the Maritime
National Order of Merit, and wrote several books including ``Solo
Victory'' in 1964 and ``Pen Duick'' in 1990.

<TEXT>
	   JAEN, Spain (AP) _ Police arrested two female Colombian twins a
Frenchman and a Spanish male Saturday in a major operation mounted
after a shoot-out at a highway checkpoint in which one Civil Guard
died and another was seriously injured, authorities said.
	   Manuel Saenz Santiago, 37, died from bullet wounds received when
he approached the rented car at about 4 a.m. (0200GMT) occupied by
four people near this southern Spanish city, a police spokesman
said.
	   After the shoot-out, the suspect car sped off and the injured
agent was rushed to hospital for surgery, Jose Manuel Fernandez
said.
	   A major search operation for the four fugitives, including
helicopters and dogs, located the dumped vehicle about midday.
	   The two 20-year-old twins and the Spaniard were found walking
along a mountain road further north. The Frenchman was arrested
several hours later along the same road.
	   Police said four detained were criminals not linked to
terrorism, but did not confirm news reports that they were linked
to drug trafficking or prostitution.
	   The Spanish Civil Guard was created in the 19th century to
police Spain's vast countryside, but now also serves as national
highway police, coast guards, and has a special anti-terrorist
unit.
	   Only those Civil Guards posted outside public buildings still
wear the characteristic patent leather tri-cornered hat.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Government troops battled rebels pinned
in a military garrison in Guinea Bissau's capital on Saturday as
the mutineers threatened to launch a major offensive within 24
hours.
	   The rebels, broadcasting on a private radio station captured
last week, said they would break out of their besieged positions in
Bissau to attack government troops and the reinforcements sent from
nearby Senegal and the Republic of Guinea in West Africa, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   There were reports of heavy fighting early Saturday, and footage
broadcast on Portuguese state television RTP showed houses reduced
to rubble and the capital's streets full of shell holes in the
former Portuguese colony.
	   Portuguese radio RDP-Africa reported that about 100 children
were stranded in a compound near the military garrison where most
of the rebels are holed up.
	   The rebel broadcast was quoted as claiming evident military
superiority and ``stocks of heavy ammunition allowing for mass
destruction.''
	   The fighting so far has been characterized by the lobbing of
shells, punctuated by exchanges of automatic gunfire. No figures
were available for the number of casualties.
	   Portuguese evacuees arriving Saturday in Lisbon from Bissau said
the shelling struck embassies, ministries, Bissau's main hospital
and the Bissau phone company building.
	   The garrison where the rebels were holed up was reportedly used
by a tank battalion, supporting the besieged soldiers' claim to be
able to break out.
	   But Guinea-Bissau Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva told
The Associated Press in Lisbon, where he was stranded due to flight
cancellations, that ``the tanks have not been maintained. They're
old, Soviet-built tanks.''
	   Delfim da Silva described the rebel strongholds as ``strategic
defensive positions.''
	   The rebel stronghold is a colonial building surrounded by high
walls that can be entered by one main and several minor roads,
Delfim da Silva said. At least one warehouse in rebel control was
believed to hold food supplies.
	   Other mutineers held positions near a barracks on the south side
of the coastal city.
	   Led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane Mane, the rebels
demand that the foreign troops be withdrawn and that international
phone lines be restored, according to a report by Portuguese radio
RDP-Africa. Lines were restored Saturday.
	   The country's former president, Luis de Almeida Cabral, said
Saturday that he was willing to mediate. Almeida Cabral, ousted by
current President Joao Bernardo Vieira in a 1980 coup and now lives
in Lisbon, said he had not been contacted by either side.
	   The rebels earlier offered negotiations at a foreign venue,
suggesting Gambia, RDP reported.
	   Mane is from Gambia. He gained renown as a guerilla fighter in
the war against Portuguese colonial rule from 1961 to 1974. He was
later appointed head of the armed forces after independence even
though he spoke no Portuguese, the country's official language.
	   Mane, who was fired in January amid allegations of arms
smuggling to rebels in Senegal, accused Vieira of corruption and
called on him to step down so that early elections can be held.
	   Vieira was elected in the country's first democratic elections
for president and parliament four years ago.
	   Portuguese daily Publico reported that many thousands of
refugees were traveling on foot along the road between Bissau and
the northern border with Senegal.
	   Senegalese officials reportedly were allowing the refugees into
the country after they were vaccinated against yellow fever and
meningitis by medical teams at the border post.
	   More than 2,200 foreigners were evacuated from Bissau by a
Portuguese container ship on Thursday. They were taken to to
Senegal's capital Dakar.
	   One of the more than 600 Portuguese evacuees who arrived
Saturday at Lisbon airport recounted how shells were landing in the
port while the foreigners were boarding the ship.
	   ``Everyone was throwing themselves onto the ground. Some people
fell into the sea,'' he said.
	   In their broadcast Saturday, the rebels said they would allow
foreigners to leave the city ``because we consider that President
Vieira is using them as a shield,'' Lusa reported.

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ A senior U.N. official warned
Saturday that battle-weary Sierra Leone risked losing precious
foreign aid unless the government forged peace with rebel fighters
in the West African country.
	   Overseas donors were not prepared to fund relief projects for
protracted periods as long as massacres by guerillas continued on
villages in the rural north of the West African country, Sergio
Vieira de Mello, the U.N. under-secretary general for humanitarian
affairs, told journalists.
	   Sierra Leone's government could not expect to end the fighting
through military means, the U.N. official added. Only
reconciliation with the guerillas would convince them to lay down
their weapons.
	   The brutal attacks, in which thousands of villagers have lost
limbs and others killed, were apparently being carried out by
former junta troops loyal to Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma seeking
revenge for their ouster from the capital of Freetown by a
Nigerian-led West African force in February.
	   The ouster allowed Sierra Leone's elected leader, President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, to return from months in exile.
	   Koroma took power in a bloody coup in May last year that
followed Kabbah's 1996 rise to power in presidential elections
after several years of vicious civil war.
	   Despite being a fertile agricultural country with bountiful
diamond and other mineral resources, the fighting has destroyed
Sierra Leone's economic livelihood, and prompted thousands of
civilians to flee their homes, Vierra said. Sierra Leone is now one
of the world's poorest countries.
	   ``The international donor commmunity is tired,'' Vieira de Mello
said. ``There are too many examples where the situation has
remained closer to war than peace for years.''
	   Food harvests are expected to be poor this year because fighting
has prevented thousands of farmers from tending their crops.
	   ``It is not the expression of indignation (by the government
towards the rebels) that will bring the sufferings of the people to
an end,'' Vieirra de Mello said. ``People need to go back home and
be given the means to engage in sustainable productive work.''

Nigeria rallies to beat Spain; ticket scandal continues Netherlands-Belgium AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with South Korea-Mexico; will be UPDATED with
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The goals continued to flow Saturday at the World
Cup as Nigeria and Mexico both rallied for second-half
come-from-behind victories, and a Korean became the first player to
be ejected for a tackle from behind.
	   Wearing black arm bands on their green jerseys because of the
death Monday of their country's ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, the
Nigerians scored twice in five minutes in a 3-2 upset over Spain at
Nantes.
	   ``We dedicate it to all our compatriots,'' said Sunday Oliseh,
who blasted home the winner from 30 meters (yards) in the 78th
minute. ``This win was for 150 million Nigerians.''
	   At Lyon, substitute Ricardo Pelaez scored in the 51st minute and
Luis Hernandez in the 75th and 84th minutes in a 3-1 win for the
Mexicans, ending South Korea's hopes for its first-ever World Cup
victory in its fifth appearance in the tournament.
	   The Koreans played the last 60 minutes with 10 men after Ha
Seok-ju, who two minutes earlier had given his team a 1-0 lead, was
given a red card for a late tackle-from-behind that upended Jesus
Ramirez.
	   ``Basically, we didn't lose our cool,'' Hernandez said. ``We
paid attention and we didn't become desperate.''
	   Ha's ejection came in the ninth game of the tournament, making
the the midfielder the first victim of the FIFA dictate to crack
down on foul tackles from behind.
	   It was Mexico's first win in nine World Cup games in Europe, and
it served as a small vindication after lackluster results leading
up to the tournament.
	   ``We unloaded all that energy that had built up,'' Hernandez
said of the pressure back home. ``We got a great win.''
	   After nine matches, 26 goals had been scored _ an average of 2.9
per game and well above the average from recent World Cup first
rounds.
	   Later Saturday, neighboring rivals Belgium and the Netherlands
played at Saint-Denis. On Sunday, it's Jamaica-Croatia at Lens,
Yugoslavia-Iran at Saint-Etienne and Argentina-Japan at Toulouse.
	   Spain, often cited as a contender for the title, controlled the
game against Nigeria for more than 70 minutes before its
goalkeeper, Andoni Zubizarreta, inadvertently knocked in Garbal
Lawal's cross at the near post to tie the game 2-2 in the 73rd.
	   ``We had the match in our grasp, but, well, now we have to
continue fighting,'' Spanish coach Javier Clemente said. ``We
could've won 3-1, but it got away from us. We just got careless.
... That third goal was just sensational.''
	   Spain's defeat was just its second in 35 games and marked a
triumphant return for coach Bora Milutinovic, who coached the U.S.
in the 1994 tournament, Costa Rica in 1990, and Mexico in 1996. He
was hired by Nigeria after being fired following last year's
qualifying campaign in a second stint with the Mexicans.
	   Early in the second half, Raul Gonzalez scored one of the most
picturesque goals of the tournament, catching Fernando Hierro's
pass on his outstretched leg at full stride to give Spain a 2-1
lead.
	   Hierro's 25-meter (yard) free kick in the first half was the
first goal of the game, but Mutiu Adepoju answered for the Super
Eagles.
	   All three matches Saturday were preceded by a moment of silence
for Fernand Sastre, the French World Cup organizing committee
co-president. Sastre, 74, who was chiefly responsible for turning
France's hopes of staging the tournament into reality, died early
Saturday of lung cancer.
	   The exciting soccer _ after four days of competition, scoring is
prevalent and rowdy fans and dirty play aren't _ does have its
downside: It makes fans who are victims of a ticket scams even more
incensed that they're missing out on the action.
	   French authorities said for the first time Saturday that they
were ready to investigate the growing international ticket scandal.
	   FIFA and the World Cup organizing committee have earlier pledged
to file lawsuits against companies or individuals found to have
taken part in the scams, which have left thousands of fans without
tickets.
	   The problem is now exploding in France. Fans who dealt with
unlicensed brokers and tour operators are arriving without tickets
they thought would be waiting for them. It's estimated that some
12,000 Japanese fans are ticketless, although most have stayed
home.
	   Similar, although smaller, cases have been reported in Britain,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Brazil.

Andrew Sherborne, Barry Lane tied in water-logged European GP 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SLALEY, England (AP) _ In some of the grimmest golf weather
imaginable, Englishmen Andrew Sherborne and Barry Lane shared the
lead among 47 players who managed to finish the second round of the
rain-soaked European Grand Prix.
	   All play was wiped out by torrential rain on Thursday.
	   On Friday, only half of the 156-man field managed to play 18
holes on a course shortened from par-72 to par-69 because of
drenched tees and fairways.
	   Saturday was no better.
	   Fighting off all-day showers, the remainder of the field sloshed
through their 18 holes _ and 47 others got in a second 18 before a
downpour ended the day.
	   Organizers hope to get all players through 36 holes on Sunday
and then play a final 18, chopping the 650,000-pound (dlrs 1.06
million) event to 54 holes.
	   However, Sunday's weather forecast calls for more rain, making a
36-hole tournament the likely outcome.
	   Sherborne and Lane each shot 2-under 67s in the first round and
had matching 68s in the second for 3-under 135. Jamie Spence and
Gary Evans, also Englishmen, were tied at 136.
	   England's Mark Davis, who shot a first-round 64 to lead the
field, had a 2-over 71 in the second to fall off the pace.
	   Spain's Diego Borrego, who was second after 18 holes with a 65,
was 4-under after 19 holes.

Horse trainer from Barbados among those knighted on Queen's birthday 
</HEADLINE>
By ERIC NURSE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Race horse trainer Michael Stoute of
Barbados was awarded Knight Bachelor honors for his contributions
to sports tourism and his efforts as a goodwill ambassador for his
Caribbean island.
	   Stoute, one of England's most successful trainers, was listed
among those to be knighted as the traditional honors list was
published as part of the official celebration of the Queen's
birthday on Saturday.
	   ``I feel very honored and very thrilled,'' said Stoute, who now
lives and trains horses in England. ``It's a lovely surprise.''
	   Stoute has had worldwide success training race horses for owners
from England and several Middle East countries. His horses won such
prestigious events last year as the Dubai Championship Stakes and
the Dubai World Cup.
	   ``We have made some steady progress and we have won some big
races and had a lot of good fortune on the way,'' said Stoute, in
assessing his progress since he moved to English several years ago.
``It's not easy, of course, to break into the English scene,''
Stoute said, but he gave credit to the many people who have worked
with him.
	   Four other Barbados residents were also honored on the Queen's
Birthday.
	   Lindsay Bolden, a lawyer, former Cabinet minister and president
of the Senate in Barbados was awarded Commander of the British
Empire honors for his years of public service.
	   The same award was granted to Ilene Murray-Ainsley for her
distinguished nursing career and her work with the rehabilitation
of the physically and mentally handicapped, along with her
contributions to philanthropy.
	   Beryl Deane was named to the Order of the British Empire for
distinguished service in the field of education, and the same award
was granted to Vernon Watson for his years of service in the
development of the Barbados culture.

Four Germans arrested with hashish 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Four Germans and four Nepalese were
arrested Saturday with 215 kilograms (470 pounds) of hashish worth
more than dlrs 3.2 million in the international market, police
said.
	   Most of the contraband was hidden on the floor of the car they
had driven from Germany. The four Germans were returning home
Saturday when police, who had been watching them closely for three
months, stopped them at a check point just outside Katmandu,
officials police said.
	   Police identified them as Rieder Wolf Dieter, 49, of Bissingen;
Barsig Walfgang Walter, 38, of Augsburg; Jamman Thomas Johannes,
38, of Augsburg; and Flaschka Walter Hans, 38, of Jakob.
	   Police recovered 125 kilograms (275 pounds) of hashish from
under the floorboard of their car and the remaining 90 kilograms
(198 pounds) from a house rented by them in the Nepalese capital
Katmandu.

Archeological remains found at controversial Jerusalem site 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Antiquities Authority has found
medieval remains in the Muslim quarter of Jerusalem's walled old
city, at a controversial site where Jewish settlers wish to build a
religious seminary.
	   The discovery of a medieval wall at the site, just inside
Herod's Gate, means that construction of the school cannot begin
for several months at least, the Authority's spokeswoman Osnat
Gouez told The Associated Press.
	   Palestinian residents of the neighborhood have clashed with the
settlers and Israeli police twice since the settlers first moved
onto the site less than three weeks ago.
	   The land was purchased by Ateret Cohanim, a group which has been
settling Jews in Arab neighborhoods of east Jerusalem. The
Palestinians wish to set up their caapital in east Jerusalem, and
their leaders have condemned the group's activity as a provocation
and an obstacle to the peace process.
	   With the help of donors such as Miami businessman Irving
Moskowitz, Ateret Cohanim says it has brought 60 families and 150
Jewish seminary students into the densely populated Muslim Quarter.
	   The settlers first moved onto the site on the night of June 8,
erecting two prefabricated huts. Jerusalem's Mayor Ehud Olmert
ordered the huts removed on the grounds that they had been put up
without a building permit.
	   However after negotiations with Ateret Cohanim he agreed in
principle that the seminary could be built, provided the site was
first examined by the Antiquities Authority.
	   Guoez said it would take at least a month to conduct an
archeological survey of the site, after which a ``rescue dig''
would be conducted lasting several months.
	   Only then could construction of the seminary begin, she said.
	   Ateret Cohanim has agreed to provide the workers for the rescue
dig at its own expense, she said.

Death toll in Kosovo stands at well over 300 since late February three Serbs presumed dead.

Eds: UPDATES with Serb report of Serb houses torched, destroyed,
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The casualty toll in Serbia's
embattled Kosovo province has risen well over 300 dead and dozens
wounded, while many are missing, latest figures from Serb and
Albanian sources showed Saturday.
	   The pro-Albanian Board for the Protection of Human Rights based
in Pristina, capital of the Serbian secessionist republic, said a
total of 272 ethnic Albanians had died in the fighting, including
31 women and 17 children.
	   It had no Serbian casualty toll, but the pro-government Serbian
Media Center in Pristina listed 22 dead Serbian policemen, another
four officers kidnapped and presumed dead as well as 59 missing.
	   The Yugoslav army, which has been involved in the fighting while
guarding the border between Yugoslavia and Albania has lost four
soldiers, according to official records.
	   Serb sources also said that a total of five Serb civilians have
died and 24 have been wounded this year. In addition, several
ethnic Albanians loyal to Serbia have been found dead in recent
months.
	   The Serbian police, including special forces, have been at the
forefront of government efforts to suppress the increasingly
radical independence movement spearheaded by the underground Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Ethnic Albanians, most of whom want secession from Serbia,
outnumber Serbs in Kosovo 9 to 1.
	   It has become increasingly difficult to obtain reports on
fighting in Kosovo, parts of which are inaccessible because of
roadblocks put up by police and the KLA, respectively. Some 40
percent of the province are believed under rebel control.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported Saturday
some small-scale exchange of gun and grenade fire between police
and the KLA in the border area near the town of Djakovica.
	   Some ``more serious'' shelling was reported against two Albanian
villages, Morina and Smolica, in the same area.
	   No casualties have been reported there, and the area is still
sealed off. ``Considerable movement of police and army troops has
been noticed,'' the center said.
	   The Pristina-based Media Center, which is close to the
government, Saturday reported that after more than a dozen Serb
families had been forced to evacuate a village northwest of
Pristina last week, KLA fighters set aflame and destroyed all
houses where the Serbs lived. Three elderly missing Serbs were
presumed dead.

French, British search for yachtsman Eric Tabarly, lost off Welsh coast 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING for sports wires 
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ French sports hero Eric Tabarly, the country's
best-known yachtsman, was reported lost off Wales Saturday after
falling off his boat during the night.
	   Coastguards at Milford Haven in southwest Wales gave up their
search for the 66-year-old Tabarly 12 hours after he fell
overboard, but later re-started when the French navy sent a search
and rescue aircraft.
	   Tabarly, one of the world's top solo sailors, was reported
missing 55 kms (35 miles) south-southeast of Milford Haven. It was
not clear how he fell overboard, but he apparently was not wearing
a lifejacket.
	   The four crew members on the yacht have no communications
equipment, and speak little or no English. Rescuers were not
alerted until seven hours after Tabarly disappeared. The yacht
crew, who reportedly had little experience at sea, fired a flare to
attract a passing boat. They also reportedly threw a life preserver
in his direction, but did not know whether their skipper was able
to catch it.
	   At about midday, the search was called off and Chris Raley,
deputy district controller for Milford Haven Coastguard, said 12
hours was three times the expected survivability in the existing
conditions.
	   But in the evening, Raley announced a renewed search after the
``generous offer of an Atlantique search and rescue aircraft ''
from France. A Royal Air Force aircraft was also made available to
assist, he said.
	   ``We are giving both aircraft a search pattern of the area,''
Raley said. ``We have a few hours of daylight left and we will
continue until dusk and then look at the situation again.''
	   During the morning search, an RAF rescue helicopter
criss-crossed area and several merchant ships joined the search,
but found no trace of the missing yachtsman. The Coastguard said
seas were moderate with waves up to 13 feet (4 meters).
	   Tabarly, born July 24, 1931 in Nantes, became a naval officer in
1959.
	   He won several races with boats named Pen Duick, a Breton phrase
meaning ``blackheaded tomtit.''
	   Among his victories were a transatlantic solo race from Plymouth
to Newport, 5,390 kms in 27 days in 1964; the Morgan Cup in 1967,
the Gotland Round, Channel Race and the Fasnet, the race from
Plymouth to La Rochelle, all in 1967. He won a transpacific solo
race in the Pen Duick V in 39 days in 1969, and won the Los
Angeles-Tahiti race in 1972. Aboard the Pen Duick VI he won the
Plymouth-Newport race in 23 days and 20 hours in 1976.
	   He was awarded the Legion of Honor, was a member of the Maritime
National Order of Merit, and wrote several books including ``Solo
Victory'' in 1964 and ``Pen Duick'' in 1990.

World Cup: Zubizarreta's fourth cup gets off to dismal start 
</HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ As he gets older, it's supposed to get
better. Not for Andoni Zubizarreta.
	   With less than 20 minutes to go Saturday and Spain overpowering
the Nigerian Super Eagles 2-1, the 36-year-old veteran, playing in
his fourth World Cup, palmed the ball into his own net on a cross
from Nigeria's Garba Lawal that wasn't even directed at goal.
	   The one-time FC Barcelona star punched the ground in
desperation. But five minutes later he was dealt a more costly blow
when Sunday Oliseh hit a 30-meter blast to score the winner in
Nigeria's 3-2 victory.
	   ``Football can be just like that,'' said the quiet-spoken
Zubizarreta, playing his 125th game for Spain and who is expected
to retire after the tournament.
	   Oliseh's goal was the 99th he has conceded since 1985.
	   ``It's not bad luck,'' he said, surprisingly cool and composed
following the game. ``Nigeria exploited a moment of play and that's
all.''
	   The defeat was only Spain's second since the side was eliminated
by Italy in the quarterfinals of the 1994 World Cup. The other was
a 1-0 defeat by France in an exhibition match in January to
inaugurate the Stade de France in Saint-Denis.
	   Spanish coach Javier Clemente has frequently been criticized for
continuing to use Zubizarreta. The pressure to replace him may
increase substantially.
	   Zubizarreta, however, remained confident of the the team's
chances.
	   ``This team is accustomed to fighting back and has got this far
on its own strength, and that's what we're going to have to do
now,'' he said. ``We're going to have to get together and start
from zero.''
	   In Spain, Zubizarreta has played 622 first-division games with
Athletic Bilbao, FC Barcelona and, most recently, Valencia.

American to present reworked Holocaust memorial model in a week 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ An American architect is to present a reworked
model of a controversial Holocaust memorial for Berlin to
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in about a week, a newspaper said Saturday.
	   New York-based architect Peter Eisenman has re-designed a
previous suggestion for the monument to victims of the Nazis and is
to present it to Kohl on June 20, the Berlin-based Morgenpost
newspaper said.
	   In an early release of its Sunday edition, the newspaper said
that while Berlin Finance Senator Annette Fugmann-Heesing and
Justice Senator Ehrhart Koerting want a quick decision on the
memorial, Construction Senator Juergen Klemann remains critical of
the project.
	   The report said that Eisenman now wants to have the memorial
sunk in a depression in the ground at Brandenburg Gate so that
``when visitors stand on its edge they will have an oversight of
it.''
	   To detract from the monument being so large and add new quality
to it, rows of trees are to be planted around the area, the
newspaper said.
	   However, according to Berlin Senate spokesman Michael-Andreas
Butz, the idea of reworking the memorial's design was to make it
smaller than planned previously.
	   Butz told the newspaper he was skeptical whether a consensus
could be reached on the memorial before the summer pause.
	   On June 4, American sculptor Richard Serra withdrew from a
design competition for the memorial, saying it was for ``personal
and professional reasons.''
	   Serra had collaborated with Eisenman on the design - a
cemetery-like ``field'' of 4,000 concrete pillars _ one of four
finalists for the project slated for construction in 1999.
	   Both the Berlin Senate cultural administrators and the state
stressed then that the oft-delayed project would not be affected by
Serra's decision.
	   Eisenman said that he ``understood'' Serra and respected his
decision for leaving, but that he was committed to the design.
	   An initial design winner in 1996 _ a massive concrete slab
engraved with the names of Holocaust survivors _ was rejected as
monumental and offensive. And the second competition remains
controversial.

<TEXT>
	   SLALEY, England (AP) _ In some of the grimmest golf weather
imaginable, Englishmen Andrew Sherborne and Barry Lane shared the
lead among 47 players who managed to finish the second round of the
rain-soaked European Grand Prix.
	   All play was wiped out by torrential rain on Thursday.
	   On Friday, only half of the 156-man field managed to play 18
holes on a course shortened from par-72 to par-69 because of
drenched tees and fairways.
	   Saturday was no better.
	   Fighting off all-day showers, the remainder of the field sloshed
through their 18 holes _ and 47 others got in a second 18 before a
downpour ended the day.
	   Organizers hope to get all players through 36 holes on Sunday
and then play a final 18, chopping the 650,000-pound (dlrs 1.06
million) event to 54 holes.
	   However, Sunday's weather forecast calls for more rain, making a
36-hole tournament the likely outcome.
	   Sherborne and Lane each shot 2-under 67s in the first round and
had matching 68s in the second for 3-under 135. Jamie Spence and
Gary Evans, also Englishmen, were tied at 136.
	   England's Mark Davis, who shot a first-round 64 to lead the
field, had a 4-over 73 in the second to fall two strokes behind the
leaders.
	   Spain's Diego Borrego, who was second after 18 holes with a 65,
was 4-under after 19 holes.

Archeological remains found at controversial Jerusalem site

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Antiquities Authority has found
medieval remains in the Muslim quarter of Jerusalem's walled old
city, at a controversial site where Jewish settlers wish to build a
religious seminary.
	   The discovery of a medieval wall at the site, just inside
Herod's Gate, means that construction of the school cannot begin
for several months at least, the Authority's spokeswoman Osnat
Gouez told The Associated Press.
	   Palestinian residents of the neighborhood have clashed with the
settlers and Israeli police twice since the settlers first moved
onto the site less than three weeks ago.
	   The land was purchased by Ateret Cohanim, a group which has been
settling Jews in Arab neighborhoods of east Jerusalem. The
Palestinians wish to set up their caapital in east Jerusalem, and
their leaders have condemned the group's activity as a provocation
and an obstacle to the peace process.
	   With the help of donors such as Miami businessman Irving
Moskowitz, Ateret Cohanim says it has brought 60 families and 150
Jewish seminary students into the densely populated Muslim Quarter.
	   The settlers first moved onto the site on the night of June 8,
erecting two prefabricated huts. Jerusalem's Mayor Ehud Olmert
ordered the huts removed on the grounds that they had been put up
without a building permit.
	   However after negotiations with Ateret Cohanim he agreed in
principle that the seminary could be built, provided the site was
first examined by the Antiquities Authority.
	   Gouez said it would take at least a month to conduct an
archeological survey of the site, after which a ``rescue dig''
would be conducted lasting several months.
	   Only then could construction of the seminary begin, she said.
	   Ateret Cohanim has agreed to provide the workers for the rescue
dig at its own expense, she said.

Four hostages reported released in Dagestan Ingush bus passengers released.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Four women who were among 10 Russian military
personnel taken hostage in the Caucasus republic of Dagestan have
been released, a news report said Saturday.
	   A military bus carrying the personnel was seized Thursday night
in a suburb of the Dagestani capital Makhachkala, Russian
television said. The women were ordered off the bus, which then was
taken in the direction of neighboring Chechnya with the remaining
six servicemen, the report said.
	   A wave of kidnappings has recently broken out in the Caucasus
republics of Dagestan, Ingushetia and North Ossetia.
	   The presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia held an emergency
meeting Saturday in Vladikavkaz and pledged to improve relations
between their two republics, Russian news agencies said.
	   On Friday, three Ingush were abducted in North Ossetia, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said, and two residents of the Ossetian
village of Zamankul were kidnapped by masked gunmen.
	   Earlier this week, North Ossetian villagers detained five Ingush
bus passengers in apparent retaliation for the kidnapping of seven
of their neighbors in the Ossetian village of Batako. They were
released Friday night, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The abduction of the Russians on Thursday was apparently
retribution for the kidnapping of the Batako residents, the agency
said.
	   Predominantly Orthodox Christian North Ossetia and Muslim
Ingushetia fought a short but bloody war in 1992. Hundreds of
people were killed and most ethnic Ingush were expelled from North
Ossetia.
	   Presidents Alexander Dzasokhov of North Ossetia and Ruslan
Aushev of Ingushetia issued a joint statement after their meeting
Saturday, Interfax reported.
	   In it, they voiced ``deep anxiety over the growing tensions
between the two neighboring republics in the wake of widespread
hostage-taking incidents'' and said they would act to prevent any
further hostage-takings.

Reigning European indoor champion in women's 1,500 meters resigns 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Theresia Kiesl, the reigning European
indoor champion in the women's 1,500 meters, announced Sunday her
resignation, citing recurrent Achilles' tendon problems in her left
leg.
	   Kiesl, a 34-year-old mother of two children, won gold in the
European Indoor Track Championships in Valencia, Spain, in February
this year in 4.13.62. and a bronze medal at the Atlanta Summer
Olympics in 1996.
	   After the indoor gold medal, Kiesl wanted to concentrate on
winning an outdoor medal at the European Championships in Hungary.
	   ``I wanted to win a medal in Budapest, but under these
conditions it would have been hardly possible, and I wanted to step
down when I am in peak form, not on the decline,'' she declared.

Grenade goes off accidentally in southern town, killing six 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Six people were killed when a hand grenade
exploded accidentally Saturday in a market in a south Yemeni town,
security officials said.
	   The grenade belonged to a dealer in qat, a locally grown
narcotic, who was jostling with a client, the officials said.
	   The pin slipped out of the grenade and it exploded.
	   The officials said the explosion killed six people and wounded
eight. A hospital said it had received 10 wounded, but had no
information on fatalities.
	   The two men were pushing and shoving in a crowded part of the
market of al-Houta, about 35 kilometers (22 miles), north of Aden.
	   Weapons are common in Yemen, which suffered a short civil war in
1994 and where the government has yet to assert its authority over
much of the country.

Saturday the 13th is special for Brazilian coach 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ Too bad Brazil didn't play
Saturday.
	   That's Saturday as in Saturday, June 13.
	   It seems Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo has a thing about 13. No
matter that some consider it bad luck. For Zagallo, 13 is a charm,
and he goes out of his way to find it.
	   He got married on the 13th. In Rio de Janeiro, the vanity plate
of his Mercedes reads 0013. He likes to say he even has a 13 in the
year of his birth, 1931, even though it's backward.
	   As an all-star player with Rio's Botafogo in the 1950s and '60s,
Zagallo switched his No. 11 practice jersey for a 13 and painted
the number on his soccer shoes. He still wears the number in
training.
	   ``I played well and just kept using it,'' he said.
	   Zagallo was a member of the first Brazilian team to win a World
Cup in '58 _ two numbers whose sum is 13. Still, it didn't hurt
that Brazil also had players such as Pele, Garrincha and Nilton
Santos.
	   Four years ago, Zagallo exuded confidence before Brazil's final
match with Italy for the World Cup title. Brazilians wouldn't lose
in '94 _ again a sum of 13 _ he predicted. And they didn't,
eliminating Italy in a penalty-kick shootout to win a record fourth
Cup title.
	   In France, Zagallo already has found his lucky 13.
	   Before Brazil's 2-1 win over Scotland, he announced that luck
was with his team. Why? Brazil and Scotland _ Escocia, in
Portuguese _ have a combined 13 letters.
	   So he has every reason to be confident for Brazil's next game
against Morocco. It's on Tuesday, 6-16.
	   For Zagallo, it all adds up.

Saudi Arabian players lose cash in hotel break-in 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Saudi Arabian soccer team members lost dlrs 11,000
in cash when their hotel rooms were burglarized while they were
playing first World Cup match, a team official said Saturday.
	   Baggage left in 10 rooms at the Sofitel Metropole in Lille was
ransacked Friday when the team was 50 kilometers (30 miles) away at
the match in Lens. The players discovered the theft when they
returned to the hotel about one hour after the match, which they
lost 1-0 to Denmark.
	   ``We were in a state of shock when we saw the rooms,'' said the
team official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition on
anonymity. He said dlrs 11,000 in cash and one cellular phone were
stolen from baggage in five of 10 rooms that were burglarized.
	   The hotel switchboard operator, contacted by The AP, confirmed
that ``something happened'' at the hotel, but referred all queries
to the manager, who was not immediately available.
	   The team official said police investigated the burglary and said
they would alert players on the results. The team had heard nothing
by Saturday evening, after moving to another hotel outside Paris.
	   Four players and the team translator lost cash in the burglary,
with the translator worst hit with dlrs 5,700 taken from his
baggage, the official said.
	   The only other article taken was a cellular phone.
	   ``As soon as we entered our rooms, we saw that somone had
meddled with our baggage. the bags were unzipped and possessions
and clothes were strewn about the room,'' the official said.
	   ``It appears they were only looking for cash,'' the source said.
There was no sign of forced entry to the rooms.
	   The Saudis had stayed at the hotel in northern France for
several days during final training for its initial first-round
match with Denmark.

World Cup: Mexico rallies to beat 10-man Koreans first in World Cup for Mexico in Europe, quotes from Cha; optional lead upcoming 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS assists to Hernandez, graf 11; ADDS that victory was
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ With South Korea down to 10 men after
suffering the first tackle-from-behind ejection of World Cup '98,
Mexico rallied with three second-half goals for a come-from-behind
3-1 victory Saturday.
	   Substitute Ricardo Pelaez scored in the 51st minute and Luis
Hernandez in the 75th and 84th minutes for the Mexicans, ending
South Korea's hopes for its first-ever World Cup victory in its
fifth appearance in the tournament.
	   ``Basically, we didn't lose our cool,'' Hernandez said. ``We
paid attention and we didn't become desperate.''
	   It was Mexico's first win in nine World Cup games in Europe, and
it served as a small measure of vindication after lackluster
results leading up to the tournament. After qualifying, the team
fired coach Bora Milutinovic and replaced him with Manuel Lapuente.
	   ``We unloaded all that energy that had built up,'' Hernandez
said of the pressure back home. ``We got a great win.''
	   South Korea, controlling the early tempo with a conservative,
pass-orientated attack, took the lead in the 28th minute when Ha
Seok-ju's 30-meter (yard) free kick ricocheted off the head of
Mexico's Duilio Davino, who was part of the defensive wall.
	   Then, in the 30th minute, Ha was given the red card by Austrian
referee Guenther Benko for a late, sliding tackle that upended
Jesus Ramirez near midfield. Ha's ejection came in the ninth game
of the tournament, making the Korean midfielder the first victim of
the FIFA dictate to crack down on foul tackles from behind.
	   ``I doubt it was a veritable red card,'' said Korean coach Cha
Bum-kun, who played for South Korea in the 1986 World Cup finals in
Mexico. ``Maybe a yellow.
	   ``Of course I told the players about the new FIFA rule about
tackling from behind. I was quite disgusted when Ha went into the
tackle. He should've been calmer in that situation.''
	   With a man advantage, Mexico made two substitutes at halftime
and instantly went on the attack. It took only six minutes for one
of the subs, Pelaez, to find the mark with an opportunistic chance
that came when Ramirez' corner kick banked off the foot of Korean
captain Yoo Sang-chul.
	   Mexico kept the pressure on, and it paid off with Hernandez' two
goals, set up by Ramirez and Cuauhtemoc Blanco, and several more
chances that could have made the margin of victory greater.
	   Even before Ha's red card, the tackle-from-behind rule had
already been tested early in the match. Lee Min-sung was given only
a yellow after making hard, backside contact on Blanco's leg in the
20th minute. Two Mexicans, Alberto Garcia Aspe and Jaime Ordiales,

World Cup: Korean goalscorer becomes first ejected under new rule 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS quote from Korean coach
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Ha Seok-ju became the first victim of FIFA's
new directive to eject anyone for a foul tackle from behind,
ejected in the 30th minute of South Korea's World Cup opener
against Mexico on Saturday.
	   Ha's sliding challenge on the sideline wiped out Ramon Ramirez
and _ after three yellow cards earlier in the match _ Austrian
referee Guenther Benko flashed the Korean midfielder a red card.
	   ``I doubt it was a veritable red card,'' Korean coach Cha
Bum-kun said. ``Maybe a yellow. Of course I told the players about
the new FIFA rule about tackling from behind. I was quite disgusted
when Ha went into the tackle. He should've been calmer in that
situation.''
	   The ejection came only two minutes after Ha had put Korea ahead
1-0 on a 30-meter free kick that glanced off the head of Duilio
Davino in the Mexican wall.
	   FIFA increased the penalty for the sliding, studs-up tackles
from behind with the start of this World Cup by instructing
referees to send off any player who attempts such a challenge and
commits a foul.
	   Some criticized the world body saying the quadrennial
championship was not the place for experiments and predicted a
flood of ejections in the early games.
	   But while some tackles which appeared to fit FIFA's target went
unpunished, Ha's ejection was the first after eight games.
	   Anatoli Nankov was ejected from Bulgaria's 0-0 draw with
Paraguay, but his red was after accumulating two yellows, neither
of them a tackle from behind.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Government troops in Guinea-Bissau on
Saturday claimed to have ousted rebels from a military garrison in
the capital where they had been holed up since launching a coup
attempt a week ago, according to a report.
	   A statement read on the West African country's state-run radio
station said there were ``serious human and material losses'' on
the rebel side, according to the Portuguese news agency Lusa.
	   No further information was immediately available about the
statement, which was issued by the armed forces. Attempts to
contact diplomats and officials in Bissau were unsuccessful.
	   Lusa quoted an unidentified military source as saying that
rebels were engaged in hand-to-hand combat with Senegalese troops
who were deployed last week to support the forces loyal to
President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
	   Shooting could still be heard at 6p.m. (1800 GMT), Lusa
reported, as government troops apparently moved to take the
airport.
	   A private radio station near the garrison, which was captured by
the rebels last week and used to broadcast statements by them, was
still broadcasting after the armed forces statement was issued,
Lusa said.
	   The report did not say what the station, renamed Radio Voice of
Liberty by the rebels, was broadcasting.
	   Government troops pinned most of the rebels forces in the
military garrison in a suburb of the capital shortly after the
powergrab was launched early last Sunday.
	   Reinforcements also were sent from the neighboring Republic of
Guinea.
	   Sporadic fighting, mostly involving artillery and automatic
weapon fire, damaged buildings in the capital of the former
Portuguese colony and caused an unknown number of casualties.
	   Earlier Saturday the rebels, led by former armed forces chief
Brig. Ansumane Mane, had threatened to launch a major offensive
within 24 hours.
	   Footage broadcast on Portuguese state television RTP showed
houses reduced to rubble and the capital's streets full of shell
holes.
	   Portuguese radio RDP-Africa reported that about 100 children
were stranded in a compound near the military garrison, but there
was no immediate report on their safety.
	   Portuguese evacuees arriving Saturday in Lisbon from Bissau said
the shelling struck embassies, ministries, Bissau's main hospital
and the Bissau phone company building.
	   The garrison where the rebels were holed up was reportedly used
by a tank battalion, supporting the besieged soldiers' claim to be
able to break out.
	   But Guinea-Bissau Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva told
The Associated Press in Lisbon, where he was stranded due to flight
cancellations, that ``the tanks have not been maintained. They're
old, Soviet-built tanks.''
	   Delfim da Silva described the rebel strongholds as ``strategic
defensive positions.''
	   The garrison is a colonial building surrounded by high walls
that could be entered by one main and several minor roads, Delfim
da Silva said. At least one warehouse in rebel control was believed
to hold food supplies.
	   Other mutineers held positions near a barracks on the south side
of the coastal city.
	   The rebels earlier offered negotiations at a foreign venue,
suggesting Gambia, RDP reported.
	   Mane is from Gambia. He gained renown as a guerilla fighter in
the war against Portuguese colonial rule from 1961 to 1974. He was
later appointed head of the armed forces after independence even
though he spoke no Portuguese, the country's official language.
	   Mane, who was fired in January amid allegations of arms
smuggling to rebels in Senegal, accused Vieira of corruption and
called on him to step down so that early elections can be held.
	   Vieira, who seized power in a 1980 coup, was elected in the
country's first democratic ballots for president and parliament
four years ago.
	   Portuguese daily Publico reported that many thousands of
refugees were traveling on foot along the road between Bissau and
the northern border with Senegal.
	   Senegalese officials reportedly were allowing the refugees into
the country after they were vaccinated against yellow fever and
meningitis by medical teams at the border post.
	   More than 2,200 foreigners were evacuated from Bissau by a
Portuguese container ship on Thursday. They were taken to Senegal's
capital Dakar.
	   One of the more than 600 Portuguese evacuees who arrived
Saturday at Lisbon airport recounted how shells were landing in the
port while the foreigners were boarding the ship.
	   ``Everyone was throwing themselves onto the ground. Some people
fell into the sea,'' he said.
	   In their broadcast Saturday, the rebels said they would allow
foreigners to leave the city ``because we consider that President
Vieira is using them as a shield,'' Lusa reported.

	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) _ Foreigners fleeing Guinea-Bissau in
overcrowded navy and merchant ships arrived Saturday in neighboring
Senegal with frightening tales of bombardments and street fighting
between government and rebel troops.
	   Fifty-eight expatriates _ Brazilians, Argentines and Chinese and
one U.S. citizen _ were aboard a small Chinese vessel, the fourth
boat to drop anchor in Senegal's capital Dakar since the exodus
began from the former Portuguese colony in West Africa.
	   Earlier boats were filled with as many as 3,000 people,
including Portuguese, Canadians, French, Germans, Senegalese and 42
U.S. nationals.
	   The evacuation was being directed by Portuguese military
authorities.
	   Mark Stevens, U.S. charge d'affaires in Dakar, said he knew of
only five Americans remaining in Guinea-Bissau _ U.S. ambassador
Peggy Blackford and four other State Department employees who were
holed up inside the embassy in the capital of Bissau.
	   ``They hear shelling from time to time but they are in no great
danger,'' Stevens said. ``They are very secure for the time being,
waiting for the orders to evacuate.''
	   So far those orders had not been given and U.S. authorities were
not contemplating any immediate relief or intervention measures to
the West African country, Stevens said.
	   If the U.S. officials were forced to leave, they would likely be
evacuated by a Portuguese ship.
	   ``That seems to be the only way to get out,'' Stevens said.
	   Evacuees arriving after the grueling 24-hour journey without
food or water on the decks of cargo ships to Dakar said those left
behind in Bissau were without water or electricity or
communications. The city's only water tower was destroyed in the
fighting.
	   Foreigners arriving in Dakar were met by family members, some
weeping with relief and others sobbing in frustration at failing to
see their loved ones on board.
	   Fighting has raged in Guinea-Bissau's capital of Bissau since
last Sunday, when government troops supported by soldiers from
Senegal and Republic of Guinea pinned a number of renegade soldiers
in a military garrison.
	   Judy Byers, a missionary from Apple Valley, California, who
arrived on the Chinese ship, told of a steady rain of mortar shells
and small arms fire in her neighborhood in a Bissau suburb last
week.
	   Most civilians in the area had fled, said Byers, who works for
the Christian group Youth with a Mission.
	   An Argentine medical doctor, Abel Vallejos, described how he,
his wife and two children had been turned away from a Portuguese
cargo ship in Bissau as mortar shells landed in the water around
the boat.
	   Eventually, a small Chinese skiff took them to an awaiting
merchant vessel.
	   ``The ship is a miracle,'' Vallejos said. ``There were more than
40 booms in the water all around us, and the booms were getting
louder.''
	   Canadian diplomats said of the 23 Canadians registered in
Guinea-Bissau, two families arrived in Dakar on Friday night and
more were expected Saturday.
	   Of the 150 Brazilians registered in Guinea-Bissau, about 50 were
known to have left by Friday evening.
	   A Sierra Leonean woman, Margaret Horton, told of being separated
from her husband, a Christian missionary, while trying to escape
from their church in Bissau under heavy shelling last Sunday.
	   ``I have not seen my husband since,'' she said. ``I will never
return. It was like seeing your death. Like facing a firing
squad.''

Chief U.N. weapons inspector talks with Iraqi officials pickup 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with start of second Butler-Aziz meeting graf 6; no
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq promised Saturday to provide visiting
chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler with evidence that it has
complied with a U.N. weapons ban.
	   Neither Butler nor Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz commented
publicly after a first round of talks Saturday, but officials on
the delegations suggested that progress had been made.
	   Iraqi weapons officials said a team of U.N. arms monitors had
unearthed enough weapons parts to verify Iraq's claims that it
destroyed and buried its biological and chemical missile warheads.
	   The pieces were gathered by a team of 27 experts under German
Jean Jan at al-Nibai, 45 kilometers (28 miles) north of the capital
Baghdad, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The parts are sufficient to reconstruct 48 warheads Iraq
unilaterally scrapped in 1991, they said.
	   U.N. officials in Baghdad confirmed that parts were recovered,
but said they required analysis.
	   Butler, who arrived in Baghdad on Thursday accompanied by 18
U.N. arms experts, met Aziz later Saturday after lower-level
technical talks.
	   Butler and his team believe that Iraq is still concealing key
information on its banned weapons programs. Iraq has insisted that
it has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction and a
government-run newspaper has repeatedly lashed out at Butler,
calling him a ``mad dog.''
	   Baghdad says his demands are politically motivated.
	   ``Circumstances have changed and the tide is running against Mr.
Butler,'' said Al-Jumhouriya, an Iraqi government newspaper. ``If
he is wise he should either resign or declare Iraq has met all
obligations to get the sanctions lifted.''
	   ``During the current meetings, Iraq will supply more evidence to
prove that Butler's mission in Iraq has ended,'' it added.
	   Earlier this year, the United States and Britain threatened air
strikes if Iraq refused to open its presidential sites to U.N.
inspections. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan brokered a deal to
open the palaces to inspections.
	   Butler has said he came to Baghdad with a list of what Iraq must
do to satisfy the arms inspectors.
	   The list specifies that Iraq must hand over information on
long-range missiles, prove it has scrapped biological and chemical
warheads, and fully account for its production of VX nerve gas.
	   The U.N. inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before the Security Council will
consider lifting the sweeping economic sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

World Cup: Yugoslav coach insists he is not underestimating Iran WITH Sports-Soccer-Yugoslavia-Iran 
</HEADLINE>
By ANWAR FARUQI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ST. ETIENNE, France (AP) _ With only a day to go before his
team's first World Cup match, Yugoslavia coach Slobodan Santrac was
making sure not to motivate his opponent.
	   ``Iranian soccer is similar to ours,'' he said. ``They have very
good technique.
	   ``Iran had to meet the same requirements as any other team to
get to the World Cup, and they passed those requirements.''
	   It's a far cry from the comments that emanated out of
Yugoslavia's camp following the World Cup draw in December, when
Yugoslavia sounded confident that it and Germany would advance from
the Group F.
	   Santrac's comments came following Saturday's practice at St.
Etienne's Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, where Yugoslavia opens its
schedule against Iran on Sunday.
	   He also said midfielder Dejan Savicevic and defender Nisa
Saveljic would miss the match due to injuries.
	   ``I don't think they'll be able to help out in tomorrow's
game,'' Santrac said.
	   Iran was still holding hoping that captain and goalkeeper Ahmad
Reza Abedzadeh would available for the match. Abedzadeh is
recovering from a knee injury late last year and told The
Associated Press Friday that he would not play.
	   Iranian coach Talebi said there was ``only a 20 percent chance''
that midfielder Reza Shahroudi, also recovering from a leg injury,
would play.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ For Mexico, Saturday was a day of
forgiveness.
	   After ridiculing their national soccer team as it lost game
after game in preparation for the World Cup _ even dubbing it the
``Tritanic'' as a play on the tri-color uniforms it wears _ fans
were jubilant after Mexico's 3-1 win over South Korea on Saturday.
	   ``It looks like the Tritanic didn't sink after all,'' said Oscar
Espindola, 29, dancing in the street with his wife, Rosalva. ``I'm
so happy!''
	   Thousands of people ran laps around the Angel of Independence, a
major Mexico City monument, lying down on the ground to make the
wave and spraying one another with foam and with red, green and
white spray paint. ``Mexico! Mexico!'' they screamed.
	   Rodrigo Gonzalez, 17, squeezed his soaking T-shirt. ``They
bathed me in beer!'' he yelled.
	   ``Even if it seemed impossible, we're going to win,'' he said.
	   He conceded that he had been drinking rum, tequila and beer _
and a lot of each. ``We're sucking them down for the victory,'' he
said.
	   Gerardo Vela, 42, stood still as three teen-agers painted his
bald head in red, white and green. ``What can I do? They painted me
up,'' he said. ``The people are very happy. You have to let them do
what they want.''
	   He raised his arms and hooted, then joined the crowd running
around the monument.
	   But according to three young men, the most enthusiastic fan
around was their bulldog Baxter. His fur was painted in the
national colors, and he was wrapped in a Mexican flag.
	   ``He's so happy,'' said Gilberto Gutierrez Vazquez, 17.
	   When a reporter pointed out that the dog actually looked a bit
sullen, Gilberto waved away that possibility.
	   ``He's angry because they sprayed him with foam,'' he said.
``But believe me, he'll be celebrating again in a minute.''

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ For Mexico, Saturday was a day of
forgiveness.
	   After ridiculing their national soccer team as it lost game
after game in preparation for the World Cup _ even dubbing it the
``Tritanic'' as a play on the tri-color uniforms it wears _ fans
were jubilant after Mexico's 3-1 win over South Korea on Saturday.
	   ``It looks like the Tritanic didn't sink after all,'' said Oscar
Espindola, 29, dancing in the street with his wife, Rosalva. ``I'm
so happy!''
	   Thousands of people ran laps around the Angel of Independence, a
major Mexico City monument, lying down on the ground to make the
wave and spraying one another with foam and with red, green and
white spray paint. ``Mexico! Mexico!'' they screamed.
	   Rodrigo Gonzalez, 17, squeezed his soaking T-shirt. ``They
bathed me in beer!'' he yelled.
	   ``Even if it seemed impossible, we're going to win,'' he said.
	   He conceded that he had been drinking rum, tequila and beer _
and a lot of each. ``We're sucking them down for the victory,'' he
said.
	   Gerardo Vela, 42, stood still as three teen-agers painted his
bald head in red, white and green. ``What can I do? They painted me
up,'' he said. ``The people are very happy. You have to let them do
what they want.''
	   He raised his arms and hooted, then joined the crowd running
around the monument.
	   But according to three young men, the most enthusiastic fan
around was their bulldog Baxter. His fur was painted in the
national colors, and he was wrapped in a Mexican flag.
	   ``He's so happy,'' said Gilberto Gutierrez Vazquez, 17.
	   When a reporter pointed out that the dog actually looked a bit
sullen, Gilberto waved away that possibility.
	   ``He's angry because they sprayed him with foam,'' he said.
``But believe me, he'll be celebrating again in a minute.''

World Cup: Korean goalscorer becomes first ejected under new rule 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with result of game in third graf.
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Ha Seok-ju became the first victim of FIFA's
new directive to eject anyone for a foul tackle from behind,
ejected in the 30th minute of South Korea's World Cup opener
against Mexico on Saturday.
	   Ha's sliding challenge on the sideline wiped out Ramon Ramirez
and _ after three yellow cards earlier in the match _ Austrian
referee Guenther Benko flashed the Korean midfielder a red card.
	   ``I doubt it was a veritable red card,'' Korean coach Cha
Bum-kun said after the 3-1 loss. ``Maybe a yellow. Of course I told
the players about the new FIFA rule about tackling from behind. I
was quite disgusted when Ha went into the tackle. He should've been
calmer in that situation.''
	   The ejection came only two minutes after Ha had put Korea ahead
1-0 on a 30-meter free kick that glanced off the head of Duilio
Davino in the Mexican wall.
	   FIFA increased the penalty for the sliding, studs-up tackles
from behind with the start of this World Cup by instructing
referees to send off any player who attempts such a challenge and
commits a foul.
	   Some criticized the world body saying the quadrennial
championship was not the place for experiments and predicted a
flood of ejections in the early games.
	   But while some tackles which appeared to fit FIFA's target went
unpunished, Ha's ejection was the first after eight games.
	   Anatoli Nankov was ejected from Bulgaria's 0-0 draw with
Paraguay, but his red was after accumulating two yellows, neither
of them a tackle from behind.

EDS: SUBS graf 5 to CORRECT Prince Philip rode, not Prince Andrew
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The weather gave Queen Elizabeth II a break for
her official birthday celebrations on Saturday.
	   The rain stopped just as the queen left Buckingham Palace for
the annual Trooping the Color ceremony at Horse Guards Parade.
	   And it stayed dry as the queen joined her family later on the
balcony of the palace to see a flypast by a variety of modern and
vintage aircraft, including an AWACS communications and
surveillance aircraft, Harrier jet fighters and a Spitfire.
	   On the way to the Trooping the Color ceremony, the queen _
wearing a white and navy cotton dress with coat and matching hat _
rode in an open carriage, behind another open carriage carrying her
mother, Queen Mother Elizabeth, and the queen's sister, Princess
Margaret.
	   Riding behind the queen, three abreast, were Prince Charles,
Prince Philip and the Duke of Kent.
	   The queen actually marked her 72nd birthday on April 21, but the
official birthday is marked on the second Saturday of June.
	   Queen Victoria, who liked to celebrate her birthday of May 24 in
private, started the custom of having an official celebration in
June 1843. The day has been marked on a Saturday since in 1959, to
accommodate the crowds who come to see the pageantry, according to
``Monarchy and the Royal Family,'' by Graham and Heather Fisher.

Havel warns his country could turn into a 'banana republic' 
</HEADLINE>
By JAN SLIVA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - Czech President Vaclav Havel said
Saturday the forthcoming early elections would determine whether
the country becomes a ``civilized democracy'' or turns into a
``banana republic.''
	   ``The country is at a crossroads,'' Havel said in a one-hour
pre-election interview with the public Czech Television. ``It will
either become a civilized European democracy with a developed
political culture, or turn into a banana republic.''
	   Havel said the latter might happen should the ``Czech tradition
of mutual accusations and intrigues'' win over constructive
politics.
	   The elections, designed to break the stalemate that stymied
Czech politics since 1996, are scheduled for June 19-20.
	   Havel refused to identify himself with the political left or
right but praised the current center-right caretaker government of
Premiere Josef Tosovsky.
	   ``This government did a lot of work and, during the five months
of its existence, has settled topics which the previous Cabinet (of
Premiere Vaclav Klaus) failed to do in two years,'' he said.
	   Speaking about his health, Havel said he was ready to resign if
diagnosed with a serious illness.
	   ``I can imagine I would step down should my struggle against
death continue,'' Havel said, referring to several serious
operations he has undergone in the past 18 months, including
surgery for lung cancer in late 1996.
	   Havel is at present at his country seat in Lany outside Prague,
recuperating from emergency abdominal surgery he underwent in
Austria two months ago.
	   Removal of a tube that was inserted into his colon, which was
originally planned for mid-June, was postponed for at least a month
to avoid unnecessary risks.
	   This may make Havel unfit for the role he's expected to play in
coalition talks following the elections, despite the latest medical
reports indicating he is recovering well.

Former Russian premier calls for center-right coalition 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's liberal economic reformers need to create
a center-right coalition that will consolidate their scattered
support, former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar was quoted as saying
Saturday.
	   ``The creation of such a broad organization ... seems to be the
only strategy which can offer real hope for success in preparation
for the next elections,'' Gaidar told a meeting of his political
movement, Interfax said.
	   Gaidar, the architect of Russia's free market reforms, has
little popular support now and conceded that his movement,
Democratic Choice, has ``a very low level of electoral support.''
	   For that reason, he told supporters, it is important for the
movement to broaden its reach by aligning itself with ``the most
influential and the strongest non-communist and non-fascist
organizations'' before the next parliamentary elections, to be held
next year.
	   Gaidar admitted his party is in crisis. He said it had no
candidate for president in 2000, and he doubted that anyone could
win on a platform of liberal economic reforms.

Tikkanen's five rings overshadow one missed shot AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Esa Tikkanen will have plenty of Stanley Cup
memories to draw upon when he looks back on his illustrious hockey
career.
	   Tikkanen made his NHL debut with Edmonton in the 1985 finals
against Philadelphia, joining a line with Wayne Gretzky and Jari
Kurri. He also has shared the ice during the final round with Mark
Messier, Grant Fuhr, Paul Coffey and several other stars.
	   Best of all, Tikkanen has skated with Lord Stanley's Cup held
above his head on five occasions.
	   When he shares these memories with friends and family, Tikkanen
probably won't spend much time talking about the time he missed an
open net in Game 2 of the Washington Capitals' championship series
against the Detroit Red Wings.
	   The Capitals led 4-3 midway through the third period Thursday
night when Tikkanen gained control of a loose puck and skated in
alone against Detroit goaltender Chris Osgood. A marvelous fake
brought Osgood far to his left, and Tikkanen deftly skated around
the fallen goalie before taking a shot that skittered to the right
of the goal.
	   Washington subsequently lost 5-4 in overtime, and Tikkanen and
the Capitals entered Game 3 at the MCI Center Saturday night
looking for a little redemption.
	   ``This is just part of the game. Too bad it happened today,''
Tikkanen said after the overtime loss. ``Hopefully I can bounce
back Saturday and do better.''
	   Washington coach Ron Wilson was counting on it.
	   ``He missed the net. What can I say to someone about that at
this point in his career?'' Wilson said Saturday. ``He's going to
be devastated, obviously, but when you've played the game a long
time you bounce back.''
	   The Capitals probably wouldn't be in the Stanley Cup finals if
it weren't for Tikkanen, 33, who was acquired in early March to add
experience to a team that wasn't even assured a playoff spot at the
time. Tikkanen had two assists in his first game with Washington,
and the Capitals ultimately became the fourth seed in the Eastern
Conference.
	   Tikkanen then played stellar defense in Washington's three
playoff series against Boston, Ottawa and Buffalo.
	   ``He's one of the big reasons why we're here,'' captain Dale
Hunter said.
	   So who's going to complain about one missed shot? Not the
Capitals.
	   ``We were already up 4-3. That had nothing to do with it,'' left
wing Chris Simon said. ``That had nothing to do with the way we
broke down. We had enough goals to win. I don't think anyone looks
at that as the reason we lost the game.''
	   If Tikkanen would have just fired away at Osgood, a big deal
wouldn't have been made about a missed opportunity. But his
impressive fake seconds before the shot left him wide open in front
of the net.
	   ``He made a great move just to get in that situation,'' Hunter
said.
	   Tikkanen, who starred for Finland in the 1998 Olympics, had 72
goals and 132 points in 184 NHL playoff games before Saturday. It
had been 13 years since his first game, but that one stands out in
his memory above all the rest.
	   Tikkanen was returning from Prague after the 1985 World
Championships when Edmonton coach Glen Sather asked him to join the
Oilers in Chicago. Tikkanen didn't get into the semifinal game, but
Sather asked him if he was ready to suit up for Game 2 of the
finals against Philadelphia.
	   ``I think that is most exciting moment in my life,'' Tikkanen
said. ``Sather told me I'd play on the left side with Wayne Gretzky
and Jari Kurri. All I could say was, `Wow!' ''
	   He won three Cups with Edmonton and another with the New York
Rangers in 1994. Now, Tikkanen looks to grab one with the Capitals.
If nothing else, he'd like to give Washington fans something else
to remember him by.
	   ``He didn't miss it on purpose,'' left wing Craig Berube said.
``One day you're a hero, the next day you should have been a hero
and you're not. Maybe he'll end up scoring a big goal for us. He
deserves it.''

Nigeria rallies to beat Spain; ticket scandal continues with Netherlands-Belgium AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with quotes from South Korea coach; will be UPDATED
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The goals continued to flow Saturday at the World
Cup as Nigeria and Mexico both rallied for second-half
come-from-behind victories, and a Korean became the first player to
be ejected for a tackle from behind.
	   Wearing black arm bands on their green jerseys because of the
death Monday of their country's ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, the
Nigerians scored twice in five minutes in a 3-2 upset over Spain at
Nantes.
	   ``We dedicate it to all our compatriots,'' said Sunday Oliseh,
who blasted home the winner from 30 meters (yards) in the 78th
minute. ``This win was for 150 million Nigerians.''
	   At Lyon, substitute Ricardo Pelaez scored in the 51st minute and
Luis Hernandez in the 75th and 84th minutes in a 3-1 win for the
Mexicans, ending South Korea's hopes for its first-ever World Cup
victory in its fifth appearance in the tournament.
	   ``Basically, we didn't lose our cool,'' Hernandez said. ``We
paid attention and we didn't become desperate.''
	   The Koreans played the last 60 minutes with 10 men after Ha
Seok-ju, who two minutes earlier had given his team a 1-0 lead, was
given a red card for a late tackle-from-behind that upended Jesus
Ramirez.
	   Ha's ejection came in the ninth game of the tournament, making
the the midfielder the first victim of the FIFA dictate to crack
down on foul tackles from behind.
	   ``I doubt it was a veritable red card,'' Korean coach Cha
Bum-kun said. ``Maybe a yellow. Of course I told the players about
the new FIFA rule about tackling from behind. I was quite disgusted
when Ha went into the tackle. He should've been calmer in that
situation.''
	   It was Mexico's first win in nine World Cup games in Europe, and
it served as a small vindication after lackluster results leading
up to the tournament.
	   ``We unloaded all that energy that had built up,'' Hernandez
said of the pressure back home. ``We got a great win.''
	   After nine matches, 26 goals had been scored _ an average of 2.9
per game and well above the average from recent World Cup first
rounds.
	   Later Saturday, neighboring rivals Belgium and the Netherlands
played at Saint-Denis. On Sunday, it's Jamaica-Croatia at Lens,
Yugoslavia-Iran at Saint-Etienne and Argentina-Japan at Toulouse.
	   Spain, often cited as a contender for the title, controlled the
game against Nigeria for more than 70 minutes before its
goalkeeper, Andoni Zubizarreta, inadvertently knocked in Garbal
Lawal's cross at the near post to tie the game 2-2 in the 73rd.
	   ``We had the match in our grasp, but, well, now we have to
continue fighting,'' Spanish coach Javier Clemente said. ``We
could've won 3-1, but it got away from us. We just got careless.
... That third goal was just sensational.''
	   Spain's defeat was just its second in 35 games and marked a
triumphant return for coach Bora Milutinovic, who coached the U.S.
in the 1994 tournament, Costa Rica in 1990, and Mexico in 1996. He
was hired by Nigeria after being fired following last year's
qualifying campaign in a second stint with the Mexicans.
	   Early in the second half, Raul Gonzalez scored one of the most
picturesque goals of the tournament, catching Fernando Hierro's
pass on his outstretched leg at full stride to give Spain a 2-1
lead.
	   Hierro's 25-meter (yard) free kick in the first half was the
first goal of the game, but Mutiu Adepoju answered for the Super
Eagles.
	   All three matches Saturday were preceded by a moment of silence
for Fernand Sastre, the French World Cup organizing committee
co-president. Sastre, 74, who was chiefly responsible for turning
France's hopes of staging the tournament into reality, died early
Saturday of lung cancer.
	   The exciting soccer _ after four days of competition, scoring is
prevalent and rowdy fans and dirty play aren't _ does have its
downside: It makes fans who are victims of a ticket scams even more
incensed that they're missing out on the action.
	   French authorities said for the first time Saturday that they
were ready to investigate the growing international ticket scandal.
	   FIFA and the World Cup organizing committee have earlier pledged
to file lawsuits against companies or individuals found to have
taken part in the scams, which have left thousands of fans without
tickets.
	   The problem is now exploding in France. Fans who dealt with
unlicensed brokers and tour operators are arriving without tickets
they thought would be waiting for them. It's estimated that some
12,000 Japanese fans are ticketless, although most have stayed
home.
	   Similar, although smaller, cases have been reported in Britain,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Brazil.

Draper, Black on verge of Queen's final 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Scott Draper of Australia and Zimbabwe's Byron
Black looked set to reach the finals of the Queen's Club
grass-court tournament when off-and-on rain Saturday finally ended
play.
	   After a four-hour delay in starting the semifinals, Draper took
a 6-3, 5-2 lead over countryman Mark Woodforde before showers ended
play after 50 minutes.
	   In the other semifinal, Black was leading Italian Laurence
Tieleman 6-3, 1-2 when play was stopped.
	   Organizers hoped to complete the matches Sunday and then play
the finals.
	   With top-seeded Pete Sampras having lost and No. 2 Greg Rusedski
of Canada eliminated with a injury, one of the traditional
Wimbledon warmups is devoid of name players.
	   Black is the top remaining seed at No. 14 and Woodforde, an
Australian doubles specialist, was seeded 15th.
	   Draper, rounding in to form, had not won back to back matches
this season until this week.
	   Black has had a better season. He has reached two APT Tour
finals _ losing both _ and helped Zimbabwe oust Australia from the

Steel plant in southern Spain likely source of rise in radiation levels in Europe 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with statement from Greenpeace Spain in final graf
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A steel mill in the southern Spanish city
of Algeciras was the probably source of a rise in radiation levels
detected in France, Switzerland and Italy in early June, a
spokeswoman for the national nuclear authorities said Saturday.
	   Radioactive scrap metal of unknown origin was melted down at the
Acerinox plant probably around the end of May, Spanish Nuclear
Security Council spokeswoman Fatima Rojas said.
	   The evidence suggests that the incident was linked with detected
increases of Cesium 137 in the atmosphere at the beginning of the
month primarily in France but also in Switzerland and Italy, Rojas
said.
	   According to the Council, the radioactive cloud moving north
from southern Spain went unnoticed because it was well below
``worrying'' levels.
	   It was not until Acerinox reported radiation in the ashes of its
foundry on June 9, that the connection was made between the
privately-owned Spanish steel mill and the growing concern in
Europe over the unexplained cloud, Rojas said.
	   The affected area of the plant has been sealed off and workers
called for a medical evaluation due Monday.
	   The Italian government has accused Spain of failing to inform it
about the leak. Environment Minister Edo Ronchi said the government
learnt the news following inquiries to the French.
	   ``We are not responsible for the lack of details about the
matter'' he said, responding to environmentalists' criticism in
Italy that the government held back information.
	   The Spanish-branch of the international environmental
organization Greenpeace on Saturday accused the government of a
negligent cover-up.
	   ``It is difficult to believe that none of the Council of Nuclear
Security's centers detected the Cesium 137 (on its way across
Spain)'' Greenpeace spokesman Carlos Bravo said.

World Cup: Dutch and Belgians 0-0 at half time 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink fluffed an
easy, early chance and the dominant Dutch were being held 0-0 by
Belgium Saturday at half time of their fourth World Cup
confrontation in as many years.
	   The Belgians, who beat the Dutch 1-0 in the last finals in the
United States in 1994 but lost twice on 3-0 scorelines in
qualifying for this competition, were kept under pressure for most
of the half but managed to survive to the interval.
	   The Dutch were without Dennis Bergkamp, who has been sidelined
for six weeks with a hamstring problem, but should have taken the
lead after only six minutes when Belgian 'keeper Filip De Wilde
spilled a 25-meter (yard) shot from Ronald de Boer.
	   Hasselbaink had an empty goal to aim at from an acute angle but
hopelessly misplaced his shot and the Belgians cleared.
	   Bertrand Crasson, beaten repeatedly by Dutch winger Marc
Overmars down the flank, was replaced by Eric Deflandre after only
21 minutes as the Belgians tried to stop the flow of crosses into
the danger area.
	   Deflandre also had problems with the speedy Dutchman and was
shown the yellow card for a foul on Overmars within eight minutes
of taking the field.
	   A minute before the interval, the Belgians almost snatched the
lead when Danny Boffin crossed from the left but Marc Wilmots could
only connect with his chest instead of his head and' keeper Edwin
van der Sar was able to save.
	   Lineups:
	   Netherlands _ Edwin van der Sar; Aron Winter, Jaap Stam, Frank
de Boer, Arthur Numan; Clarence Seedorf, Ronald de Boer, Phillip
Cocu, Marc Overmars; Patrick Kluivert, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.
	   Belgium _ Filip De Wilde; Bertrand Crasson (Eric Deflandre,
21st), Lorenzo Staelens, Mike Verstraeten, Vital Borkelmans; Franky
van der Elst, Philippe Clement, Marc Wilmots, Danny Boffin; Luc
Nilis, Luis Oliveira.
	   Referee: Pierluigi Collina, Italy.

Mexico benefits from new FIFA tackling dictate 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: optional lead
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Implemented just before the start of the
World Cup, FIFA's new dictate to crack down on foul tackles from
behind earned countless complaints as teams struggled to adjust in
time for the showcase tournament.
	   But you won't here any complaining from Mexico
	   Benefiting from a man-advantage after a South Korean player was
given a red card for just such a tackle in Saturday's match, Mexico
came back from a one-goal deficit to score three times in the
second half for a 3-1 victory and its first World Cup match win in
Europe.
	   ``The call was a very harsh one,'' said Korean coach Cha
Bum-kun, who played for South Korea in the 1986 World Cup finals in
Mexico. ``I doubt it was a veritable red card, maybe a yellow.
	   ``Of course I told the players about the new FIFA rule about
tackling from behind. I was quite disgusted when Ha went into the
tackle. He should've been calmer in that situation.''
	   Just two minutes after putting the South Koreans up 1-0 in the
28th minute, when his 30-meter (yard) free kick deflected off the
head of Mexico's Duilio Davino, Ha Seok-ju has shown the red card
by Austrian referee Guenther Benko for a sliding tackle that
toppled Ramon Ramirez near midfield.
	   Ha's ejection threw the South Korean side into disarray.
	   ``Ha's red card was a psychological blow to the team,'' Cha
said. ``After he went off, the players all felt rushed and
pressured. It unbalanced the entire team.
	   ``When the Mexicans scored, all I was hoping for was a tie. At
then end I was hoping for a 3-2 score at least. The final score was
lamentable.''
	   With a man advantage, Mexico made two substitutes at halftime
and instantly went on the attack. It took only six minutes for one
of the subs, Ricardo Pelaez, to find the back of the net with a
golden opportunity that came when Ramirez' corner kick banked off
the foot of Korean captain Yoo Sang-chul.
	   Mexico kept the pressure on, and it paid off with Luis Hernandez
scoring the winner in the 75th and an insurance goal nine minutes
later.
	   The tackle-from-behind rule had already been tested early in the
match, before Ha's red card. Lee Min-sung was given only a yellow
after making hard, backside contact on Cuauhtemoc Blanco's leg in
the 20th minute, and two Mexicans, Alberto Garcia Aspe and Jaime
Ordiales, were also given yellows for less vicious fouls.
	   Mexico's win stumped South Korea's hopes for its first-ever
World Cup victory five appearances in the tournament, and renewed
its own hope of advancing to the second round _ or even winning the
tournament.
	   ``We've come to this tournament with the hopes of becoming
champions,'' said Pelaez. ``We are determined to win even though it
will be very difficult for us.
	   ``Those who come to the World Cup without the intention of
winning the tournament, should not come at all.''
	   The victory offered a measure of vindication for Mexico, which
had come under criticism for its unimpressive results leading up to
the World Cup. After qualifying, the team fired coach Bora
Milutinovic and replaced him with Manuel Lapuente.
	   Lapuente was off to Paris only moments after the match to watch
the Belgium-Netherlands game, and get a good look at his other
opponents in Group E.
	   ``This is the first step and it was a solid first step,''
Lapuente said. ``All the boys were ready to play. They showed class
and character.''

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Six people were killed and 18 wounded when a
hand grenade exploded accidentally Saturday in a market in a south
Yemeni town, the Interior Ministry said.
	   The grenade belonged to Hassan Azar, a dealer in qat, a locally
grown narcotic, security officials said.
	   The grenade was fastened to Azar's belt. He inadvertently pulled
the pin out when retrieving change from his pocket, the ministry
said in a statement.
	   The ministry said a committee would investigate the incident.
	   The explosion occurred in a crowded market in al-Houta, about 35
kilometers (22 miles), north of Aden, said the officials, who spoke
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Weapons are common in Yemen, which suffered a short civil war in
1994 and where the government has yet to assert its authority over
much of the country.

Carr helps Jazz survive in Game 5 AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ All Utah wanted from its trip to Chicago was to
get the NBA Finals back home. That's where the series is today,
thanks in large part to a big-time performance from a most unlikely
source.
	   Reserve Antoine Carr scored 12 points in Utah's 83-81 stay-alive
victory in Game 5 Friday night. Eight of Carr's points came in the
fourth quarter, huge production from a 13-year veteran who scored
just four points in the first four games of the series.
	   Carr also gave Utah a big-man defensive presence to help out
Karl Malone.
	   ``We turned the heat up on everybody,'' he said. ``We just
started banging and going to work against them, trying to keep them
from cutting through the lanes and freelancing and keep them from
doing what they normally do best, which is that high-flying game of
theirs.
	   ``We played like the Jazz of old. We have to do that every game
now.''
	   Carr's presence took some of the defensive heat off Malone, who
scored a series-high 39 points.
	   ``I don't think they were able to double-team him as quickly,''
Carr said. ``They knew someone was on top who was able to hit the
jumper or take it to the hole. They had to try and counter.''
	   Malone said from the start of the series that the Jazz big men
would have to step up against Chicago and help out Utah's guards
against the Bulls. But until Carr came through, the big guys had
done little damage.
	   At halftime, trailing 36-30 after the Jazz tied the record for
fewest points in any half for the finals set by Houston against
Boston in 1981, coach Jerry Sloan turned to Carr.
	   ``Number one, he was able to catch a basketball,'' Sloan said.
``We had a tremendously tough time trying to catch the ball when we
were driving to the basket. That's one reason we put him out there.
He was able to do something with it. The way they were playing
Karl, we needed to have somebody step up. I thought he made a
couple of excellent plays.''
	   Carr made five of six shots from the field and hit a pair of
crucial foul shots in the final 10 seconds. He wasn't surprised by
his production.
	   ``I was ready to play,'' he said. ``I wanted to get in and bang.
I've always had the offense. I got an opportunity to put the ball
up and home.''
	   The stay-alive victory puts the Jazz at home for Game 6 on
Sunday. If Utah wins that one, a decisive seventh game would be
played there next Wednesday.
	   ``I like our odds going home,'' Carr said. ``We have a good
crowd. They ought to be pumped up. We're going to be pumped up. It
feels good going back home.''
	   And even better that they're dragging the Bulls along with them.

President meets with labor leaders after four-day protest 
</HEADLINE>
By LEO MORPURGO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ President Jules Wijdenbosch planned
to meet Saturday with labor leaders after four days of protest that
have closed down most businesses and schools in the country.
	   As labor unions and other groups mounted another wave of work
stoppages last week, some business groups also turned against the
president and asked Wijdenbosch to resign.
	   Protests began Tuesday and were initially planned to last one
day. Instead, they gained steam and were extended through the week,
as more organizations joined in demonstrations against the
government.
	   Labor unions are opposing government privatization plans and
also demanding better pay as the country is wracked by rapidly
rising inflation. Business groups are unhappy with the president's
inability to quell the labor disturbances and fix the nation's
economy.
	   Suriname, a former Dutch colony located on the northeast corner
of South America, is the Western Hemisphere's poorest country after
Haiti. Because of its economic problems, the Central Bank was
forced to prop up the country's guilder in September.
	   On Wednesday, Wijdenbosch said the government would not give in
to the demands of the workers. But in a televised address to the
nation on Thursday night, with the protests growing, he struck a
more conciliatory note, saying ``the government will seriously
consider the ideas and opinions of all Surinamese.''
	   The president met with business leaders Friday before meeting
with labor union representatives on Saturday, but refused to
comment on the content of the discussions.
	   Opposition political leader Winston Jessurun dismissed the
president's meetings as an attempt to stall for time and split the
opposition to his government.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A Finnish mobile telephone company said Saturday
it was canceling an advertising campaign containing a slogan that
also had been used at a Nazi concentration camp.
	   Signs and newspaper ads in Germany for new Nokia mobile phones
bear the slogan ``Jedem das Seine,'' which translates to ``Everyone
gets his due.''
	   The same slogan was posted on a sign at the entrance to
Buchenwald, a Nazi concentration camp where thousands of Jews died
during World War II.
	   ``Nokia sincerely regrets any offense we have caused by this
unfortunate choice of phrase,'' a Nokia senior vice president,
Anssi Vanjoki, said in a statement faxed Saturday to The Associated
Press in New York.
	   ``We have taken strong corrective actions and we are reviewing
approval procedures with our advertising agencies to ensure that
such things will not happen again.''
	   The American Jewish Committee had demanded that Nokia stop the
campaign, claiming it insulted Holocaust victims, the Berlin-based
Tageszeitung daily newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Committee spokeswoman Wendy Kloke called Nokia's use of the
slogan a ``lack of sense of history and deriding to victims,'' the

President meets with labor leaders after four-day protest 
</HEADLINE>
By LEO MORPURGO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Suriname President Jules Wijdenbosch
will meet with labor leaders after four days of protest that have
closed down most businesses and schools in the country.
	   The president met with business leaders Friday, and was to meet
with labor union representatives on Saturday, but refused to
comment on the content of the discussions.
	   As labor unions and other groups mounted another wave of work
stoppages last week, some business groups also turned against the
president and asked Wijdenbosch to resign.
	   Protests began Tuesday and were initially planned to last one
day. Instead, they gained steam and were extended through the week,
as more organizations joined in demonstrations against the
government.
	   Suriname, a former Dutch colony located on the northeast corner
of South America, is the Western Hemisphere's poorest country after
Haiti. Because of its economic problems, the Central Bank was
forced to prop up the country's guilder in September.
	   Labor unions are opposing government privatization plans and
also demanding better pay as the country is wracked by rapidly
rising inflation. Business groups are unhappy with the president's
inability to quell the labor disturbances and fix the nation's
economy.
	   Opposition political leader Winston Jessurun dismissed the
president's meetings as an attempt to stall for time and split the
opposition to his government.

Haile Gebrselassie sets world record on 5,000 meters 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia set a
new world record in the 5,000 meters running Saturday night in
Helsinki. He clocked 12 minutes, 39.36 seconds for his 14th world
record after two blistering final laps.
	   Daniel Komen of Kenya set the previous record of 12:39.74 last
year.
	   Only ten days earlier, Gebrselassie set a new record in the
10,000 meters in Hengelo, Netherlands, with 26:22.75 in his
previous race. He beat Kenyan Paul Tergat's time of 26:27.85.
	   ``I went home after that to do a little bit of light training
... and recovered quickly,'' Gebrselassie said.
	   ``I am not a hundred percent satisfied with this run, but it was
OK. The beginning was a bit slow, and after that I tried to do
better.''
	   Gebrselassie, and his agent, Jos Hermens of Belgium, had hoped
for cool temperatures and windless weather. It was a few degrees
chillier than they wanted, but a bigger problem was Gebrselassie's
three pacesetters.
	   Branko Zorko of Croatia could not go with the required
60.5-second laps until 2,000 meters. The 2:31-2:32 for the first
1,000 meters was not met, with Zorko leading in 2:33.91. Assefa
Mezegebu of Ethiopia took over, but the contribution of another
Ethiopian, Million Wolde, came to almost nothing.
	   The first 2,000 meters went in 5:05.6 compared with 5:02.4 in
Komen's record race, and Gebrselassie was four seconds off his
hoped-for pace at 3,000, clocking 7:38.9.
	   Gebrselassie had to go solo for the final 2,000 meters, but two
blistering final laps under 59 seconds got the record for the world
and Olympic champion.

U.S. Open field may be one of best ever AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ For a while, the inability of anyone to
dominate the four major golf championships was because no single
great player had emerged. Going into the U.S. Open, the lack of a
dominating golfer seems to be because there are too many great
players _ especially young ones.
	   The last 14 major championships were won by 14 different players
and nine of those won their first _ and so far only _ major.
	   Even Tiger Woods, whose 12-stroke victory in the 1997 Masters
had people talking Grand Slam, has not been able to dominate. In
fact, he has not made a real run at a major title since winning the
Masters.
	   ``I think it's going to be very common to have four different
major winners in a year,'' said Davis Love III, winner of the U.S.
PGA Championship last year.
	   The reason is clear. After a search for several years for the
next Jack Nicklaus or Tom Watson, golf found not one but a slew of
players wanting the title of best in the world.
	   As Thursday's first round of the U.S. Open at The Olympic Club
nears, many players are near the top of their game.
	   Woods, two-time U.S. Open winner Ernie Els, British Open
champion Justin Leonard, Phil Mickelson, David Duval, Australian
Stuart Appleby and Lee Westwood of England have all won this year
and all are 28 or younger.
	   Throw in Love, Masters winner Mark O'Meara, two-time PGA Tour
winner Fred Couples, Colin Montgomerie and a revitalized Watson,
and the Open field is very deep.
	   ``If you ask me who is playing the best right now going into the
Open, I'd have to say Duval and Couples,'' Love said.
	   He also thinks Els has a chance to become the first player to
successfully defend the U.S. Open title since Curtis Strange did it
in 1989.
	   ``He hits it straight and he's a great putter,'' Love said.
``For a long hitter he's very patient. He's always going to do well
on a U.S. Open-type course.''
	   Woods, Els, Love and Couples come into Olympic with health
questions. Woods withdrew from Kemper and Els pulled out of the
Buick Classic, both with back problems.
	   The fact that both Woods and Els withdrew a week apart could
indicate the threat of back problems to the great young golfers. Or
it could indicate how intent the two of them are on playing well at
Olympic.
	   Love, who played three very good rounds at the Memorial
Tournament before fading on Sunday, and Couples seem to have their
bad backs under control.
	   In fact, Couples has found an inner peace during a series of
personal problems _ including the death of his father and his
girlfriend's breast cancer _ to play his best golf since 1992.
	   Woods, whose game has been much more consistent but not as
spectacular as last year, feels he has an advantage at Olympic
because he knows the course very well.
	   Still, Woods will have to deal with another one of his problem
courses _ one where he cannot hit the driver very often.
	   ``There are a lot of doglegs at Olympic,'' Woods said. ``There
will be a lot of 2-irons off the tee.''
	   And when the driver has to stay in his bag Woods loses his
biggest advantage.
	   Montgomerie, Duval and Mickelson come into the Open with the
burden of trying to claim their first major championship.
	   At almost 35, Montgomerie is under the most pressure, especially
since his accurate game seems perfect for the U.S. Open, a fact
proven by his two second-place and one third-place finish.
	   Mickelson turns 28 on Tuesday, but his 12 career victories and
five full seasons on the PGA Tour leave people wondering when he
will get a major title.
	   Duval has less pressure. He is only 26 and his breakthrough
victory came last October. Since then, he has won five times and is
the hottest player in the world.
	   He has also developed the confidence and grind-it-out attitude
it takes to win a U.S. Open.
	   Another young guy with a perfect game for the tight fairways,
high rough and fast greens of a U.S. Open venue is Jim Furyk. The
28-year-old is in that group of young players, along with Appleby
and Westwood, just a notch below Woods, Els, Leonard, Duval and
Mickelson.
	   Westwood, 25, won four times in Europe last year and won his
last two tournaments before crossing the Atlantic to play in the
Buick Classic near New York the week before the Open.
	   He also won in New Orleans, getting his first PGA Tour victory,
something Montgomerie still does not have.
	   ``Now they are grouping me with Tiger Woods, David Duval and
Ernie Els,'' he said, raising his eyebrows in a combination of
disbelief and pride.
	   Appleby, 27, has won twice on the PGA Tour in 15 months.

Seven Britons arrested in southern Spain on suspicion of drug trafficking 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FUENGIROLA, Spain (AP) _ Seven British citizens were detained
Saturday in the southern town of Fuengirola, suspected of
involvement in trafficking hashish between Morocco and the United
Kingdom, news reports said.
	   The arrested Britons lived in British rocky outcrop of Gibraltar
and along the southern Spanish coastal region known as the Costa
del Sol, the private news agency Europa Press reported.
	   Police seized 260 kilos (573 pounds) of hashish as well as seven
vehicles and three million pesetas (dlrs 20,000) in the operation,
Europa Press said.
	   According to the agency British police arrested the son of one
of the group in the U.K. in a simultaneous operation, seizing a
further 200 kilos (441 pounds) of hashish from his home.
	   The identities of the suspects were not released and no further
details were available.

Grenade goes off accidentally in southern town, killing six 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A hand grenade exploded in a crowded market
Saturday, killing six people and wounding 18, when a vendor pulled
the pin while giving change.
	   The grenade was fastened to the belt of Hassan Azar, a dealer in
qat, a locally grown narcotic, the Interior Ministry said in a
statement. Azar was among the dead.
	   The explosion occurred in al-Houta, about 35 kilometers (22
miles), north of the southern city of Aden.
	   The ministry said a committee would investigate the incident.
	   Weapons are common in Yemen, which suffered a short civil war in
1994 and where the government has yet to assert its authority over
much of the country.

World Cup: Kluivert expelled as Dutch held 0-0 by neighbor 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Patrick Kluivert was expelled for
elbowing Lorenzo Staelens in the chest as the Dutch squandered
their chances in a 0-0 World Cup tie with Belgium Saturday.
	   Kluivert, who had few opportunities, showed his frustration
eight minutes from time after a collision with Staelens. He walked
over towards the Belgian, wagging his finger, and elbowed him in
the chest.
	   Italian referee Pierluigi Collina didn't see the off-the-ball
incident but consulted his linesman with Staelens on the ground and
didn't hesitate to show the AC Milan star the red card.
	   Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and his second half replacement, Dennis
Bergkamp, both fluffed easy opportunities as the Dutch dominated
but failed to get the ball past overworked Belgian 'keeper Filip De
Wilde in the fourth World Cup confrontation in as many years
between the two neighbors.
	   The Belgians, who beat the Dutch 1-0 in the last finals in the
United States in 1994 but lost twice on 3-0 scorelines in
qualifying for this competition, were kept under pressure for most
of the game but managed to survive.
	   The Dutch should have taken the lead after only six minutes when
De Wilde spilled a 25-meter (yard) shot from Ronald de Boer.
	   Hasselbaink had an empty goal to aim at from an acute angle but
hopelessly misplaced his shot and the Belgians cleared.
	   Bertrand Crasson, beaten repeatedly by Dutch winger Marc
Overmars down the flank, was replaced by Eric Deflandre after only
21 minutes as the Belgians tried to stop the flow of crosses into
the danger area.
	   Deflandre also had problems with the speedy Dutchman and was
shown the yellow card for a foul on Overmars within eight minutes
of taking the field.
	   A minute before the interval, the Belgians almost snatched the
lead when Danny Boffin crossed from the left but Marc Wilmots could
only connect with his chest instead of his head and' keeper Edwin
van der Sar was able to save.
	   The Dutch resumed applying pressure early in the second half and
De Wilde smothered a 25-meter (yard) shot from Clarence Seedorf two
seconds after blocking a fiercely struck angled shot from
Hasselbaink.
	   De Wilde was beaten when Kluivert climbed above the Belgian
defense to meet a corner by Ronald de Boer but Deflandre was well
placed to head off the line.
	   Forced to defend for long periods, the Belgians reminded the
Dutch they were still a force on the break and Luc Nilis was only
inches too high with a 25-yard floater in the 58th minute.
	   Bergkamp, sidelined for six weeks with hamstring problems,
entered the game as substitute for Hasselbaink after 66 minutes and
coach Guus Hiddink sent on Boudewijn Zenden for Seedorf at the same
time to provide fresh legs and ideas.
	   Bergkamp had been on the field for eight minutes when he had a
golden chance to give his team the lead but volleyed wide from no
more than 10 meters with no one near him.
	   Jaap Stam, a defender who will play for Manchester United next
season, fired in a 30-meter shot that De Wilde couldn't hold onto
first time and Deflandre kicked the ball off the line from Phillip
Cocu.
	   Lineups:
	   Netherlands _ Edwin van der Sar; Aron Winter, Jaap Stam, Frank
de Boer, Arthur Numan; Clarence Seedorf (Boudewijn Zenden, 66th),
Ronald de Boer (Wim Jonk, 80th), Phillip Cocu, Marc Overmars;
Patrick Kluivert, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink (Dennis Bergkamp, 66th).
	   Belgium _ Filip De Wilde; Bertrand Crasson (Eric Deflandre,
21st), Lorenzo Staelens, Mike Verstraeten, Vital Borkelmans; Franky
van der Elst, Philippe Clement, Marc Wilmots, Danny Boffin; Luc
Nilis, Luis Oliveira (Lakonda Mpenza, 60th).
	   Referee: Pierluigi Collina, Italy.

Nigeria rallies to beat Spain; ticket scandal continues AP Sports Writer

Eds: UPDATES with Netherlands-Belgium, 11th graf
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The goals continued to flow Saturday at the World
Cup as Nigeria and Mexico both rallied for second-half
come-from-behind victories, and a Korean became the first player to
be ejected for a tackle from behind.
	   Wearing black arm bands on their green jerseys because of the
death Monday of their country's ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, the
Nigerians scored twice in five minutes in a 3-2 upset over Spain at
Nantes.
	   ``We dedicate it to all our compatriots,'' said Sunday Oliseh,
who blasted home the winner from 30 meters (yards) in the 78th
minute. ``This win was for 150 million Nigerians.''
	   At Lyon, substitute Ricardo Pelaez scored in the 51st minute and
Luis Hernandez in the 75th and 84th minutes in a 3-1 win for the
Mexicans, ending South Korea's hopes for its first-ever World Cup
victory in its fifth appearance in the tournament.
	   ``Basically, we didn't lose our cool,'' Hernandez said. ``We
paid attention and we didn't become desperate.''
	   The Koreans played the last 60 minutes with 10 men after Ha
Seok-ju, who two minutes earlier had given his team a 1-0 lead, was
given a red card for a late tackle-from-behind that upended Jesus
Ramirez.
	   Ha's ejection came in the ninth game of the tournament, making
the the midfielder the first victim of the FIFA dictate to crack
down on foul tackles from behind.
	   ``The call was a very harsh one,'' Korean coach Cha Bum-kun
said. ``I doubt it was a veritable red card,'' Maybe a yellow. Of
course I told the players about the new FIFA rule about tackling
from behind. I was quite disgusted when Ha went into the tackle. He
should've been calmer in that situation.''
	   It was Mexico's first win in nine World Cup games in Europe, and
it served as a small vindication after lackluster results leading
up to the tournament.
	   ``We unloaded all that energy that had built up,'' Hernandez
said of the pressure back home. ``We got a great win.''
	   Late Saturday, neighboring rivals Belgium and the Netherlands
played to a 0-0 draw at Saint-Denis, a game marred by Patrick
Kluivert's expulsion for elbowing Lorenzo Staelens in the chest in
the second half. Even so, 26 goals had been scored through the
tournament's first 10 matches _ an average of 2.6 per game and
above the average from recent World Cup first rounds.
	   On Sunday, it's Jamaica-Croatia at Lens, Yugoslavia-Iran at
Saint-Etienne and Argentina-Japan at Toulouse.
	   Spain, often cited as a contender for the title, controlled the
game against Nigeria for more than 70 minutes before its
goalkeeper, Andoni Zubizarreta, inadvertently knocked in Garbal
Lawal's cross at the near post to tie the game 2-2 in the 73rd.
	   ``We had the match in our grasp, but, well, now we have to
continue fighting,'' Spanish coach Javier Clemente said. ``We
could've won 3-1, but it got away from us. We just got careless.
... That third goal was just sensational.''
	   Spain's defeat was just its second in 35 games and marked a
triumphant return for coach Bora Milutinovic, who coached the U.S.
in the 1994 tournament, Costa Rica in 1990, and Mexico in 1996. He
was hired by Nigeria after being fired following last year's
qualifying campaign in a second stint with the Mexicans.
	   Early in the second half, Raul Gonzalez scored one of the most
picturesque goals of the tournament, catching Fernando Hierro's
pass on his outstretched leg at full stride to give Spain a 2-1
lead.
	   Hierro's 25-meter (yard) free kick in the first half was the
first goal of the game, but Mutiu Adepoju answered for the Super
Eagles.
	   All three matches Saturday were preceded by a moment of silence
for Fernand Sastre, the French World Cup organizing committee
co-president. Sastre, 74, who was chiefly responsible for turning
France's hopes of staging the tournament into reality, died early
Saturday of lung cancer.
	   The exciting soccer _ after four days of competition, scoring is
prevalent and rowdy fans and dirty play aren't _ does have its
downside: It makes fans who are victims of a ticket scams even more
incensed that they're missing out on the action.
	   French authorities said for the first time Saturday that they
were ready to investigate the growing international ticket scandal.
	   FIFA and the World Cup organizing committee have earlier pledged
to file lawsuits against companies or individuals found to have
taken part in the scams, which have left thousands of fans without
tickets.
	   The problem is now exploding in France. Fans who dealt with
unlicensed brokers and tour operators are arriving without tickets
they thought would be waiting for them. It's estimated that some
12,000 Japanese fans are ticketless, although most have stayed
home.
	   Similar, although smaller, cases have been reported in Britain,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Brazil.

	   JAEN, Spain (AP) _ Police arrested four people, including
20-year-old Colombian twins and a Frenchman, in connection with a
shooting at a highway checkpoint that killed one Civil Guard and
injured another, authorities said.
	   Manuel Saenz Santiago, 37, approached a rented car at about 4
a.m. (0200GMT) near the southern Spanish city of Jaen to check for
identification papers, a police spokesman said.
	   He was fatally shot and his partner seriously wounded before the
car occupied by four people sped off, Jose Manuel Fernandez said.
	   A major search operation located the abandoned vehicle about
midday.
	   The 20-year-old twins Sandra Milena Robles and Paula Robles
Aranda and a Spaniard, Francisco Javier Fernandez Romero, 40, were
found walking along a mountain road further north.
	   The Frenchman, Christophe Daniel Albert Bacquet, 30, was
arrested several hours later along the same road.
	   Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said later Saturday that the
group was involved in drug trafficking.
	   The Spanish Civil Guard was created in the 19th century to
patrol Spain's vast countryside, but now also serves as national
highway police, coast guard, and has a special anti-terrorist unit.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A hand grenade exploded in a crowded market
Saturday, killing six people and wounding 18, when a vendor pulled
the pin while giving change.
	   The grenade was fastened to the belt of Hassan Azar, a dealer in
the popular locally grown ``qat'' narcotic, said security officials
speaking on condition of anonymity. Azar was among the dead.
	   The explosion occurred in al-Houta, about 35 kilometers (22
miles), north of the southern city of Aden.
	   The Interior Ministry said a committee would investigate the
incident.
	   Weapons are common in Yemen, which suffered a short civil war in
1994 and where the government has yet to assert its authority over
much of the country.

Haile Gebrselassie sets world record on 5,000 meters

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia set a
new world record in the 5,000 meters running Saturday night in
Helsinki. He clocked 12 minutes, 39.36 seconds for his 14th world
record after two blistering final laps.
	   Daniel Komen of Kenya set the previous record of 12:39.74 last
year.
	   Only ten days earlier, Gebrselassie set a new record in the
10,000 meters in Hengelo, Netherlands, with 26:22.75 in his
previous race. He beat Kenyan Paul Tergat's time of 26:27.85.
	   ``I went home after that to do a little bit of light training
... and recovered quickly,'' Gebrselassie said.
	   ``I am not a hundred percent satisfied with this run, but it was
OK. The beginning was a bit slow, and after that I tried to do
better.''
	   Gebrselassie, and his agent, Jos Hermens of Belgium, had hoped
for cool temperatures and windless weather. It was a few degrees
chillier than they wanted, but a bigger problem was Gebrselassie's
three pacesetters.
	   Branko Zorko of Croatia could not go with the required
60.5-second laps until 2,000 meters. The 2:31-2:32 for the first
1,000 meters was not met, with Zorko leading in 2:33.91. Assefa
Mezegebu of Ethiopia took over, but the contribution of another
Ethiopian, Million Wolde, came to almost nothing.
	   The first 2,000 meters went in 5:05.6 compared with 5:02.4 in
Komen's record race, and Gebrselassie was four seconds off his
hoped-for pace at 3,000, clocking 7:38.9.
	   Gebrselassie had to go solo for the final 2,000 meters, but two
blistering final laps under 59 seconds got the record for the world
and Olympic champion.
	   In other events, Colin Jackson of Britain ran a 13.12 in the 110
meter high hurdles to share the year's best time with Allen Johnson
of the United States. American Mark Crear lost by 2/100 of a
second.
	   Ruslan Mastchenko, 27, of Russia set a new best for the year in
the mens' 400 meter hurdles with 48.06 seconds.
	   Marion Jones of the United States prevailed in the women's 100
meters, winning in 10.86 _ half a second ahead of second-placed
Beverly Grant of Jamaica. Mark Richardson of Britain took the men's
400 meters in 44.52 seconds.
	   In front of 21,000 spectators in Helsinki's Olympic Stadium,
Finland's new javelin star Aki Parviainen, 23, held off the elite
with a throw of 87.91 meters (96.17 yards) in his fourth attempt,
surpassing Steve Backley of Britain, who had a result of 87.48
(95.70 yards).
	   World champion Marius Corbett was injured in his first try.

Steel plant in southern Spain likely source of rise in radiation levels in Europe negligence and a cover-up sted negligent cover-up 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A steel mill in the southern Spanish city
of Algeciras was the probably source of a rise in radiation levels
detected in France, Switzerland and Italy in early June, a
spokeswoman for the national nuclear authorities said Saturday.
	   Radioactive scrap metal of unknown origin was melted down at the
Acerinox plant probably around the end of May, Spanish Nuclear
Security Council spokeswoman Fatima Rojas said.
	   The evidence suggests that the incident was linked with detected
increases of Cesium 137 in the atmosphere at the beginning of the
month primarily in France but also in Switzerland and Italy, Rojas
said.
	   According to the Council, the radioactive cloud moving north
from southern Spain went unnoticed because it was well below
``worrying'' levels.
	   It was not until Acerinox reported radiation in the ashes of its
foundry on June 9, that the connection was made between the
privately-owned Spanish steel mill and the growing concern in
Europe over the unexplained cloud, Rojas said.
	   The affected area of the plant has been sealed off and workers
called for a medical evaluation due Monday.
	   The Italian government has accused Spain of failing to inform it
about the leak. Environment Minister Edo Ronchi said the government
learnt the news following inquiries to the French.
	   ``We are not responsible for the lack of details about the
matter'' he said, responding to environmentalists' criticism in
Italy that the government held back information.
	   The Spanish-branch of the international environmental
organization Greenpeace on Saturday accused the nuclear authorities
of both negligence and a cover-up.
	   ``It is difficult to believe that none of the Council of Nuclear
Security's centers detected the Cesium 137 (on its way across
Spain)'' Greenpeace spokesman Carlos Bravo said.

France in its World Cup debut, South Africa got more bad news
Saturday _ Benni McCarthy may miss this week's crucial match
against Denmark.
	   McCarthy, the 20-year-old striker who plays for Ajax Amsterdam,
went down with an injured left ankle late in Friday's match in
Marseille and was carried off the field on a stretcher. He was
diagnosed with damaged ligaments and team officials said he was
unlikely to play Thursday in Toulouse against the Danes.
	   But McCarthy later walked through Vichy's streets, his ankle
wrapped but causing him no apparent problem. He said the ankle
improved considerably on Saturday.
	   ``I don't want to miss out,'' he said of the match against
Denmark.
	   South Africa sits at the bottom of the Group C standings after
its loss, with France on top ahead of Denmark, which defeated Saudi
Arabia 1-0 on Friday.
	   For South Africa, its first appearance in soccer's global
showcase after being banned for 28 years because of apartheid went
terribly awry. France controlled the match after the first 20
minutes, dominating possession by being quicker and stronger on the
ball.
	   The loss disappointed the hundreds of South African fans in
Marseilles, including Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who sat with
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and World Cup organizing
committee chairman Michel Platini.
	   ``They tried very well, but I think they will understand the
mistakes they have made,'' said Mbeki, who visited the dressing
room after the match to console the players.
	   President Nelson Mandela, back in South Africa, phoned captain
Lucas Radebe on Saturday to tell the players to remain positive.
	   ``He said he wanted the team to know that he was still behind
them and had all the confidence in them,'' Radebe said. ``He wanted
the team to keep the flag flying high.''
	   Soccer is the most popular sport among South Africa's black
majority, and some criticism of coach Philippe Troussier followed
Friday's loss.
	   The black nationalist Pan Africanist Congress, a small political
party, called for the immediate dismissal of Troussier, who is a
white Frenchman, and for former coach Jomo Sono or assistant coach
Trott Moloto to take over. Both are black and South African.
	   Others accepted Troussier's assessment that France was a
favorite to win the tournament, and that South Africa never
expected to win. Now, he said, the team must focus on beating
Denmark and Saudi Arabia in order to advance.
	   ``We are right where we thought we would be,'' he said.

Leader of coca leaf farmers and congressman at war with the government 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER McFARREN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ A top leader of the coca leaf farmers
unions faces expulsion from Congress and charges of sedition for
urging armed resistance to a plan to pull Bolivia out of the
cocaine trafficking circuit.
	   Evo Morales has retaliated by dredging up old, unproved
accusations that President Hugo Banzer is involved in drug
trafficking activities.
	   Banzer's decision to take Bolivia out of the cocaine trafficking
circuit before his term ends in 2001 and his use of troops to help
destroy illegal coca leaf plantations have resulted in several
violent confrontations and eight deaths in the Chapare, the main
coca-growing region.
	   ``The police and military are trying to rob everything,''
Morales said Saturday. ``In the face of such delinquency, any
citizen would defend and organize themselves.''
	   The killing of two policemen in the last two weeks in the
Chapare, a lush tropical region in the heart of Bolivia where
Morales receives most of his support, has escalated the war of
words. The first policeman was killed hours after Morales called
for armed insurrection.
	   Last week Congress referred Morales to the ethics committee to
consider charges of sedition, which could result in his expulsion.
	   ``The Ministry of the Interior wants him out of congress so he
loses political immunity and can be quickly brought to trial,''
said Adolfo Anez, party whip of the ruling Nationalist Democratic
Action party (ADN).
	   Morales says that farmers are only defending themselves from the
loss of their livelihood. He has called for the withdrawal of
troops from the Chapare and for the forceful destruction of coca
plants to end.
	   ``The ADN does not have the moral or ethical right to throw me
out of congress,'' Morales said.
	   The president of the Bolivian Human Rights Assembly said the
charge of sedition _ loosely defined in the legal code as actions
that attack and undermine the public order _ does not apply to
Morales.
	   ``Morales, as a union leader of the coca farmers is representing
the people who have elected him democratically to claim the right
of coca producers,'' Waldo Albarracin said. He suggested the
sedition charge was retaliation for Morales' linking Banzer to drug
trafficking
	   Morales has referred to books that allege links between Banzer's
family and drug trafficking during Banzer's 1971-78 dictatorship.
	   Thousands of coca leaf farmers, meanwhile, have broken ranks
with Morales and have agreed to voluntarily eradicate coca plants
in exchange for the development of alternative products.
	   The Bolivian Government is paying farmers dlrs 2,500 per 1
hectare (2.47 acres) of old coca plants destroyed voluntarily by
farmers. New coca fields, now being destroyed with the backing of
army and police troops, are considered illegal and destroyed
without compensation.
	   Bolivia has agreed to destroy 7,000 hectares (17,297 acres) of
coca plants this year or face decertification by the United States
and the loss of U.S. aid.
	   The United States and the United Nations are investing millions
of dollars in the development of alternative crops such as hearts
of palm, pineapples, bananas and dairy products.
	   Coca leaf is grown in the Andean foothills of Bolivia and Peru.
Most of it is processed into cocaine.

World Cup: Kluivert expelled as Belgium holds Netherlands to 0-0 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Recasts, UPDATES with quotes
By RAF CASERT
Assocatiated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Again, those Belgians were too modest
and again, the great expectations of the Dutch were out of place.
The age-old rivals finished their World Cup opener with a goalless
draw only the Belgians could love.
	   Goalkeeper Filip De Wilde parried everything thrown at him and
when he was beaten, defender Eric Deflandre cleared two balls off
the line as the underdog Belgians survived against the hotly
favored Dutch.
	   It left the Dutch so frustrated, that striker Patrick Kluivert
took it out on defender Lorenzo Staelens with an intentional elbow
and was sent off in the 81st minute.
	   In their 120th meeting, the Dutch pounded the Belgian defense
almost throughout the match, playing in a different gear and
seemingly in a different class.
	   But the Red Devils stuck to age-old tactics, pulling back
everyone, surviving on 100 percent perspiration and very little
inspiration, and just watched that stadium clock run down the time.
	   ``I surely wanted more than this,'' said Dutch winger Marc
Overmars. ``We had great moves but you have to be able to get it
into the net.''
	   With Dennis Bergkamp on the substitute's bench until the 66th
minute with a tender hamstring, the Dutch got plenty of attacks,
but no lethal finishing.
	   When the Arsenal star got a clear shot on goal in the 73rd
minute, he froze up in the cold and volleyed over.
	   By the end, the continuous drone of Belgian tackling and
stubborn resistence turned the Dutch into a bunch of frustrated
players who had lost their inspiration along the way.
	   ``This looks real somber to us,'' said Overmars.
	   The best Dutch chance came two minutes from time when Philip
Cocu, latched on to a corner and beat De Wilde with a drive to the
near corner. Deflandre kicked it off the line.
	   Early on, the Dutch should have put the match away.
	   In the sixth minute, De Wilde failed to control a drive from
Ronald de Boer, pushed it into the path of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink,
but the Leeds striker missed an easy tap-in from a tight angle.
	   For the first hour, Overmars ruled the left wing and ran
Bertrand Crasson so ragged that Belgian coach Georges Leekens was
forced to replace them after just 21 minutes with Deflandre.
	   Seedorf had trouble getting past Vital Borkelmans on the right
and in the center Kluivert was a non-factor as he could not make
the Dutch fans forget the hamstring injury of Bergkamp.
	   Only in injury time, when speedy winger Danny Boffin switched to
the left, did they come close to Van der Sar, with midfielder Marc
Wilmots chesting a cross into the goalkeeper's arms and having
another shot in the goalmouth blocked.
	   But as soon as the second half started it was all Oranje again.
In the 50th minute, Hasselbaink shot from a tight angle forcing a
good save of De Wilde and the Anderlecht 'keeper was there again to
deny Clarence Seedorf from scoring in the rebound.
	   De Wilde was less brilliant five minutes later, late on a cross
but Kluivert's header was pushed off the line by Deflandre.
	   Belgium got a better piece of the action and a curling shot from
striker Luc Nilis just went over in the 58th minute. Five minutes
later Boffin tested Van der Sar with a half volley.
	   When carefully-built moves failed, the Dutch turned to central
defender Jaap Stam but his 28 meter drive in the 75th minute was
stopped by De Wilde at the second attempt.
	   Belgium beat the Netherlands 1-0 in the United States four years
ago, but twice lost against their northerly neighbors in qualifying
for France.
	   Lineups:
	   Belgium _ Filip De Wilde; Bertrand Crasson (Eric Deflandre,
21st), Lorenzo Staelens, Mike Verstraeten, Vital Borkelmans;
Philippe Clement, Franky van der Elst, Marc Wilmots, Danny Boffin;
Luc Nilis, Luis Oliveira (Lokonda Mpenza, 60th).
	   Netherlands _ Edwin van der Sar; Aron Winter, Jaap Stam, Frank
de Boer, Arthur Numan; Clarence Seedorf (Boudewijn Zenden, 66th),
Ronald de Boer (Wim Jonk, 80th), Phillip Cocu, Marc Overmars;
Patrick Kluivert, Jimmy Hasselbaink (Dennis Bergkamp, 66th).
	   Referee: Pierluigi Collina, Italy.

South Africa wins first Test against Ireland 37-13

	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ Stefan Terblanche ran in four
record breaking tries in his Test debut with the Springboks against
Ireland, sealing a shaky first-half team performance for a 37-13
win.
	   At one point Ireland tied the World Cup champions, stunning the
home crowd into silence.
	   ``It's encouraging to know that we can still win when playing
like that,'' South African coach Nick Mallett told reporters
afterwards.
	   Terblanche's four touchdowns were the most by any Springbok on
Test debut and tied two previous individual Springbok playing
records.
	   Mallett attributed the strong performance to Terblanche's
playing in the Super 12.
	   The last time the two countries played at Test level in Durban
in 1981, South Africa squeaked by with a 12-10 victory.
	   On Saturday, Ireland held the South African machine at bay until
well into the second period, as the forwards attacked with brutal
effectiveness.
	   Irish skipper Paddy Johns was penalized for late-charging rookie
Springbok fly half Gaffie du Toit at the opening kickoff.
	   The South Africans snatched the lead as Bok tighthead Adrian
Garvey drove through the back-pedaling Irish rear guard. Gary
Teichmann spun the ball to Terblanche, who crossed in the corner
for an easy try, converted by Du Toit.
	   Disorganization followed Du Toit's disappearance to the blood
bin for 12 minutes, and the Irish took full advantage to pull three
points back via the trusty boot of Eric Elwood.
	   Elwood's pinpoint up-and-under came down by the right-hand,
where Springbok full back Percy Montgomery failed to spot Justin
Marshall moving though. The wing jumped in to pinch the ball from
under his nose and fall over for a debut try.
	   Elwood added the goal points to set the alarm bells ringing in
the home camp.
	   Wood was yellow-carded for a right-hander to Teichmann as
tempers flared towards break. But Du Toit slotted a 39th minute
penalty to take his team into a fragile 13-10 lead.
	   After break, hard-running center Kevin Maggs broke through to
within several meters of the home line but elected to cut back
inside when an overlap was on to his right _ and the chance was
lost.
	   It was to prove a costly mistake. With 51 minutes played,
Terblanche went in for his second try of the night, opening the
floodgates.
	   South Africa lifted the pace and gaps started to appear in the
tiring Irish defense. Terblanche completed his hat-trick in the
56th minute with a powerful burst from the 22-meter line.
	   Eight minutes later, his exceptional upper body strength enabled
him to twist and break his way through three desperate tackles,
stretching the led to 30_13.
	   Mark Andrews came to life in the final quarter following the
surprise replacement of Johns with Gabriel Fulcher, and drove over
from a rolling maul close to the posts.

Seven Britons arrested in southern Spain on suspicion of drug trafficking 
</HEADLINE>

France defeats Argentina 35-18 in test match 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ With notorious superiority and
fast passing, the France national rugby union team defeated
Argentina 35-18 in the first of two test matches.
	   France scored five converted tries to Argentina's two tries, one
converted and two penalties at the match played before 20,000
spectators at Velez Sarsfield stadium in the capital.
	   The French pushed the locals into their own field for the first
12 minutes, and only Argentina's relentless defense kept them from
scoring.
	   When Argentina finally managed to cross midfield, its captain
Lisandro Arbizu scored two penalties to put them 6-0 ahead.
	   Bu then the French mounted their attack with swift running and
passing. Christophe Dominici and Marc Dal Masot scored after 28 and
40 minutes to give France a 14-6 halftime lead.
	   Argentina made three tactical changes for the second half. Play
was more open and even, but in the 45th Thomas Castagnede raced
away from the halfway line to score under the posts and convert the
try himself for a 21-6 lead.
	   A pushover try put France 28-6 ahead after 52 minutes, but then
Argentina finally managed to cross the French line with Jose Orengo
and Facundo Soler, reducing the breach to 28-18 with 10 minutes to
go.
	   In the final minutes, Marc Lievremont scored his fifth try, also
converted by Castaignede, to give France a 35-18 victory.
	   The two teams will meet again next Saturday at the same venue.

Spanish steel plant likely source of rise in radiation levels 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A steel mill in southern Spain was the
probably source of increased radiation levels detected in France,
Switzerland and Italy in early June, Spanish nuclear authorities
said Saturday.
	   Radioactive scrap metal of unknown origin was melted down at the
Acerinox plant in the city of Algeciras, probably around the end of
May, said Spanish Nuclear Security Council spokeswoman Fatima
Rojas.
	   The evidence suggests that the melting down of the scrap metal
was linked with detected increases of Cesium 137 in the atmosphere
at the beginning of the month, primarily in France but also in
Switzerland and Italy, Rojas said.
	   According to the council, a radioactive cloud moving north from
southern Spain went unnoticed because it was well below levels that
would have prompted concern.
	   It was not until Acerinox reported radiation in the ashes of its
foundry on June 9 that the connection was made between the
privately owned Spanish steel mill and the growing concern in
Europe over the unexplained cloud, Rojas said.
	   Part of the plant has been sealed off. Workers will receive
medical evaluations.
	   The Italian government has accused Spain of failing to make the
leak public. The Spanish-branch of the international environmental
organization Greenpeace on Saturday accused the nuclear authorities
of both negligence and a cover-up.

Aoki ties senior tour record with 16-under AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Isao Aoki shot a 6-under 66 and tied
a Senior U.S. PGA Tour scoring record Saturday in grabbing an
eight-stroke lead after the second round of the BellSouth Senior
Classic.
	   Aoki, who had 10 birdies for a 62 on Friday, started slowly with
eight straight pars. But he finished with four birdies and an eagle
for a 128 total, tying the record of 16-under par set by Hale Irwin
last year in the Vantage Championship.
	   Larry Nelson, who designed the Springhouse Golf Club course,
shot a 68 and was at 136 with Irwin (70) and John Jacobs (71). Gil
Morgan (73) and Tom Jenkins (71) were at 137.
	   In the tournament's four years, no one had led by more than one
stroke after two rounds.
	   Swirling wind Saturday kept players guessing from tee to green.
With the course drying, tournament officials didn't allow players
to ``lift, clean and place'' as they had Friday.
	   The changes didn't bother Aoki, who started with a two-stroke
lead over Morgan and quickly led by three as Morgan bogeyed the
second hole.
	   On No. 9, Aoki finally got his putter working for his first
birdie. He set up his eagle on the par-5 No. 10 with a 4-wood to
two feet (0.61 meters), giving him a five-stroke lead as Nelson
bogeyed No. 11.
	   Aoki sank an 18-footer (5.49-meter shot) on No. 12, had a
2-footer (0.61-meter shot) on the 13th and saved par on the 14th
with a 25-footer (7.62 meter shot). His round would have been even
lower had he not missed an eagle chance by inches (centimeters) on
12 and birdie putts on 15 and 16.
	   As Aoki pulled away from the field, Morgan had two bogeys and a
double bogey and Irwin struggled with two bogeys and 12 pars.

World Cup: Kluivert expelled Belgium as holds Netherlands to 0-0 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Kluivert, Leekens, Hiddink quotes
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Again, those Belgians were too modest
and again, the great expectations of the Dutch were out of place.
The age-old rivals finished their World Cup opener with a goalless
draw only the Belgians could love.
	   Belgian goalie Filip De Wilde parried everything thrown at him
and when he was beaten, defender Eric Deflandre cleared two balls
off the line as the underdog Belgians performed beyond their dreams
and survived against the hotly favored Dutch.
	   It left the Dutch so frustrated, that striker Patrick Kluivert
took it out on defender Lorenzo Staelens, threatening him with a
wagging finger before planting his elbow in his chest. Referee
Pierluigi Collina sent him off in the 81th minute.
	   ``It was a stupid thing to do,'' Kluivert said.
	   In their 120th meeting, the Dutch pounded the Belgian defense
almost throughout the match, playing in a different gear and
seemingly in a different class.
	   But the Red Devils stuck to age-old tactics, pulling back
everyone, surviving on 100 percent perspiration and very little
inspiration, and just watched that stadium clock run down the time.
	   ``I surely wanted more than this,'' said Dutch winger Marc
Overmars. ``We had great moves but you have to be able to get it
into the net.''
	   With Dennis Bergkamp on the substitute's bench until the 66th
minute with a tender hamstring, the Dutch got plenty of attacks,
but no lethal finishing.
	   When the Arsenal star got a clear shot on goal in the 73rd
minute, he froze up in the cold and volleyed over.
	   By the end, the continuous drone of Belgian tackling and
stubborn resistence turned the Dutch into a bunch of frustrated
players who had lost their inspiration along the way.
	   ``This looks real somber to us,'' said Overmars.
	   Belgian coach Georges Leekens maintains his team in the underdog
role, just like he had down ahead of the Dutch game.
	   ``Now, don't think that we really are bigger than we are,'' he
said, stressing the second game against Mexico would be the vital
match. Mexico beat South Korea 3-1 in the first Group E game
earlier Saturday.
	   Belgium had already beaten the favored Dutch 1-0 at the World
Cup four years ago. But it badly lost two qualifying games against
them ahead of the finals and looked like a similar thrashing was
coming early on.
	   In the sixth minute, De Wilde failed to control a drive from
Ronald de Boer, pushed it into the path of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink,
but the Leeds striker missed an easy tap-in from a tight angle.
	   The Dutch had to wait until two minutes from time to get another
such opportunity when Philip Cocu, latched on to a corner and beat
De Wilde with a drive to the near corner. Deflandre kicked it off
the line.
	   ``If you play against such a well organized team in defense, you
just have to score when you get those chances,'' said Dutch coach
Guus Hiddink.
	   ``They always kept seven men behind the ball,'' complained Dutch
captain Frank de Boer.
	   In the 50th minute, Hasselbaink shot from a tight angle forcing
a good save of De Wilde and the Anderlecht 'keeper was there again
to deny Seedorf from scoring in the rebound.
	   De Wilde was less brilliant five minutes later when he was late
on a cross but Kluivert's header was pushed off the line by
Deflandre.
	   On the hour mark, Belgium started to get a better piece of the
action and a curling shot from striker Luc Nilis just went over.
Five minutes later Danny Boffin tested Van der Sar with a half
volley.
	   When carefully-built actions failed, the Dutch turned to central
defender Jaap Stam but his 28 meter drive in the 75th minute was
stopped by De Wilde at the second attempt.
	   The Dutch have been hotly tipped as the team that could surprise
many at the World Cup and the result disappointed many, but not
Hiddink.
	   ``It's not a big blow for us. We knew Belgium was improving,''
he said.
	   Lineups:
	   Belgium _ Filip De Wilde; Bertrand Crasson (Eric Deflandre,
21st), Lorenzo Staelens, Mike Verstraeten, Vital Borkelmans;
Philippe Clement, Franky van der Elst, Marc Wilmots, Danny Boffin;
Luc Nilis, Luis Oliveira (Lokonda Mpenza, 60th).
	   Netherlands _ Edwin van der Sar; Aron Winter, Jaap Stam, Frank
de Boer, Arthur Numan; Clarence Seedorf (Boudewijn Zenden, 66th),
Ronald de Boer (Wim Jonk, 80th), Phillip Cocu, Marc Overmars;
Patrick Kluivert, Jimmy Hasselbaink (Dennis Bergkamp, 66th).
	   Referee: Pierluigi Collina, Italy.

Chief U.N. weapons inspector talks with Iraqi officials 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS no details from second Butler-Aziz meeting graf 6
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq promised Saturday to provide visiting
chief United Nations arms inspector Richard Butler with evidence
that it has complied with a U.N. weapons ban.
	   Neither Butler nor Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz commented
publicly after a first round of talks Saturday, but officials on
the delegations suggested that progress had been made.
	   Iraqi weapons officials said a team of U.N. arms monitors had
unearthed enough weapons parts to verify Iraq's claims that it
destroyed and buried its biological and chemical missile warheads.
	   The pieces were gathered by a team of 27 experts under German
Jean Jan at al-Nibai, 45 kilometers (28 miles) north of the capital
Baghdad, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The parts are sufficient to reconstruct 48 warheads Iraq
unilaterally scrapped in 1991, they said.
	   U.N. officials in Baghdad confirmed that parts were recovered,
but said they required analysis.
	   Butler, who arrived Thursday in Baghdad accompanied by 18 U.N.
arms experts, met Aziz later Saturday after lower-level technical
talks. No details were released about their second session.

Top French yachtsman Eric Tabarly lost off Welsh coast 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: Updates throughout with search abandoned.
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ French sports hero Eric Tabarly, the country's
best-known yachtsman, was lost off Wales Saturday after reportedly
falling off his boat during the night.
	   After a day-long search, British coastguards, Royal Air Force
helicopters and a French search and rescue aircraft gave up the
hunt for the 66-year-old yachtsman at nightfall.
	   '' We have liaised throughout with the French authorities, and
vessels passing through the area are being requested to maintain a
sharp lookout for any sign of Mr. Tabarly. Our deepest sympathies
go out to his family at this time, '' said Chris Raley deputy
district controller for Milford Haven Coastguard in southwest
Wales.
	   Tabarly, one of the world's top solo sailors, was reported
missing 55 kms (35 miles) south-southeast of Milford Haven en route
to Northern Ireland. It was not clear how he fell overboard, at
about midnight Friday, but he apparently was not wearing a
lifejacket.
	   The four crew members on the yacht had no communications
equipment, and speak little or no English. Rescuers were not
alerted until seven hours after Tabarly disappeared. The crew, who
reportedly had little experience at sea, fired a flare to attract a
passing boat. They also reportedly threw a lifebuoy in his
direction, but did not know whether the skipper was able to catch
it.
	   Coastguards at Milford Haven first gave up their search 12 hours
after he fell overboard, but later re-started when the French navy
sent a search and rescue aircraft.
	   Raley said they carried out numerous searches within the 486
square mile (1,260 square km) area and ``we had considerable
assistance from other merchant shipping in the area.''
	   Tabarly, born July 24, 1931 in Nantes, became a naval officer in
1959.
	   He won several races with boats named Pen Duick, a Breton phrase
meaning ``blackheaded tomtit.''
	   Among his victories were a transatlantic solo race from Plymouth
to Newport, 5,390 kms in 27 days in 1964; the Morgan Cup in 1967,
the Gotland Round, Channel Race and the Fasnet, the race from
Plymouth to La Rochelle, all in 1967. He won a transpacific solo
race in the Pen Duick V in 39 days in 1969, and won the Los
Angeles-Tahiti race in 1972. Aboard the Pen Duick VI he won the
Plymouth-Newport race in 23 days and 20 hours in 1976.
	   He was awarded the Legion of Honor, was a member of the Maritime
National Order of Merit, and wrote several books including ``Solo
Victory'' in 1964 and ``Pen Duick'' in 1990.

President meets with labor leaders after four-day protest UPDATES with cancellation of meeting with president

Eds: UPDATES with union meeting to plan next week's actions;
By LEO MORPURGO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Labor union leaders planned to meet
Saturday night to decide whether to continue four days of protests
that have shut down most of the country's businesses and schools.
	   President Jules Wijdenbosch had offered to meet Saturday with
union representatives, but the labor leaders, upset by the
cancellation of a meeting with the president on Friday, decided
instead to discuss their next move among themselves. Last week's
protests could continue Monday.
	   As labor unions and other groups mounted another wave of work
stoppages last week, some business groups also turned against the
president and asked Wijdenbosch to resign.
	   Protests began Tuesday and were initially planned to last one
day. Instead, they gained steam and were extended through the week,
as more organizations joined in demonstrations against the
government.
	   Labor unions are opposing government privatization plans and
also demanding better pay as the country is wracked by rapidly
rising inflation. Business groups are unhappy with the president's
inability to quell the labor disturbances and fix the nation's
economy.
	   Suriname, a former Dutch colony located on the northeast corner
of South America, is the Western Hemisphere's poorest country after
Haiti. Because of its economic problems, the Central Bank was
forced to prop up the country's guilder in September.
	   On Wednesday, Wijdenbosch said the government would not give in
to the demands of the workers. But in a televised address to the
nation on Thursday night, with the protests growing, he struck a
more conciliatory note, saying ``the government will seriously
consider the ideas and opinions of all Surinamese.''
	   Opposition political leader Winston Jessurun dismissed the
president's statements as an attempt to stall for time and split
the opposition to his government.

	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Isao Aoki shot a 6-under 66 and tied
a Senior U.S. PGA Tour scoring record Saturday in grabbing an
eight-stroke lead after the second round of the BellSouth Senior
Classic.
	   Aoki, who had 10 birdies for a 62 on Friday, started slowly with
eight straight pars. But he finished with four birdies and an eagle
for a 128 total, tying the record of 16-under par set by Hale Irwin
last year in the Vantage Championship.
	   Larry Nelson, who designed the Springhouse Golf Club course,
shot a 68 and was at 136 with Irwin (70) and John Jacobs (71). Gil
Morgan (73) and Tom Jenkins (71) were at 137.
	   In the tournament's four years, no one had led by more than one
stroke after two rounds.
	   Swirling wind Saturday kept players guessing from tee to green.
With the course drying, tournament officials didn't allow players
to ``lift, clean and place'' as they had Friday.
	   The changes didn't bother Aoki, who started with a two-stroke
lead over Morgan and quickly led by three as Morgan bogeyed the
second hole.
	   On No. 9, Aoki finally got his putter working for his first
birdie. He set up his eagle on the par-5 No. 10 with a 4-wood to
two feet (0.61 meters), giving him a five-stroke lead as Nelson
bogeyed No. 11.
	   Aoki sank an 18-footer (5.49-meter shot) on No. 12, had a
2-footer (0.61-meter shot) on the 13th and saved par on the 14th
with a 25-footer (7.62 meter shot). His round would have been even
lower had he not missed an eagle chance by inches (centimeters) on
12 and birdie putts on 15 and 16.
	   As Aoki pulled away from the field, Morgan had two bogeys and a
double bogey and Irwin struggled with two bogeys and 12 pars.

	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) _ Foreigners fleeing Guinea-Bissau in
overcrowded navy and merchant ships arrived Saturday in neighboring
Senegal with frightening tales of bombardments and street fighting
between government and rebel troops.
	   Fifty-eight expatriates _ Brazilians, Argentines and Chinese and
one U.S. citizen _ were aboard a small Chinese vessel, the fourth
boat to drop anchor in Senegal's capital Dakar since the exodus
began from the former Portuguese colony in West Africa.
	   Earlier boats were filled with Portuguese, Canadians, French,
Germans, Senegalese and U.S. nationals..
	   Evacuees arriving after the grueling 24-hour journey without
food or water on the decks of cargo ships to Dakar said those left
behind in Bissau were without water or electricity or
communications. The city's only water tower was destroyed in the
fighting.
	   The ships, most without food and water supplies, were met by
embassy officials and family members, some weeping with relief and
others sobbing in frustration at failing to see their loved ones on
board.
	   Fighting has raged in Guinea-Bissau's capital of Bissau since
last Sunday, when government troops supported by soldiers from
neighboring Senegal and Republic of Guinea pinned an unknown number
of renegade soldiers in a military garrison.
	   Judy Byers, a missionary from Apple Valley, California, who
arrived on the Chinese ship, told of a steady rain of mortar shells
and small arms fire in her neighborhood in a Bissau suburb after
the fighting began.
	   Most civilians in the area had fled, said Byers, who works for
the Christian group Youth with a Mission.
	   Some of the heaviest fighting occurred near the U.S. embassy in
Bissau, which has been left with a skeleton staff, several of the
evacuees said.
	   Communications with much of Bissau have been cut due to the
fighting and it was unclear which side had gained the upper hand in
the street battles.
	   An Argentine medical doctor, Abel Vallejos, described how he,
his wife and two children had been turned away from a Portuguese
cargo ship in Bissau as mortar shells landed in the water around
the boat.
	   Eventually, a small Chinese skiff docked and took them to an
awaiting merchant vessel.
	   ``The ship is a miracle,'' Vallejos said. ``There were more than
40 booms in the water all around us, and the booms were getting
louder.''
	   Mark Stevens, U.S. charge d'affaires in Dakar, said he knew of
only five Americans remaining in Guinea-Bissau _ U.S. ambassador
Peggy Blackford and four other State Department employees who were
holed up inside the embassy in the capital of Bissau.
	   Meanwhile, the White House on Saturday released a statement that
a ``standby evacuation force'' of U.S. military planes was sent to
Dakar on Wednesday to be prepared to evacuate American private
citizens and government employees.
	   ``Although U.S. forces are equipped for combat, this action is
being taken solely for the purpose of protecting American citizens
and property,'' Clinton wrote. ``United States forces will redeploy
as soon as it is determined that the evacuation is complete.''
	   The White House released the letter Saturday from Portland,
Oregon, where Clinton delivered the commencement speech at Portland
State University.
	   Canadian diplomats said of the 23 Canadians registered in
Guinea-Bissau, two families were on the first boat to arrive in
Dakar on Friday night and more were expected on Saturday.
	   Brazilian consul Ronald Small said of the 150 Brazilians
registered in Guinea-Bissau, about 50 were known to have left the
country by Friday evening.
	   A Sierra Leonean woman, Margaret Horton, who arrived in Dakar in
a Senegalese navy ship late Friday, told of being separated from
her husband, a Christian missionary, while trying to escape from
their church in Bissau under heavy shelling last Sunday.
	   ``I have not seen my husband since,'' she said. ``I will never
return. It was like seeing your death. Like facing a firing
squad.''

A Package of Caribbean News Briefs SURINAME: Labor union leaders consider extending protests 
</HEADLINE>

	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Labor union leaders planned to meet
Saturday night to decide whether to continue four days of protests
that have shut down most of the country's businesses and schools.
	   President Jules Wijdenbosch had offered to meet Saturday with
union representatives, but the labor leaders, upset by the

as more organizations joined in demonstrations against the
government.
 &UR; BARBADOS: Horse trainer knighted
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Race horse trainer Michael Stoute of
Barbados was awarded Knight Bachelor honors for his contributions
to sports tourism and his efforts as a goodwill ambassador for his
Caribbean island.
	   Stoute, one of England's most successful trainers, was listed
among those to be knighted as the traditional honors list was
published as part of the official celebration of the Queen's
birthday on Saturday.
	   ``I feel very honored and very thrilled,'' said Stoute, who now
lives and trains horses in England. ``It's a lovely surprise.''
	   Four other Barbados residents were also honored on the Queen's
Birthday.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Canadian ambassador apologizes for Cuba comments
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Canada's ambassador expressed regret Friday for
saying the death of anti-Castro leader Jorge Mas Canosa could help
prompt America to ease its Cuban trade embargo.
	   A Cuban exile group said it was outraged by Raymond Chretien's
words Thursday.
	   ``This is a diplomat? To welcome the death of another human
being, a citizen of the country in which you are based? It just
betrays the utter moral bankruptcy of Canada's embracing of Fidel
Castro,'' said Alberto Hernandez, chairman of the Cuban American
National Foundation.
	   Chretien had told reporters in Washington that Mas' death in
November _ along with increased tourism and Pope John Paul II's
recent visit to Cuba _ will soon give the United States an
opportunity to consider easing sanctions against Cuba. Canada
allows trade to Cuba.
	   He later said he meant no disrespect.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Man arrested after disturbance on flight from
Bahamas
	   FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (AP) _ A passenger on a commercial
flight from Freeport, Bahamas to Fort Lauderdale created a ruckus,
head-butting a flight attendant and biting another passenger,
authorities said.
	   David Christopher Kreyer, 28, of Warwick, Rhode Island, was
taken into custody Friday by sheriff's deputies and U.S. marshals.
He was charged with assault and interfering with a flight.
	   Officials said they don't know what triggered Kreyer's outburst
on the Laker Airways flight Friday.
	   He attacked flight attendant Kristy Lynn Scott after she asked
if he was wearing a seat belt, authorities said.
	   He jumped up, grabbed her arms, pushed her and attempted to grab
her by the throat, authorities said. Scott's cheek was fractured
and needed stitches, which were provided at the airport,
authorities said.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ For Mexico, Saturday was a day of forgiveness
_ and a few drunken scuffles, especially along the capital's main
thoroughfare where some 40 people were treated for cuts and
bruises.
	   Police acted quickly to break up at least three fistfights. Some
of the revelers hurled soft drink bottles and beer cans at each
other. At least a dozen people were arrested.
	   Around 40 people were injured, Aztec Television reported. Red
Cross duty officer Daniel Castanon said he didn't have a precise
number but that ``several dozen were given first aid at the
scene.''
	   After ridiculing their national soccer team as it lost game
after game in preparation for the World Cup _ even dubbing it the
``Tritanic'' as a play on the tri-color uniforms it wears _ fans
were jubilant after Mexico's 3-1 win over South Korea on Saturday.
	   ``It looks like the Tritanic didn't sink after all,'' said Oscar
Espindola, 29, dancing in the street with his wife, Rosalva. ``I'm
so happy!''
	   Thousands of people ran laps around the Angel of Independence, a
major Mexico City monument, lying down on the ground to make the
wave and spraying one another with foam and with red, green and
white spray paint. ``Mexico! Mexico!'' they screamed.
	   Rodrigo Gonzalez, 17, squeezed his soaking T-shirt. ``They
bathed me in beer!'' he yelled.
	   ``Even if it seemed impossible, we're going to win,'' he said.
	   He conceded that he had been drinking rum, tequila and beer _
and a lot of each. ``We're sucking them down for the victory,'' he
said.
	   Gerardo Vela, 42, stood still as three teen-agers painted his
bald head in red, white and green. ``What can I do? They painted me
up,'' he said. ``The people are very happy. You have to let them do
what they want.''
	   He raised his arms and hooted, then joined the crowd running
around the monument.
	   But according to three young men, the most enthusiastic fan
around was their bulldog Baxter. His fur was painted in the
national colors, and he was wrapped in a Mexican flag.
	   ``He's so happy,'' said Gilberto Gutierrez Vazquez, 17.
	   When a reporter pointed out that the dog actually looked a bit
sullen, Gilberto waved away that possibility.
	   ``He's angry because they sprayed him with foam,'' he said.
``But believe me, he'll be celebrating again in a minute.''

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Contestants sniffed, scratched, barked
and wagged their tails in the World Dog Show in the Finnish
capital,
	   Dog owners from 44 countries entered 15,600 canines in
competitions ranging from miniature schnauzers, Great Danes and
Rottweilers, to the less common East Siberian laikas, Peruvian
hairless dogs and the Thai ridgeback.
	   The four-day competition, which ends Sunday, were held in 60
rings in tents and the Helsinki Fair Center, a hall with 36,000
square meters (43,200 sq. yards) of floor space.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The general director of the Los Angeles Opera
will be awarded with the Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the
British Empire, an honor given by Queen Elizabeth.
	   Peter W. Hemmings, 64, has held his post with the Los Angeles
Opera since it debuted in 1986. Previously, he was managing
director of the London Symphony Orchestra, general manager of the
Australian Opera and general administrator of the Scottish Opera.
	   He will be given the award, also known as an OBE, later this
year ``for service to opera overseas.'' Hemmings was among hundreds
of people included in Queen Elizabeth's birthday honors list
announced Saturday. He will receive the award later this year.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ROME (AP) _ Sophia Loren and director Michelangelo Antonioni are
planning a movie together.
	   ``It's an extraordinary role written especially for me,'' the
Italian actress told the ANSA news agency.
	   Ms. Loren said the project, her first with Antonioni, has a
working title of ``Verna.'' Further details were unavailable.
	   The 85-year-old Antonioni, who directed ``Blow Up,'' has been
hampered by the effects of a stroke in recent years. He last
directed a movie in 1994, and won a lifetime achievement Oscar in
1995.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Margaret Thatcher has authorized a biography of
herself to be published only after her death.
	   The 72-year-old former prime minister will give Charles Moore,
editor of the Daily Telegraph, access to her personal and political
papers.
	   The biography is expected to be published in two or three
volumes by Penguin Press.
	   Mrs. Thatcher was Britain's first female prime minister, serving
from 1979 to 1990. Her autobiography, ``The Path to Power,'' came
out in 1995.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Three days after they met in a hotel lobby,
Larry Tuma and Adriana Pallares got married.
	   They weren't alone.
	   Tuma and Pallares were among 1,500 couples _ many who met just
recently _ married in Madison Square Garden on Saturday by the Rev.
Sun Myung Moon, leader of the Unification Church.
	   The mass wedding was part of a larger ceremony to bless married
couples of all faiths around the world. Moon performed a similar
ceremony for 28,000 couples last November in Washington.
	   Like others, Tuma, 40, and Pallares, 35, were paired together by
Moon after he examined their photographs.
	   Wearing a tall crown and white robe decorated with gold, Moon
said the vows in Korean. A translation was not immediately
available.
	   Many couples had no idea what Moon said, but dutifully replied
``I do,'' in unison when prompted by the English-speaking master of
ceremonies. A translation later said Moon asked if they would
create an ideal family.
	   The majority of the newlyweds were members of Moon's church, an
institution some critics perceive as a cult. About 20 people
protested outside the Garden.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO will send fighters, helicopters
and reconnaissance aircraft into the air Monday over Albania and
Macedonia in a show of force against Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic. The exercise is aimed at pressuring Milosevic into
backing off from his armed campaign against ethnic Albanians in the
neighboring southern Serbian province of Kosovo, scene of violent
clashes that have killed more than 300 ethnic Albanians and Serbs
in recent months. The exercises will probably come before Russian
President Boris Yeltsin has had a chance to talk to Milosevic, who
is in Moscow on Monday for talks with his long-time allies. The
Russians, who oppose direct action against Yugoslavia, feel not all
diplomatic means have been exhausted. (NATO-KOSOVO)
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Government troops in Guinea-Bissau
claimed Saturday to have ousted rebels from a military garrison in
the capital where they had been holed up since launching a coup
attempt a week ago, according to a report. A statement read on the
West African country's state-run radio station said there were
``serious human and material losses'' on the rebel side in the
former Portuguese colony, according to the Portuguese news agency
Lusa. The report quoted an unidentified military source as saying
that rebels were engaged in hand-to-hand combat with Senegalese
troops deployed last week to support government troops. Government
troops pinned most of the rebels forces in the military garrison in
a suburb of the capital shortly after the powergrab was launched
early last Sunday.
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ With stability in the Horn of Africa at
stake, five African leaders are moving to take charge of frantic
efforts to foster peace between feuding neighbors Ethiopia and
Eritrea. Since early May, tank and artillery battles have flared on
three fronts, and warplanes' bombs have killed civilians on both
sides of the disputed border. No skirmishes were reported Saturday.
It will be difficult to avert full-scale war unless a plan can be
found to allow both Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and
Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki to back down with honor. Eritrean
rebels, who fought a 30-year war to secede from Ethiopia, joined
Ethiopian rebels in a 17-year fight to oust Ethiopia's Marxist
government. In 1993, Eritreans voted for independence and Meles'
government let the region secede. (ERITREA-ETHIOPIA)
	   JASPER, Texas (AP) _ Civil rights leaders and politicians called
for an end to racial violence Saturday as hundreds of mourners
crowded into a sweltering, tiny church for the funeral of a black
man who police say was brutally killed by white supremacists.
``Turn a crucifixion into a resurrection,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson
said. He suggested erecting a memorial to James Byrd Jr. as ``a
place for blacks and whites to rally, a tomb that says choose
redemption over retaliation.'' But others called for a different
reaction to Byrd's killing. After the funeral, about 15
shotgun-toting black militants marched through this town of 8,000
people, some 250 kilometers (150 miles) northeast of Houston.
(US-DRAGGING DEATH)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq promised Saturday to provide visiting
chief United Nations arms inspector Richard Butler with evidence
that it has complied with a U.N. weapons ban. Neither Butler nor
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz commented publicly after a first
round of talks Saturday, but officials on the delegations suggested
that progress had been made. Iraqi weapons officials said a team of
U.N. arms monitors had unearthed enough weapons parts to verify
Iraq's claims that it destroyed and buried its biological and
chemical missile warheads. U.N. officials in Baghdad confirmed that
parts were recovered, but said they required analysis. (IRAQ-UN)

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's president and his son are
backing rival candidates in the largest town in Lebanon's eastern
sector in Sunday's municipal elections.
	   About 4,000 Lebanese soldiers, backed by armor, have been
deployed in the east's Bekaa Valley to ensure safe balloting in the
polls, the last in the four-stage municipal elections held over the
past four weeks.
	   Sunday's round is distinguished from earlier votes by the
absence of sectarian competition.
	   Whereas elections in Mount Lebanon, north Lebanon, Beirut and
south Lebanon tended to feature Muslim versus Christian races, in
eastern Lebanon ``it's Shiites against Shiites and Christians
against Christians,'' as it was put in the Christian newspaper
Nidaa al-Watan.
	   In Zahle, 37 kilometers (23 miles) east of Beirut, the election
has become a tussle within the president's own family.
	   President Elias Hrawi, his younger son Roy, and his nephew
Khalil Hrawi, a member of parliament, have endorsed a slate of
candidates for the 21-seat council in the family's hometown.
	   But George Hrawi, the president's elder son, is backing
legislator Elie Skaff _ a long-time rival with the elder Hrawi for
the leadership of Zahle's mostly Greek Catholic community.
	   George Hrawi, who shied away from politics until recently, says
he does not agree with his father's policies.
	   A fierce race is expected in the east's second biggest city,
Baalbek, where the two rival Shiite Muslim parties, Hezbollah and
Amal, are vying for control of the 21-seat municipal council.
	   The pro-Syrian Amal has joined forces with a coalition of
Syrian-backed leftist parties in a bid to defeat the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah.
	   The elections, the first municipal polls for 35 years, are
widely seen as bolstering democracy after the 1975-90 civil war.

Government claims to have ousted rebels from stronghold

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Hand-to-hand combat continues in the
capital, but Guinea-Bissau's army is claiming the upper hand
against renegade troops after ousting them from an important
military garrison.
	   A statement read Saturday on a state-run radio station in the
former Portuguese colony said rebels suffered ``serious human and
material losses'' during the siege, according to the Portuguese
news agency, Lusa. No casualty figures were available.
	   The rebels had been hunkered down in the compound in the West
African capital, Bissau, since shortly after launching a coup
attempt last Sunday.
	   The government claims couldn't immediately confirmed. Attempts
to contact diplomats and officials in Bissau were unsuccessful.
	   Lusa quoted an unidentified military source as saying that
rebels were engaged in hand-to-hand combat in the capital with
Senegalese troops who were deployed last week to support the forces
loyal to President Joao Bernardo Vieira. Troops from the Republic
of Guinea also supported Vieira.
	   Shooting could still be heard in the early evening, Lusa
reported, as government troops apparently moved to take the
airport. Footage broadcast earlier on Portuguese state television
RTP showed homes pulverized by shells and streets pocked by the
blasts.
	   Troops had battled rebels pinned in the Bissau garrison
throughout the week, reportedly trapping dozens of children in
downtown areas decimated by shelling.
	   Portuguese radio RDP-Africa reported that the 84 children _
including some infants _ were evacuated in the hours before the
garrison was seized.
	   Foreigners who fled Guinea-Bissau in overcrowded navy and
merchant ships docked in Senegal's capital, Dakar, described
harrowing tales from the fighting.
	   An Argentine medical doctor, Abel Vallejos, described Saturday
how he, his wife and two children had been turned away from a
Portuguese cargo ship as mortar shells landed in the water around
the boat.
	   Eventually, a small Chinese skiff took them to a merchant
vessel. ``There were more than 40 booms in the water all around
us,'' he said, ``and the booms were getting louder.''
	   Mark Stevens, U.S. charge d'affaires in Dakar, said he knew of
only five Americans remaining in Guinea-Bissau _ U.S. ambassador
Peggy Blackford and four other State Department employees who were
holed up inside the embassy in the capital of Bissau.
	   If the U.S. officials were forced to leave, they would likely be
evacuated by a Portuguese ship.
	   ``That seems to be the only way to get out,'' Stevens said.
	   The White House released a letter Saturday in Portland, Oregon,
in which President Bill Clinton informed congressional leaders that
he had assigned U.S. military planes to Dakar last Wednesday ``to
be prepared to evacuate American private citizens and government
employees as well as third country nationals in Bissau.''
	   Earlier Saturday, the rebels had offered to negotiate an end to
their coup attempt during a broadcast on a private radio station
they captured last week, RDP-Africa said.
	   The rebels are led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, who was fired in January amid allegations of arms smuggling.
	   Mane has accused Vieira of corruption and called on him to step
down so that early elections can be held.
	   Vieira himself came to power in a 1980 coup. He was elected in
the country's first democratic elections for president and
parliament four years ago.

Hanson's forces sweep rural Queensland, strike fear into

<TEXT>
	   GYMPIE, Australia (AP) _ Bashing Asians and Aboriginals and
boosting protectionism, Pauline Hanson's campaign swept through
rural Queensland like a bush fire. Her party was not likely to win
outright _ but there was no denying she dominated the state
elections.
	   No matter which party wins government after the closely
contested election _ vote-counting may go on for days _ Hanson's
One Nation party has the most reason for celebrating.
	   For the first time since the White Australia policy was
abolished in 1973, an Australian political party that appeals to a
belief racial superiority is firmly established as a viable
alternative to the mainstream parties.
	   Hanson published a book last year that said Aborigines were
cannibals that ate their woman and children. She describes Asian
neighborhoods as crime and drug-ridden ghettos. She has called for
a cutoff of Asian immigration to keep Australia from being
``swamped by Asians.''
	   But she broadened her appeal beyond these fringe positions by
tapping into Australians' insecurity about their jobs and future,
which many fear are at the mercy of impersonal international
economic forces.
	   One Nation outperformed expectations, scooping up 23 percent
statewide and more than 40 percent in at least a dozen districts.
In 34 districts, it ran first or second, beating one or both major
parties.
	   Hanson, who holds an independent seat in the national
parliament, was not even on the ballot.
	   Conservative Prime Minister John Howard now faces a similar
challenge from Hanson's forces when he calls a federal election, by
March 1999 at the latest.
	   Warning Howard of the battle to come, Hanson said Saturday: ``I
don't think it's hit them yet; I don't think they have a clue.''
	   Hanson's forces cut so deeply into the conservative vote in
Queensland that it has probably kept both major parties from
winning a parliamentary majority, resulting in a hung Parliament in
which One Nation holds the balance of power.
	   Howard fears that if he goes to an early national election, One
Nation is likely to win enough seats in the closely divided
national Senate to hold the balance of power there, blocking
passage of any legislation not to its liking.
	   From that position, One Nation could veto Howard's planned
privatization of the Telstra national telephone company, or his tax
reform that would include a new goods and services tax of 10 or 15
percent.
	   His best strategy now is to wait as long as he can before
calling the election and hope for a lucky break.
	   But the longer he waits, the harder the Australian economy will
be hit by the Asian economic crisis, which is just beginning to
ripple here. Howard will become even more vulnerable on economic
issues.
	   Hanson, in the run-up to the Queensland election, broadened her
appeal by latching onto the potent issue of the dislocation of
Australian workers by global economic forces; both Labor and
Howard's Liberal Party have worked since the 1980s to abolish
tariffs and protectionism that once sheltered Australian jobs and
industries.
	   The former fish-and-chips shop owner, more in touch with the
economic suffering of rural Queenslanders than her opponents,
understood the depth of this outrage and used it effectively in
Saturday's state election.
	   Howard's government, which has not displayed much political
skill lately, will have to run a masterful federal election
campaign to avoid the same damage that Hanson inflicted in
Queensland.

World Cup: Super Eagles soaring; Spain must regroup

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Nigeria came into its World Cup opener
carrying some burdensome defeats and doubts.
	   Now it's Spain that has to turn things around.
	   Outhustled and outplayed for much of the match Saturday, Nigeria
summoned the resolve to strike twice in a five-minute span,
rallying for a 3-2 victory over the Iberians.
	   ``The game is 90 minutes and you have to be aware you won't play
well the whole time,'' said Nigeria coach Bora Milutinovic, draped
in an ``agbada,'' an embroidered white Nigerian dress team
officials gave him before the match.
	   ``What's important is to play well at the end, and we did. The
way we fought back to win was very, very valuable, especially
against a team like Spain.''
	   Speculation Milutinovic might be forced out _ which would be
nothing new for a man leading his record fourth different country
at the World Cup _ was rife after Nigeria lost its three warmup
games against Germany, Yugoslavia and the Netherlands by a total
score of 9-1.
	   And with several top players out with injuries, the Olympic
champions looked vulnerable heading into the game with Spain.
	   ``A lot of people had written us off,'' midfielder Jay-Jay
Okocha said. ``You might just say we played our friendlies to know
our mistakes and correct them.''
	   Nigeria appeared to play the first two-thirds of Saturday's
match for that very purpose.
	   Raul's spectacular volley off a long pass from his Real Madrid
teammate Fernando Hierro, who earlier had scored the game's first
goal, put Spain up 2-1 two minutes after halftime.
	   To that point, Milutinovic's players _ wearing black arm bands
on their green jerseys because of the death Monday of their
country's ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha _ were often caught out of
position and had trouble creating scoring chances.
	   But winger Garba Lawal tied the match in the 73rd minute with a
shot that goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta deflected into his own net,
and Sunday Oliseh won it with 12 minutes to go on a 30-meter (yard)
drive that glanced off the left post.
	   ``I never had any doubt we were going to win,'' Inter Milan
defender Taribo West said. ``Bora has experience in the World Cup
and that was a big advantage for us. He's a man of ambition.''
	   Milutinovic, who coached the United States at the 1994
tournament, made a key move three minutes before Lawal's goal,
sending on extra attacker Rasheed Yekini. The substitute helped set
up the equalizer and opened up space in the box.
	   ``We showed Nigeria is not dead,'' Oliseh said. ``Our problem
now is to keep our heads.''
	   Spain coach Javier Clemente's problem is recharging a side that
isn't familiar with defeat. The team, often disappointing at the
World Cup, lost for the second time in 35 games.
	   ``We had the match in our grasp,'' Clemente said after his team
allowed three goals for the first time since he became coach in
1992. ``We could have won 3-1, but it got away from us. We just got
careless.''

World Cup: Egil wishes that Egil would try two forwards AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHAN NASSTROM
<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ If there's a player hoping that Norway
adds one guy up front, it must be striker Egil Ostenstad.
	   But the other Norwegian Egil, head coach Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen,
is likely to keep his preferred lone striker formation. That means
Ostenstad stays on the bench when Norway plays Scotland in a World
Cup Group A match Tuesday in Bordeaux.
	   Ostenstad, 26, who plays for Southampton and is one of 11
Norwegians based in England, has been one of the world's top
reserve players since making his national team debut in 1993.
	   He has scored six goals coming off the bench as a substitute in
12 games, including the clincher in an impressive 4-2 exhibition
win a year ago in Oslo against Group A favorite and defending world
champion Brazil.
	   His latest goal came May 27 in a 6-0 rout of fellow World Cup
team Saudi Arabia in Norway.
	   In the two other appearances for Norway, both as a starter, he
went scoreless.
	   Ostenstad understands his role as a bench-warmer. He's patient
and waiting for his chance.
	   ``I'm not used to being a reserve in club soccer, but I realize
that I'll spend a lot of time on the bench in this championship,''
Ostenstad said.
	   ``As long as I'm not playing, I must be happy that I've done a
good job when I've been a substitute. But I'm convinced that I'm
good enough to be a starter.
	   ``Both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and I are suffering because we only
have one man up front, but Tore Andre (Flo) has been playing so
well and it's easy to understand why he's the first choice.''
	   Flo, the tall Chelsea striker nicknamed ``Flonaldo'' after his
two goals against Brazil last year, looked sluggish toward the end
of the Group A opener against Morocco that ended 2-2 Wednesday in
Montpellier.
	   So a lot of people expected Ostenstad to come off the bench as
the Norwegians turned the pressure on. Especially since
forward-midfielder Solskjaer had limped off 10 minutes before the
end of the first half with an ankle injury.
	   But Ostenstad never got the chance and for the first time in his
career he stayed on the bench throughout the game.
	   Ostenstad will see many familiar faces on the pitch in Bordeaux.
	   ``It will be a special game against the Scots because many
players face each other often in England,'' he said.
	   Coach Olsen, who was unhappy with Norway's normally disciplined
defense against Morocco, has promised changes in his starting
lineup. But Ostenstad is likely to be on the sidelines again from
the start.
	   ``One, two or three new players will get the chance from the
start,'' Olsen said. ``I never use the same players for two matches
in a row.''
	   In 84 games since his debut as coach in 1990 against Cameroon,
Olsen has never used the same team in two straight games.

World Cup: Salas showcases talent that earned him a spot in Italy 
</HEADLINE>
By SERGIO CARRASCO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ A league champion first in his native
Chile and then in Argentina, striker Marcelo Salas is using the
World Cup to showcase the scoring talent that earned him a place in
one of soccer's premier leagues.
	   In Chile's first World Cup game in 16 years, Salas scored two
goals against Italy and quickly established himself as one of the
favorites to win top scoring honors, along with Brazil's Ronaldo.
	   It was a taste of things to come for the Italians. Salas, 23,
will join the tough Italian league this year with Lazio, which
bought him recently for more than dlrs 20 million.
	   There he'll face fellow Chilean Ivan Zamorano, of Milan's
Internazionale, with whom he scored 23 goals for Chile in Cup
qualifying. That was as many as scored by Argentina's entire team
during qualifying.
	   Lazio now hopes Salas, known by his fans as ``El Matador,'' can
display in Rome the magic he showed in Santiago and Buenos Aires.
His thundering goals, which come in bunches, are followed by a
well-known salute: a knee to the ground, head bowed and the right
arm extended, index pointing skyward.
	   At 1.73 meters tall (5-foot-8), Salas doesn't bring an imposing
physical presence to the field, but that hasn't kept him from
scoring more than 150 goals in less than five years as a
professional.
	   ``He's fantastic, a natural goal-scorer,'' says Chile's coach,
Nelson Acosta. ``When he is sure of himself, you can see what he is
capable of.''
	   Over the last four years, Salas has led Universidad de Chile and
Argentina's River Plate to two titles each.
	   He proved to be a steal for the Buenos Aires club, which paid
less than dlrs 3 million for him after long-time rival Boca Juniors
decided not to spend that kind of money.
	   Born in Temuco, home to the last of Chile's Mapuche Indians,
Salas is a man of few words and he speaks to the press only
reluctantly.
	   Earlier this month, a Chilean publisher agreed to changes to an
unauthorized biography on Salas after the player complained the
author attributed his character traits and soccer talent to his
Mapuche background.

Nigerians make case for Africans early 
</HEADLINE>
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Maybe it is time for an African breakthrough.
	   Predicted since Cameroon made its run to the quarterfinals in
1990, Nigeria may be the team to prove Africa is a serious
contender for the World Cup title.
	   Two goals in five minutes completed the Super Eagles' second
rally from a one-goal deficit and lifted Nigeria to a 3-2 victory
over perennial European power Spain on Saturday in a match which
featured a goal that will be shown in video replays for years.
	   The World Cup also saw its first glimpse of the enforcement of
the new tackle from behind directive, a moment which turned South
Korea's 1-0 lead into a 3-1 Mexican victory.
	   And the Dutch and Belgians played to a disappointing 0-0
lowlands grudge draw.
	   At each of the games a moment of silence was observed for
Fernand Sastre. The man who spearheaded France's campaign to host
the World Cup died of lung cancer earlier in the day.
	   Sastre was the often faceless administrator, contrasting the
more public persona of his World Cup organizing committee
co-president, Michel Platini.
	   ``I think he regarded me a little like a son,'' Platini said.
``I had a wonderfully sound relationship with Fernand and my
feelings for him are filled with fondness. Unfortunately, destiny
did not see fit to give him the opportunity to see this World Cup
through when he gave so much to it.''
	   Overall, goals in France '98 were up through 10 games over four
years ago in the United States and ahead of Italia '90's pace as
well.
	   ``We're very happy with the pace of scoring and the attacking
spirit,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said.
	   Twenty-six goals had been scored through 10 matches in France,
one more than Italy and three more than the United States.
	   Six more teams were to get their chance at adding to the total
on Sunday when Japan debuted against Argentina in Toulouse,
Yugoslavia took on Iran in Saint-Etienne and Jamaica faced Croatia
in Lens.
	   In Nantes, the Nigerians did their part, tallying in the 73rd
and 78th minutes to shock the Spaniards.
	   ``We showed Nigeria is not dead,'' said Sunday Oliseh, whose
30-meter (yard) rocket with 12 minutes remaining ticked off the
left post for the game-winner. ``Our problem now is to keep our
heads.''
	   Cameroon's 1990 showing nudged FIFA into giving Africa an extra
berth for the 1994 World Cup for a total of three, plus two more
for 1998.
	   With Nigeria's winning of the Olympic title two years ago in
Atlanta, expectations have increased significantly for this World
Cup.
	   ``This win was for 150 million Nigerians,'' Oliseh said.
	   Shock has turned to respect.
	   ``I have to congratulate Nigeria. That third goal was just
sensational,'' Spanish coach Javier Clemente said after his side
lost for just the second time in 35 outings.
	   Spain took the lead in the 21st minute when Fernando Hierro bent
a free kick around the Nigerian wall, but Mutiu Adepoju tied it on
a header only five minutes later.
	   Spain charged back into the lead less than two minutes into the
second half on what was clearly the goal of the tournament. Hierro
sent in a long ball from just outside the midfield circle and Raul
ran onto to it, sliding and volleying a shot with an outstretched
left foot that left Nigerian keeper Peter Rufai with no chance to
react.
	   Then, when it looked like Spain would escape, Garba Lawal sent a
ball from the left side of the Spanish area parallel to the end
line. Spanish keeper Andoni Zubizarreta reached down with his right
hand, only to have the ball glance off his glove and into the net.
	   ``We had the match in our grasp,'' Clemente said. ``We could
have won 3-1, but it got away from us, We just got careless.''
	   Careless wasn't the word in Lyon, but luckless.
	   South Korea, still trying for its first victory in a World Cup
finals in its fifth try, took a 1-0 lead on Ha Seok-ju's 30-meter
(yard) free kick, then gave the advantage _ and the game _ away
when Ha was red-carded for a studs-up challenge from behind that
upended Mexican midfielder Ramon Ramirez two minutes later.
	   ``The call was a very harsh one,'' Korean coach Cha Bum-kun
said. ``I doubt it was a veritable red card. Maybe a yellow. Of
course I told the players about the new FIFA rule about tackling
from behind. I was quite disgusted when Ha went into the tackle. He
should've been calmer in that situation.''
	   Ha's ejection was the first since FIFA instituted the mandatory
red card for the decried practice, but hardly the first time fans
had seen the tactic used in the first four days.
	   Austrian referee Guenther Benko showed three yellows before Ha's
ejection, at least one of which appeared to fit FIFA's criteria.
	   Mexico capitalized on the man advantage to equalize in the 51st
minute on substitute Ricardo Pelaez's goal and won it on a pair by
Luis Hernandez in the 75th and 84th minutes.
	   ``Basically, we didn't lose our cool,'' Hernandez said. ``We
paid attention and we didn't become desperate.''
	   The game which was supposed to be the highlight of the day
turned out to be the low point.
	   In Saint-Denis, Dutch forward Patrick Kluivert was ejected for
an elbow to the chest of Belgium's Lorenzo Staelens in the 82nd
minute and the Netherlands squandered their chances in the goalless
draw.
	   Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and his second-half replacement, Dennis
Bergkamp, both wasted easy chances as the Dutch dominated, but were
unable to get past overworked Belgian goalkeeper Filip De Wilde.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Dozens of hungry farm workers
blocked a road in northeast Brazil and seized shipments of rice,
beans and sugar as police watched, newspapers reported Saturday.
	   About 150 members of the Landless Rural Workers Movement seized
three truckloads of food near Santa Maria da Boa Vista, 1,550
kilometers (975 miles) north of Rio de Janeiro.
	   The daily newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported that about 40
policemen watched the incident without interfering.
	   It was the 15th time this year that the landless rural workers
movement has seized food in the drought-striken region, the daily
newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported.
	   Brazil's northeastern coastal region has been plagued by
drought, prompting the government to distribute food packages in an
effort to prevent the looting of supermarkets and food shipments.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Human rights groups from Europe and
the Americas have asked Venezuela to reconsider a Supreme Court
decision ordering the extradition of an alleged Peruvian guerrilla.
	   The groups said Cecilia Rossana Nunez Chipana, alias Comrade
Ana, could face undue punishment in Peru.
	   This week's decision to extradite her could endanger her life
and physical integrity, Juan Navarrete, representative of the
rights group Support Network, told The Associated Press on
Saturday.
	   Nunez was arrested in February in Caracas. Peru accuses her of
belonging to the Shining Path guerrilla movement and of
participating in a July 1992 car bombing that killed 21 people in
Lima.
	   Navarrete said Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are
backing the petition.
	   On Wednesday, the Venezuelan Supreme Court ordered Nunez's
extradition to Peru under the condition that she not be executed or
tortured.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A kidnapped automobile dealership executive
has been freed by a special police team in Mexico City after a
brief shootout with his captors.
	   A police report said five suspects were arrested during the
action late Friday in the south-side neighborhood of Iztapalapa.
The victim, Eliot Margoli Friedman, was unhurt.
	   Eight armed men assaulted Automotores de Mexico, S.A., one of
the city's main Chrysler dealerships, and hauled Margoli away May
19. He was not heard from until Friday.
	   It was not known if any ransom was asked for or paid for his
freedom. Margoli is general manager of the dealership.
	   One the suspects, a former police officer the report identified
only as Alberto Alba Alba (cq), suffered a bullet wound in the leg
during the shootout and also broke a bone while trying to escape by
jumping a fence.
	   The five suspects admitted they belonged to a kidnapping gang
that has been operating in the capital and the neighboring state of
Mexico. They were booked on charges of kidnapping and attempts to
cause bodily harm.

	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ David Beckham skipped a golf game with
his England teammates because he had a better offer.
	   Her name is Victoria Adams _ also known as Posh Spice _ and she
landed Friday in a private jet in this small Brittany town where
England is training to spend a few quiet hours with her fiance.
	   The two had permission from coach Glenn Hoddle, who has clamped
down on almost everything else at the England camp.
	   ``Victoria did fly out to spend some time with David,'' said
team spokesman Steve Double.
	   ``Glenn has already agreed that the wives and the girlfriends of
the players should be allowed to fly out to watch the England games
in the World Cup.
	   ``But Victoria's tour commitments with the Spice Girls mean she
could not come out to see David in any of the England games.''
	   Double stressed that the two had not been alone together in the
team hotel, visiting instead in the golf course clubhouse.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ U.S. players finally escaped their gilded luxury
Saturday, leaving their 12th century chateau in Beaujolais wine
country and traveling by train to Paris.
	   About 100 family and friends greeted the players when they
arrived on a high-speed TGV train at the Gare de Lyon.
	   ``It finally feels like we're at the World Cup,''
defender-midfielder Mike Burns said, ``with the atmosphere driving
through Paris, seeing the Belgian and Holland fans going to
tonight's game.''
	   U.S. coach Steve Sampson appears ready to start a
defensive-oriented lineup, based on the three players he brought to
the news conference: Burns, defender Thomas Dooley and goalkeeper
Kasey Keller.
	   ``I would say he is one of the top three-four goalkeepers in the
world _ no question,'' Sampson boldly proclaimed of Keller. ``It's
not just his performance against Brazil.''
	   Keller gained much worldwide attention in February when he made
several spectacular saves against Romario as the United States beat
the Brazilians for the first time ever in nine meetings.
	   The U.S. team, at least some of the players, visited the Eiffel
Tower with their families on Saturday night. Sampson gave the
players time to spend with their families, and left additional time
for players to be on their own after Sunday's workout at the Parc
des Princes.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Most training camp news concerns injuries to
players, but a World Cup linesman is also struggling for fitness.
	   Organizers said Saturday that South African linesman Aristidis
Soldatos has been replaced by Mali's Dramane Dante for Monday's
game between England and Tunisia.
	   A statement said Soldatos ``sustained an injury while training
at Gressy.'' It didn't elaborate.
	   The injury can't be too serious, however. Soldatos is slated to
take Dante's place at the Romania-England game on June 22.

Hanson's forces sweep rural Queensland, strike fear into conservatives nationally

<TEXT>
	   GYMPIE, Australia (AP) _ Bashing Asians and Aboriginals and
boosting protectionism, Pauline Hanson's campaign swept through
rural Queensland like a bush fire. Her party was not likely to win
outright _ but there was no denying she dominated the state
elections.
	   No matter which party wins government after the closely
contested election _ vote-counting may go on for days _ Hanson's
One Nation party has the most reason for celebrating.
	   For the first time since the White Australia policy was
abolished in 1973, an Australian political party that appeals to a
belief racial superiority is firmly established as a viable
alternative to the mainstream parties.
	   Hanson published a book last year that said Aborigines were
cannibals that ate their woman and children. She describes Asian
neighborhoods as crime and drug-ridden ghettos. She has called for
a cutoff of Asian immigration to keep Australia from being
``swamped by Asians.''
	   But she broadened her appeal beyond these fringe positions by
tapping into Australians' insecurity about their jobs and future,
which many fear are at the mercy of impersonal international
economic forces.
	   One Nation outperformed expectations, scooping up 23 percent
statewide and more than 40 percent in at least a dozen districts.
In 34 districts, it ran first or second, beating one or both major
parties.
	   Hanson, who holds an independent seat in the national
parliament, was not even on the ballot.
	   Conservative Prime Minister John Howard now faces a similar
challenge from Hanson's forces when he calls a federal election, by
March 1999 at the latest.
	   Warning Howard of the battle to come, Hanson said Saturday: ``I
don't think it's hit them yet; I don't think they have a clue.''
	   Hanson's forces cut so deeply into the conservative vote in
Queensland that it has probably kept both major parties from
winning a parliamentary majority, resulting in a hung Parliament in
which One Nation holds the balance of power.
	   Howard fears that if he goes to an early national election, One
Nation is likely to win enough seats in the closely divided
national Senate to hold the balance of power there, blocking
passage of any legislation not to its liking.
	   From that position, One Nation could veto Howard's planned
privatization of the Telstra national telephone company, or his tax
reform that would include a new goods and services tax of 10 or 15
percent.
	   His best strategy now is to wait as long as he can before
calling the election and hope for a lucky break.
	   But the longer he waits, the harder the Australian economy will
be hit by the Asian economic crisis, which is just beginning to
ripple here. Howard will become even more vulnerable on economic
issues.
	   Hanson, in the run-up to the Queensland election, broadened her
appeal by latching onto the potent issue of the dislocation of
Australian workers by global economic forces; both Labor and
Howard's Liberal Party have worked since the 1980s to abolish
tariffs and protectionism that once sheltered Australian jobs and
industries.
	   The former fish-and-chips shop owner, more in touch with the
economic suffering of rural Queenslanders than her opponents,
understood the depth of this outrage and used it effectively in
Saturday's state election.
	   Howard's government, which has not displayed much political
skill lately, will have to run a masterful federal election
campaign to avoid the same damage that Hanson inflicted in
Queensland.

World Cup: Mexican team makes believers of non-believers

	   LYON, France (AP) _ El Tritanic has stopped sinking.
	   Mexico's El Tricolor, dubbed El Tritanic by its national media
for its poor performances through the buildup to the World Cup,
finally ended fan anxiety Saturday, taking advantage of a man
advantage to score three second-half goals to drown South Korea 3-1
in the opener for both sides.
	   ``This was the first step, and it was a solid first step,'' said
Mexico's Manuel Lapuente, who replaced Bora Milutinovic as coach
after the team qualified for the World Cup finals. ``Today we
earned three points. We are happy to have won so we can relax a
bit.
	   ``Beating the Netherlands and Belgium will be a big challenge
but we are ready to face it.''
	   Given the dubious moniker of the ill-fated ocean liner, Mexico
was eager to silence its critics, and did so at least for the
moment with its first ever World Cup victory in Europe.
	   After rallying from a one-goal deficit to win the match in
convincing fashion, Mexico's players are aiming beyond South Korea.
	   ``The win against South Korea was fantastic,'' said Mexican
striker Luis Hernandez, who had two goals in the final 15 minutes
to complete the rout. ``We have high aspirations for our next
matches. I'm sure we can make it to the next round.''
	   Even more confident, striker Ricardo Pelaez spoke of lifting the
trophy on July 12.
	   ``We are determined to win the World Cup, even though it will be
very difficult for us,'' said Pelaez, who scored Mexico's opening
goal after coming in on a substitution in the second half. ``We
came here with the intention to win.
	   ``Those who come to the World Cup without the intention of
winning the tournament, should not come at all.''
	   The comments seemingly were in response to South Korea's stated
intention of just winning a game in the World Cup finals in five
tries.
	   South Korea took the lead on Ha Seok-ju's 30-meter (yard) free
kick, deflecting off the head of Duilio Davino in the middle of the
wall and into the goal. Ha negated his good deed two minutes later,
wiping out Ramon Ramirez on a tackle from behind, and leaving his
teammates down a man for the final hour.
	   The advantage enabled Mexico to wear down the Koreans and tally
three times in the second half.
	   ``It was a terrific, exciting win for Mexico over the South
Koreans,'' said Carmen Fernandez, a Mexican supporter whose face
was painted green, red and white for team's national colors. ``Of
course they will become the World Cup champions this year!''

	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Three years ago, it seemed no other
soccer prodigy had as bright a future as Patrick Kluivert. For
three years, he has taken a course in self-destruction.
	   And it continues at the World Cup.
	   Near the end of a frustrating, goalless draw against Belgium,
Kluivert elbowed Belgian defender Lorenzo Staelens in the chest
after a brief but heated discussion in the 81st minute.
	   The elbow was more of a shove, but Staelens fell to the ground
and Italian referee Pierluigi Collina gave Kluivert his marching
orders.
	   Kluivert admitted afterwards that his actions had been
``stupid,'' but he claimed Staelens said something ``below the
belt'' to him.
	   That could mean a great many things.
	   Since scoring the only goal in Ajax Amsterdam's win over AC
Milan in the 1995 European Cup final, Kluivert's life and soccer
fortunes have taken a dive.
	   In May 1996, he was convicted of vehicular homicide after
slamming a borrowed BMW into another car, killing its driver.
Kluivert was ordered to perform 240 hours community service.
	   And earlier this year, Kluivert looked like he might miss the
World Cup finals after being accused of being involved in a gang
rape by a woman he picked up outside an Amsterdam nightclub. No
charges were ever pressed in the case.
	   Fellow striker Dennis Bergkamp agreed that the shove was stupid,
but said it was borne of frustration on a night when nothing went
right for the Dutch attack.
	   ``As a forward I can understand that it is frustration,'' said
Bergkamp. Kluivert effectively had to replace Bergkamp as the Dutch
goalscorer, and never came close. Staelens marked him too tightly.
	   Bergkamp came on as a substitute in the 66th minute but could
not break down the dogged defense. Bergkamp has been sidelined for
six weeks with a hamstring injury and admitted he was missing match
sharpness Saturday night.
	   With Kluivert suspended, Bergkamp will have to work hard in the
coming week to be fully match ready for the Netherlands' second
match, against South Korea on June 20 in Marseille.
	   On a rainy and cold night in Saint-Denis, Belgian goalie Filip
De Wilde parried everything thrown at him and when he was beaten,
defender Eric Deflandre cleared two balls off the line as the
underdog Belgians perfo watched the stadium clock run down the time.

	   OAKLAND, California (AP) _ Mike Macfarlane hit a three-run homer
off Randy Johnson and the Oakland Athletics overcame two home runs
by Jay Buhner to beat the Seattle Mariners 7-3 Saturday.
	   Johnson (5-6) has lost three straight starts for the first time
since dropping eight in a row in 1992. He was tagged for seven runs
in seven innings.
	   The left-hander, 20-4 last season, has not had a losing record
this late in a season since finishing 1992 at 12-14. Johnson's 5.61
ERA is the highest it has ever at this point in a year.
	   Buhner drove in all three Seattle runs with his two homers, his
first since returning from a two-month stay on the disabled list
following arthroscopic knee surgery.
	   The Mariners managed only three hits off Blake Stein (3-3) and
relievers Buddy Groom and Mike Fetters, who got his third save.
 &UR; Toronto Blue Jays 9, Baltimore Orioles 8
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Carlos Delgado drove in three runs while Mike
Stanley and Alex Gonzalez each hit two-run homers, lifting the
Toronto Blue Jays over the Baltimore Orioles.
	   Mark Dalesandro also homered for Toronto. Joe Carter, Rafael
Palmeiro and Jesus Tavarez connected for the Orioles.
	   Tavarez, starting in place of injured Orioles center fielder
Brady Anderson, led off the game with a home run. Anderson is
expected to be out for a week because of a strained right
quadriceps.
	   Two outs after Tavarez homered, Rafael Palmeiro lined a ball off
the pitching hand of Chris Carpenter. The righty left the game and
was taken to the hospital, where X-rays were negative. Robert
Person (2-0) relieved.
	   Randy Myers, pitching against the Orioles for the first time
since leaving them as a free agent in the offseason, worked the
ninth for his 17th save in 19 chances.
	   Palmeiro hit Myers' first pitch for his 17th home run. Roberto
Alomar then walked, but B.J. Surhoff fouled out and Cal Ripken
grounded into a double play.

	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Rookie Travis Lee homered in consecutive innings
and drove in a team-record five runs as the Arizona Diamondbacks
rallied to beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7-4 on Saturday.
	   Down 4-3 after Brian Jordan's two-run homer in the eighth, the
Diamondbacks scored four runs in the bottom of the inning on Lee's
three-run homer and Matt Williams' solo shot, both off Jeff
Brantley (0-3).
	   Lee, who had a two-run homer in the seventh, has 13 home runs
and 39 RBIs, both tops among National League rookies. Russ Springer
(4-3) got the victory despite allowing Jordan's homer. Gregg Olson
pitched the ninth for his eighth save.
	   St. Louis star Mark McGwire, who hit his major league-leading
31st homer Friday night, was 1-for-2 with two walks, raising his
league-leading walk total to 70.
 &UR; Colorado Rockies 4, Los Angeles Dodgers 2,
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Colorado's Larry Walker went 3-for-3 with a
solo home run and the Dodgers turned their first double play ever
at Dodger Stadium and second since moving to Los Angeles in 1958.
	   The fifth-inning triple play, which began on a bunt by Kurt
Abbott, also was the first involving the Rockies in their six-year
history.
	   Abbott's bunt fell between Darren Dreifort (4-6) and first
baseman Eric Karros, with Dreifort throwing to shortstop Jose
Vizcaino at second base for the first out. Vizcaino relayed to
first base, where second baseman Eric Young was covering, for the
second out. Jamey Wright was thrown out when Young threw to third
baseman Bobby Bonilla.
	   Wright (5-6) pitched 5 1-3 innings for the victory, and Jerry
Dipoto worked the ninth for his 13th save.
 &UR; Chicago Cubs 10, Philadelphia Philllies 8, 10 innings
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Chicago's Sammy Sosa hit his 21st homer and
drove in the go-ahead run with a sacrifice fly in the 10th.
	   Sosa, who drove in four runs, has 12 home runs and 29 RBIs in
his last 14 games. Brant Brown also homered for Chicago, and Mickey
Morandini, acquired from Philadelphia in an offseason trade, was
4-for-5.
	   Bobby Abreu went 3-for-3 with a homer and three RBIs for the
Phillies.
	   Terry Adams (5-3) pitched two scoreless innings for the victory.
Jerry Spradlin (2-3) took the loss.

Nobel prize winner says E. Timorese should decide own fate

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ One of East Timor's most influential
figures appealed Sunday for the release of a jailed rebel chief and
said the people of the Indonesian-controlled territory should
decide their own political future.
	   Bishop Carlos Belo, who won the Nobel peace prize in 1996 for
his efforts to bring peace to the former Portuguese colony, also
appeared to harbor doubts about the sincerity of recent
conciliatory moves by the Indonesian government.
	   Pushing a nationwide agenda of democratic reform, Indonesian
President B.J. Habibie last week suggested special status for East
Timor, which would entail some measure of autonomy.
	   ``I'd like to see first. Not only promises,'' Belo said after
early morning Mass in an open-air chapel on the grounds of his Dili
home. ``It could be a transitional solution... The definite
solution should be said by the people here.''
	   However, Habibie will likely reject calls for a referendum on
self-determination in East Timor. In an interview with The
Associated Press on Saturday, he ruled out the possibility of
independence for the disputed territory.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it a year
later, snuffing out most armed resistance in the following years.
Human rights workers say tens of thousands of people died.
	   Belo, a sharp critic of the Indonesian government, urged the
government to release Xanana Gusmao, a separatist guerrilla leader,
and other political prisoners.
	   Arrested in 1992, Gusmao is serving a 20-year sentence in a
prison in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. Habibie has said he is
considering freeing Gusmao.
	   Indonesia released a dozen activists from a jail on Friday, but
Belo said all detainees must be freed in order to bring peace to
the rugged, half-island territory of 800,000 people.
	   ``All of them'' should be released, Belo told reporters.
	   In demonstrations this week in Dili, the capital of East Timor,
thousands of university students waved banners and chanted slogans
in favor of a vote on independence. Belo cautioned that a
referendum could be divisive and asked advocates to be patient.
	   ``Maybe we can prepare it,'' he said. ``But they must be aware
that we must prepare first a dialogue.''
	   Without elaborating, Belo warned that there are ``dark forces''
trying to create antagonism among East Timorese.
	   While there is great resentment toward the Indonesian
authorities, some observers fear old internal wounds could emerge
if Indonesia withdraws. East Timor plunged into civil war after
Portugal withdrew in the 1970s, and Indonesia used the conflict as
a pretext to invade in order to restore order.
	   Belo, who shared the Nobel prize with East Timorese activist
Jose Ramos-Horta, commands deep respect among East Timorese and is
seen as a symbol of opposition to Indonesian authority. Despite his
political commentary on Sunday, he said that his role was
secondary.
	   ``You must leave the political leaders to take the way, not the
Catholic church,'' he said.

Walters takes lead with 65 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   EAST LANSING, Michigan (AP) _ Lisa Walters shot a 7-under 65
Saturday and built a five-stroke lead after the third round of the
dlrs 650,000 LPGA Oldsmobile Classic at Walnut Hills Country Club.
	   Walters, a native of Prince Rupert, British Columbia who lives
in Tampa, Florida, was at 17-under 199 for the tournament, five
better than Donna Andrews.
	   Walters opened the round two strokes behind Andrews, the LPGA's
leading money winner who began the tournament with a 64. Andrews
struggled with her putting on Saturday, however, and could only
match par over the 6,191-yard (5,659-meter) Walnut Hills Country
Club course.
	   Australian Karrie Webb shot a 69 and was at 11-under 205, the
only other player within nine shots of the lead.
	   Walters, 38, birdied three holes on the front and four on the
back, including two of the last three holes.
	   ``I didn't look at the leader board,'' she said. ``I was only
concerned about my own game. I have enough problems of my own
without worrying about anyone else.''
	   Walters, whose best finish this year was eighth in the Rochester
International two weeks ago, is 55th on the money list with dlrs
60,000. The Oldsmobile Classic is worth dlrs 97,500 to the winner.
	   ``I feel really good about my golf game right now,'' Walters
said. ``So if things don't go the way I want them to go tomorrow,
it is not going to be the end of the world. I have never been in
this position before so I'll rack it up to a learning experience.''
	   Walters' only two LPGA victories were the 1992 and 1993 Hawaiian
Ladies Open.
	   Andrews has finished second in each of the last three LPGA
events and won the Longs Drugs Challenge in early April.
	   ``I had a lot of putts today but if I make all those 15-footers
(5-meter-shots) I'm right in it,'' said Andrews, who has earned
more than dlrs 465,000 this year. ``Now I'm five strokes back and I
have my work cut out for me. It felt like I hit some good putts
today that I missed.''
	   Walters and Andrews played in the final group Saturday and will
be paired together for Sunday's final round.
	   ``She hit the ball great today,'' Andrews said. ``She didn't
make any mistakes out there. I think we have to go catch her
because I don't think she is going to come back to us.''

Norwood retains title by stopping Rios 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Freddy Norwood retained his WBA
featherweight title in impressive fashion Saturday, stopping Genaro
Rios of Nicaragua in the eighth round at the Trump Taj Mahal Casino
Resort.
	   Norwood, who improved to 30-0-1 with 19 knockouts, knocked down
the WBA's No. 1 contender twice early in the fight that was
scheduled for 12 rounds.
	   ``That kid was a good fighter, but I can't be touched when I'm
at my best,'' Norwood said ``I was surprised he made it out of the
second round, but I wasn't in any hurry. Once I whack a guy the
first time, it's just a matter of time before I do it again.''
	   Norwood caught Rios (18-5) with a short left uppercut in the
eighth round. Rios stumbled toward the ropes on unsteady legs,
prompting referee Joe Cortez to stop the fight at the 1:05 mark of
the round.
	   ``I saw his eyes roll back in his head, and he was out on his
feet when I got to him,'' Cortez said of Rios. ``The next blow
could have been a fatal one, and boxing doesn't need any more black
eyes. This way, he can come back and fight another day.''
	   Rios recovered enough to conduct a lengthy interview with a
Nicaraguan radio station, but left the arena immediately after
complaining of a broken nose.
	   ``The referee stopped it just in time,'' Norwood said. ``This is
a sport, and I really don't like to hurt anybody seriously, but I
could have really hurt that kid if I had hit him again. If you ask
me he stopped it just in time.''
	   Norwood, a native of St. Louis, had inflicted his share of
punishment in the earlier rounds. He dropped Rios twice in the
second round, nearly providing a premature end to a fight that
gained excitement.
	   Rios fought back over the next few rounds, occasionally catching
Norwood with some combinations, but ultimately couldn't handle
Norwood's nonstop pressure.
	   All three judges, John Stewart of the United States (69-62),
Marcial Vargar of Venezuela (69-62) and Hector Hernandez of Mexico
(67-64), had Norwood in front through seven rounds.
	   Norwood would like to unify the featherweight division by adding
the WBC and IBF belts, but said he would relish the chance to first
fight England's Prince Naseem Hamed, the flamboyant WBO champion.
	   ``I don't even want his belt,'' Norwood said. ``After I beat
him, I'll give it right back to him. I just want to beat him up for
the fun of it. I want to show the world who's the best out there.''

President says Indonesia could recover in a year or two With Indonesia-East Timor

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's President B.J. Habibie has
given his first timetable for economic recovery, predicting a
turnaround within a year or two despite the economy's stunning
meltdown.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, he also ruled out the
possibility of independence for disputed East Timor. But he later
indicated he was considering the release of East Timorese rebel
leader Xanano Gusmao, Indonesia's highest-profile political
prisoner.
	   Habibie said Saturday that pulling the country out of its worst
economic troubles in decades demands ``concentrated and concerted
action'' by all Indonesians.
	   Habibie had not indicated how long economic recovery would take
since he came to power last month. His predecessor, Suharto, quit
amid protests and riots partly triggered by the economic woes.
	   Analysts have given a far more pessimistic view, suggesting it
could be several years before Indonesia's economy picks up.
Indonesia, thriving a year ago, has been hit hardest by Asia's
financial woes.
	   The currency, the rupiah, has lost more than 80 percent of its
value against the dollar since July 1997. Inflation is running at
more than 50 percent and is rising along with widespread
unemployment.
	   Weeks of political turmoil derailed a dlrs 43 billion bailout by
the International Monetary Fund, which is examining how to restart
the rescue plan.
	   Habibie has promised sweeping political changes to match
IMF-demanded economic reform, including free and fair elections in
1999.
	   However, he has refused to budge on the issue of East Timor, a
former Portuguese colony invaded by Indonesia on Suharto's orders
in 1975 and annexed the following year.
	   Gusmao's release is a key demand of protesters and rebels who
continue to fight for independence from East Timor's rugged
interior.
	   ``I'm really, really honestly considering releasing him and
integrating all the Timorese, who are still in the mountains,
(into) the society and to take care of them the same as other
Indonesian people,'' Japan's Kyodo News agency quoted Habibie as
saying Saturday.
	   Until now Indonesian authorities have flatly rejected calls to
release Gusmao.
	   On Sunday, Bishop Carlos Belo, one of East Timor's most
influential figures, issued another appeal for Gusmao's release and
said the people of the Indonesian-controlled territory should
decide their political future.
	   Belo, who won the Nobel peace prize in 1996 for his efforts to
bring peace to the former Portuguese colony, also appeared
skeptical about conciliatory moves by the Indonesian government.
	   ``I'd like to see first. Not only promises,'' Belo said after
early morning Mass in an open-air chapel on the grounds of his Dili
home.
	   Earlier this week, Habibie released 15 East Timorese political
prisoners and suggested a special status for the territory in
return for peace _ an offer rejected by East Timorese activists.
	   In East Timor on Saturday, about 1,000 protesters staged a noisy
demonstration calling for a referendum on their future and Gusmao's
release.
	   Tens of thousands of East Timorese died during Indonesia's
efforts in the 1970s to wipe out the independence movement.
	   Habibie also said he remained friends with Suharto. Although the
two have known each other for 49 years, Habibie indicated he will
not help the ex-autocrat fend off corruption allegations if they
are pursued legally.
	   Critics say Suharto's family amassed a fortune under his
patronage during his 32 years in power.
	   ``The problem that he is facing with his family, that is his
problem,'' Habibie said.

Buick Classic becomes another weather-plagued event 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS to UPDATE with finishing scores
By JOEL STASHENKO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   HARRISON, New York (AP) _ The exercise of the year on the PGA
Tour is ``lift, clean and place.''
	   ``Lightning alert'' and ``play suspended'' have turned up on
more leaderboards than ``David Duval'' and ``Fred Couples.''
	   The Buick Classic, where heavy rain prevented the completion of
the second round for a second day Saturday with Jim Furyk holding a
one-shot lead over Kevin Sutherland, became the latest in a long
line of tour events to be plagued by weather.
	   Furyk had an 8-under-par 63 Saturday, one stroke off the
Westchester Country Club course record set by Jimmy Wright in 1976,
and was at 9-under 133 for 36 holes.
	   Be it torrential rain, high winds, lightning, fog or even frost,
play at 12 tour events in 1998 has been suspended or delayed by the
weather.
	   The Buick Invitational in February at La Jolla, Calif., was
reduced from 72 holes to 54 holes by rain. The AT-and-T Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am in California in January also was shortened,
when players got in only two rounds because of rain. Golfers will
return to Pebble Beach on Aug. 17 to play one round and make the
event official.
	   Buick Classic officials said they would be lucky if golfers
could even play three rounds this weekend.
	   ``We're just hoping and praying to get 54 holes in as things
stand,'' tournament director Arvin Ginn said Saturday.
	   Heat and humidity were the hazards at the Buick Classic in
recent years, not rains so heavy they turned sand traps and
low-lying stretches of fairways and greens into creeks for two
straight days. More than three inches (7.5 centimeters) of rain
fell locally Friday and Saturday.
	   ``Maybe this is the hangover for us from El Nino,'' Hugh Beath,
the general chairman of the Buick Classic, said Saturday. ``It's
very unusual for this part of the world.''
	   In addition to making life miserable for both golfers and
spectators, the tropical-like rainfall has hurt the Buick Classic
financially. Beath said ticket sales were down more than 25 percent
since the rain started Friday and concession sales were off more
than 50 percent.
	   ``It's terrible,'' he said.
	   Players got in less than six hours of golf Saturday between a
45-minute fog delay in the morning and a six-hour lightning and
rain suspension in the afternoon. That left 26 golfers who had yet
to complete their second round as play was called because of
darkness. They were to try and complete the second round Sunday
morning.
	   Furyk, who had eight birdies and no bogeys, said he was
fortunate to maintain his concentration and swing with the fits and
starts of a 14-hour day at the course Saturday.
	   ``I don't like doing anything for 14 hours,'' Furyk said. ``I
think my butt was flat from sitting on a hard bench in the
lockerroom all afternoon.''
	   Sutherland, the first-round leader after a 64, completed his
second-round 70 in the fading light.
	   Right behind Sutherland at seven under was J.P. Hayes, who was
two under through 13 holes Saturday when play ended.
	   Bob Tway, Jesper Parnevik and 49-year-old Bruce Fleisher, a
winner only once in 27 years of playing tour events, were tied at
6-under 136.
	   Fleisher, 1968 U.S. Amateur champion, said he hasn't been
playing that badly this year though he has only made two cuts in 11
tournaments and earned just dlrs 12,753. He shot a 68 Saturday.
	   ``It's just very difficult to focus and me not being in this
position very often doesn't help,'' said Fleisher, who took a nap
during the long rain delay Saturday. ``There were a lot of anxious
moments out there.''
	   Players hitting the fairway Saturday were again allowed to lift,
clean and place their ball one club length from where it landed
because of the soggy ground.

Threat of falling lights forces 30-minute evacuation in El Paso 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   EL PASO, Texas (AP) _ Gusty winds that threatened to collapse
light banks above the ring forced the hasty evacuation of the
ringside area during the undercard of the Oscar De La Hoya-Patrick
Charpentier fight at the Sun Bowl.
	   The entire ringside area was evacuated for about 30 minutes on
Saturday night after technicians warned that light banks some 30
feet (nine meters) above the ring were on the verge of collapse in
the gusty wind.
	   The evacuation occurred just after the first fight on the
undercard, more than two hours before De La Hoya was to defend his
WBC welterweight title against the French challenger.
	   Officials, spectators and ringside workers fled from the ring
area after a technician yelled a warning that the swaying light
banks suspended on four aluminum towers could come down, sending
banks of lights crashing ringside.
	   After the evacuation, workers lowered the light banks about
halfway. The fight card then continued with the second undercard
fight of the night.
	   The National Weather Service said wind gusted in excess of 35
mph (55 kmh) at the time.

Jamaicans psyched up for Croatia match 
</HEADLINE>
By LLOYD WILLIAMS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ It is doubtful that Jamaicans have ever
prepared for any event _ even hurricanes _ like they have for the
island's first World Cup soccer match against Croatia on Sunday.
	   Friends and family made firm arrangements where to meet to watch
the game on television. If it's at home, the refrigerator and
freezer are already stocked with Red Stripe beer or another brew of
choice.
	   Unless it's absolutely essential, trips to the countryside _ or
to the cities of Kingston or Montego Bay for that matter _ are out,
if it means missing the match.
	   And Jamaicans are confident that their Reggae Boyz, as the
national football team is known, will do them proud at Lens against
Croatia, five and one half times its size of 4,244 square miles and
almost twice its population of 2.5 million.
	   They are equally confident that ``David'' (Jamaica) will slay
the ``Goliaths'' of Argentina, 252 times its size and 13 1/2 times
its population, and Japan, 34 1/2 times its size and 50 times its
population, in matches on June 21 and June 26.
	   Dounting Thomases are silenced with the Jamaican expression,
``We little but we tallawah,'' meaning: ``Don't underestimate me; I
may be small but I'm dangerous.''
	   Soccer fans _ and everybody seems to be one these days _ discuss
the matches as if they have to do with the Reggae Boyz imposing
some sort of national accreditation on Jamaica's behalf on the
international scene.
	   It won't be surprising Sunday if sermons are cut short or church
attendance dips a bit. Whatever happens, no Sunday in Jamaica will
be like this Sunday.

Town goes wild over boxing's golden boy With Sports-Boxing-De La Hoya-Charpentier Evacuation 
</HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO MONTES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   EL PASO, Texas (AP) _ When a party lasts a week, you'd think it
would eventually run out of steam.
	   But with a guest of honor like Oscar De La Hoya and an
invitation list that appeared to include an entire city, El Paso
seemed like it would never stop celebrating.
	   Some 50,000 people were expected in the Sun Bowl on Saturday
night to watch De La Hoya defend his WBC welterweight title against
No. 1 challenger Patrick Charpentier of France. To a person,
excited fans agreed this was the city's biggest event in years.
	   ``The Cowboys were a big deal and the Rolling Stones, but this
is definitely bigger,'' said Millie Garcia, one of hundreds of
women who turned out to get a glimpse of De La Hoya.
	   The Dallas Cowboys, a U.S. football team, have scrimmaged twice
in the Sun Bowl, once before a sellout crowd, and the Rolling
Stones have also filled the stadium in recent years. De La Hoya's
fight topped them all when it came to excitement.
	   Unlike the other one-day events, De La Hoya's trip to El Paso
kicked off a weeklong frenzy that seemed to consume most of the
city, or at least the city's women.
	   Hundreds showed up to greet the Mexican boxer at the airport
Tuesday. Hundreds more crashed a ``secret'' workout Wednesday
apparently discovered by some young girls who followed De La Hoya's
tour bus through the city.
	   On Saturday, the Sun Bowl field disappeared under lights,
cameras and a voluminous tent shielding a party for some of the
city's notables, among others.
	   There was also unexpected excitement as wind gusting over 25 mph
(40 kph) buffeting the scaffolding supporting the lights over the
ring. As the metal bars swayed, security officials cleared ringside
seats and an undercard fight was delayed for about 20 minutes until
the scaffold could be secured.
	   Amid all this, the boxing match seemed almost incidental.
	   Except to people like Debbie O'Sullivan, a fight fan from
Sacramento, California, who trekked to El Paso because she thought
it was her best shot to watch a premiere event with a fighter like
De La Hoya.
	   ``I don't think it's possible for an ordinary person to get
tickets to a big fight,'' O'Sullivan said. ``We came here because
we figured this place was so big it would be easy to get tickets.''

Let the second-guessing begin; here comes AFI's Top 100 movie list AP Entertainment Writer 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo NY301
By MICHAEL FLEEMAN
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Tuesday night, the American Film Institute, a
film preservation and research group that is diving into film
promotion, will announce the top 100 American movies of the last
100 years.
	   That is, THEIR 100 top films. It's an admittedly subjective
movie-ranking enterprise that speaks as much to Hollywood hype and
commerce as it does to film appreciation.
	   The top-secret list will be revealed on a CBS television
special.
	   Then comes the special edition of Newsweek magazine, the cable
series, the big Blockbuster vide chain commercial tie-in, complete
with 6-foot (1.8-meter) kiosks in the stores, signs all over the
place, an Internet site and little gold stickers on the chosen 100
videos.
	   A collision of crass commercialism and art?
	   That's the movies, the medium of the unwashed masses from the
day the first dark little American film house opened in 1896 in
what is now Macy's Herald Square in New York City.
	   From the very beginning, movies were seen as a way to make a
dollar, and the ``Hundred Years ... Hundred Movies'' event holds
true to that tradition. The studios, the networks, the video stores
and even the unassailable AFI, a child of the 1960s, all have
financial agendas working.
	   Why else would the studios let the TV special and cable series
use their precious film clips for free?
	   But the larger issue is, what's the point of this list? And who
appointed the AFI as film god, anyway?
	   ``I think we've been clear that this is a subjective list,''
said AFI chief Jean Firstenberg. ``The reason that people will
really care is because they love the movies and they're passionate
about them and they're touched by them emotionally.''
	   The list has been a more closely guarded secret than the recipe
for the drug Viagra. The TV crews on the various programs on the
top 100 had to sign confidentiality agreements. Not even
promotional partner Blockbuster knows yet.
	   But early word from those who have seen the list is that it's an
invitation for rampant second-guessing since _ perhaps inevitably _
it suffers a modern slant.
	   ``It's weaker in terms of films in the '30s and '40s and the
silent era,'' said movie critic Richard Schickel, co-executive
producer of a 10-program TNT series on the list. ``People's
memories are short.''
	   Also cloaked in secrecy is who, exactly, voted on the thing.
	   According to AFI, a mega-panel of 1,500 movie industry figures,
from studio executives to critics (also included were President
Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore), was asked to choose the
best 100 movies from a ballot of 400 titles.
	   AFI won't say how many of the selected panelists actually cast
ballots, only that the response was ``overwhelming,'' or who _
except Clinton and Gore _ the actual voters were.
	   The ballot ranged from the earliest surviving silent, ``Richard
III'' (1912), which AFI recovered to much hoopla, to the 1996 movie
``The English Patient,'' a multiple winner of the Academy Award.
	   The nominees covered nearly all the recognized movie classics,
including ``Citizen Kane,'' ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' ``Casablanca''
and ``Gone With the Wind,'' which is being re-released theatrically
in restored form this summer.
	   There were a couple of obvious snubs on the ballot list,
including ``The Great Dictator,'' ``Seven Brides for Seven
Brothers'' and George Cukor's ``Born Yesterday.'' And there are
some surprising choices as well _ yes, ``Blazing Saddles'' is on
it, so is ``National Lampoon's Animal House.''
	   The voting criteria were sufficiently vague so that John Belushi
screaming ``food fight!'' in ``Animal House,'' while not likely to
make the top 10, could conceivably land in the top 100.
	   This won't be the only film list out there. The Library of
Congress has its own with the National Film Registry.
	   And it certainly won't be the only look-back list of any sort,
as the approaching millennium has us scrambling to take stock of
just what we've gotten ourselves into here on Earth.
	   But no list will have been accompanied by so much hype.
	   ``It just permeates our stores,'' said Blockbuster spokeswoman
Karen Raskopf, referring to AFI promotional materials. ``When you
go into Blockbuster this summer, you are not going to miss it.''
	   Of course, the Dallas-based video chain is motivated by more
than love of movie history. It recently pulled itself out of a
financial slump by increasing stocks of new releases through
controversial revenue sharing with several studios. It hopes now to
start moving the older models.
	   ``That speaks to revenue right there,'' said Raskopf.
	   The AFI also is seeking financial salvation from the top 100
event. The 30-year-old organization founded by President Lyndon
Johnson has suffered money problems in recent years, with its
funding from the National Endowment for the Arts plummeting from
dlrs 4 million a year to a paltry dlrs 100,000.
	   Without new income, the group, that until now has been known
primarily for its modest broadcasts of the Lifetime Achievement
Awards, is in danger of extinction.
	   And, finally, the studios are looking at the top 100 as a new
way to make money off the old movies gathering dust in their vast
libraries.
	   It was this opportunity that helped persuade studios to waive
their normally steep broadcast fees for the film clips to be used
in the AFI shows.
	   Said Schickel: ``I think it serves everybody's interest to do
this.''

Blockbuster Impressionist exhibit opening in Toronto

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ One Toronto hotel is offering ``The Great
Impressionist Get-Away.'' Another has deluxe rooms available
through its Vincent van Gogh Package. Blockbuster season is here.
	   One of the top art exhibits in North America this summer opened
Wednesday at the Art Gallery of Ontario _ 80 Impressionist and
post-Impressionist masterpieces from the Courtauld Institute in
London. Highlights include works by Manet, Degas, Cezanne, Monet,
Renoir and van Gogh.
	   While the Courtauld gallery undergoes renovation, its prized
collection has been sent on tour to only two cities _ first to
Kyoto, Japan, and now to Toronto for a three-month stay until Sept.
20.
	   It is a coup for the Art Gallery of Ontario, which obtained the
exclusive North American showing despite strong interest expressed
by some U.S. art museums.
	   Maxwell L. Anderson, director of the Toronto museum, said
Courtauld officials made the choice in part because of past
cooperation between the two institutions. Another factor, he said,
was the museum's success in drawing huge crowds when the popular
Barnes Collection came to Toronto during its five-city world tour
in 1994.
	   Anderson, an American who moved to Toronto three years ago, said
he hopes the Courtauld Collection will draw more than 400,000
visitors _ including many from the United States.
	   Among the many notable works in the show are Manet's ``A Bar at
the Folies-Bergere,'' depicting a bar girl whose sad eyes contrast
with the festive surroundings, and Georges Seurat's ``Young Woman
Powdering Herself,'' an eye-catching display of pointillist
technique.
	   One of the two versions of Manet's famous ``Le Dejeuner Sur
L'Herbe'' also is on hand.
	   Many of the paintings toured the United States a decade ago, but
have never been seen in Canada.
	   The collection was amassed between 1923 and 1929 by Samuel
Courtauld, chairman of a successful British silk manufacturing
firm. He founded the Courtauld Institute of Art at the University
of London in 1931.
	   The Art Gallery of Ontario, with sponsorship help from Chrysler
Canada, is spending millions of dollars to mount and promote the
show. Anderson said he expects the museum to more than recoup its
costs through sales of tickets, food and merchandise.
	   A whole line of Courtauld Collection products has been designed
for sale at the museum shop, including jewelry, scarves, tiles,
chocolate in the shape of a champagne bottle, an educational card
game and tutus like those in Degas' luminous ``Ballet Scene.''

German cellist Siegfried Palm sees career end looming, but plays on 
</HEADLINE>
By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Siegfried Palm figures he has about
four years left as a concert musician, but the German cellist isn't
looking back.
	   ``String players mostly stop at 75. Conductors maybe go on until
they are 100 or have died but do not know it,'' the 71-year-old
Palm says. ``Pianists can go on and on, like (Artur) Rubinstein.
But for strings the fingers tend to go at 75. You lose control,
intonation and pitch.''
	   Palm hasn't lost any of those yet, as proven by the cheers of
fellow cellists at the Manchester International Cello Festival last
month.
	   The biennial event at the Royal Northern College of Music was
founded in 1988 by one of its faculty members, the American cellist
Ralph Kirshbaum.
	   Over its five days, the festival this year attracted almost
2,500 people who performed, demonstrated, discussed or simply
listened to some of the best cellists in the world.
	   Twenty-five invited leading cellists from 14 countries
enraptured audiences with their playing, their master classes and
discussions about the cello and its repertoire.
	   Five world premieres of new compositions for the cello were
performed, one of them by Cheryl Frances-Hoad, a 17-year-old Briton
who is still at school.
	   The discerning audience cheered Palm's performance of
``Capriccio,'' composed for him in 1968 by Krysztof Penderecki. It
not only required notes on the strings, but also tapping rhythmic
passages with his bow on the cello's body.
	   He showed similar mastery of the tough ``Sonata for solo
cello,'' which the late Bernd Alois Zimmermann wrote for him in
1960.
	   Short, tubby and cheerful, Palm becomes one with his cello,
which looks almost larger than him when he sits, jabs the endpin in
the floor, shoots his cuffs, shrugs his right shoulder and begins
to play fiendishly difficult modern music.
	   ``Zimmermann is very demanding,'' he says. ``Maybe that piece of
his is the most complicated contemporary work for cello. He is
difficult, but that was his job.''
	   Among the composers who have accepted commissions from Palm, or
dedicated works to him, are Yennis Xenakis, Sven-Erik Back, York
Holler, Gyorgy Ligeti and Wofgang Rihn.
	   Palm leaves them free to follow their own inspirations and never
discusses a commission. His commitment is simply to modern music.
	   ``There must always be new music and it must be played for music
to progress, even though audiences might find it too demanding,''
he says.
	   In his long career, Palm was principal cellist in orchestras in
Cologne, Hamburg and Luebeck between 1946 and 1968, and has also
played chamber music. He has directed the State Convervatoire in
Cologne and the Deutsche Oper in Berlin.
	   ``When I'm 75, I will have been playing for 70 years as I
started at 5,'' Palm says. He enjoys a story told by Mischa Elman,
the Russian-American violinist.
	   ``When he was 75, he said, `When I was 5, they said he plays
beautifully for his age _ and the same they say now.' It is a good
story.''

South Koreans disappointed after national team defeated by Mexico 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Millions of South Koreans stayed up
long past midnight Sunday watching television only to be
disappointed as their national team was beaten by Mexico in an
opening World Cup soccer match in France.
	   Millions of viewers fell ``from heaven to hell'' as South
Korea's 1-0 lead in the first half of the game dissolved, leading
to a 3-1 defeat, the country's Yonhap news agency said.
	   This year marks South Korea's fifth appearance in the World Cup
finals, but the national team has yet to win a match enabling it to
advance to the second round. It now faces games against two even
tougher teams, Belgium and Netherlands.
	   ``The wall for one victory was high,'' Hankook Ilbo newspaper
said. Another newspaper, Dong-ah Ilbo, characterized the game
against Mexico as a ``shocking defeat'' which shattered South
Korea's hope for making it to the second round.
	   Lee Seung-woo, an employee of a South Korean trading company
said, ``I am really disappointed.''
	   ``We all hoped for a victory that would help lift our spirit
amid a very difficult time,'' he said in reference to the country's
recent economic crisis.
	   Some analysts criticized the game strategy employed by South
Korean team coach Cha Bum-keun.
	   ``It is a failure of strategy. The South Korean players focused
too much on defense in the second half, so the Mexicans led the
game completely,'' said Shin Moon-sun, a television soccer
commentator.

Robert Barnard internationally known for wit, plot surprises, observation AP Newsfeatures Writer 
</HEADLINE>
AP PHOTO NY372
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ By his own description, Robert Barnard is a
mystery writer with ``an eye for human awfulness.''
	   The Englishman's most recent book, ``No Place of Safety,''
concerns the stabbing of a man who runs a shelter for homeless
adolescents in Leeds, England. His 30th book, it was published by
Scribner in May.
	   Called on to investigate the homicide is Detective Constable
Charlie Peace, whom Barnard named after an infamous 19th century
murderer.
	   When he first put Peace in a book, ``Bodies'' in 1986, he was an
ordinary fellow, an attendant at a gym. But, says Barnard, ``I
liked him. That's why I exercised my authorial prerogative and put
him in the police force at the end of the book. He is a pathologic
observer of human foibles _ like his author.''
	   He continues: ``I had to move him to Yorkshire. He is quite
happy there. Being black, he stands out in little Yorkshire
villages where you see comparatively few blacks. It is rather an
advantage that he looks at most things from the outside.''
	   Peace is one of three series characters Barnard has used.
Another, Peregrine Trethowan, is a Scotland Yard superintendent.
The third came as an inspiration while Barnard was listening to
music one night.
	   He remembered that Mozart had spent some time in England as a
boy, and thought: ``What if Mozart had stayed on?'' Under the pen
name Bernard Bastable, which he uses for mysteries set in the past,
Barnard has written two fictional adventures for the composer,
ignoring his return to Vienna and his death at 35.
	   ``In my books, Mozart teaches Princess Victoria to play the
piano,'' says Barnard, who allows the composer to reach old age.
	   The newest Bastable book, ``A Mansion and its Murder,'' set from
the end of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th, was
published in May by Carroll and Graf. Bastable mysteries don't sell
as well as the books under Barnard's real name in America and
Britain, the author says, but they're popular in Germany and
France.
	   Barnard spoke in New York, where he recently attended the
Mystery Writers of America annual banquet. Then it was on to
Washington, D.C., for Malice Domestic, a convention for writers of
whodunits, where he was guest of honor.
	   Critics like Barnard.
	   ``Sardonic wit and crystalline prose,'' said a 1991 Philadelphia
Inquirer review of ``A Scandal in Belgravia.'' It praised his
writing style and credited him with ``insight into the vagaries of
human behavior that is rare.''
	   Americans tend to think that most British mystery writers are
women. In the past they were, Barnard says.
	   ``We had a lot of middle-class women supervising running of the
home, with a lot of brains and time on their hands. There were
Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, Margery Allingham, even Ngaio
Marsh in New Zealand looking after her ailing father, being a long
way from anywhere, probably bored out of her mind and starting to
write. Plotting elaborate crimes can be combined with hoovering a
floor.''
	   Barnard's plots also borrow from his daily life. Take the book
he has just finished, ``The Corpse at the Haworth Tandoori.''
	   The author explains: ``The title is an Indian restaurant in the
place the Brontes lived. I'm chairman of the Bronte Society, so I'm
in Haworth quite frequently, walking around the area.''
	   In that book, he writes about a junior cabinet minister in the
Blair government.
	   ``When he gets home one night, he finds a grubby postcard on his
doormat with a cryptic message: `Who do you think you are?' It's
ambiguous.
	   ``It might mean you're getting too big for your boots. It might
mean you don't know who your parents are,'' Barnard says, letting
the mystery stand except to add: ``Quite often people have to go
into their past and origins to get at the truth.''
	   In ``Out of the Blackout,'' many readers' favorite Barnard, a
little boy arrives with a party of evacuees in wartime, with no
evidence of who he is. As a grown-up, he starts looking into his
background.
	   Barnard grew up in Essex, a shy child. But something in him
changed by the time he finished Oxford.
	   Barnard wrote his first mystery, ``Death of an Old Goat,'' while
living in Norway with his Australian wife, Louise. He set the story
in Australian academia, a milieu he experienced while working on a
Ph.D. and teaching English literature.
	   Since 1983, the Barnards have lived in Leeds, where he writes
from October through March and says he always has a corpse,
murderer and motive in mind before he begins.
	   Barnard's father, a onetime farm laborer, produced romance
novels from the 1930s until he died in the late 1960s.
	   ``So writing was in my background,'' says Barnard. And again,
his background is in his writing: his 1987 book, ``The Cherry
Blossom Corpse,'' is set at an international convention of romance
writers in Norway.
	   In many of his books there is what he calls ``a sudden
surprise.'' Something you've taken for granted all through the book
turns out not to be so _ though it's not necessarily who the
murderer is.
	   ``You can't do it all the time,'' he says. ``If you did always
do it, it would become sort of a trick and everybody would be
waiting for it.''
	   While readers like his surprises, some have complained his
characters are often unlikable.
	   ``People have said that before,'' he acknowledges, but with a
tone of surprise. ``I like them. But, if you have a group of
suspects, you don't want to have Mary Poppins-type characters
considered as possible murderers.
	   ``On the whole, I like murdering unpleasant people just because
lots of people around them can have a motive.''

Images have made creator a hot commodity, but are they art?

	   CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (AP) _ Look closely at the hundreds of
tiny images and you'll see a polar bear, a passion flower and a
bunch of necklaces.
	   Then step back and see the animals and flowers and necklaces
melt into a larger picture. It's an image of Jesus Christ.
	   This is the work of Robert Silvers, work that changes before
your eyes, depending on where you're standing.
	   The 29-year-old began creating his so-called photomosaics when
he was a student at the Media Lab at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. He developed software that allows him to assemble them
and patented the program when he graduated in 1996.
	   Less than two years after he started his company, Runaway
Technology Inc., he says he's commanding dlrs 75,000 a commission
and turning down 90 percent of offers.
	   ``I decided that I want to do everything myself,'' he says. ``I
don't want a factory like Andy Warhol.''
	   Many of the commissions are commercial. Paramount Pictures used
a Silvers photomosaic on the movie poster for ``The Truman Show.''
A mosaic of Princess Diana appeared on the year-end cover of
Newsweek magazine. And Silvers' work is used in Absolut vodka and
Audi ads.
	   Silvers has the pallor of someone who works at night and spends
his days indoors. He wears leather pants, a leather jacket and
combat boots that don't quite go with his small, shy face. During
an interview, he never cracked a smile, even when asked.
	   To create a mosaic, Silvers first scans into his computer the
overall image he wants to reproduce _ a Vincent van Gogh
self-portrait or a dollar bill for example.
	   He then scans a bunch of photos that he'll use like tiles to
build up his creation. His computer breaks down the larger image
into hundreds or thousands of rectangles. Then it replaces each
rectangle with the tile that best matches it for light and shading.
	   Sometimes people are criticized for not seeing the forest for
the trees, but in Silvers' photomosaics, the trees are often as
fascinating as the forest.
	   To take a couple of examples: John Wilkes Booth's face appears
in the cheek of Abraham Lincoln, the U.S. president whom Booth
assassinated, and an image of Princess Diana is made entirely of
roses.
	   Silvers gets a lot of his stock photos _ which include a
remarkable number of wildlife images _ from the public domain. But
he can also get creative when he needs new images.
	   When he was looking for a way to render a dollar bill into a
mosaic he turned to a bank.
	   ``I went to the local bank and I asked for one piece of every
foreign currency they had,'' he says.
	   Silvers wants to be seen more as an artist than as a software
designer. He created his software to render the image the way he
would see it; after the computer finishes its first draft, Silvers
changes as many as one-third of the individual tiles to get the
overall effect he wants.
	   ``At a distance I might see a tile that sticks out in a way I
don't like, or up close I might see a tile with a subject matter I
don't like,'' he says.
	   But with his images showing up in ads and magazine covers _
never mind puzzles and posters _ Silvers has trouble convincing
some in the art world.
	   Marjorie Jacobson, an independent art curator in Boston who is
writing a book on art and new media, says Silvers' work does not
fall into her definition of art.
	   ``It's very technologically smart and it's very
design-oriented,'' she says, ``but I don't think it has the kind of
content that makes it art.''
	   Eight of Silvers' works will be hung in Chicago's Museum of
Science and Industry in a temporary exhibition starting July 16. He
says art dealers have shown an interest, but no art museums have
been buying.
	   But others have.
	   Besides originals which go for thousands, he says orders for his
dlrs 12 posters are coming in faster than he can produce them.

Laura Linney is no instant pudding

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Laura Linney is in the cross hairs of a dozen
video cameras.
	   She pauses on a sun-drenched corner of Central Park as idle
gawkers and tourists scramble to line her up in their viewfinders:
A real-life celebrity! Or a model! Or... something!
	   The gawkers soon hesitate, puzzled.
	   ``They have no idea who I am,'' says Linney lightly, her dimples
puckering.
	   Nonetheless, the cameras keep whirring.
	   The irony of the scene doesn't escape Linney, who currently
appears as Jim Carrey's bubbly wife in ``The Truman Show'' _ where
cameras are quite literally everywhere.
	   Unlike her red-hot co-star _ ``Jim's in that tornado of fame'' _
the curbside attention is still novel for Linney, who has spent the
last decade becoming an ``overnight success.''
	   ``Most of the time people don't recognize me,'' she says. ``I'll
have no makeup on my face, jeans and a T-shirt and my hair's up _ I
look like I just rolled out of bed. No one knows who I am. I don't
even get a look or anything. There's something really nice about
that.''
	   On this afternoon, at least, Linney, 34, looks the part of a
bona fide movie star as she strides through the park in an elegant,
zucchini-colored Donna Karan suit and strappy black shoes.
	   Tell her this and Linney laughs, producing for inspection her
left foot. Three toes are wrapped in neon yellow Band-Aids
featuring Casper the Friendly Ghost _ casualties of a recent
chafing incident with a pair of very expensive Italian pumps.
	   ``Some movie star, huh?'' she says.
	   She's that _ and much more. Over the next few weeks, you can
also catch Linney performing twice a day on a Broadway stage in
``Honour,'' a play about marital infidelity, and on Showtime aboard
the sequel to the award-winning PBS miniseries adapted from
Armistead Maupin's ``Tales of the City.''
	   ``I'm one of those people who has just sort of been around for a
while now, and the work has been accumulating to the point where
people are beginning to make connections,'' she says.
	   With her straight blonde hair and peaches-and-cream complexion,
Linney looks like a cross between Helen Hunt and the singer Jewel.
She's an Ivy League-educated actress who seems best suited to
playing intelligent, professional women: Think Meryl Streep rather
than Jenny McCarthy.
	   Overexposure is hardly a concern. Even with the success of ``The
Truman Show,'' Linney is determined to remain just below the
celebrity radar a little while longer.
	   ``There are some real advantages to being right under there. I
used to be in such extreme denial about the fact that I was
actually having a career, that I was actually a successful actress.
It's a very hard thing for me to accept in a weird way,'' she says.
	   ``When you watch people struggle their whole life, you see how
unfair it is when, all of a sudden, you're one of the lucky ones.
It's hard to step into that without feeling unsure about it and
unreal about it. I have to let go of that and let myself enjoy that
fact that, yes, it is happening,'' she says. ``I sort of have to
grow up in a way.''
	   Linney matured her craft on the stage. After winning raves for
``Sight Unseen,'' she next appeared on Broadway in ``The Seagull,''
with Ethan Hawke, Tyne Daly and Jon Voight, ``Six Degrees of
Separation'' with Stockard Channing and ``Hedda Gabler'' with Kelly
McGillis.
	   ``I grew up in the theater. My father's a playwright. I feel
safe there _ it's what I know,'' she says. ``I was really
intimidated by film and television _ just scared to death of it. I
didn't know it, I didn't know the people, I didn't understand it. I
was scared of moving to California: Ahhhhh! Fortunately, I got over
that.''
	   But was California ready? Linney recalls finally going West for
auditions with her head high and a shelf full of stage awards.
	   ``I'll never forget the first time I went to L.A. I was so proud
of my theater resume. So proud!'' she says. ``And I went into this
room and this woman was like, 'OK, Laura. Well, you really haven't
done anything, have you?'''
	   Smallish roles in films like ``Dave'' and ``Searching for Bobby
Fisher'' led to larger, supporting parts in ``Absolute Power'' with
Clint Eastwood and ``Primal Fear'' with Richard Gere. Hollywood was
still a little wary: Paramount Pictures once asked her to cram all
of her complex scenes into one grueling, all-day audition.
	   ``There are a lot of directors who want `It'. They want instant
pudding. They want `It'! And they don't fully trust that someone
like me will be able to get there,'' she says.
	   ``So people do have a hard time pinning me down: 'Well, she's
blonde ... so maybe she's cold. That's it! She's cold! She's blonde
and she's cold!' I got that for a while. Then, the latest round I
went through was, 'She's not sexy.' Well, what do you say to that?
I mean, what do you say to that?''
	   In 1995, Linney finally got her starring role _ in the dlrs 60
million mutant-gorillas-in-the-mist epic ``Congo,'' where she
scampered down hillsides waving a laser-gun at deformed apes.
Savaged by critics, the film did quite well at the box office.
	   ``It's taken me a while to be comfortable with it. It took me
enough time when I was growing up just to say I wanted to be an
actress. It's taken me now seven years of professional work to be
able to say I really enjoy making films,'' she says with a sigh.
	   ``God knows it ain't boring.''

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Picture a stage full of dancers, arms strangely
stiff and feet tapping rapid-fire in unison. Ankles twitch
impossibly this way and that. Straight legs kick waist-high to the
rollicking rhythms of traditional Irish music.
	   ``Riverdance,'' right?
	   Wrong.
	   Before ``Riverdance,'' the flashy show that made dancer Michael
Flatley a household name, there was Trinity. As in the Trinity
Irish Dance Company of Chicago.
	   For nearly a decade, Trinity has pushed the boundaries of
traditional Irish step-dancing, infusing it with elements of
ballet, tap, modern dance and world rhythms to create a new genre.
	   Guided by artistic director Mark Howard, it has gone from church
halls to some of the nation's most prestigious dance forums,
including New York's venerable Joyce Theater. Stops planned on
upcoming tours include London and Taiwan.
	   Trinity eschews the glitz and self-promotion associated with
``Riverdance'' and Flatley. Yet comparisons are inevitable.
	   ``There would be no `Riverdance' if there were no Trinity,''
says Philadelphia dance presenter Randy Schwartz.
	   Trinity, he says, is the pure form. ``You see the sort of guts
of where it came from. It's glorious.''
	   The similarities don't end there. Howard, an accomplished step
dancer, trained at the same suburban Chicago dance school that
Flatley attended a few years earlier.
	   And ``Riverdance'' contains routines reminiscent of Trinity
creations. In one, dancers wear stark black leotards instead of the
traditional colorfully embroidered costumes.
	   In another, they tap-dance a capella in stunning unison. In
``Riverdance'' this routine is called ``Distant Thunder.''
Trinity's is called ``Celtic Thunder,'' and youngsters from
Howard's dance academy performed it on the U.S. late night
television show ``The Tonight Show'' several years before
``Riverdance.''
	   ``You really can't copyright dance,'' Howard says, but he
bristles at the idea that Flatley doesn't give Trinity its due.
Indeed, the first time he saw ``Riverdance,'' the similarities
floored him.
	   Flatley spokeswoman Carri McClure declined to comment.
	   Howard, with intense hazel-green eyes and rapid speech bordering
on stream of consciousness, knows his criticism sounds like sour
grapes. At the same time, he credits ``Riverdance'' with
contributing to a soaring interest in Celtic dance.
	   Like many things Irish, the origins of step-dancing are wrapped
in myth.
	   Some say it evolved from English oppression that forbade the
Irish to celebrate their culture. Children were taught to dance
with their upper bodies rigid so English soldiers passing the
windows wouldn't see them breaking the rules. Wearing clunky-heeled
shoes, they tapped loud and furious in defiance.
	   Howard added his own revelation: That traditional Irish dance
could be blended with other dance forms, ethnic as well as
mainstream and avant-garde.
	   That blending, says Angela Graham, a Temple University dance
scholar, is part of what makes Trinity ``interesting and important.
``Their skill is just phenomenal, and they're obviously having a
great time.''
	   Howard, an admirer of the lively Ballet Folklorico de Mexico and
modern dance, helped his students update Irish dance, sometimes
erasing old taboos.
	   ``We were finally able to lift our arms from our sides _ it was
really liberating'' said Sheila Ryan, 22, one of Trinity's original
dancers.
	   Trinity's seeds were planted in 1979 when Howard, then a
17-year-old high school student, started an Irish dance school with
20 students in a Catholic church on Chicago's North Side. Within
six years his dancers won a second-place silver medal at the world
championships in Ireland.
	   The next year they were disqualified for departing from
tradition. Over the years, judges have either loved them for their
exquisitely executed jigs, reels and hornpipes, or scorned their
innovations.
	   ``We were always looked upon as the black sheep of Irish dance,
but everybody couldn't wait until we were there,'' Howard says.
	   In 1987, Trinity students won a gold medal for team dancing _
the first time a group from outside Ireland had won the top prize.
That recognition landed them on the ``The Tonight Show.''
	   Trinity has an unequaled 17 world titles. Howard formed
Trinity's professional company in 1990 so the school's highly
trained dancers could move beyond amateur competitions.
	   Most of the company's 35 dancers studied at Trinity and grew up
together there. That chemistry shows on stage.
	   ``You're keeping time with each other, checking the times,
checking the revolutions for the turns,'' says Michaela McGarry,
19, a college sophomore who started dancing at 9 and joined the
company in high school. ``That we can do that is a testament to our
relationships with each other.''

Japan found to have used poison gas in World War II: report 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese troops were found to have used poison gas
against Chinese military forces during World War II, a Japanese
newspaper reported Sunday, citing government documents on war
crimes trials held in China.
	   The Japanese Foreign Ministry documents released Saturday
include reports on a postwar Chinese court verdict which found
Japanese military officers guilty of using poison gas on a northern
China battlefield in May of 1942, the Mainichi newspaper reported.
	   The reports detail the outcome of a war crimes trial held in
communist China from 1946 to 1949, the paper said.
	   Japan has said its wartime army manufactured and stored poison
gas in China, but it has not acknowledged that any chemical weapons
were actually used. China has said Japan used poison gas 2,900
times during World War II, killing thousands Chinese soldiers and
civilians.
	   As a signatory of last year's Chemical Weapons Convention treaty
banning chemical weapons, Japan has agreed to clean up stockpiles
of poison gas which were abandoned in China by the former Imperial
Japanese Army.

Five questions with Kelly Macdonald: Her film resume is growing Eds note: 'Cousin Bette' opened Friday 
</HEADLINE>
With AP Photos NY347, NY352
By CAROL DEEGAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Kelly Macdonald's film career had a
serendipitous start.
	   Her first role was in Danny Boyle's ``Trainspotting.'' She won
the part of Diane after going to an open call for the film in her
hometown of Glasgow, Scotland.
	   Macdonald was getting ready to apply to drama school when
several friends encouraged her to audition. ``So I thought, 'I'll
go along into this and see what an audition is like.' I wasn't sort
of going for the part. I wasn't going along thinking I would ever
sort of be in film.''
	   She paused, somewhat bemused. ``It went quite well.''
	   Macdonald was called back for several readings including one
with Ewan McGregor, the star of the film. ``I didn't look up. I
didn't look at anybody. I kept the script right in front of my
face. Then I got called back again to do a screen test, which was
really surprising.''
	   ``By that point, I wanted the part,'' Macdonald said. ``And I
really wanted to give it my best shot. So when I left that screen
test, I had done my best. At least I'd tried, and if I didn't get
it, then I knew that I'd done my best.''
	   Fast forward to late spring 1998. Macdonald, 22, has almost a
dozen films to her credit. She's abandoned plans for drama school
and has moved to London. And in a complete change of pace from
``Trainspotting,'' she's one of the stars in ``Cousin Bette,''
based on the novel by Honore de Balzac. The cast also includes
Jessica Lange, Elisabeth Shue and Bob Hoskins.
	   Hortense, her character in ``Cousin Bette,'' falls to ruin after
scheming to marry a handsome young artist that Bette wanted for
herself. ``Well, she's quite naughty, really, isn't she?'' said
Macdonald from her home in London. But unlike Hortense, Macdonald's
star is clearly on the rise.
	   1. How would you describe your experience filming
``Trainspotting''?
	   Macdonald: I didn't have any experience to judge it by. I didn't
realize that there was a buzz about it, like on the set and
everything. Everyone was working toward the same thing, and nobody
was working on it just to pay their mortgage or anything. Everyone
really was enjoying it, before the camera and behind, and it was
only after I finished and I got more films, I realized that was
quite an unusual experience.
	   2. Did you think your role in ``Trainspotting'' would lead to
other films?
	   Macdonald: I didn't really have time to think about it. I was a
nervous wreck for two or three months. ... I didn't expect it to go
anywhere afterward. I wanted it to, but I thought I was still going
to go to drama school after that.
	   2 1-2 . You didn't go to drama school, did you?
	   Macdonald: No, no, no. I'm absolutely trying to avoid it. I'm
doing OK, actually. I'm beginning to realize that more and more
actors haven't been to drama school. I thought it was a necessary
sort of thing to do, but it's not. I think you either can do it or
you can't.
	   3. What was it like to wear heavy costumes and wigs in ``Cousin
Bette''?
	   Macdonald: It was very hot when we were filming. Very, very hot.
And a sort of common feeling was this trickle of sweat going down
my front, inside the dress. It felt like a wee beastie.
	   4. What about the corsets?
	   Macdonald: It was hard to get used to wearing the corsets
really. I found myself even at nighttime, when I was going out for
dinner after filming, I would be still be holding myself in because
you're so used to it. And Gabriella (Pescucci), who was head of
costumes ... I would try my hardest to keep my stomach out when she
fitting the costumes on to fool her into thinking that she'd done
it properly, but she caught on quick and she'd say 'tighter,
tighter.'
	   4 1-2 . What about your costumes as compared with those of
Elisabeth Shue, who plays a Parisian burlesque star?
	   Macdonald: I think I had more costumes than anybody else.
Chocolate and strawberries, she wore.
	   5. You've done some film work in Los Angeles. What do you think
of Los Angeles as compared with Glasgow and London?
	   Macdonald: You can't even say them in the same sentence really.
Just completely different. ... Driving around L.A., it's a bit
fascinating, everything is so flat. Other than that, I'm just very
suspicious of the whole place. I think it's not really even houses,
it's just sort of the fronts of houses, and there's people
tee-heeing behind and sort of thinking, 'she thinks she's in a
town. Ha Ha. We're just pretending. There's no people actually
there.'

Smythe was creator of `Andy Capp' comic strip 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Cartoonist Reg Smythe, creator of the widely
publicized comic strip ``Andy Capp,'' has died, Britain's Press
Association reported. He was 81.
	   Smythe drew his stories of Capp, an idle male chauvinist, from
the northern England town of Hartlepool, where he lived his entire
life. He died of cancer Saturday morning, the national news agency
said.
	   Capp's antics were the scourge of feminists groups, but many
readers in Britain, the United States and elsewhere found humor in
his foolish ways.
	   Smythe once said he modeled Capp's character on his father, and
Capp's long-suffering wife, Flo, on his mother.
	   The strip began running in northern editions of the Daily Mirror
in 1957 but quickly became a national feature. It was later picked

	   Ken Layson, the Mirror's cartoon editor, said Smythe left a
year's worth of cartoons.
	   ``He was just there waiting. The next door neighbor. The bloke
in the local. Andy Capp's all over the place,'' Smythe once said.

Like his medium, comics grand master is unrecognized in his own land

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ He revolutionized the comics, but you've likely
never heard of Will Eisner.
	   Most in the medium agree: ``The Spirit,'' a superhero strip
appearing in no more than 20 newspapers 50 years ago, turned the
comics from a pidgin of pulp fiction and cheesecake drawings into a
language with its own vocabulary and syntax.
	   Though feted in Europe, Eisner is neglected in the United
States, reflecting the orphan status of his medium in its homeland.
	   Hoping to redress that imbalance, Kitchen Sink, a comics
publishing house that specializes in grown-up and historical
material, has launched ``The Spirit: The New Adventures.'' The
third issue of tributes by an array of industry stars hit the
stands May 27.
	   ``Will Eisner is the single person most responsible for giving
comics its brains,'' said Alan Moore, a British writer celebrated
for his work on ``Watchmen'' and ``Swamp Thing.''
	   Decades before Art Spiegelman's ``Maus'' cast Nazis as cats and
Jews as mice, Eisner was exploring how comics more than any other
medium had the potential to expose truths about the culture by
subverting familiar icons.
	   ``He was an early master of the German Expressionist approach in
comic books,'' Jules Feiffer once wrote of Eisner.
	   Eisner, 81 and still working, hopes the paean will help
establish a legitimacy for comic books, an art form he had made his
life's work in his native land.
	   ``I see the beginnings of the medium becoming `adult' here,'' he
said on a recent visit to New York, the model for ``The Spirit'''s
mood-infested Central City.
	   He cites as examples the work of Frank Miller, whose successful
``Dark Knight'' Batman series 15 years ago inspired film director
Tim Burton, and the Hernandez brothers' acclaimed magic-realist
``Love and Rockets'' series.
	   It's a realization of what Eisner set out to do in 1940 when he
left the still-infant comic book industry to pitch a new type of
Sunday comic supplement to newspapers: a whole comic book with
three lengthy, self-contained stories. He hoped to reach adults
through the newspapers. At the time, comic books were seen as
strictly for kids.
	   He wanted to combine the pace and length of comic book stories
with the seriousness and technique that had been confined to a few
newspaper comics.
	   He acquired enough subscribers to sustain his studio, and
entertain ambitions of revolutionizing the form. Soon, the impact
of ``The Spirit'' was being felt throughout the industry.
	   Before Eisner, a page of comics _ in a comic book or in a Sunday
comics section _ was a bland affair, nine or 12 square panels of
equal size, occasionally broken up by a circular panel.
Compositions were standard, as if shot by a primitive fixed camera.
	   Eisner began thinking of the ``rhythm'' of a page, how panels
could be manipulated to suggest speed (small panels running into
each other) climax (two or three small panels, then a large one),
even nausea (panels cast at odd angles).
	   ``Eisner wouldn't worry about varying the design of the page,''
said Dave Gibbons, Moore's ``Watchmen'' partner and a ``Spirit''
contributor. ``One page had 20 pictures, followed by a page with
three tall pictures on it.''
	   Eisner also borrowed unsettling shooting angles from the movies.
From the static panels of a few years earlier, now scenes could be
perceived through skylights, or from below a sewer grate.
	   He was the first to use ``silent'' _ balloonless _ panels to
emphasize emotions, by focusing the reader's attentions on finely
wrought facial expressions. He abandoned the blood and guts
approach he helped invent in the 1930s for a gentler, more quixotic
story.
	   The Spirit _ a coroner named Denny Colt believed murdered by a
mad scientist's potion, but actually buried alive _ became less
important than the other characters in each story.
	   With a sensitive ear for dialogue, Eisner addressed topics
considered unthinkable in comic books and rarely seen, at the time,
in newspaper comics: wife beating, tax audits, urban blight, graft.
	   By 1952, Eisner grew tired of the strip, and newsprint prices
made it less profitable. He disappeared into educational
publishing.
	   But like his hero, his legacy would not die. His techniques,
considered revolutionary a few years earlier, had become standard,
first in the hugely popular E.C. horror comics of the 1950s, then
in the Marvel comics that revitalized the industry in the 1960s.
His influence eventually seeped into the more conservative
newspaper comics.
	   Still, a modicum of recognition had to wait until 1965, when
Feiffer, gaining attention as a political cartoonist, a playwright
and a screenwriter, celebrated the comics as his primary influence
in ``The Great Comic Book Heroes.''
	   ``(Eisner's) world seemed more real than the world of other
comic book men. He was a cartoonist other cartoonists swiped
from,'' Feiffer said.
	   Feiffer's praise prompted comic book fans to start searching,
and soon reprints of ``The Spirit,'' bootleg and legitimate,
appeared, to influence a whole new generation of emerging comics
artists.
	   Artists as diverse as Miller and Robert Crumb acknowledge Eisner
as a primary influence.
	   Yet, while Crumb was the subject of a successful documentary,
and Feiffer has earned a retrospective at the Smithsonian
Institution, Eisner remains uncelebrated beyond the faithful who
gather at comics conventions _ at least in the United States.
	   Eisner recently addressed the Academy of Fine Arts in Bologna,
discussing his published treatises on what he prefers to call
``sequential art.'' In Amsterdam, a popular cafe is named for ``The
Spirit.'' French comics critic Maurice Horn calls Eisner's
influence tremendous.
	   The interest in ``The Spirit'' 20 years ago helped rekindle
Eisner's career. His most recent graphic novel, due to appear this
summer, ``A Family Matter,'' deals with assisted suicide.
	   Eisner may be the last of the pioneers of the American medium
that was born in the last, raucous decade of the 19th century.
Together with Mad Magazine founder Harvey Kurtzman, he gave comics
syncopation and improvisation.

Actress juggles roles in `ER' and `Working' and a one-woman New York show

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Yvette Freeman was in New York City the other
day and learned a lesson in the power of television.
	   A subway brakeman saw her board his train and, in a move certain
to delay many riders, he ``kept the doors open, came in and asked
for my autograph,'' she recalled.
	   This underground encounter can be attributed to ``ER,'' NBC's
smash hit on Thursday nights. Miss Freeman portrays nurse Haleh
Adams in the emergency room drama. Part of ``ER'' from the
inception, she appeared in the pilot.
	   ``You knew it was good,'' she said by telephone from New York
City. ``You kind of felt something was happening, but I was a 'B'
performer and did not know it was going to be series TV. I just
knew it was a special project.
	   ``Then when they said they were going to use me for the season
if we got picked up, I said, `Please use me!' That first year I
appeared in about 20 episodes out of 22.''
	   Now her appearances are less frequent. The reason: ``Working.''
The Wednesday night sitcom debuted last season and performed well
enough to be renewed by NBC. Fred Savage, who grew up in ``The
Wonder Years,'' stars as a young man caught in the mad scramble of
a high-powered corporation.
	   Miss Freeman appears as the by-the-rules office manager, Evelyn
Smalley. It's a part that comes easily for her, because she bases
it on her experience as an office temp with a ``horrible boss who
was persnickety, watched everyone like a hawk, and even counted
paper clips.''
	   She encountered the woman, she said, when she first came to Los
Angeles.
	   Born in Chester, Pennsylvania, and raised in Wilmington,
Delaware, Miss Freeman studied art and theater at the University of
Delaware and broke into New York City shows with ``Ain't
Misbehavin'.''
	   ``You name any black show, and I've done it, on the road, all
over the world. That's why I stopped doing that and came out to
L.A.,'' she said. ``I wanted to sit down. I was tired.''
	   She began with guest spots on series and occasional movies. Then
came ``ER'' and ``Working.''
	   As if two series weren't enough of a work load, Miss Freeman has
used the TV off-season to appear appear off-Broadway in ``Dinah
Was.'' It's a musical biography of the late, great jazz singer
Dinah Washington. Miss Freeman has performed the roll in Los
Angeles and at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts.
	   ``I'm on stage alone for two hours, acting, singing and a little
bit of dancing,'' she said. ``It was a dream of mine, starting
about eight to 10 years ago.
	   ``My father (Charles Freeman) is a jazz piano player, so I heard
Dinah's music at home. And I just liked the woman. She was a
businesswoman, and she pushed herself. She wasn't like Billie
Holiday, who had things happen to her. Dinah made things happen,
good and bad.''
	   Miss Freeman, who is married to Lanny Hartley, musical director
and jazz pianist of ``Dinah Was,'' must return to ``ER'' and
``Working'' on July 27. Heavy schedules don't bother her.
	   ``I worked a long time to get here,'' she said. ``And I've got
plans to go further, do other things.''

	   In the spotlight: Boy George.
	   When designer Donatella Versace walked down the fashion runway
in Milan, Italy, this past spring, it was to the music of British
pop star Boy George. It would seem an unlikely assignment for the
pop singer, best known for his outlandish style of dress. Or maybe
not.
	   Boy George, who celebrates his 37th birthday on June 14, was the
lead singer of Culture Club, which recorded such 1980s hits as
``Karma Chameleon'' and ``Do You Really Want to Hurt Me.'' He also
recorded a version of the title song for the 1992 film, ``The
Crying Game.''
	   He hit the music scene at the start of the '80s as a backup
singer with the British group, Bow Wow Wow. In those days he was
known as Lieutenant Lush. He eventually formed his own group, the
Sex Gang Children, which later evolved into the internationally
successful quartet, Culture Club. Boy George assumed the role as
the group's most visible member, attracting attention with gobs of
makeup and a smooth-as-silk voice.
	   Culture Club's first two singles bombed, despite growing fashion
interest in Boy George. The band finally reached No. 1 in Britain
with ``Do You Really Want to Hurt Me'' in 1982.
	   The group's four albums _ ``Kissing to Be Clever,'' ``Colour by
Numbers,'' ``Waking Up With the House on Fire'' and ``From Luxury
to Heartache'' _ quickly became top-sellers in the first half of
the 1980s. This was largely due to a unique style that combined
pop, funk, reggae and soul.
	   ``We were really lucky. We were just in the right place at the
right time,'' Boy George said. ``It's a bit like trying to catch a
taxi.''
	   But then the Culture Club's taxi took a wrong turn. Boy George
was arrested in 1986 for drug possession.
	   His debut solo album, ``Sold,'' was released in 1987. He made a
minor comeback with the title song from ``The Crying Game.''
	   Capitalizing on renewed attention to his career, Boy George,
whose real name is George O'Dowd, released a frank autobiography,
``Take It Like a Man,'' and a new album, ``Cheapness and Beauty.''

Book Review: Trembling Mountain: A personal account of Kuru, Cannibals, and Mad Cow Disease. By Robert Klitzman, M.D. 
</HEADLINE>
By Waka Tsunoda
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With few virginal places left in the world, it
is not easy to have an old-fashioned adventure today. Until
recently, though, there was a place that could still fulfill a
romantic's dream of a faraway land: Papua New Guinea. And Robert
Klitzman grabbed the last plane for it.
	   ``The Trembling Mountain: A Personal Account of Kuru, Cannibals
and Mad Cow Disease'' is an intellectually stimulating account of
his several months among the country's near-Stone Age people.
	   Klitzman is now an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at
Columbia University, but in the book, he is in between college and
medical school. He is doing some summer work at the National
Institutes of Health and gets to know Carleton Gajdusek, who won
the Nobel Prize for his study of kuru - a neurological disease
found in Papua New Guinea's Fore tribal group that used to practice
cannibalism.
	   It is suspected that the disease, which has a long incubation
period, even decades, spreads when one eats infected corpses, much
like Mad Cow disease spreads when one eats infected beef. Gajdusek
asks Klitzman if he cares to go to Papua New Guinea, or PNG, and
collect more data on the disease.
	   Klitzman, who has just seen the movie ``Lawrence of Arabia,''
jumps at the chance for an adventure and heads for Waisa, PNG,
which will be his base.
	   After a long trip from civilization, he ends up in the
wilderness with a solitary house. ``This is Waisa?'' he wonders
incredulously. Recovering from the initial shock, he risks malaria
and other hazards and treks to remote villages to interview Kuru
patients.
	   The author's interactions with the natives are thought-provoking
and often hilarious. One of his guides, for example, is a sly one,
and tries to rip off Klitsman at every opportunity. Kiltzman, a
streetwise New Yorker, does his best to defend himself, but doesn't
always succeed.
	   The data he collects turns out to be a significant contribution
to the understanding of Mad Cow disease, which, like kuru, is
caused by infectious protein, but this book isn't a scientific
treatise.
	   Rather it is a story of a young man coming of age in a culture
which is far removed from his own. The author is frank about his
feelings and intelligent in his musings, and it gives the book the
universal and timeless charm of a classic.
	   Klitzman has written a few books, but ``Trembling Mountains''
best showcases his multidisciplinary talent as a physician,
thinker, and ethnographer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   The Trembling Mountain: A personal account of Kuru, Cannibals,
and Mad Cow Disease was published by Plenum Trade, New York. dlrs
27.95.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Start putting the Detroit Red Wings' names on
the Stanley Cup again.
	   Barring the greatest motivational speech of coach Ron Wilson's
career and a complete turnaround by the Washington Capitals, the
Cup is going back to Hockeytown for a second straight year.
	   Sergei Fedorov made a dlrs 12 million move and scored with 4:51
to play as the Red Wings beat the Capitals 2-1 Saturday night to
take a 3-0 lead in the Stanley Cup finals.
	   Only one team in NHL history has rallied from a 3-0 deficit in
the finals to win the Stanley Cup, the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1942
against Detroit.
	   This Detroit club can now become the first team since the
Pittsburgh Penguins in 1991 and 1992 to capture consecutive Cups by
winning Game 4 of the best-of-7 series here on Tuesday night.
	   If the Red Wings do that, they will also become the first team
to win the NHL title with consecutive sweeps in the finals since
the New York Islanders capped a string of four consecutive titles
with sweeps in 1982 and 1983.
	   Coach Scotty Bowman also would tie Toe Blake's record for
Stanley Cup titles by a coach with eight.
	   Tomas Holmstrom got the other Detroit goal 35 seconds after the
opening faceoff. Brian Bellows of the Capitals tied the game at
10:35 of the third period on a power play.
	   Fedorov's game-winner was magnificent. He took a pass off the
side boards from Doug Brown at center ice and steamed into the
Capitals' zone with only defenseman Calle Johansson between him and
goaltender Olaf Kolzig.
	   Fedorov cut inside as he reached the right faceoff circle and
then snapped a shot that beat Kolzig over his glove.
	   Detroit goaltender Chris Osgood didn't have to make a tough stop
over the final minutes, finishing with 17 saves.
	   As the Red Wings skated off the ice, the small number of Detroit
fans in the MCI Center chanted ``Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!''
	   Dominated most of the game by Detroit but only down a goal since
the opening 35 seconds, Washington finally tied the game midway
through the third period with Darren McCarty off for tripping.
	   Adam Oates made the key play going to the net from the left
circle. His shot hit someone in the crease and Bellows came in
quickly and ripped it past Osgood for his fifth goal of the
playoffs.
	   Getting the first goal seemingly has been one of the keys to the
Red Wings' success in the playoffs this year. They are 12-1 when
scoring first.
	   Game 3 was only 35 seconds old when Steve Yzerman broke into the
Capitals zone, fought off a back check by Esa Tikkanen and got off
a shot while crashing into Kolzig. The puck came out of the pileup
and Holmstrom, fighting off a check by Todd Krygier, pushed it into
the open net.
	   Holmstrom, who had 22 points in 57 regular-season games, now has
18 (seven goals, 11 assists) in 21 playoffs contests. He has a goal
and three assists in this series.
	   It was the third straight one-goal loss for the Capitals, who
have managed to stay in this series because Kolzig has been
outstanding in net.
	   Detroit dominated the first Stanley Cup finals game in the
nation's capital, but Kolzig stopped almost everything, making 32
saves, including 12 in the first period as the Red Wings outshot
Washington 12-1.
	   The only other club to have just one shot in a period since 1968
was the Red Wings against New Jersey in 1995.
	   When Washington finally got going in the second period, Osgood,
the supposed weak link in the Red Wings' lineup, was outstanding.
	   He made a sliding stop on a power-play shot by Bellows in close,
stopped Peter Bondra on a great setup in front by Richard Zednik
and then made a snapping glove save on Bondra late in the period.

Red Wings won't take second-best when scoring first AP Hockey Writer

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Detroit Red Wings have been tough to beat
when scoring first in the playoffs.
	   Saturday night's 2-1 victory over Washington gave them a 12-1
record in the postseason when getting the early jump.
	   ``We realize how important it is to get off to a good start,
especially coming into (the MCI Center),'' Detroit's Brendan
Shanahan said. ``We knew that they were going to have a lot of
emotion and we wanted to jump on them early.''
	   The Red Wings did, scoring 35 seconds into the game.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; A REAL KICK: The action was fast and furious at the Stanley Cup
finals _ even before Saturday night's Game 3.
	   In a hallway outside of the Detroit locker room, some of the Red
Wings were in a circle kicking a soccer ball around.
	   ``This could be a bad omen,'' joked one sports writer, ``we
could be playing all night with a scoreless tie.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; REALLY BIG SHOW: Pre-game ceremonies at the MCI Center on
Saturday night included scenes of Washington through the years _
and scenes from one of the Japanese ``Godzilla'' movies. The
latter, of course, was a reference to the Capitals' jumbo-size
goaltender, 6-foot-3 (1.90-meter), 225-pound (102-kilos) Olaf
Kolzig who wears his nickname on his mask.
	   ___
	    &UR; LONG AND SHORT OF IT: At one point in Saturday night's game,
the Washington Capitals were being outshot 17-3 _ and two of their
shots came on a Detroit power play.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TREAT'S ON SERGEI: What does a hockey player do when he signs a
new contract worth millions of dollars? Treat his teammates to
dinner, of course.
	   That's what Sergei Fedorov did for the Detroit Red Wings after
rejoining the team late this season following his long and
complicated contract battle.
	   Fedorov, who earned a dlrs 12 million bonus when the Red Wings
made the conference finals, took his teammates out to a restaurant
in Phoenix. The dinner bill: about dlrs 11,000.
	   What did the players eat?
	   ``We ate a lot of red wine,'' Brendan Shanahan said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; THE SILENT TYPE: As a captain, Steve Yzerman leads by example
rather than fiery speeches. So says Detroit coach Scotty Bowman.
	   ``He doesn't say a lot,'' Bowman said. ``If there are issues, he
will take them up. He has a good demeanor because he plays hard.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DRAFT STORY: Unless the Tampa Bay Lightning make a trade, it's
likely they'll pick Vincent Lecavalier with the first overall pick
in the NHL Entry Draft.
	   A guest at the Stanley Cup finals along with other likely top
picks, Lecavalier was asked about stories regarding the Lightning
trading his rights.
	   ``I read something in the newspapers (about a possible trade),
but I don't know if it's true or not,'' he said.
	   There were chuckles and groans. Then, realizing he was among
writers, Lecavalier quickly apologized, saying, ``No offense!''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; STANLEY CUP STREAKS: With victories over Washington in the
first three games of the finals, the Red Wings extended their
unbeaten streak over the Capitals to 10 games (9-0-1). The last
previous Washington win over Detroit was Jan. 30, 1994 _ 6-3 at
Landover, Md.
	   Detroit's Steve Yzerman was on a streak of his own. His assist
in Game 3 extended his point streak in the finals to seven games
dating to last year's four-game sweep of Philadelphia.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BROWN OUT, KLEE IN: Defenseman Jeff Brown was scratched from
the Capitals' lineup Saturday and replaced by Ken Klee.
	   ``Kenny deserves a chance to play right now. He hasn't played in
a while,'' Capitals coach Ron Wilson said after Saturday's morning
skate. ``He's a guy who can kill penalties and play a steady game.
Maybe he'll step forward and make a difference in the game.''
	   Brown has a problem with post-concussion syndrome. He felt
nauseated after the second period in Thursday night's game at
Detroit and did not return to the ice.
	   Klee had one goal in seven games during the 1998 playoffs but
was not used in the first two games of this series.
	   ``Of course, it's great to get a chance like this,'' Klee said.
``This is what you dream about when you're growing up _ playing in
the Stanley Cup finals.''

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Rookie Travis Lee homered in consecutive innings
and drove in a team-record five runs as the Arizona Diamondbacks
rallied to beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7-4 on Saturday.
	   Down 4-3 after Brian Jordan's two-run homer in the eighth, the
Diamondbacks scored four runs in the bottom of the inning on Lee's
three-run homer and Matt Williams' solo shot, both off Jeff
Brantley (0-3).
	   Lee, who had a two-run homer in the seventh, has 13 home runs
and 39 RBIs, both tops among National League rookies. Russ Springer
(4-3) got the victory despite allowing Jordan's homer. Gregg Olson
pitched the ninth for his eighth save.
	   St. Louis star Mark McGwire, who hit his major league-leading
31st homer Friday night, was 1-for-2 with two walks, raising his
league-leading walk total to 70.
 &UR; Colorado Rockies 4, Los Angeles Dodgers 2,
	   At Los Angeles, Colorado's Larry Walker went 3-for-3 with a solo
home run and the Dodgers turned their first double play ever at
Dodger Stadium and second since moving to Los Angeles in 1958.
	   The fifth-inning triple play, which began on a bunt by Kurt
Abbott, also was the first involving the Rockies in their six-year
history.
	   Abbott's bunt fell between Darren Dreifort (4-6) and first
baseman Eric Karros, with Dreifort throwing to shortstop Jose
Vizcaino at second base for the first out. Vizcaino relayed to
first base, where second baseman Eric Young was covering, for the
second out. Jamey Wright was thrown out when Young threw to third
baseman Bobby Bonilla.
	   Wright (5-6) pitched 5 1-3 innings for the victory, and Jerry
Dipoto worked the ninth for his 13th save.
 &UR; Chicago Cubs 10, Philadelphia Philllies 8, 10 innings
	   At Philadelphia, Chicago's Sammy Sosa hit his 21st homer and
drove in the go-ahead run with a sacrifice fly in the 10th.
	   Sosa, who drove in four runs, has 12 home runs and 29 RBIs in
his last 14 games. Brant Brown also homered for Chicago, and Mickey
Morandini, acquired from Philadelphia in an offseason trade, was
4-for-5.
	   Bobby Abreu went 3-for-3 with a homer and three RBIs for the
Phillies.
	   Terry Adams (5-3) pitched two scoreless innings for the victory.
Jerry Spradlin (2-3) took the loss.
 &UR; Braves 9, Expos 7
	   In Atlanta, Javier Lopez and Andruw Jones hit back-to-back
homers in both the second and third innings, powering the Braves
over the Montreal Expos.
	   Lopez had a pair of two-run homers, his 14th and 15th of the
season, off Mike Johnson (0-2). Jones hit his 11th and 12th homers
off Johnson, the third time he has homered twice in a game this
season.
	   Tom Glavine (9-2) gave up four runs in the first inning, then
settled down to win his 12th straight decision against Montreal.
Dennis Martinez pitched the ninth for his second save.
 &UR; Brewers 8, Pirates 1
	   In Pittsburgh, Jeff Juden pitched a five-hitter and barely
missed the first shutout of his major league career and Jeromy
Burnitz hit two of Milwaukee's three homers against the Pirates.
	   Backup catcher Bobby Hughes added a two-run double off Jason
Schmidt (8-3) and helped shut down the Pirates' offense by twice
throwing out runners attempting to steal.
	   Juden (6-5) came within two outs of recording his first shutout
in 119 games and 54 starts since breaking into the majors with
Houston in 1991.
 &UR; Reds 7, Astros 4
	   In Cincinnati, Dmitri Young hit a three-run home run in the
fifth inning and Bret Boone followed with another homer, rallying
the Reds past the Houston Astros.
	   The Reds won for only the third time in 11 games by scoring four
times with two outs in the fifth off Shane Reynolds (7-4).
Reynolds, who had won his last five decisions, gave up three homers
as he fell to 1-8 for his career against the Reds.
	   Scott Klingenbeck (1-1) got his first victory in two starts for
his hometown team. Jeff Shaw pitched the ninth for his 18th save in
22 chances. He has not allowed an earned run in his last 19
appearances covering 25 1-3 innings.
 &UR; Mets 7, Marlins 4
	   In Miami, Butch Huskey's three-run homer highlighted a seven-run
third inning that sent Rick Reed and the New York Mets over the
Florida Marlins.
	   Reed (8-3) allowed seven hits and struck out eight in 8 1-3
innings, winning for the seventh time in his last eight starts.
	   John Franco closed for his 15th save. It was Franco's 401st game
for the Mets, tying the team record for a pitcher set by Tom
Seaver.
	   Huksey hit his ninth home run of the season and his fifth in his
last 10 games. He connected off Brian Meadows (4-6).

	   OAKLAND, California (AP) _ Mike Macfarlane hit a three-run homer
off Randy Johnson and the Oakland Athletics overcame two home runs
by Jay Buhner to beat the Seattle Mariners 7-3 Saturday.
	   Johnson (5-6) has lost three straight starts for the first time
since dropping eight in a row in 1992. He was tagged for seven runs
in seven innings.
	   The left-hander, 20-4 last season, has not had a losing record
this late in a season since finishing 1992 at 12-14. Johnson's 5.61
ERA is the highest it has ever at this point in a year.
	   Buhner drove in all three Seattle runs with his two homers, his
first since returning from a two-month stay on the disabled list
following arthroscopic knee surgery.
	   The Mariners managed only three hits off Blake Stein (3-3) and
relievers Buddy Groom and Mike Fetters, who got his third save.
 &UR; Toronto Blue Jays 9, Baltimore Orioles 8
	   In Toronto, Carlos Delgado drove in three runs while Mike
Stanley and Alex Gonzalez each hit two-run homers, lifting the
Toronto Blue Jays over the Baltimore Orioles.
	   Mark Dalesandro also homered for Toronto. Joe Carter, Rafael
Palmeiro and Jesus Tavarez connected for the Orioles.
	   Tavarez, starting in place of injured Orioles center fielder
Brady Anderson, led off the game with a home run. Anderson is
expected to be out for a week because of a strained right
quadriceps.
	   Two outs after Tavarez homered, Rafael Palmeiro lined a ball off
the pitching hand of Chris Carpenter. The righty left the game and
was taken to the hospital, where X-rays were negative. Robert
Person (2-0) relieved.
	   Randy Myers, pitching against the Orioles for the first time
since leaving them as a free agent in the offseason, worked the
ninth for his 17th save in 19 chances.
	   Palmeiro hit Myers' first pitch for his 17th home run. Roberto
Alomar then walked, but B.J. Surhoff fouled out and Cal Ripken
grounded into a double play.
 &UR; Tigers 7, Royals 1
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Justin Thompson pitched a five-hitter
for his second straight complete game and Luis Gonzalez drove in
three runs as the Detroit Tigers beat the Royals.
	   Thompson (5-6) struck out five and walked three. In his last
previous outing, he pitched a three-hitter Sunday to win at
Milwaukee 4-1.
	   Rookie designated hitter Frank Catalanotto added a pair of RBIs
for the Tigers. Joe Randa and Bobby Higginson homered on
consecutive pitches in the ninth.
	   Catalanotto's two-run single off Pat Rapp (5-6) capped the
Tigers' three-run third inning and put Detroit up 4-1.
 &UR; White Sox 3, Twins 2
	   In Minneapolis, Mike Sirotka rebounded from his worst start of
the season with a three-hit effort through 8 1-3 innings and Frank
Thomas hit a solo homer to help the Chicago White Sox beat the
Minnesota Twins.
	   Sirotka gave up eight runs on nine hits in 2 2-3 innings in his
last outing, a 13-7 loss against the crosstown rival Cubs last
Sunday.
	   Sirotka (7-6), who had won only once since May 8, struck out
three and walked two as the White Sox ended Minnesota's three-game
winning streak.
	   He left after giving up a one-out triple to Pat Meares in the
ninth. Paul Molitor hit a sacrifice fly off reliever Matt Karchner,
who finished for his seventh save.
	   Bob Tewksbury (3-8) allowed three runs on nine hits through
six-plus innings in his second start since a stint on the 15-day DL
with a strained right shoulder. Tewksbury is winless since April
29.

Bazan wins WBC lightweight title from Johnston AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
	   EL PASO, Texas (AP) _ Cesar Bazan didn't thrill the crowd while
he was fighting Stevie Johnston. He did when he got the split
decision Saturday night that gave him the WBC lightweight title.
	   Bazan outfought Johnston on the inside to take a split decision
in a lackluster fight.
	   ``I got what I deserved after many years of boxing,'' Bazan
said.
	   Bazan, a Mexican fighting on the undercard of the Oscar De La
Hoya-Patrick Charpentier welterweight title fight, got a big
reaction from the crowd entering the ring. But as the fight wore on
and settled into a slow pace, the crowd was quiet.
	   Bazan won by two points on two scorecards, 115-113, while the
third judge favored Johnston, of the United States, by a 116-112
margin. The Associated Press had Johnston ahead 115-113.
	   ``I made it a tough fight myself,'' said Johnston, who had
trouble coping with the 6-foot challenger's six-inch height
advantage.
	   It was the first loss in 25 fights for Johnston, who was making
the fourth defense of the title he won from Jean Mendy in March
1997.
	   It came in a fight which neither boxer was able to dominate, a
bout marked more by holding and clinching than steady fighting.
	   Bazan (32-2-1), who was the No. 1-ranked contender, had won 21
of his last 22 fights and had vowed to take the fight to Johnston.
	   He did so, despite a nose bloodied in the middle rounds that
bled through much of the rest of the fight.
	   ``It was a hard fight but I think I fought the better fight,''
Bazan said.
	   Ringside punching statistics showed Bazan landing 288 of 903
punches to 250 of 831 for Johnston.
	   Johnston, 133 pounds (60.3 kilos), gave Bazan, 133 3/4 (60.7
kilos), trouble with his left-handed style, but was never able to
hurt the challenger or put him in trouble.
	   There were no knockdowns or fouls.
	   The undercard was delayed for about 30 minutes following the
first fight when light standards swaying in gusty winds at the Sun
Bowl forced the evacuation of the ringside area.
	   In other fights, 1996 Olympic bronze medalist Daniel Santos of
Puerto Rico remained undefeated by stopping Juan Carlos Rodriguez
of Mexico in the fifth round of a scheduled 10-round fight.
	   Santos, 149, dominated the bout before finally knocking out
Rodriguez, 148, with a right hand at 2:00 of the fifth round.
Santos improved to 16-0-1 with 12 knockouts, while Rodriguez fell
to 32-11-2.
	   Mexico's Cesar Soto, the WBC's No. 1-ranked featherweight, kept
in line for a title shot by stopping Juan Polo-Perez of Miami in
the second round of their scheduled 10-rounder. Soto landed a
flurry of punches to stop the fight at 2:14 of the round.
