<HEADLINE> African Governments Urged To Curb Child Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The participants at the
just-ended five- day workshop have called on the African
governments to formulate national policies that deal with child
sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
About 40 delegates from east, west and southern African
countries attended the workshop which called on the World Health
Organization (WHO) to continue supporting countries in their
efforts to reduce child sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Monday, the WHO said the participants agreed
that child sexual abuse was a major problem in every country and
called for the review and updating of laws on children's rights.
</P>
<P>
The participants called for the setting up of coordinating
mechanisms to harmonize ongoing activities on child sexual abuse
management and prevention.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of crisis management units as well as
rehabilitation centers and programs for displaced, orphaned, and
neglected sexually abused children were singled out also as
important.
</P>
<P>
Other recommendations made by the participants included the
setting up of victim friendly services in courts, police units and
health facilities and greater community involvement in the
prevention and management of child sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
The Participants also recommended improvements in data
collection and case reporting and underlined the positive role the
media could play by focusing on ways to prevent child abuse rather
than on reporting mainly sensational stories and statistics on
child abuse.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Exchange Shortage Hits Zambian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- An acute shortage of foreign
exchange has hit most of the banks and bureau de change in the
Zambian capital Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
U.S. dollar has become more scarce than other hard currencies
like British pound and South African rand.
</P>
<P>
The lack of foreign exchange has further devalued the local
currency, kwacha.
</P>
<P>
At bureau de change on Monday the mid-rate of dollar against
kwacha is one against 2,610 compared with one against 2,570 a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
One source told Xinhua that at present it is very difficult to
exchange kwacha for U.S. dollar at banks and bureau de chang in
the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Usually foreign exchange is in higher demand around Christmas
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some insiders from banks said that foreign exchange is being
withheld in anticipation of a further higher exchange rate of the
hard currencies against kwacha.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Italian Treasury Minister
Giuliano Amato said Monday that he expected Italian banks and
financial institutions to sail through the New Year without
trouble from the Millennium Bug.
</P>
<P>
Problems expected to emerge when the internal clocks of
un-adapted computers find their internal clocks faced with a year
denoted as "00" in two-digit form are of "no real worry," Amato
said.
</P>
<P>
In any case, now that banks and financial operators have
completed software adaptation program the problem is "more
psychological than real," he added.
</P>
<P>
Amato said the only real risk was an overloading of the system
as investors and traders tried to complete operations early in
order to avoid possible complications at New Year.
</P>
<P>
The Italian bourse is expected to close a day early in the week
leading up to December 31 as a precaution against Millennium Bug
risks.
</P>
<P>
In related developments, an inquiry by the Wall Street Journal
said Monday that there was a risk of disruption at Italy's
airports on January 1 because part of their computer systems had
been made "big proof."

<HEADLINE> Algerian Opposition Leader's Killing Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Algerian Presidential
Office issued a statement Monday evening, condemning the killing
of Abdelkader Hachani, the third-ranking leader of Algeria's
banned party Islamic Salvation Front (FIS).
</P>
<P>
"This heinous act shows that the enemies of Algerian national
reconciliation and rapprochement inside and outside the country
are still lurking for the country," the Algerian News Agency
quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The presidential office of the Republic urges the nation to
keep vigilant until those who harbor evil for the country's
present and future are unmasked," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The presidential office condemns the attack as one of
terrorist acts whatever their sources are," it added.
</P>
<P>
The security agencies have started an investigation into the
murder.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified gunman shot Hachani twice in the head and once
in the stomach in the capital Algiers earlier in the day and he
was immediately rushed to the emergency ward at the Maillot
Hospital, where died later.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Hachani was the acting leader of the banned FIS after its
leader Abbas Madani was arrested in December 1991 when the front
got a sweeping victory in the first round of the legislative
elections on December 26.
</P>
<P>
The then authorities canceled the second round of the
elections, which sparked an Islamic insurgency that involved
several militant groups including the FIS military wing, the
Islamic Salvation Army, and has left about 100,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
Hachani, rejecting President Abdelaziz Bouteflika's peace
plan, called for a summit in an attempt to restore security in
Algeria through a comprehensive national reconciliation plan.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika has given Islamic militants till January 13 to apply
for pardons under the amnesty and warned that those who failed to
do so risk harsh treatment at the hands of the state.
</P>
<P>
Hachani's shooting came after a week of violence, in which over
30 people were killed.

<HEADLINE> 10 Iraqi Civilians Injured in U.S.-British Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Ten Iraqi civilians were
injured on Monday in U.S. and British warplanes attacks on civil
and service installations in southern Iraq, an Iraqi military
spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 11:38 a.m. (0838 GMT), 19 formations
of U.S. and British warplanes coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases
made 78 sorties over southern Iraqi airspace over Basra, Thi-Qar,
Qadissiya, Kerbela, Misan, Muthana and Najaf provinces.
</P>
<P>
At 11:05 a.m. (0805 GMT), eight formations of U.S. and British
warplanes coming from the Turkish airspace violated northern Iraqi
airspace over Dohuk, Erbil and Neineva provinces, and bombed some
civil and military targets in this region, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraqi surface-to-air defense units fired back at
the enemy planes and repulsed them to their bases in Turkey, Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, the U.S. and
British warplanes have made 15,918 sorties over the two no-fly
zones in Iraq and have targetted regularly Iraqi civil and
military targets, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south against attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize these restricted zones, regarding them
as unilaterally imposed by the U.S. and Britain as they are not
covered directly by any United Nations resolution.

<HEADLINE> World Bank: New Approach Useful in Cutting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of
developing countries are significantly cutting industrial
pollution by using combined powers, according to a new report
released by the World Bank on Monday.
</P>
<P>
This new community-based approach is proving more effective in
curbing pollution than relying on traditional approaches to
environmental regulation, which can often be under-funded,
inefficient, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The report, Greening Industry: New Roles for Communities,
Markets and Governments, said that this new approach shows how
local industrial pollution can be held within acceptable bounds,
without hindering growth.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, for example, the government has cut industrial
water pollution sharply by monitoring factories' discharges and
publicizing their findings in the news media.
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank has been very fortunate to collaborate with the
pioneers of this new approach, in which communities themselves
negotiate with polluting factories to achieve the clean air and
water that their physical and economic health demand," said David
Wheeler, a senior World Bank economist and the author of the
report.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Wheeler and a World Bank team have collaborated
closely with pollution regulators in developing countries, such as
Brazil, China, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The report described how environmental regulators in developing
countries pioneered new approaches after the so-called "command
and control" model of pollution control, imported from industrial
countries, failed to cut poisonous discharges. Under this
approach, still widely used, government regulators set maximum
pollution levels and then fine companies that exceed them.
</P>
<P>
Where enforcement agencies are weak, as they are in many
developing countries, companies run little risk of being caught
and punished. Therefore, polluting firms which violate regulatory
standards have little incentive to clean up their activities, and
firms that do respect legal limits have even less incentive to cut
their pollution.
</P>
<P>
To address these limitations, the new approach combines
market-based incentives and public information disclosure to
encourage factory managers to improve their environmental
performance while they are pursuing profits.
</P>
<P>
With the new model, government, communities, and markets all
have important roles to play in reducing pollution, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The new approach works because it has a solid economic
foundation. Cost-conscious factory managers will generally
tolerate pollution up to the point where the expected penalty for
pollution becomes greater than the cost of controlling emissions,
according to the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Seeks Friendly Ties With Russia: Shevardnadze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Georgia seeks to maintain a
friendly relationship with Russia, said Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze in the capital of Tbilisi Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The Georgian leadership wants to promote friendly, mutually
advantageous and equitable relations with Russia," said
Shevardnadze in an interview with the National Radio.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that "broad sections of the Russian
population are also interested in the development of friendly
relations with Georgia."
</P>
<P>
Russian helicopters allegedly dropped bombs on November 17 near
the Georgian village of Shatili, bordering Russian rebelling
republic of Chechnya, but nobody was injured.
</P>
<P>
On this incident, the president said that a joint commission of
the two countries' military experts is investigating it and
Georgian State Minister Vazha Lordkipanidze phoned Russian Premier
Vladimir Putin on the development of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze also said a Russian pullout from Georgia would
help improve bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
A pullout, agreed on by the two sides at the summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in
Istanbul, will correspond to the interests of the two countries
and bring about a rapprochement in bilateral relations, he noted.

Eckhard said Iraq had decided not to sign a new agreement with

to be implemented in late 1996.
</P>

Eckhard said U.N. staff would remain in Iraq for the time
being. "There are an awful lot of supplies in the pipelines so our
work doesn't need to stop just because of the oil stopping flowing."
</P>

The spokesman expressed the hope that Iraq would reconsider its
termination of the humanitarian program.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. officials, Iraq's Ambassador to the United
Nations, Saeed Hasan, informed the United Nations of his country's
decision by leaving a voice mail in the home telephone of chief
U.N. legal counsel, Hans Corell.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted a resolution Friday, extending the
current phase of the program, which expired on November 20, for
two weeks until December 4.
</P>
<P>
It is widely seen here that the move taken by Iraq is a
protest to the continuing U.N. sanctions against the country.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Warns Against "Misuse of Student </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Amid spiraling factional
struggles over the coming Majlis (parliament) elections in
February, Iran's paramount leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on
Monday warned university students against possible misuse of the
student movement in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to students at the campus mosque of the Sharif
Technical University in Tehran, Khamenei said that student
movement should remain independent of any partisan conflicts and
should go ahead with its own faithful nature.
</P>
<P>
Political parties have always failed to attract members from
university students, because students prefer not to be trapped by
partisan dictations, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's remarks came after some Iranian leaders tried to
close ranks among the conservative and moderate factions to pave
the way for a peaceful Majlis polling.
</P>
<P>
Several major Iranian cleric groups recently held a joint
meeting, trying to work out a joint list for the Majlis elections.
</P>
<P>
But local press said the two major factions - the leftist
Society of Militant Clergymen, a main supporter of the moderate
President Mohammad Khatami, and the rightist conservative
Association of Militant Clerics - failed to reach a deal.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said both the moderates and the conservatives
pine hopes on the Majlis polling to rebalance the country's
political power. Both sides have started their campaigns to block
rivals from running for the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that student movement should contribute to
reinforcing social and moral freedom, justice and faith within
itself and avoid falling into trap of political games.
</P>
<P>
"Those power greed political groups which have bad records in
years after victory of the (1979) Islamic revolution have always
attempted to misuse student movement and now they, who see the
young university students being present on the scene, make every
endeavor to link themselves to the students," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader was obviously referring to the pro-democracy
groups, such as Freedom Movement of Iran and the Nationalist
Front, which restarted their activities among students after
President Khatami came to power in 1997 with the policies on
freedom of speech and rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei called on university students not to allow those
groups to approach them, adding that certain people have attempted
to mislead student movement and make the movement turn away from
its goals.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Sell Cement Factory to Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 22 (Xinhua) -- In a further step in its
privatization drive, Egypt agreed on Monday to sell a major cement
factory to a Mexican company.
</P>
<P>
Under a contract signed in the day, Egypt will sell 90 percent
of the assests of the Assiut Cement Company to the Mexican Demex
Company, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican corporation is to pay 1.43 billion Egyptian pounds
(414.49 million U.S. dollars) for the purchase, the news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
It will keep the labor force, introduce advanced technology to
the factory and modernize the means of production, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
The Assiut company, which is in the governorate of Assiut, 330
kilometers south of Cairo, produces about 4.2 million tons of
cement each year. The Mexican company, whose annual production
stands at 65 million tons of cement, is the world's fourth
largest, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The selling is one of the biggest in the privatization process
that Egypt began in 1995 in a bid to raise its economic growth and
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has so far privatized more than one third of the targeted
314 companies and earned proceeds of over 10 billion pounds (2.94
billion dollars), according to official statistics.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday said he is preparing to withdraw the United
Nations Civilian Police Mission In Haiti (MIPONUH) following the
expiration of its mandate on November 30, unless the Security
Council decides otherwise,
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Annan said as the mandate
of MIPONUH draws to the end, it can be said that the mission has
made important contributions to the institutional development of
the Haitian National Police and police reform.
</P>
<P>
The training provided by the mission and the presence of the
civilian police personnel in police stations throughout the
country have helped to establish the basis for the development of
an independent and professional police service, which should be a
cornerstone of a society based on the rule of law, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The termination of the mission will mark the end of United
Nations peacekeeping in Haiti. However, it is important that the
international community continues to be present in the country to
assist it in the process of democratization.
</P>
<P>
MIPONUH, established in December 1997, is aimed to assist the
Government of Haiti by supporting and contributing to the
professionalization of the Haitian National Police, including
monitoring police field performance.

<HEADLINE> Russia Launches Four U.S. Satellites From Baikonur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia launched a Soyuz-U
booster rocket with four U.S. communications satellites from
Kazakhstan's Baikonur cosmodrome Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian carrier rocket with four Globalstar satellites (NN
29, 34, 39 and 61) on board was launched at 7:20 p.m., Moscow time
(1620 GMT) on Monday, said the press service of the Russian
Strategic Rocket Forces.
</P>
<P>
This was the first launch from Baikonur after Kazakhstan lifted
the ban from all launches from the site. The ban was imposed
following the crash of the Proton carrier rocket on October 27 and
now applies only to Proton carriers.
</P>
<P>
It also was the sixth launch of the Soyuz-U booster rocket from
Baikonur since the beginning of this year under the Globalstar
personal mobile satellite communications program.
</P>
<P>
The Soyuz-U is to take the satellites to an intermediate orbit,
whose maximum distance is 920 kilometers and minimum distance 240
kilometers from the Earth with 96- minute circulation time and
96-minute orbital period.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the booster Ikar and their own engines, the
satellites will be put into a working circle orbit at an altitude
of about 1,400 kilometers. The formation of the satellites' final
orbits is expected to begin at 11:39 p.m., Moscow time. The last
satellite will depart from the space platform at 2:31 a.m.,
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Globalstar communication satellites were made by the
Italian corporation Alenia for the United States' firm SS/Loral
and belong to the Globalstar international consortium.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Wants Peacekeepers Trained Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Ghana said on Monday it
intends to set up a United Nations Pre-Mission Training Facility
for officers and men who will be posted on international
peacekeeping duties, Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The facility is expected to improve training and development
schemes for servicemen internationally to enable them to meet the
required standards of U.N. peacekeeping," Joseph Awa Laryea,
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs told the opening of a one-week
"training of trainers" workshop for United Nations Civilian Police
(UNCIVPOL) in the Ghanaian capital Accra.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, the first ever to be held for Africa, follows
those organized for Europe in Sweden and Asia in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 police officers from 19 countries are attending and are
 expected to pass on knowledge acquired to fellow officers through
their local training programs before they embark on U.N. peace
missions.
</P>
<P>
Peter Nanfuri, Ghana's Inspector-General of Police, said that
in the past, police officers were not specifically trained to
meet adequately the demands of UN Peacekeeping Operations.
</P>
<P>
"Our officers have been thrown into the cauldron of UN
Peacekeeping Operations, and they have survived largely by their
own instincts and previous experiences."
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Alhassan, a representative from the U.N. Secretariat,
said the aim of the workshop was to foster a common approach to
selection and training, share policing models of good practices
through interaction and demonstrations. The Accra workshop is
being funded by Sweden with instructors from Ghana, Canada and
Norway.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reports Consequences Caused by UN Sanctions, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The maintenance of the
U.N. embargo and the ongoing United States attacks have resulted
in the destruction of infrastructure and of basic utilities
essential to the survival of Iraqi people, Iraq said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the United Nations, Speaker of the National
Assembly of the Republic of Iraq, Saadoun Hammadi, said the
economic embargo of the past nines years and the fact that these
years have been punctured by constant military assaults, planned
and carried out by the U.S. have targeted all aspects of life and
been based on the refusal of that country to allow the people of
Iraq to live a life of dignity and exercise its free and
independent will.
</P>
<P>
Saadoun Hammadi said many water treatment plants are no longer
capable of functioning in terms of their capacity, ability to meet
standards and uninterrupted operations, and the reason for this
are obsolescence and poor maintenance because of the
unavailability of the spare parts they require, most of them
having been damaged by military action.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is undergoing a reduction in the amount of energy produced
because of the destruction of electric power stations or the
damage done to them during the aggression against it, the speaker
said.
</P>
<P>
There is also the persistence shown by the representatives of
the United States and the Britain in the Security Council
Sanctions Committee in obstructing the conclusion and processing
of contracts under the memorandum of understanding of May 20, 1996
for the supply of spare parts for electric power stations, the
speaker said.
</P>
<P>
There is an acute shortage of water treatment chemicals, which
are include in the contracts under the memorandum of
understanding, because their delivery to the country is being
obstructed. Thus in laboratory tests conducted in Baghdad 47 of
129 samples failed to meet the required standard, and the number
of substandard samples is greater in the country's other
governorates, the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
He said some 30 percent of citizens countrywide are entirely
without drinking water as a result of the suspension of
development plans over the past 10 years because of the embargo
imposed in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of in-patients and out-patients had contracted
various diseases as a result of unsafe drinking water and that
many had died of such diseases, he added.

<HEADLINE> UAE, Qatar Coordinate Stand Ahead of GCC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- President of the Untied
Arab Emirates (UAE) Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan met here on
Monday with visiting Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani
to coordinate stand ahead of the annual Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) summit.
</P>
<P>
The meeting aimed to ensure the success of the organization's
20th summit scheduled to be held in Riyadh later this month,
analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE minister of state for
foreign affairs, said the meeting between the two leaders was
within the framework of consultation "between brothers to support
the GCC progress."
</P>
<P>
A number of topics of mutual concern, including ways to enhance
bilateral relations, were discussed, the official added without
elaboration.
</P>
<P>
Experts on GCC affairs, however, said the Qatari emir's
one-day visit mainly aimed to coordinate with the UAE leader on
some sensitive issues to ensure that the summit would go on
smoothly and produce positive results.
</P>
<P>
One major issue was the UAE's long-standing dispute with Iran
over the sovereignty of three small but strategic Gulf islands,
now under Iranian control but also claimed by the UAE.
</P>
<P>
Hamad has helped defuse a row between the UAE and Saudi Arabia
last June, which was ignited by Riyadh's movement to improve ties
with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The UAE accused Saudi Arabia of "putting individual interest
above collective obligations" and had threatened to withdraw from
the GCC alliance, which groups the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman,
Kuwait and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting on Monday, Hamad had to explain to the UAE
leader the progress the GCC tripartite committee had made in
helping solve the land dispute between the UAE and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The committee, set up after Abu Dhabi and Riyadh became
reconciled in July, groups foreign ministers of Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and Oman as well as GCC Secretary General Sheikh Jamil
Ibrahim Al Hujailan. Its task is to help solve the islands dispute
through contacts with Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran rejected the intervention of such a committee,
saying it was interested only in direct talks with the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has expressed its dissatisfaction with the slow moving
of the committee, and it hopes that the committee will submit a
report to the 20th summit.
</P>
<P>
Saudi officials, however, have indicated that the committee
was not scheduled to submit a report during the coming summit. It
planned to present a report during the GCC summit in the middle of
next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official Emirates News Agency announced Monday
that President Zayed would not attend the Riyadh summit. The UAE
delegation to the meeting will be led by Sheikh Maktoum Bin
Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE vice president and prime minister and
ruler of Dubai.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Committed to Settling POW Issue: Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Baghdad is committed to
settling the issue prisoners of war (POWs) between Iraq and Kuwait
within an Arab context, an Iraqi diplomat said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs involves Iraq and Kuwait, two Arab countries,
which are capable of resolving the dispute without the
interference of a third party, said Sultan al Shawi, Iraq's
permanent representative to the Cairo-based Arab League, after
meeting with the league's Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has accused Iraq of still jailing 625 people from Kuwait
and some other countries who were detained during Iraq's
occupation of Kuwait from August 1990 to February 1991, which
triggered the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League has made a proposal on the settlement of the
POWs issue and asked Abdel-Meguid to reach a mechanism in this
respect, al Shawi said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official accused Kuwait of not responding to the
efforts "in an appropriate way," saying Iraq supports any Arab
initiative for the settlement of this humanitarian issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, al Shawi condemned Turkey's military incursion into
northern Iraq, saying Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said
al-Sahaf has sent the league chief a message on the Turkish
military operations in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League has accused Turkey of posing a flagrant
interference in Iraq's internal affairs and an infringement on its
territorial integrity, al Shawi said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly sent troops into northern Iraq since 1995
in an attempt to wipe out rebels of its outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party which has been fighting since 1984 for an independent state
in southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Britain Expects to Restore Full Diplomatic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said on Monday that he expected Britain to restore full
diplomatic relations with Libya next month.
</P>
<P>
Cook told parliament that the last obstacle to the restoration
of full diplomatic relations between Britain and Libya has been
moved after Libya had handed over compensation for the killing of
a British policewoman in London in 1984.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected a British ambassador to take up his post in
Tripoli next month, more than 15 years after ties were broken off.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said that the compensation was handed over in
recent weeks to the family of policewoman Yvonne Fletcher, who was
killed by automatic shots fired from Libya's embassy in London
during a demonstration against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in
April 1984.
</P>
<P>
Relation between the two countries was broken after the
killing.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Libya has handed over compensation for the
killing of Fletcher, so removing the last obstacle to the
restoration of full diplomatic relations," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"I can inform the house that we expect a British ambassador to
take up his post in Libya next month," the foreign secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Britain and Libya have been boosted by
Libya's handover of the two Libyans who were suspected as the
bomber of an Pan-Am airliner over Lockerbie, a Scottish town in
1988, which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects are scheduled to be put on trial in a court
sitting by Scottish judges in a hired military camp in Netherland
next February.

<HEADLINE> Capital Flow From Russia to Drop 50 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The capital flow from Russia
will drop over 50 percent in 1999 from 1998, said a Russia's top
bank official Monday.
</P>
<P>
The capital flow out of Russia in 1998 amounted to 25-27
billion U.S. dollars, said Russian Central Bank's Deputy Chief
Executive Officer Victor Melnikov at a round table discussion on
capital flow here.
</P>
<P>
The average capital influx into offshore zones in the first
half of 1999 was counted in billions, but during the past four
months it fell to 530-550 million dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Melnikov attributed the achievement to Central Bank efforts, a
number of legal acts and an increase in confidence in the Russian
government.
</P>
<P>
"One decisive law and a serious measure of market character was
the introduction of a 50 percent reserve on transfers to all
correspondent offshore banks -- and this was the result," he said.
</P>
<P>
Melnikov also announced that in 1999 "the country's exports
will amount to 68-68.5 billion dollars, which is about 3 billion
less than in 1998, but currency revenue should be about 1.5
billion dollars more this year."

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Accuses Palestinians of Incitement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy said here Monday that the Palestinian's "incitements
against Israel" are harming the peace talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the European ambassadors to Israel at his ministry on
the development of the peace process, Levy accused the Palestinian
side of "dragging their feet" on Israel's next troops redeployment
in the West Bank, said a Foreign Ministry press release.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli minister accused the Palestinian officials of
conducting an incitement campaign against Israel and then blaming
Israel for not moving the peace process forward and for not making
decisions on key issues in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Palestinians have joined ranks with
some other Arab nations in trying to block Israel from some world
bodies inside the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Such incitements could force Israel to really think about
changing its policy on peace talks with the Palestinians," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
"It is Israel who has the right to make decisions on the scope
of troops redeployment, and the Palestinian's refusal to accept
the 5 percent territories has forced the delay of the pullback,"
Levy said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat rejected the redeployment map
and demanded more densely populated territory in the second-stage
land transfer originally scheduled for November 15. Discussions
are under way on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Italy: Pension Reform Back on Center Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The hot-button issue on pension
reform is again back on center stage of Italian politics after
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema mentioned it on the
Florence "Third Way" summit Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Monday morning, a range of politicians, including the prime
minister himself, commented that pension reform needs to be put on
the fast-track.
</P>
<P>
"We want to accelerate the implementation of pension reform,"
D'Alema said, adding to his remarks at Sunday's conference of
center-left leaders in Florence.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want a new reform, but to look again for a dialogue
with business and labor, and in negotiating, speeding up reform
must be discussed."
</P>
<P>
He said that he was "a bit surprised" by the widespread
reaction his comments were engendering from the press, union
leaders and other politicians.
</P>
<P>
Among the first to respond were leaders of both the Greens and
the Italian Communists, key coalition partners for D'Alema, who
said pensions are simply not up for debate before the scheduled
review in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The opposition took their swings at D'Alema, arguing that his
follow-up comments Monday were evidence of "backtracking" by the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The major opposition party Forza Italia's floor-leader in the
Lower House, Giuseppe Pisanu, said "as forecast" D'Alema is
already changing his tune.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Labor Minister Cesare Salvi defended current
timetable for pension reform, saying there was no emergency, and
no changes will be made before 2001.

LONDON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Secretary
Peter Mandelson said on Monday he expected the province's peace
deal to work, but made clear he would suspend a planned all-party
government there if any side defaulted on the agreement.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on the peace process to the House of Commons, he
said devolution of powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly will
take place on December 2.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said he planned to call a meeting of the Assembly on
November 29 to nominate ministers in the new executive.
</P>
<P>
Assuming ministers were nominated, the parliament would be
invited to approve a Devolution Order under the Northern Ireland
Act on November 30.
</P>
<P>
Powers would then be transferred to the devolved executive on
December 2.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson's statement outlined to MPs the planned timetable for
devolution, to be put into action as long as Ulster Unionists back
the proposals for a power-sharing executive followed by the
disarming of terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
The statement is a progress report after the minister revealed
a 10-day timetable for devolution at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland will only have a devolved government on
December 2 if Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble manages to sell
the current deal to his divided party, a job which demands his
full efforts over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Some of his opponents fear the party will split if they accept
the plan. Trimble is expected to meet his deputy John Taylor, who
has come down against the deal, to try and persuade him to change
his stance. The two men are expected to meet on Tuesday at the
Commons after Taylor returns from a parliamentary visit to the
Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi National Assembly Urges UN to Lift Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- There is no solution
other than lifting the sanctions being maintained over nine years
to address the suffering of the Iraqi people, Iraq said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the United Nations, Saadoun Hammadi, Speaker of
the National Assembly of the Republic of Iraq said his country has
done everything required by the relevant Security Council
resolutions and the sanctions should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations should adopted a resolution prohibiting in
time of war the targeting of cities and residential neighborhoods
as well as attacks on all installations relating to the lives of
civilians, the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
The Representatives of the people of Iraq urge an immediate
halt to the daily attacks being carried out by the United States
and British aircraft under the cloak of the so-called no-fly zones
imposed on Iraq without any legal basis, Saadoun Hammadi said.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said the international humanitarian organizations
should play an active role in mitigating the suffering of the
people of Iraq that has been caused by the unjust embargo now
entering it ninth year, and they should strive most earnestly for
the lifting of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly of Iraq invites all men of good will
throughout the world and those whose consciences are moved by the
suffering of the people of Iraq, whether parliamentarians or
members of international humanitarian organizations, to visit Iraq
in order to ascertain the nature of the suffering caused by the
maintenance of the embargo and the insistence of the United States
on its position of hostility to Iraq, the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
He called upon them to raise their voices in revealing the true
character of the aggression committed and to strive for the
lifting of the embargo imposed on the people of Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends to Extend Mandate of UNDOF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday recommended to extend the mandate of the
United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) for a further
period of six months until May 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the United Nations Security Council, Annan said
the situation in the Israeli-Syrian sector has remained quiet and
there has been no serious incident.
</P>
<P>
Despite the present quiet in the sector, the situation in the
Middle East continues to be potentially dangerous and is likely to
remain so, unless and until a comprehensive settlement covering
all aspects of the Middle East problem can reached, the U.N. chief
said.
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed the hope that the determined efforts will be
made by all concerned to tackle the problem in all its aspects,
with a view to arriving at a just and durable peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
In making the recommendation, Annan pointed out the serious
shortfall in the funding of the force, saying unpaid assessments
amount to 53.8 million U.S. dollars, a sum far larger than the
current annual budget of UNDOF.
</P>
<P>
UNDOF was established in May 1974 to supervise the ceasefire
called for by the United Nations Security Council and the
agreement on disengagement between Israeli and Syrian forces of
May 31, 1974.

<HEADLINE> Israeli State of Emergency Likely to End Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The 51-year-old state of
emergency in Israel is likely to be canceled next summer after the
government recommended legal steps toward normalcy.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, the cabinet
Sunday decided to recommend to the Knesset (parliament) extend the
existing state of emergency for only six months when it expires on
January 26, 2000. The Justice Ministry will redraft the regulations
into normal legislation afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Beilin plans to bring the six-month extension request for
Knesset approval by the end of this week. The government normally
requests a one-year extension.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency, adopted when the Jewish state was
established following the 1948 Mideast War, allows Israel to hold
Arabs in prison for several months without charge or trial and
permits the government to confiscate civilian goods for military
use.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, when the basic law for direct elections came into
force, the Knesset has had to approve the extension of the state
of emergency each year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A three-day workshop on
demining techniques started here on Monday, with participants
calling for governments to support efforts to clear landmines.
</P>
<P>
A total of 18 participants from Mozambique, South Africa,
Canada, France, China, Italy, Austria, Germany and Zimbabwe are
attending the workshop which is jointly organized by Mine Tech

</P>
<P>
They said the techniques being used such as mine detecting dogs
and metal detectors were not safe and effective enough to clear
all the mines.
</P>
<P>
Metal detectors were sometimes affected by the type of soil,
landmine and the depth of the mine.
</P>
<P>
The participants were on Monday afternoon expected to leave for
Mutare of east Zimbabwe where they would see the demining exercise
in that area.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 million anti-personal landmines are scattered in 71

<HEADLINE> Indian Cabinet Expanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indian cabinet led by
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was expanded on Monday with
the induction of three cabinet ministers and a minister of state,
according to a communique issued by the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
The expansion, which also included several shifts, gave
representation to a small party in the ruling National Democratic
Alliance led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and brought in three
BJP members, two of whom from the key states of Uttar Pradesh and
Bihar.
</P>
<P>
Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, a veteran leader of the local party
Shiromani Akali Dal in the northwestern state of Punjab, was sworn
in Monday evening as minister of works and estates, carved out of
the Urban Development Ministry.
</P>
<P>
BJP chief in Uttar Pradesh Rajnath Singh was given the
portfolio of surface transport while his predecessor Nitish Kumar
was shifted to agriculture, the portfolio which had been held by
Vajpayee since the formation of his cabinet early last month.
</P>
<P>
Singh, who became BJP president in Uttar Pradesh in 1997, was
the country's education minister in 1991.
</P>
<P>
C. P. Thakur, 68, now minister of water resources, is an
emeritus professor of medicine in Patna Medical College in Bihar
and a former congressman who later jointed the BJP and won the
election to the Lok Sabha or the lower house in 1998 and again in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Noted journalist Arun Shourie, inducted as a minister of state,
is now in charge of planning, statistics and program
implementation and the Department of Administrative Reforms and
Public Grievances under the Ministry of Personnel, Public
Grievances and Pensions.
</P>
<P>
With the induction of the four new faces, the strength of the
Vajpayee cabinet has gone up to 74.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Pramod Mahajan was shifted from water
resources to the newly-created Ministry of Information Technology
in addition to parliamentary affairs in the re-allocation of
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
Among the ministers of state, Santosh Gangwar was removed from
science and technology and given charge of petroleum and natural
gas and additional charge of parliamentary affairs.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Welcomes Reopening of Afghan-Iran Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Monday welcomed the
reopening of the Islam Qila border post along the Afghanistan-Iran
border to facilitate bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
"The decision by the two neighbors will promote better
understanding. Pakistan views this development as a positive
step," said a statement issued by the Foreign Office here.
</P>
<P>
It said Pakistan hopes that this will lead to the
"normalization of relations" between Iran and Afghanistan's ruling
Taliban militia. Such a development will benefit the people of
both countries, it added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has always been of the view that all countries inside
and outside the region should engage the Taliban to promote
mutually beneficial interaction and durable peace and stability in
Afghanistan, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the Taliban have reportedly also agreed to reopen the
Iranian consulate in the western Afghan city of Herat following
the reopening of the Afghan-Iran border.
</P>
<P>
The consulate was closed last year after relations between Iran
and the Taliban worsened in August 1998 when nine Iranian
diplomats and a journalist were killed in the northern Afghan city
of Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's Governor of Herat Province Mulla Khairullah
Khairkhwa, who held talks with the former Iranian consul general
in Herat recently, described the accord as a move toward
improvement of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Afghanistan will import wheat flour, ghee,
sugar and petroleum products from Iran, which will also buy
products from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that the border will not be closed again
at least over the next five years even if there is war in
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> New Project Launched to Promote Healthy Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- China started a nationwide "
Green Project" today to further promote healthy consumption among
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The activity is sponsored by the State Administration of
Internal Trade (SAIT), the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of
Public Health and several other departments.
</P>
<P>
The "Green Project" refers to the program of cultivating an
environmentally sound market, promoting healthy and nutritious
consumption and building networks for the transportation of such
foods.
</P>
<P>
As people's living standards improve, their demand for
healthier, nutritious foods and clean environment increases.
</P>
<P>
Huang Hai, a senior official with SAIT, said that the total
output volume of vegetables, meat, eggs, milk, aquatic products
and fruits accounts for some 52 percent of China's agricultural
produce.
</P>
<P>
The average consumption of milk, eggs and meat by a Chinese
each year has exceeded or almost reached the average international
level, while the consumption of vegetables has doubled the
international level, said Huang.
</P>
<P>
However, the quality of many agricultural products is far from
satisfactory, and fake products on the market are a major concern
for everyone.
</P>
<P>
One of the key tasks of the project is to build efficient
transportation networks across China to circumvent the illegal
transportation of farm produce.

<HEADLINE> Britain Won't Agree Early Vote on Next UN-Iraq Oil Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 22 (Xinhua) - Britain said on Monday that it
did not expect the United Nations to bring forward a vote on the
seventh phase of its oil-for-food exchange with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so. We are not in that position. It's very much
an Iraqi decision," a spokesman at the British foreign office
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came after Iraq said on Saturday that it could not
accept a U.N. proposal extending the sixth six-month phase of
oil-for-food by two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad said it would suspend its oil exports for two weeks
because it had already fulfilled its obligations under the sixth
phase of the program which is designed to help Iraqi civilians
suffering the impact of U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council voted to extend phase six of the
arrangement because it is hoping to solve a dispute over a
comprehensive package that would ease the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Price Hits Three-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The average price of the OPEC's
basket of seven crudes soared to a three-year high of 24.35 U.S.
dollars per barrel last week, from 23.33 U.S. dollars per barrel
over the previous week, the Vienna-based OPEC Secretariat
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the sharp price increase to OPEC members
sticking to their agreement to curb oil production and an
increasing demand on heating fuel during the cold winter days in
European and American countries.
</P>
<P>
OPEC officials recently pointed out that the organization will
stick to the agreement despite enormous pressure from other
countries to increase oil production.
</P>
<P>
Supported by non-OPEC oil-producing countries, the agreement
has created a balance in the oil market. However, their efforts
face enormous pressure from other countries, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Since OPEC oil ministers reached an agreement on reducing oil
production in March, the price of crude oil has risen steadily.
Experts predict that the price will increase to 25 to 30 dollars
per barrel during this winter.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian, Chinese Leaders Pledge Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and his Chinese counterpart, Zhu Rongji, both
pledged Monday to forge closer friendly relations between their
countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner in honor of the Chinese premier here
Monday night, Mahathir said, "The last 25 years have seen much
progress in Sino-Malaysian relations." "It is important that
concerted efforts are made to further build upon such progress so
as to enhance bilateral relations in all fields."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir expressed his confidence that Zhu's visit will
contribute significantly to achieving this objective.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia is pleased to see that the economic links
between the two countries especially in the last decade have
expanded considerably both in scope and volume and two-way
investment has also seen encouraging progress.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the scope for expansion in the economic fields
between Malaysia and China is tremendous.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, the Chinese premier said that earlier this
year, the two governments signed an agreement on the framework for
future bilateral cooperation, which charts the course for the
establishment of an all-round relationship of good-neighborliness,
friendship and cooperation between China and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China and Malaysia are close neighbors and that
since the two countries established diplomatic ties 25 years ago,
the bilateral friendly relations and cooperation have made
all-round progress under the guidance of the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that with bilateral efforts, China
and Malaysia will surely build even broader and closer friendly
relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The friendly contacts and exchanges between our two peoples
have become ever closer. Our mutually beneficial cooperation has
been deepening in all fields," Zhu said. "This has brought
benefits to our two countries and two peoples and also contributed
positively to regional stability and prosperity."
</P>
<P>
"On the verge of the new century, let us look to the future and
move forward hand in hand. Let us write a still more splendid
chapter of Sino-Malaysian friendship in the new century," he said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Reports: Tobacco Giant Fortifies Nicotine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Canadians are being warned of
getting an unprecedented peek of smokers as some big tobacco firms
are trying to "fortify" and "enhance" the nicotine in cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Ottawa Citizen and the Gazette newspapers reported
Monday that "the tobacco industry conducted intensive research" on
nicotine fortification "so that addicted smokers would keep buying
the product."
</P>
<P>
Citing "newly released documents", the reports said the firms
also targeted young people, including teenagers, for taking up the
habit of smoking.
</P>
<P>
Strategies taken by the tobacco firms range from using
sophisticated lifestyle advertisements to introducing the
so-called "light" cigarettes to prevent health-conscious smokers
from quitting, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The documents are stored at a depository in Guildford, England
-- home of the international conglomerate, British American
Tobacco (BAT), said the reports.
</P>
<P>
BAT has cigarette companies around the world under its
corporate wing, including Montreal based Imperial Tobacco Ltd.,
Canada's largest cigarette manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government plans to used some of the material to
defend itself in a lawsuit already launched by the tobacco
industry, which claims the recent outlawing of lifestyle
advertising is "unconstitutional", the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Appreciates China's Commitment to Regional Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Monday expressed
its appreciation of China's commitment to forge greater regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he was pleased
to note the progress achieved in China's relations with the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) over the years.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate the support given by the PRC (People's Republic
of China), as a full dialogue partner of ASEAN and as a member of
the ASEAN Regional Forum, to the various ASEAN proposals and
initiatives to strengthen regional cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We also appreciate the PRC's commitment in building upon
existing ASEAN-China consultative and cooperative processes in
various areas," he said in his address at a dinner here Monday
night in honor of the visiting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said he was confident that closer Sino-ASEAN
cooperation and friendship would bring positive impacts to greater
regional collaboration in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
To further strengthen regional and economic cooperation,
Mahathir said, it is timely that the PRC, together with Malaysia
and other East Asian countries, consider seriously the
establishment of the East Asian Monetary Fund, the benefits of
which are well appreciated by the member countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir stressed the importance of overcoming weaknesses that
exist in the current global financial architecture through the
creation of a new financial architecture with the participation of
both developed and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia looks forward to the PRC playing a positive role in
this regard, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S., Britain of Blocking Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Ministry said on
Monday that the United States and British representatives at the
United Nations Sanctions Committee had suspended another 33 of its
contracts signed under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the ministry said those blocked contracts were
concluded in the fifth and sixth phases of the oil-for-food
program with companies of Italy, France, Canada, Belgium, China,
Switzerland, Russia, Germany, Jordan, Turkey and Armenia.
</P>
<P>
The contracts were for the purchases of spare parts and
equipment for its oil and electricity sectors as well as other
equipment and machines, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to sell limited
amount of oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and
infrastructure-related materials for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
The sixth phase expired on November 20. The U.N. Security
Council approved unanimously last Friday to extend this phase for
two weeks until December 4 to allow more time for Iraq to reach
its export ceiling of 8.3 billion U.S. dollars set by the council.
</P>
<P>
Though Baghdad publicly announced its rejection to the
extension of the program, it seemed that Iraq has not stopped the
export of oil.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing indicates that the flow of oil has been stopped till
now," said a U.N. source on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the U.S. and British envoys at
the Sanctions Committee of deliberately delaying the approval of
its contracts, arguing that the oil-for-food deal has failed to
alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> S. Lankan President Blames Rebels for Civilian Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga on Monday blamed Tamil Tiger rebels for the death of
38 innocent Tamil civilians who were killed over the weekend in a
mortar attack on a 17th-century church in the northern Wanni
region.
</P>
<P>
"This attack once again demonstrates to the entire world the
brutal, savage and inhuman character of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE)," Kumaratunga said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
She said the tragic incident was more proof of the fact that
the LTTE not only does not confine itself to killing Sinhalese
people, but also does not hesitate to kill innocent Tamil
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The president said she had instructed relevant authorities to
provide relief and assistance to families of all victims. She also
appointed a high-ranking committee to provide necessary food,
medical assistance and all other relief and help to the refugees
in the church.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting the Sinhalese-dominated
government troops to demand a separate state for minority Tamils
in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry said on Sunday that the LTTE rebels had
fired mortars on the Catholic church in Madhu on Saturday night
where thousands of displaced civilians took shelter due to the
ongoing fighting.
</P>
<P>
It said 28 civilians had been killed instantly and 10 more died
later in hospital. Another 56 civilians injured in the attack were
being treated at a nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said government troops had by Saturday noon
regained control over the church which was seized by LTTE rebels
last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the LTTE on Sunday denied firing mortars on civilians.
It said in a statement that government troops had shelled the
church and used refugees taking shelter there as human shields.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which gave
emergency medical supplies to the wounded, expressed its deep
shock and urged both sides to spare civilians places of worship.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga has directed the army to withdraw from
the Madhu church premises to prevent further attacks by the LTTE
on the church and the civilians, the Government Information
Department said Monday night.

<HEADLINE> India Not Averse to Talks With Pakistan: Vajpayee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee said here Monday that New Delhi is not averse to
talks with the military regime in Pakistan provided an atmosphere
conducive to dialogue is created for meaningful parleys.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared for talks but a conducive atmosphere has to be
created for meaningful dialogue," Vajpayee told the media
immediately after the swearing-in of four new union ministers at
the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
In a reply to a question about whether India is willing to
resume talks with the military regime led by General Pervaiz
Musharraf, the Indian leader said, "Yes, the present set-up in
Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "it should not be a dialogue for the sake of
it. No condition has been put by us. The atmosphere should be
conducive for the talks to be fruitful."
</P>
<P>
India has been maintaining that Islamabad must put a halt to
cross-border terrorism in the disputed Jammu and Kashmir and other
parts of the country for the resumption of talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported that India
and Pakistan have agreed not to resort to firing across the border
and decided instead to discuss and sort out "issues" at their flag
meetings on the border.
</P>
<P>
The firing across the border and on civilians was reportedly
discussed at the four-day biannual meeting of commanders from the
two neighbors in Lahore, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that such firings should stop immediately, PTI
said. The decision was confirmed by reports reaching here from
Islamabad.

<HEADLINE> Holland Backs Indian Bid for UN Security Council Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands Monday
expressed its support for India's bid for permanent membership in
an enlarged U.N. Security Council and shared New Delhi's concerns
about cross-border terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"India is a very important and prominent candidate for such a
prestigious position," said Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, who
arrived here Saturday for a five-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Kok, who held wide-ranging discussions with President Kocheril
Raman Narayanan, Vice President Krishan Kant and Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee here Monday, told the media that he was "very
receptive" to India's concerns about cross-border terrorism.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the visiting Dutch leader, Indian
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha explained that it was difficult
for New Delhi to agree to start a new round of trade negotiations
when developed countries had not fulfilled their obligations in
the existing World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements.
</P>
<P>
India is hoping that the Netherlands would take a firm position
at the upcoming WTO meeting in Seattle particularly on attempts of
the developed countries to abuse labor standards and the
environment to legitimize protectionism.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi looks upon the Netherlands as an important ally and
an influential member of the European Union which would help push
through its perceptions on various issues.
</P>
<P>
Official sources here said that during their talks, the leaders
of the two countries discussed the recent developments in Pakistan
as well as nuclear weapons and security, with special focus on
enhancing economic and trade ties between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Opens Free Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti Free Trade
Zone (KFTZ) located in Shuwaikh Industrial Area, about four
kilometers east of the capital Kuwait City, was inaugurated Monday
after nine months of unofficial operations.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the KFTZ was a turning point for Kuwaiti economy
as it will enable Kuwait to become a financial and trade center in
the region, said Minister of Commerce and Industry Abdul Wahab
Mohammad al-Wazzan at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The opening, which was initially scheduled for earlier this
year, was postponed several times.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 contracts have been inked so far mainly with
local companies for light industrial and service-oriented
activities, he added.
</P>
<P>
Some companies from Europe, Middle East and Asia also showed
interests in doing business in or through the zone, he said.
</P>
<P>
KFTZ Director General Juhail Al-Juhail said earlier this year
that the zone was established to boost trade with neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the zone will promote the entrepot trade
between Iran and Saudi Arabia, whose tense relations began to ease
up until after the election of moderate Iranian President Mohammed
Khatami in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The free trade zone could serve as a junction point of trade
cooperation between Tehran and Riyadh," the director said.
</P>
<P>
In October, an Iranian official delegation comprising
government officials and businessmen visited the zone.
</P>
<P>
The KFTZ, which is to be managed by Kuwait's National Real
Estate Company, will offer tax-free investment opportunities to
re-export and light industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
It will issue import-export licenses to related companies
within hours and offer health insurance and legal consultations
to any project in the zone.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Send Troops to Intervene in Niger Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government deployed
 troops at the weekend in the oil-rich Niger Delta in an attempt
to resume law and order.
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reported on Monday
that dozens of army trucks were seen Sunday moving into an area of
Bayelsa State, where earlier this month youths of the ethnic Ijaw
group killed at least 12 policemen.
</P>
<P>
The main road across the Niger Delta connecting the cities of
Warri and Port Harcourt has been blocked by the army since
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The troops are not allowing journalists or anyone else into the
area around the town of Odi in Bayelsa State which is in the
middle of the Delta.
</P>
<P>
People who fled that area say they had heard lots of shooting.
The well armed Ijaw youths are reportedly taking refuge near Odi.
</P>
<P>
Neither the army nor the Nigerian government have made comment
on these latest developments, which came after weeks of unrest in
the Delta.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo had earlier ordered the
governor of Bayelsa State to restore order by the 24th of this
month or accept the imposition of a state of emergency.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Must Turn to Export-Oriented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Africa's industrial and
economic growth should depend increasingly on exports in the next
century if the continent is to face the challenge of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO) on Monday said if the growth was
not export-led, it might risk being stifled by sluggish domestic
markets.
</P>
<P>
"There are other risks too. Small markets breed cartels and
monopolies, which in turn undermine competitiveness and also deter
direct foreign investment, thereby restrict access to export,"
read the statement.
</P>
<P>
Citing the growth in Africa's most successful economies,
Mauritius and Botswana, which it said were export-led, the
statement noted the industrial growth in Africa would have to be
substantially export-driven over the next 20 years, because
African markets were small with low per capita income and small
populations and gross domestic product (GDP) of less than seven
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The failure of African exporters to break into global market to
sell their manufactured goods underlined the need for openness in
the form of inward foreign direct investment and imports of
technology and skills, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"On the eve of the 21st century, Africa has been hit hard by
globalization, its loss of market share of primary commodities and
its failure to break into world markets for manufactured goods are
having major adverse effects," it said.
</P>
<P>
In the 21st century, the statement said, industrial policy in
Africa would shift from measures designed to protect specific
sectors to creating an enabling environment for industries to grow
and flourish.
</P>
<P>
"This included nurturing the start-up and growth of new firms,
supporting research and development, improving the spread of
technology, knowledge and information, building links between
large and small firms and between local and foreign investors and
to help firms to find, access and penetrate export markets," it
said.
</P>
<P>
It went on explaining that such policies would be essential for
sub- Saharan countries to make the difficult transition from
resource-led growth which was likely to remain in the foreseeable
future to more diversified industrial growth.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the engine for Africa's economic
growth has witnessed a shift from manufacturing toward energy,
mining, utilities and services, with manufacturing's contribution
to GDP declining to 14.1 percent in sub-Saharan Africa during the
last decade.

<HEADLINE> Sub-Saharan Africa Urged to Improve Infant Feeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Sub-Saharan African
countries should enhance capacity to respond to infant feeding
needs in emergency situations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of a five-day Africa Regional
Workshop on Infant Feeding in Emergencies here on Monday,
Tanzanian Minister of Health Aaron Chiduo said caring of the
infant populations during emergencies unfortunately remains a
global humanitarian priority at a great proportion.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Contributions Fall 3.8 percent for Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Contributions to registered
retirement savings plans (RRSP) fell by 3.8 percent last year to
26.6 billion Canadian dollars (about 18.2 billion U.S. dollars) in
the country, Statistics Canada said Monday.
</P>
<P>
More than 6.2 million people put 26.6 billion Canadian dollars
into their RRSPs, representing 0.6 percent fewer contributors and
3.8 percent less in contributions, a first drop since 1991, said
the official agency.
</P>
<P>
RRSP contributions grew at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in the
past seven years until the end of 1997, when the growth began to
slow down, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the RRSP contributions were in proportion
with average incomes.
</P>
<P>
People with yearly incomes over 80,000 Canadian dollars (about
54,720 U.S. dollars) contributed an average of 13,298 dollars
(about 9,096 U.S. dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, those with incomes of 60,000 Canadian dollars
(about 41,040 U.S. dollars) invested an average 6,356 dollars
(about 4,348 U.S. dollars) in RRSP.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the year's RRSP contributions was also
illustrated as a result of the downsizing of the public sector by
3 percent between 1995 and 1997.

<HEADLINE> France Supports Cyprus' EU Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of European
Affairs Pierre Moscovici said Monday that Paris supported Cyprus'
unhindered accession to the European Union (EU) before a
settlement of the island republic's division problem.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou in
Athens, Moscovici, who arrived here Monday from Turkey, said that
this was a new position on the part of France, which was ready to
reassure that no EU candidate state had the right of veto against
any other candidate.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that both Greece and France welcomed and supported
efforts by the United Nations and they all believed that there
should be a resolution of the Cyprus political problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The island republic has been making efforts to join the EU but
neighboring Turkey opposes Nicosia's EU accession.
</P>
<P>
While backing Nicosia's entry into the EU, Greece, a guarantor
of Cyprus, also supports Ankara's EU membership bid with
conditions.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton
administration said on Monday that it took "very seriously" a
published report that Iran sold Scud missiles to the Democratic
Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times reported on Monday that U.S. spy
agencies detected Iranian Scud B and Scud C missile systems in
the central African nation over past several weeks.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper alleged that Iran sold Scud missiles to Kinshasa
last month in the first export of its homemade versions of the
widely used short-range missile.
</P>
<P>
"We take these kinds of reports very seriously," said Jim
Fallin, a spokesman for the White House's National Security
Council. But he admitted that the United States has "no credible
evidence that such a sale has occurred."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department spokesman James Rubin, taking the
same tone, said Washington "will be following vigorously various
reports... and taking appropriate action when there is evidence
that... transfers of concern have taken place."

<HEADLINE> Water Shortage Hits Southern Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Serious shortage of water is
badly affecting the subsistence of farmers and nomads in some
parts of southern somalia.
</P>
<P>
There had been almost no rain during the rainy season starting
from September in Bakol and Bay regions.
</P>
<P>
Prolonged drought has also made the land barren, killing the
hope of the usual sorghum harvest of the year, and animals in the
region are forced to move to wet areas.
</P>
<P>
Governor of Bakol region, Aden Mohamed Nur Soransor, told
Xinhua on VHF radio from Huddor town Tuesday that the situation is
grave and the people have started dying for hunger and its related
diseases.
</P>
<P>
Soransor said the average death now exceeds more than 10 people
per day, especially the children and the elderly people in the
five districts of the region.
</P>
<P>
In the worst effected towns of El-Bardeh, Rabdhurreh, Tigeglow
and Wajid,

people are now on the brink of fleeing from their own hometowns,
the governor said.
</P>
<P>
The number of death in Bay region is reported to be four per
day, but the famine-related diseases such as tuberculosis and
anemia are also taking their toll.
</P>
<P>
Severe diarrhea is attacking the children in the region, often
causing fatalities.
</P>
<P>
The authorities in Bakol and Bay are especially concerned over
the coming dry season when no rains are expected.
</P>
<P>
The people in the two regions mainly depend on their sorghum
crops, which they supplied to the rest of southern Somalia
including capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Despite food aid from United Nations agencies, this little help
is far from quenching the desperate need for food in the region.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities have appealed for more tangible food
assistance before the dry season begins.

<P>
VIENTIANE, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Lao government is
pleased with the impending return of Macao to China, another major
achievement in China's reunification process following China's
resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, Lao
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavad said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a press interview with Xinhua, Lengsavad said Macao's
scheduled reversion to China reflects the concept of "one country,
two systems" put forward by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping,
and is another vital step in China's bid for the country's
complete reunification.
</P>
<P>
Macao will revert to China on December 20 after more than 300
years of Portuguese colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the ways of solving the Hong Kong and Macao issues
will be a model for settling the Taiwan issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lengsavad also reaffirmed his government's one-China policy.
The Lao government has always adhered to the one-China policy and
maintains that the People's Republic of China is the sole
legitimate government of China and Taiwan is a province of China,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope China will become stronger after the return of Macao
and contribute more to world peace, stability and development," he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) said in Harare Tuesday that there is need to form
partnerships in Africa to curb the prevalence of malaria.
</P>
<P>
There is need to strengthen manpower in order to effectively
manage malaria in African countries, said Akpa Gbary, WHO medical
officer for Roll Back Malaria, a program aimed at reducing malaria
mortality by half by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Some African countries have organized national conferences to
bring together stakeholders to agree upon initiatives against
malaria and also identify the way forward, Gbary noted.
</P>
<P>
He said in March and April this year, 43 countries in Africa
held consensus building meetings to increase awareness toward the
initiative of Roll Back Malaria.
</P>
<P>
The meetings had a high political support from various
governments, the WHO official said, adding most countries
indicated that they had commenced partnerships with external
departments, non-governmental organizations, civil society and
private sector.
</P>
<P>
However, there is a problem of unavailability of drugs to treat
malaria in some areas in Africa, Gbary pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Out of between 270 million to 480 million malaria cases which
are recorded each year globally, 80 percent of the cases were from
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Malaria also accounted for one million deaths annually
worldwide and 90 percent of them were from the African states.

<P>
VIENTIANE, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Lao Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavad said here Tuesday that his
country will continue to adhere to the policies of reform and
opening up and develop its market economy while following the path
of socialism.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Lengsavad said that Laos has
achieved remarkable accomplishments over the past 10 years since
the country adopted the policy of opening up. It has not only
secured political stability, economic growth and better living
standards, but also consolidated and enhanced foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the entry into force of the law on foreign
investment in 1988, Laos has absorbed more than seven billion U.S.
dollars in contractual foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
In the early 2001, the Lao People's Revolutionary Party will
convene the Seventh National Congress to map out future
development strategies with an eye toward lifting the country out
of poverty by 2020.
</P>
<P>
Laos will continue to carry on its reform and opening-up drive
and develop a market economy while following the path of socialism,
he added.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, he said, Laos will pursue its advantages and
put emphasis on the development of agriculture, while making
coordinated efforts to improve the industry and service sectors.
It will also step up its infrastructure construction and devote
more efforts to personnel cultivation and exploitation.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said the bulk of the Lao economy is
privately based and accounts for 80 percent of the entire economy.
Laos will continue to absorb foreign funds and make special
efforts to develop the hydroelectric industry and produce
environmentally friendly agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
He said Laos has abundant hydroelectric resources, and rich,
pollution-free soil, which have great potential. It welcomes
foreign investment in both fields. The country also invites
foreign businessmen to open independent businesses and will
provide preferential taxation terms, he added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Not Ready for Accession to WTO: Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia is still not ready for
integration into the world economy, including accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO), Russian Premier Vladimir Putin
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is not ready for successful integration into the world
economy because neither the state, nor producers are prepared for
tough international competition, when we have proved unable to
create an effective system of protectionism measures for domestic
commodity producers," Putin said at a meeting of the Coordination
Council of Domestic Commodity Producers.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has suffered sizable losses in the course of
integrating into the world economy, so there is a need for
carefully considering Russia's entering the WTO," he said. Russia
must exercise "a very weighted approach" to joining the WTO and
this step will yield "more pluses," he said, adding that China has
been negotiating for WTO membership for thirteen years.
</P>
<P>
However, Putin stressed that Russia's strategy in foreign
markets "should be more active and aggressive."
</P>
<P>
"Political support for Russian exporters must be intensified
at the top level," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's economy should turn to expansion of the domestic and
external markets," he said. Furthermore, "its constituents should
look beyond inter-regional cooperation."
</P>
<P>
He urged to "discard the arising tendencies for self-isolation
of Russian regions," noting that "we break up our common economic
expanse, our country, by imposing internal regional restrictions."
</P>
<P>
He also called for "increasing state regulation in the
economic and financial spheres and better work by law enforcement
agencies," because "organized crime and corruption pose a major
problem for our life and economy."
</P>
<P>
"We have worked seriously on both directions recently and the
results will be known in the near future," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK Sees Growth in Volume of Retail Sales, Drop in Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The index for the volume of
Hong Kong's retail sales in September was 82.3, 2.5 percent up
from the same month of last year, according to the provisional
figures on retail sales released Tuesday by the Census and
Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the index for the value of retail sales decreased by
6.1 percent to 82.9.
</P>
<P>
The value of retail sales in September totaled about 14.4
billion HK dollars (1.85 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The figures mean that the retailers sold more to earn less, but
consumers benefited from cheaper prices and tourists gave a modest
boost to the market, Ian K Perkin, chief economist of the Hong
Kong General Chamber of Commerce said after the release of the
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Retailers must now be looking to the Christmas-Millennium-
Chinese New Year period, extending from December to early February,
for a boost to near-term sales, Perkin said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Help Indonesia in Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Singapore reaffirmed its
willingness to help Indonesia in its economic recovery on Tuesday,
two weeks after Singapore leaders made the promise to visiting
Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question in the parliament on behalf of Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong, Minister for Foreign Affairs and for Law
S. Jayakumar said Singapore is ready to work with Indonesia to
assist in its economic recovery by restoring investor confidence
in Indonesia and bringing back investments back to that country.
</P>
<P>
Referring Indonesia as one of Singapore's closest neighbors and
a major trading partner, Jayakumar said Singapore can play a
catalytic role to help Indonesia restore investor confidence
through practical measures and the existing cooperation platforms
can be leveraged to help Indonesia achieve early results in
bringing back investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore believes that Wahid's suggestion for turning
Batam into a free trade zone is "a good idea" to increase
attractiveness for foreign investors and create more employment
opportunities for Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
Apart from bringing in foreign exchange and creating jobs, he
said, there will also be positive spin-offs for other sectors and
industries in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Drawing attention to Indonesia's enormous tourism potential,
Jayakumar suggested that the two countries intensify tourism
cooperation and stated that Singapore is prepared to work with
Indonesia to re-launch the Indonesia-Singapore Tourism Cooperation
Program.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar confirmed that Prime Minister Goh will lead a
business delegation to visit Indonesia some time early next year
and Philip Yeo, chairman of Singapore's Economic Development
Board, will head a delegation of senior officials to Jakarta at
the end of this month to lay the groundwork for the prime
minister's visit.

Tsang said the government is putting in place other support
programs to benefit future tenants of the Science Park to ensure
its success.
</P>
<P>
They include the 5 billion HK dollar (641 million U.S. dollar)

<HEADLINE> Canada Not Prepared to Impose Sanctions Against Talisman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy Monday insisted on "
hard evidence" to substantiate charges against Talisman by a U.N.
special report on human rights.
</P>
<P>
"It was insufficient in the sense that it didn't deal with some
of the specifics we want to examine," said Axworthy. "We will
weigh the evidence according to our own judgment," he added.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy announced last month that his country would send its
own investigative mission to the East African nation, which is
trying to rid itself of the shadow of nearly 33 years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. human rights official in a recent report accused
Talisman of exploiting oil reserves in the southern part of Sudan,
thus "seriously compounding and exacerbating" the human rights
situation in the war-torn nation.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has declared Sudan to be a country in
support of terrorism, has also criticized Canada for allowing
Talisman to continue its 25 percent partnership with Sudan in the
Greater Nile Oil Project.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy in turn challenged the United States to become active
in promoting an international peace process for Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to do what we can to promote the peace process,
which is not within the U.S. approach," he said.
</P>
<P>
Canada has committed 300,000 Canadian dollars (about 205,230 U.
S. dollars) to the Inter-governmental Authority on Development (
IGAD), an organization of seven East African nations that is
mediating peace in its member country Sudan, according to official
sources.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League supports the
efforts of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to restore sovereignty
over three islands in the Gulf, the assistant secretary-general of
the pan-Arab forum reiterated on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League and the Arab world have reached a common stand
that the UAE has "undisputed sovereignty" over the islands of
Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, Ahmed Ben Helei told a
symposium organized by the Egyptian Press Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
The UAE claims sovereignty over the islands, which Iranian
troops occupied after British troops pullout in 1971.
</P>
<P>
The islands are close to the strategic Hormuz Straits. Rich oil
resource has been found in recent years around the islands.
</P>
<P>
The 22-nation forum also supports all peaceful measures that
the UAE will take to restore its sovereignty over the islands,
Helei was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the league's "rejection of all Iranian measures
aimed at imposing a fait accompli and consecrating its occupation
of the islands."
</P>
<P>
The league will continue its endeavors to persuade Iran to settle
the problem with the UAE peacefully, either through negotiations
or international arbitration, he added.
</P>
<P>
Both the UAE and Iran have expressed readiness to solve their
dispute by peaceful means. The UAE has called for a solution to
the issue through international arbitration while Iran insists on
direct talks.

BEIRUT, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Iranian-backed

create an effective system of protectionism measures for domestic
commodity producers," Putin said at a meeting of the Coordination
Council of Domestic Commodity Producers.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has suffered sizable losses in the course of
integrating into the world economy, so there is a need for
carefully considering Russia's entering the WTO," he said. Russia
must exercise "a very weighted approach" to joining the WTO and
this step will yield "more pluses," he said, adding that China has
been negotiating for WTO membership for thirteen years. (Pakistan-

<HEADLINE> GDP of ASEAN Economies to Grow by 3 PC in 1999: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product
(GDP) of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
economies is projected to grow by 3 percent in 1999, the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) said in a report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said this figure is in sharp contrast to a negative
growth of 7.5 percent in 1998 for ASEAN countries, which groups
the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei,
Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the recovery has been based on an
increase in global demand for electronic products, a rise in
commodity prices and a strengthening of domestic demand as a
result of reflationary monetary and fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
Inventory rebuilding in Asia, particularly in electronics, a
surge in intra-regional trade and rallies in the industrial and
agricultural sectors in some economies have also contributed to
recovery, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand are expected
to register a positive export growth in 1999 after experiencing a
generally negative export growth in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1999, the global recovery in demand for
semiconductors emanating from preparations for achieving Y2K
compliance has led to a surge in exports from Malaysia, Thailand
and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rising international oil prices stimulated exports
in Indonesia, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The ADB pointed out that expansionary fiscal policy has helped
stimulate consumption growth in the Philippines and Thailand while
slowing down the economic downturn in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank said pump-priming of the regional economies
through large fiscal stimulus packages will be used less in the
short to medium term as concern for fiscal balance may limit their
effectiveness for future expansion.
</P>
<P>
According to the ADB, the ASEAN economies will grow by 4.5
percent in 2000 based on continued improvement in domestic demand
and sustained external demand arising from an expansion in world
and intra-regional trade.

<HEADLINE> Manila Moves to Secure Upcoming ASEAN Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The military has mobilized
1,180 troops as additional security force in preparation for the
3rd ASEAN Informal Summit to be held here later this week, a
senior military official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Angelo Reyes, chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines (AFP), said the troops will be deployed under Jose
Calimlim, commanding general of the Presidential Security Group
(PSG), whose unit is primarily tasked to secure the safety of all
delegates attending the summit from November 24 to 28.
</P>
<P>
The government will deploy a total of up to 2,000 troops to
avert any terrorist attack during the five-day conference and more
than half of them will come from the AFP and the rest from the
PSG.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
will discuss at the summit economic competitiveness in the global
market and the future directions of the regional bloc.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said a meeting was also held in the presidential palace
Tuesday afternoon in line with the security preparation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado assured all ASEAN
heads of state and other delegates attending the summit of full
security.
</P>
<P>
He said he has not received any intelligence reports of threats
to the delegates.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we are concerned we have taken all precautionary
measures and I think there will be a safe summit meeting," Mercado
said.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Ready for Talks Over bin Laden: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban's Foreign
Minister Wakil Ahmad Mutawakil Tuesday said the militia are ready
for unconditional talks with the United States over the issue of
alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden, news reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Mutawakil said talks between the two
sides were suspended after U.N. sanctions were imposed on
Afghanistan on November 14 because the Taliban failed to hand over
bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for talks. Amendments can be made if there is
understanding," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not attach any conditions," he added. "On the contrary,
we have made several proposals."
</P>
<P>
Mutawakil said his militia are keen on improving relations with
their neighbor Iran after their border was reopened to trade last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the border was reopened shortly after the U.N.
sanctions were imposed was a mere coincidence, he said.

KUMAMOTO, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia stopped the United
States' giant-killing run 3-2 on Tuesday and remained with Cuba
as the only two unbeaten teams at the World Cup men's volleyball
tournament.
</P>
<P>
The European silver medallists Russia moved another big step
forward for their first major title after scoring a 25-22, 25-19,
20-25, 30-32, 15-11 win over the Americans, who had their four-
game winning streak stopped.
</P>
<P>
"This was indescribable. I am proud of what our team did today.
I told my players not to lose their concentration," said Russian
head coach Guennadi Chipouline after the two-hour battle in
Kumamoto of Japan.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for the Russian team to compete at the
World Cup since 1991. The former Soviet Union won the World Cup
four times, the Olympics three times and the world championships
six times, but the Russians have never won in the three big events,
with their best finish of fourth at the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Americans, surprise winners over Barcelona Olympic
champions Brazil on the opening day and defending champions Italy
Monday, now stood with four wins against one defeat in the 12-team
round robin.
</P>
<P>
The top three finishers will qualify for the Sydney Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
European champions Italy defeated Asian champions China 23-25,
25-16, 25-14, 25-21 for their third win against two defeats, while
Brazil outgunned African champions Tunisia 25-20, 25-20, 25-17.

In Hiroshima, Caribbean champions Cuba ignored a vociferous
crowd to beat host Japan 25-21, 25-22, 25-16, while Spain

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Meets Chinese Top Legislator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese top
legislator Li Peng called on Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi at
State House here Tuesday, hoping the relations and cooperation
between China and Kenya will be enhanced in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress,

first conveyed to President Moi the greetings from Chinese
President Jiang Zemin who visited Kenya in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Li said President Moi is a veteran statesman in Africa and also
an old friend of the Chinese people. Moi, who had visited China
for three times, made valuable contributions to the development of
the Sino-Kenyan relations.
</P>
<P>
Since President Moi's visit to China in 1994 and Chinese
President Jiang' s visit to Kenya in 1996, the Sino-Kenyan
relations have expanded to all fields, Li said, adding the the
friendly relationship between the two countries has entered the
best stage since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in 1963.
</P>
<P>
Moi said China is a great country and it is Kenya's sincere
desire to develop the relations with China. Since its
independence, Kenya has pursued "One China" policy and will
continue to stick to this principled stand.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke highly of Kenya's "One China" policy and admired that
the Kenyan government under the leadership of President Moi
follows the peace, good-neighborhood and non-alignment policies,
and plays an active role in safeguarding peace and promoting
economic cooperation in Africa.
</P>
<P>
On international issues, Li stressed that pluralism is
beneficial to peace and development. All nations in the world,
big or small, rich or poor, should be equal in the world family.
</P>
<P>
After China's access to the World Trade Organization (WTO),
China will, together with other developing countries, safeguard
the rights and interests of all developing countries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Moi expressed his warm congratulation on the signing of the
Sino-U.S. agreement on China's access to the WTO, saying that
China's access would be a support to Kenya, and developing
countries would have more say in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Li also expressed his belief that the African continent with
more than 50 countries and 600 million people has broad prospects
of development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader arrived here Monday for a four-day official
visit.

<HEADLINE> Angola Denies Accusation of Kidnapping Savimbi's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government Tuesday
denied the accusation that an Angolan diplomat had intended to
kidnap a son of Jonas Savimbi, head of the rebel National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
"It can't be true because it is not the orientation of the
Angolan government," Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda said in
response to the accusation.
</P>
<P>
The Togolese government alleged that the Togolese police
succeeded in preventing Angolan diplomat Casimiro Manuel Silva
from committing the abduction, the official Angolan news agency
Angop reported.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Angolan Foreign Ministry said: "The
detention of the Angolan diplomat on Friday was, simply, an
unfriendly act, because kidnapping of citizens is not and has
never been the policy of the Angolan government."
</P>
<P>
Casimiro Silva, a second secretary in the Angolan Embassy to
Nigeria, was in Togolese capital Lome, the spokesman said, adding
that Silva went there for business in Togo under his jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that a delegation of the Angolan
Foreign Ministry will go to Togo to deal with the matter together
with the Togolese government.

BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences (CASS) has completed compilation of its annual Yellow
Book on the World Economy for 1999--2000, which will bring good
news for those who worry about the world's economy.
</P>
<P>
Wang Luolin, CASS executive vice-president and co-head of the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Urged to Stop Interfering in China's Internal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua)-- Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun
Yuxi today urged U.S. Congress to stop interfering in China's
internal affairs by making use of the Taiwan and human rights
issues.
</P>
<P>
Sun's remarks were made during the regular press conference, in
response to a journalist's question concerning the Omnibus Act
which was recently passed by both houses of the United States
Congress -- the House of Representatives and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The Omnibus Act, according to Sun, demands that the U.S. State
Department report to the Congress on efforts made by the executive
branch to support Taiwan's bid to join international organizations,
strengthen the monitoring of China's human rights situation, and
make appropriations available to the so-called "China's Democratic
Movement" overseas.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate also passed a so-called Resolution on China's
Human Rights Question, Sun said, which makes "irresponsible
remarks about China and lodges unreasonable demands."
</P>
<P>
These practices by the U.S. Congress are a gross interference
in China's internal affairs, to which China expresses its strong
dissatisfaction and opposition, Sun stated.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the U.S. congressmen to stop interfering in China's
internal affairs by using the questions of Taiwan and human rights,
the executive branch to clearly oppose these acts and take
effective measures to prevent the anti-China clauses in the
Omnibus Act from becoming law, so as not to affect the improvement
and development of China-U.S. relations," Sun said.

<HEADLINE> White-Fin Dolphins May Disappear From Yangtze River in 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Recent monitoring of the white-
fin dolphins in the Yangtze River indicates that their number is
decreasing dramatically, with far less than 100 now surviving in
the wild.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the white-fin dolphin will become extinct
in about 20 years if effective measures are not taken immediately.
</P>
<P>
The white-fin dolphin, or lipotes vexillifer, is a rare aquatic
mammal only found in the Yangtze River, China's longest. As early
as 2,000 years ago, ancient Chinese documents gave accurate
descriptions of these mammals.
</P>
<P>
However, the habitat of this dolphin has deteriorated
constantly in recent years due to serious pollution, changes in
the ecological environment, busy waterways, and rampant illegal
fishing.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Fishery Bureau of the Ministry of
Agriculture show that in 1984 white-fin dolphins numbered about
400, but diminished to 300 and 200 by 1986 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1997, the bureau began to monitor the mammal every
November along the 1900-km-long middle and lower reaches of the
Yangtze, starting at the Gezhou Dam in central Hubei Province to
Wusongkou at Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
During this year's monitoring, more than 20 ships from five
provinces and Shanghai were sent out, but only five white-fin
dolphins were found, compared with seven in 1998 and 21 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Li Jianhua, vice-director of the bureau, said that related
research institutions are currently analyzing the results of the
three-year monitoring, which will provide a scientific basis for
the bureau to take further action to rescue the endangered species.

<HEADLINE> Asian Countries Seek Effective Crime Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Procurators, justices and
crime prevention officials from 28 Asian countries gathered here
on Tuesday to seek improvement of mutual cooperation in their
fight against crimes in the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Seventh World
Conference of Asia Crime Prevention Foundation (ACPF), Deputy
Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate of China
Liang Guoqing called for enhancing cooperation among Asian
countries to fight crimes and set up a crime prevention regime.
</P>
<P>
The conference, with the theme of Effective Regional
Cooperation in Crime Prevention and Crime Justice in the next
millennium, is scheduled to discuss and foster strategies and
viable approaches on crime prevention.
</P>
<P>
With the world moving toward multi-polarization and integration
and exchanges among countries on the increase, Liang said, crime
has also become international in nature.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries are faced with the common challenge of
combating criminals who flee from one country to another and gang
up with local criminals, he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, it is imperative to enhance cooperation
among countries so as to set up a crime prevention regime.
</P>
<P>
He informed the delegates that China has signed legal
assistance agreements with 28 countries and extradition treaties
with 10 countries. China is ready to exchange experience in
preventing and penalizing crimes with all countries, especially
those in Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Liang also gave a brief account of the procuratorate system in
China and the practice and experience of Chinese procurators in
the field of crime prevention.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting, Indian Law Minister Ram Jethamalani said
New Delhi favors creating international pressure against countries
which give credence and shelter to criminals and various groups
indulging in violence, arson and other unlawful activities.
</P>
<P>
"You can not fight crime at international and global level if a
criminal of one society becomes an honorable guest elsewhere and
is extended best of hospitality," Jethamalani said.
</P>
<P>
Without naming any country, the minister said perpetrators of
crime should not be given "shelter" in any country.
</P>
<P>
ACPF, a non-governmental, non-political and non-profit
organization founded in 1982, strives to promote sustainable
development, peace and stability in Asia and the world through
mutual cooperation and more effective crime prevention, criminal
justice policies and practices.

<P>
But the federal government hadn't declared a state of emergency
or launched a military action in the state, Doyin Okupe, the
spokesman, said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of forces was "under the control of Bayelsa
State Governor Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, the Guardian newspaper
Tuesday quoted Okupe as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also disclosed that President Olusegun Obasanjo
met in capital Abuja Monday with senior government officials,
leaders of the National Assembly (parliament) and the ruling
People's Democratic Party (PDP), as well as key players in the oil
industry to discuss ways of restoring order in the troubled
region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also sought to design means of implementing a
program for the region's rapid development, according to the
presidential spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Okupe also said that meeting was resolved to institute the
monthly forum "to review the progress made toward the improvement
of the situation in the oil-producing areas of the country."
</P>
<P>
Trucks with full load of soldiers were seen running into the
state at the weekend and some fleeing local residents said that
they had heard gun shoots.
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo issued an ultimatum last week, ordering the
Bayelsa State governor to bring the killers of 11 policemen to
justice within two weeks, otherwise, a state of emergency will be
declared in the state.
</P>
<P>
Violence by different ethnic groups continued to flare recently
in the country's oil producing area of Niger Delta, threatening
the operations of multinational oil companies in the area.
Revenue from crude oil accounts for 90 percent of Nigeria's hard
currency incomes.
</P>
<P>
As a climax of the unrest, 11 policemen were taken hostages and
killed by local militant Ijaw youths in Bayelsa two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The Niger Delta region has long been a hotbed of ethnic feuds
and violence, which has claimed thousands of lives over the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts are believed to be deeply rooted in poverty in
the region caused by years of exploitation by foreign oil firms
and neglect by the Northerner-controlled military governments.

had to withdraw because of chickenpox.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Two other men's singles seeded shuttlers were out of race in

</P>
<P>
Indonesia-born Hariyanto Agus of Hong Kong, China, ranked 333rd
in the world, clinched a third round berth by beating former Asian

</P>
<P>
"I was not in top form nowadays, that's why I lost the match,"
said Jeffer.
</P>
<P>
Fourth seed Ng Wei of Hong Kong, China, was defeated by a
steady Lee Huyn Ii of South Korea 15-8 and 15-2.

lesson as he made an easy job by powering past Yuen Sui-hung of
Hong Kong, China, 15-2 and 15-1.
</P>
<P>
In other matches on Tuesday, China's mixed duo Guo Siwei and

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebels Register as Political Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Revolutionary United
Front (RUF) of Sierra Leone has registered as a political party in
a bid to contest for power in future elections in the west African
country.
</P>
<P>
A registration ceremony was held Monday outside Sierra Leone's
Interim National Electoral Commission in central Freetown,
Nigeria's This Day newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The party is registered as the Revolutionary United Front Party
(RUFP), according to RUF spokesman Eldred Collins.
</P>
<P>
The party's symbol is a lion in honor of the name of the
country which was named after the ridge of mountains behind
capital Freetown resembling the outline of a sleeping lion, the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, RUF founding leader Foday Sankoh said that
"the war has now ended and we are in peace. We are going to give
up all our arms and we have succeeded in getting democracy."
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, acting chairman of the electoral
commission, Ibrahim Sesay, described the RUF's registration as
"historic", saying that "we are all looking forward to this day
and we hope the RUF will now surrender their arms and ammunition
in keeping with the Lome Peace Accord."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, seven members of the former rebellion
movement took up their positions in President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah's
new cabinet in line with the Lome Peace Accord signed in July this
year.
</P>
<P>
The RUF was given a blanket amnesty as part of the peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
The RUF first launched a rebellion in 1991, unleashing one of
the most brutal civil wars Africa has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
In the eight-year war, tens of thousands of people died, an
estimated half the country's 4.5 million inhabitants were uprooted
and countless victims had their limbs hacked off.
</P>
<P>
The first units of a 6,000-strong United Nations peace-keeping
force from India and Kenya are due to arrive in Sierra Leone
Thursday and the task of the peace-keeping force will be to
monitor the cease-fire and supervise the disarmament.

<HEADLINE> Senior CPC Official Meets Equatorial Guinea Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, a standing
committee member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC), met with a delegation of
the Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea (DPGE) here today.
</P>
<P>
Wei, who is also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, extended a warm welcome to the delegation headed by
Candido Muatetema Rivas, deputy secretary-general of the DPGE and
a member of its political bureau.
</P>
<P>
Although China and Equatorial Guinea are far apart
geographically, they have developed sound cooperative ties in
various fields since forging diplomatic ties, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
He touched upon the fact that the two countries have consulted
with and supported each other in international affairs, and
President Obiang's three visits to China have actively stimulated
friendly cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On party-to-party relations, Wei noted that during the ten
years since the CPC and the DPGE established relations, they have
conducted frequent contacts and exchanged experiences on party
building and on governing the country.
</P>
<P>
The CPC highly appreciates the DPGE's pursuit of the "one China
" policy since it became the ruling party of the country, he said,
expressing the hope that the two parties will increase cooperation
and broaden overall bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Wei also stressed China's emphasis on relations with Africa,
noting it is a basic point of China's independent foreign policy
of peace to develop relations with African countries and other
developing countries. Looking toward the new century, China is
ready to work together with all African countries to push ties
forward, he said.
</P>
<P>
Candido, on behalf of the people of Equatorial Guinea,
congratulated China on its great achievements and the impending
return of Macao. He stressed that the party, the government, and
the people of Equatorial Guinea will continue to reinforce their
friendly and cooperative ties with China for the benefit of the
people of both countries.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is visiting China as guests of the CPC.

<P>
LUSAKA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Foreign Minister Joao
Miranda arrive in Lusaka Tuesday for a two-day visit to Zambia in
a bid to mend the once soured relations between the two
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan minister said at the airport lounge that his visit
reflects constructive friendship and brotherhood between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Angola will strengthen, consolidate and develop the cooperation
with Zambia, Miranda noted.
</P>
<P>
During his first visit to Zambia, the Angolan foreign minister
will have consultative talks with his Zambian counterpart Keli
Walubita.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba is expected to meet the
Angolan minister Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Early this year Angola repeatedly accused Zambia of allowing
its territory to be used as a springboard for military and
logistic supplies to the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Although Lusaka strongly denied the accusation, the bilateral
ties between Zambia and Angola were strained.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the mediation by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) in June, Angola withdrew its accusation and proposed
that the past misunderstanding be forgotten and a new chapter be
opened in their relations.

<HEADLINE> China Maps Out Regulations to Ensure Navigation Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- China has mapped out
regulations to ensure safe navigation and the safety of
construction within navigable waters.
</P>
<P>
The regulations will take effect on January 1 next year and
will put all construction and activities including bridge building,
aquatic production and sand dredging under the supervision of
maritime safety administrations, said Song Jiahui, deputy director
of the Maritime Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
The regulations require builders to apply for certificates at
the maritime safety administration before starting construction,
and submit to the administrations construction procedures and
contingent measures.
</P>
<P>
During the construction period, the builders should receive
supervision from the maritime safety administration, and after
completion, an assessment will be made.
</P>
<P>
The regulations clearly stipulate that builders without
certificates will be stopped and their projects dismantled. Fines
of up to 30,000 yuan will be imposed on violators, according to
the regulations.
</P>
<P>
With economic development and a more open China, the scale of
construction in the navigable waters is expanding every year, some
of which hinders normal navigation.
</P>
<P>
Some other activities, such as aquatic production and dredging,
are also causing navigation difficulties.

BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua)-- A heavy fog covered Beijing
last night and early this morning, causing expressways and
airports to close temporarily and a sudden increase in road
accidents.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time that such a heavy fog has occurred in
the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The fog forced the closure of the Beijing Capital International
Airport from 7:20 last night to 9:00 this morning. Some trains
were also delayed by the fog.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 traffic police were on patrol to cope with the
traffic.
</P>
<P>
The fog, which covered much of north China is expected to lift
by tonight, said experts at the Central Meteorological Center.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the fog to Beijing's geographical features
and weather conditions. Beijing is surrounded by mountains which
make the moisture in the atmosphere and various pollutants hard to
disperse.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, also
reported heavy fog and expressway and airport closures.

<HEADLINE> Iran Slams Anti-Iran Remarks by German DM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian official on Tuesday
denounced as "trivial and unprincipled" recent remarks by German
Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping on Iran's occupation of the
three disputed islands in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said that Scharping
made the remarks in an attempt to justify sale of weapons to the
Gulf states, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in particular, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a televised program Sunday night, Scharping accused Iran of
supporting terrorism and fundamentalism, and occupying the three
islands of Abu Musa, the Greater and Lesser Tunbs in the Persian
Gulf, over which Iran and the UAE have conflicting sovereignty
claims.
</P>
<P>
The export of various arms and weapons is the factor behind
insecurity in the Persian Gulf region, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that the German official resorted to "the
most vicious propaganda methods by fabricating unfounded and
baseless allegations in an attempt to promulgate seditious
policies in the region."
</P>
<P>
"Such fabrications were made by the defense minister of a
country whose supply of chemical weapons to Iraq during the
1980-88 Iran-Iraq war would never be forgotten," said Asefi.
</P>
<P>
He noted that such "uncalculated" remarks would be no help
to the stability and security of the region nor to the relations
between Iran and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation among regional states is the only means to
consolidate stability and security in the region, he stressed,
adding that strengthening of cooperation and convergence of
regional countries would be realized in the light of Iran's
detente policy.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Enjoys Strong Export Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines enjoyed a trade
surplus of 2.45 billion U.S. dollars in the first seven months of
the year, outperforming most of its Asian neighbors, due to a
bullish export growth, the government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a briefing, presidential spokesman Jerry Barican
cited a 17-percent export growth posted by the country from
January to September.
</P>
<P>
He noted that for September alone exports soared by 32.5
percent, bringing the year-to-date exports growth to an average of
17 percent which he said "remains one of the highest in the
region."
</P>
<P>
"Unlike the case of other Asian countries where improvements in
the trade balance were only accounted for by a slowdown in
imports, ours was due mainly to very strong exports," Barican
said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the favorable trade performance, Barican said,
the Philippines posted a current account surplus of 2.5 billion
dollars and an overall balance of payment surplus of 2.8 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the inflow of foreign investment showed
substantial increases this year, with net foreign investments for
the first seven months reaching 1.1 billion dollars, significantly
higher than the 775 million dollars posted during the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Barican, the greater part of these investments
consisted of the more stable foreign direct investments, which
accounted for 569 million dollars of the total, as against
portfolio investments which amounted to 453 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The inflow of remittances from overseas Filipino workers has
also ballooned by 48.44 percent in the first seven months of the
year compared with a year ago, reaching 4.5 billion dollars from
January to July, 1999.
</P>
<P>
International organizations like the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) have cited Manila's remarkable ability to
bounce back from the Asian financial crisis that slowed regional
growth for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank said the Philippines is expected to be among the
very first Asian countries to recover from the Asian currency
turmoil that began in 1997.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Manila-based ADB lauded the nation's
economic and monetary policies which contributed a great deal to
the faster rebound of the Philippine economy compared with most of
its neighbors in Asia, including some of the region's once-fast
growing tiger economies.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Talks to Go Into Second Round: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides said the proximity talks on Cyprus to be held next month
in New York will be followed by at least a second round of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon arrival Monday night from Athens, Greece,
Clerides said there would be no visible progress on the Cyprus
issue before the European Union (EU) summit in Helsinki on
December 10-11.
</P>
<P>
He said that the proximity talks would be suspended over the
Christmas period but would resume.
</P>
<P>
Clerides was returning from a lengthy trip that had taken him
to South Africa for a Commonwealth meeting, to Istanbul for a
summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
and Greece.
</P>
<P>
The proximity talks on Cyprus are due to begin in New York on
December 3 and during the following week, the EU summit will
decide on whether to accept Turkey as a candidate country.
</P>
<P>
Clerides pledged to continue the talks no matter what will come
out of the first round of contacts.
</P>
<P>
He refused to disclose ideas and strategies he had discussed
with Greek officials in Athens on the EU summit and Turkey's
aspirations to obtain candidate status.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Turkish
Cypriots-controlled north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of
the island after a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The talks held between the two communities two years ago
failed when the Turkish side refused to negotiate unless its
breakaway state in northern Cyprus was recognized and Cyprus
withdrew its application for EU membership.

DAR ES SALAAM, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
 Monday announced its decision to allow an international cellular

</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Officer of the Zanzibar Telecom Ltd. (Zantel)
Mohamed Ahmed Salim was quoted as saying on Monday that his
company would be allowed to operate on the mainland of Tanzania by
the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
Zantel was previously denied a license to offer services on the

Communication Commission (TCC) Ahmed Hassan Diria, who was on a
familiarization tour of Zantel on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some 18 percent of Zantel is owned by the Zanzibar

and another 24 percent by Kingbury International Investments of
Channel Island.

<P>
Through its state-of-the-art satellite earth station with an 18
meter antennae, Zantel has an advantage of offering cheaper
tariffs than its competitors.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Partly Restore Wage &AMP; CPF Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Singapore will partly
restore wage and Central Provident Fund (CPF) cuts which were
effected at the beginning of this year and contained in last
year's 10.5 billion-Singapore-dollar package to reduce business
costs in dealing with the economic recession.
</P>
<P>
In a statement in the parliament Tuesday afternoon, Deputy
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that the employers' CPF
contribution rate will be increased by 2 percentage points to 12
percent with effect from April 2000 from current 10 percent, the
quantum of year-end bonus for civil servants will be increased
from 3/4 month of annual variable component (AVC) last year to 1
1/4 months of AVC this year, and the 5-1 percentage point wage
cuts imposed on ministers and civil servants of different classes
will be fully restored with effect from January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the government has also decided to keep unchanged the
one-percent rate of the skill development levy (SDL) on employers
for workers below a monthly salary of 1,000 Singapore dollars but
to progressively raise the salary ceiling for SDL contributions
from current 1,000 Singapore dollars to 2,000 Singapore dollars
over the next five years to 2004.
</P>
<P>
While confirming that last year's cost-cutting package will
continue as committed, Lee said that the current industrial rental
rebate, ports and airport fee rebate and foreign worker levy rate
will be unchanged and extended for another year to December 2000.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the government made the decision in the light of
improvement in the economy, citing that "the mood has totally
changed and things have turned out much better than we feared."
</P>
<P>
While assessing the recent developments, Lee said "Our own
economy has picked up sharply, boosted by our cost-cutting
measures and the regional recovery."
</P>
<P>
"We expect about five percent growth this year, and between 4.5
percent to 6.5 percent next year," he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Touching on regional economic scenario, Lee said "Except for
Indonesia's problems with Aceh, the worst of the Asian crisis is
behind us."
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the region exchange rates have firmed, interest
rates have come down, confidence has returned and growth is
resuming," he elaborated.
</P>
<P>
Lee stressed that the challenge facing Singapore is to manage
the recovery and to restore the economy to "full health without
mishap,"
pointing out that the economy still has some weak patches and
continuing restructuring is causing a steady stream of
retrenchments.

<HEADLINE> First Chinese Firm Repurchases State-Owned Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai-based Shenneng Co.
, Ltd. has become the first publicly listed Chinese firm approved
to repurchase its state-owned shares.
</P>
<P>
An announcement by the board of directors in major securities
newspapers today said the green light has been granted by the
Ministry of the Finance for the firm to repurchase and write off
one billion state-owned shares held by the Shenneng (group) Co.,
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The plan also gained the support of the company's shareholders
at a meeting on Monday in Shanghai, when it was decided to
repurchase the state-owned shares at 2.51 yuan per share.
</P>
<P>
After the repurchase, which is expected to be completed within
six months, the total equity of the firm will be reduced from 2.6
billion shares to 1.6 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
State-owned shares will then account for 68 percent of the
total equity, compared with the present 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Non-circulating state-owned shares account for 60 to 80 percent
of the total equity in many publicly listed firms in China, often
resulting in the disregard of the interests of minor investors in
corporate decision-making.
</P>
<P>
This situation is also contrary to the government's ultimate
goal of transforming state-owned enterprises into modern corporate
bodies through diversified ownership.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Zhu Jianfang, an analyst with the China Securities Co., Ltd.
, said the repurchase of the state-owned shares will help publicly
listed firms optimize their equity structure.
</P>
<P>
The government can use repurchases as a major means to withdraw
from certain sectors of the economy and spend the proceeds gained
from repurchases on sectors where the state should play a bigger
role, he added.

<HEADLINE> GDP of Asia's NIEs to Grow by 5.7 Pct in 1999: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said Tuesday in a report that Asia's Newly Industrialized
Economies (NIE) are expected to post a economic growth rate of 5.7
percent in 1999 compared to the negative growth of 1.6 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said the higher GDP (gross domestic product) growth of
the NIEs, which comprises China's Hongkong, Singapore, Korea and
China's Taipei, is likely to be achieved along with a further
moderation in inflation with prices expected to remain unchanged
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Exports, which had declined in 1998 as a result of the crisis,
are likely to pick-up again but only moderately with a growth of
2.1 percent in 1999, said the ADB.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, import demand will recover sharply as growth
returns and the rise in exports increases demand for raw materials
and components.
</P>
<P>
However, the ADB said, it will be some time before the NIEs
regain their export dynamism of the pre-crisis period.
</P>
<P>
The bank also said a large-scale restructuring of capacities
and policy measures to regain competitiveness are required to be
taken to restore the NIE's export dynamism.
</P>
<P>
After a severe recession in 1998, the economy of China's Hong
Kong is expected to record a positive growth of 0.7 percent in
1999 supported by an improvement in private consumption, growth in
government spending and rise of exports.
</P>
<P>
Korea's GDP is expected to grow by 9 percent for 1999. A
built-up of inventory and a rise in private consumption,
investment demand and exports have boosted the country's
production to above pre-crisis levels.
</P>
<P>
According to the ADB, the major source of uncertainty for
future economic expansion in Korea is the sustainability of the
growth in domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The primary concern for Singapore, whose economy grew by 3.7
percent in the first half of 1999, is the potential weakness of
key electronics exports emanating from a contraction in U.S.
demand and lower hardware demand post Y2K, the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB projected the GDP of China's Taipei to grow by 5.2
percent in 1999 due to a surge in exports of electronic,
information, and communication products.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Consumers Still Cautious on Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese consumers are more
optimistic about the future economic situation but remain
uncertain about their incomes in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Consumer indices released today by the National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS) show that last month, 63 percent of consumers
believed the economy will improve over the next 12 months, a
higher percentage than in September.
</P>
<P>
In October, the Index of Consumer Expectations among low-income
consumers rose by two percentage points over September.
</P>
<P>
The NBS pointed out in a news release today that consumers are
cautiously optimistic about the economic situation, but lack
confidence that their incomes will grow in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In October, 66 percent of consumers said their household income
either remained unchanged or decreased over the previous 12 months.
And 51 percent of them see no raises or decreases in their
household income over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The NBS attributes this phenomenon to people's concern about an
increasingly competitive employment environment and their
potential spending for social security, education, and housing in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Some 56 percent of those surveyed said that housing prices are
excessively high. In October, 14 percent of the consumers polled
thought that buying housing was not a good investment, three
percentage points more than in September.

<HEADLINE> World Trade to Show Robust Growth in 2000: WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- World trade volume could show
robust growth in the year 2000, with the growth rated expected to
reach six to seven percent, the World Trade Organization (WTO)
said in its annual report for 1999 released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gains in the 1999 trade volume are expected to be in the order
of four percent, much the same as in 1998, according to WTO. Once
again these gains are in excess of growth of overall output.
</P>
<P>
World output growth is now expected to be in the order of three
percent in 1999, rising to some 3.5 percent in 2000, and trade
volumes have stabilized, after falling sharply in 1998, and are
expected to show robust growth in 2000, with growth expected at
six to seven percent, close to the average rate of the 1900s.
</P>
<P>
The WTO report noted that the economic situation is more
healthy now than it was a year ago. At that time, with the
financial crisis that had started in parts of east-Asia about a
year old, there was still considerable concern about the risk of
contagion and deep recession.
</P>
<P>
"Now recovery is well underway; disciplined macroeconomic
policies and structural reform in the countries most affected by
the crisis and open markets played their full role in making
possible and supporting the ongoing recovery," said the WTO.
</P>
<P>
However, the WTO warned that there is no room for complacency,
particularly as government will continue to face pressure from
special interest groups to take protectionist measures.
</P>
<P>
"Such action would not only be counterproductive, it could also
serve to undermine a promising economic environment for the
conduct of new multilateral negotiations," said the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Spokesman on Bush's Remarks Concerning Sino-U.S. Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua)-- A stable and healthy China-U.S.
relationship serves the fundamental interest of the Chinese and
American peoples as well as peace, stability and development of
the Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole, said Sun Yuxi,
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, here today at the regular
press conference.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in response to a question requesting
comments on the U.S. Republic presidential candidate Governor
George W. Bush's recent words that the U.S. should strengthen its
relations with its Asia-Pacific allies to have China checked.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that it is the shared aspiration of the people of all
countries in the Asia-Pacific region to promote peace, cooperation
and development, and that any attempt to have China "checked" does
not conform to the fundamental interest of the people of the Asia-
Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
A statesman with a vision and a sense of responsibility must
see clearly the overall interest of China-U.S. relations and the
inevitable trend of historical development, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that an early realization of the complete
reunification of the motherland is the common aspiration of the
entire Chinese people, the people in Taiwan included, adding that
the Government and people of China have the confidence and ability
to fulfill the grand cause of national reunification.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan question is the most sensitive political question at
the very core of China-U.S. relations, Sun said, noting that to
strictly observe the one-China principle, the three China-U.S.
joint communiques and the relevant commitments made by the U.S.
side is the solemn commitment made by successive U.S.
administrations, both Democratic and Republic.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the Chinese people have chosen a road of
development suited to China's national conditions and have scored
impressive achievements that draw world attention and that the
Chinese people will continue to go along this road with full
confidence and firm resolve.
</P>
<P>
We hope that people of vision in the United States will proceed
from the fundamental interest of the people of our two countries
and make efforts to safeguard and promote China-U.S. relations, he
pointed out.

<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Abdelkader Hachani, one of the principal leaders of the
outlawed Islamic Salvation Front party of Algeria, was
assassinated on Monday in a waiting hall of a dentist clinic in
central Algiers by a professional killer. Considered to be the
most capable political figure of the party, Hachani was killed by
two bullets in his head and one in his chest. His death was a
severe blow to the policy of national reconciliation launched by
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The number three of the Islamic Salvation Front party of
Algeria, Abdelkader Hachani, was killed by a single gunman on
Monday. Considered to be the "pragmatic technocrat"' of the
Islamist party, Hachani played an important role in the secret
negotiations between the government and the Islamic Salvation Army,
which resulted in a unilateral cease-fire in October 1997 by the
Islamist armed group. This attack coincided with a recent revival
of violence in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
-- The price of crude oil per barrel attained 25.90 U.S.
dollars on Monday, the highest since the Gulf War, after Iraq
announced that it would suspend "Oil for Food" program. In New
York, the crude oil price once reached 27 dollars per barrel on
Monday.

GAZA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian official on Tuesday
refuted accusations that the Palestinians as well as Arab states
are obstructing Israel's accession to the European Union (EU) and
other international bodies.
</P>
<P>
Tayeb Abdel Rahim, Palestinian Cabinet Secretary, told the
Voice of Palestine radio that such remarks by the Israeli side
were provocative to the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The accusations were made Monday by Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy at a meeting with ambassadors of the EU states in Tel
Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Levy also accused the Palestinian side of unjustified
procrastination of the peace process, adding that Israel was
prepared to implement the second phase of withdrawal from the West
Bank in accordance with the Sharm el-Sheikh memorandum, but the
Palestinian side was delaying the process.
</P>
<P>
But Rabhim said the Israeli side was attempting to violate the
already signed agreements with the Palestinians by claiming that
it had the right to define the areas from which it will withdraw
its troops.
</P>
<P>
Rahim reiterated that Israel's stance on the withdrawal maps
violated the spirit of negotiations and signed accords, saying
that there would be no peace and security under continued Israeli
occupation and settlements.

<P>
PARIS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine condemned on Tuesday the assassination of the number three
of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) of Algeria, Abdelkader
Hachani.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said in a radio interview that the assassination showed
that "different groups (in Algeria) are using all the means to
block the peace process" in the country.
</P>
<P>
Hachani, 40, was assassinated by a professional killer on
Monday in a dentist clinic in central Algiers.
</P>
<P>
The FIS leader had reportedly played a major role in the secret
negotiations between the government and the Islamic Salvation Army,
the military wing of FIS which has laid down its arms.
</P>
<P>
"We see that the policy of national reconciliation initiated by
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika is clashing with the tenacious will
of different groups who don't want this evolution, who don't want
Algeria to go out of the tragedy," said the French foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France believes Bouteflika would not change
his policy because of this new act of violence.
</P>
<P>
"The aspiration of the Algerian people to put an end to all
this (violence) is the strongest," Vedrine said.

symbols. The new discoveries join together with a large collection

</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists believe the cliff paintings were carved

historical records, Baisikou, 45 kilometers from Yinchuan, the
regional capital, was a royal monastery during the Western Xia
Dynasty.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Poor Marketing Hinders Food Security Efforts in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) has said poor marketing of
agricultural products is currently the major stumbling block to
efforts at ensuring food security and good nutrition in
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
"The main obstacle is marketing, because the farmers will only
produce more if they are sure of selling their products," FAO
representative in Mozambique, S. Ring, was quoted as saying by
Tuesday's Noticias newspaper.
</P>
<P>
She explained that marketing implies coordinated planning
involving the authorities responsible for roads and bridges, as
well as the traders and the factories that process agricultural
products.
</P>
<P>
Post-harvest management is also important to guarantee the
conservation of harvested crops, she said.
</P>
<P>
FAO is currently cooperating with the Mozambican Agriculture
Ministry to prepare a plan to ensure food security and good
nutrition in the country.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, we are working on a food security special
program covering Maputo, Sofala and Manica provinces, aimed at
introducing new production technologies at the level of the
peasant farming sector," Ring said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the objective of this program is to analyze the
obstacles in the application of new technologies, in access to
credit and in marketing.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government believes that the country has
attained food self-sufficiency, particularly concerning maize, but
FAO, for its part, argues that this is a relative concept, because
"there are always products that must be bought abroad."
</P>
<P>
Ring notes that "no doubt that Mozambique has made huge
progress in the agricultural sector," but she stressed that people
should diversify their diet, if they are to have food nutrition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mozambique's National Director of Agriculture,
Sergio Gouveia, has admitted that, despite the fact that food is
now available because farmers are producing it, "there is still
the question of the utilization of that food in order to eliminate
malnutrition."
</P>
<P>
There is work still to be done, even after the food has been
harvested, he said, adding that "it is necessary to explain to the
farmers how that food should be prepared and consumed, in order to
attain good nutrition."
</P>
<P>
Mozambique produced in the last agricultural campaign a record
1.8 million tons of grain (mostly maize), compared with about
300,000 tons harvested each year during the civil war period
ending in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Gouveia noted that there are still serious signs of
malnutrition in the country, particularly in areas affected by
cyclical drought and, consequently, with lower production, and
also in areas that are a long way from the major markets.
</P>
<P>
He said that the action plan for food security, budgeted at 1.7
million U.S. dollars, will try and concentrate all efforts in the
priority areas, particularly where there are most difficulties in
production and marketing.
</P>
<P>
The program is focused on the production of maize and butter
beans, the raising of livestock, especially the breeding of
chickens and improved strains of goat and the distribution of
irrigation components, he said.

After this election, the theme will focus on the Legislative
Council election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an opening ceremony, Chief Electoral Officer Li
Wing said a special feature of the center was a touch-screen
computer system through which visitors could easily search
information about 390 District Council constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The system links up the databank of 2.83 million electors with
the maps of 390 District Council constituencies.
</P>
<P>
"Visitors may try for themselves how to mark a ballot paper
with a chop at two real-sized polling booths," said Li. A chop
bearing a "tick" is introduced for the first time this year to
replace a pen for marking ballot papers.

CANBERRA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Predatory native fish are

About 6,500 fingerling fish were released between February and

"Being part of the wet tropics and being made up mostly of

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) has increased more than three percent in
the third quarter of this year, South African Reserve Bank (SARB)
said in Pretoria on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Head of SARB economic reviews and statistics Bernie de Jager
said South Africa's economy is in a recovery mode and SARB will
have to carefully assess the implications for interest rates,
local newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is very possible that the economy could have passed the
lower turning point in the business cycle in the first half of the
year, de Jager said.
</P>
<P>
The implications for interest rates would be discussed on
Tuesday at an SARB monetary policy meeting aimed to evaluate the
entire economic situation, he said, adding it is more than likely
that a decision would be taken whether the bank should continue
with the current rate of change in repo rate, or whether the rate
should go up or decline at a faster pace.

<P>
The suspect then took the investigators to his home, where more
rifles and parts were found.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israel Finds Migratory Route of Prehistoric Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli archeologists have
excavated artifacts along the banks of the upper reaches of the
Jordan River, which indicate that there was one of the migratory
routes of prehistoric man out of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Professor Na'ama Goren-Inbar of the Hebrew University's
Department of Prehistoric Archeology said that flint and stone
tools uncovered in the region of the B'not Ya'akov bridge showed
many similarities to those used by African hominid and could date
back 700,000 to 800,000 years, The Jerusalem Post newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Most archeologists believe that the origin of human beings is
in Africa, and then the hominid left Africa through what is known
as the Levantine Corridor.
</P>
<P>
The B'not Ya'akov discovery, as another one made southwest of
Lake Kinneret in Israel, shows that the Jordan River Valley is a
part of the migratory corridor.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Reliance on Gulf Fuel to Fall Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf states, along with
Iraq and Iran, will continue to show major surplus of kerosene/jet
fuel production, as Asia's imports of this product are reducing
due to large-scale expansion in its refining capacities.
</P>
<P>
Asian states, particularly those on the Pacific Ocean coast,
have for the past two decades been major buyers of Middle East
crude, jet fuel, kerosene, fuel oil and downstream hydrocarbon
products.
</P>
<P>
However, with the development of grassroot oil refineries in
several of the Eastern Asian states in the past few years, the
scenario is likely to change, reported the Gulf News daily on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Net imports of kerosene/jet fuel by the Asia Pacific region
have reduced from 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 1993, to
30,000 bpd in 1998.
</P>
<P>
And this is projected to dip further to 26,000 bpd next year,
Khalid Al Alawi, senior coordinator of aviation sales of the
Bahrain National Oil Co., was quoted by the paper as saying at an
industrial conference which started in Dubai on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Al Alawi added that for the past five years, Asia-Pacific had
pulled in essentially all the Gulf's kerosene/jet fuel exports
availibility.
</P>
<P>
This, however, does not seem likely to continue in the short
and medium terms, as Asia will become self-sufficient. A surplus
is seen in Asia-Pacific that is projected to continue till 2000.
</P>
<P>
The global demand for kerosene/jet fuel which was 6.4 million
bpd in 1998, will increase to 6.6 million bpd next year,
increasing to 7.4 million bpd in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Of this, demand in Asia-Pacific will increase from 2.41
million bpd, to 2.56 million bpd and 2.93 million bpd during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
The total kerosene/jet fuel to be produced in the Gulf states
will be 753,000 bpd next year, increasing to 868,000 bpd in 2005.
</P>
<P>
On the consumption side, the projected Gulf demand will be
288,800 bpd next year and 353,200 bpd in 2005 - representing a 3.7
percent growth in annual demand for the product.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Aceh Separatist Movement Escalates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The separatist movement in the
predominantly Muslim province of Aceh has killed at least 259
people and injured 298 others in a period of about one year,
Commander of the Indonesian Armed Forces Admiral Widodo said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the killings, whose victims included 171
civilians, took place from late 1998 to November 19, 1999 after
the Military Operation Zone (DOM) in the troubled province was
dropped by former president B.J. Habibie's administration.
</P>
<P>
"Among the deaths, eight were military officials. Separatist
movement now have been escalating and even worsened by third
parties both internal and external for their own interest," the
military chief said in a hearing with House of Representatives
(DPR) Commission I on national security and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to soon settle the problem in the
province as well in other parts of the country such as Irian Jaya
and Maluku.
</P>
<P>
Widodo, however, reiterated it was impossible for the
government to let its western-most province become independent and
separate from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make a sense letting Aceh become an independent
state," he insisted, referring Acehnese demands on independence.
</P>
<P>
Aceh, with a population of only about 4.3 million people, has
a history of rebellion against foreign rule. The Dutch only
managed to wholly occupy the territory in the 1930s, long after
they had firmly established themselves in the rest of the
Indonesian archipelago.
</P>
<P>
When the Indonesian Republic proclaimed its independence from
the Dutch in 1945, Aceh emerged as a strong backer of the
Indonesian nationalist cause, supporting the new republic with
donations of money and materials. However, in the 1950s, a popular
insurgency movement against the Jakarta administration arose,
bringing new unrest to the territory for many years. Since then,
trouble has continued to brew, on and off.
</P>
<P>
On November 8 this year, more than one million Acehnese
attended a meeting in Banda Aceh, capital of Aceh province,
demanding a referendum on the right of the people of that province
to self determination. This was an impressive display of
solidarity since the independence group Free Aceh Movement
unilaterally declared independence on December 4, 1976.
</P>
<P>
But, President Abdurrahman Wahid pointed out earlier that there
is no way that Aceh could break away from Indonesia, although a
referendum was a reasonable proposition.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investors Preparing to Surf New Business Wave in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Encouraged by the Sino-U.S.
agreement on China's accession to the World Trade Organization (
WTO), Germany's chemicals and pharmaceuticals giant Bayer is
considering moving its China headquarters from Hong Kong to
Shanghai while establishing a 10-million-U.S.-dollar technical
service center here.
</P>
<P>
M.W. Cheung, Bayer's chief representative in Shanghai, said "
after entering the WTO, China will open wider and adopt
international practices even further in areas like foreign
exchange administration, foreign trade and tariff levels," Cheung
said, adding this has enhanced Bayer's determination to promote
long-term development in China.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States signed an agreement on market
access related to China's entry into the WTO on November 15, thus
removing what was believed to be the biggest obstacle to China's
WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
Bayer, which has already established 13 subsidiaries in China,
is not the only overseas investor busily preparing to surf an
anticipated new trade and investment wave.
</P>
<P>
Sources from many of the 3,650 overseas-funded representative
offices in Shanghai said they all have plans to expand business in
China.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account both the Sino-U.S. agreement and Japan's
economic recovery, Issei Nakamura, director general of the
Shanghai representative office of the Tokyo-based Japan-China
Association on Economy and Trade, predicted that large numbers of
Japanese investors will come to seek business opportunities in
China during the second half of next year.
</P>
<P>
Japanese investment in China witnessed a high tide during the
past two decades, Issei Nakamura said, but it was checked by the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We're preparing for another high tide," said Issei Nakamura,
whose association handles inquiries from more than 1,800 Japanese
enterprises annually about doing business with China.

<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Sheppard, chief representative of the Queensland Trade
and Investment Office, said that one of the major characteristics
of the upcoming wave of overseas trade and investment in China
will probably be the rushing in of small and medium-sized firms,
which are usually more particular about the business environment.
</P>
<P>
China has significantly improved its business environment over
the past years, Sheppard said, and its entry into the WTO will
systematically guarantee a continuing improvement.
</P>
<P>
A booming state in Australia, Queensland has increased its
presence in China over the past years, with its exports to this
country rising 25 percent last year on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
Philip Murtaugh, General Motors chief representative in
Shanghai, said that China's accession to the WTO will not only
bring about exciting market opportunities but will also help raise
GM's China operations closer to international standards.
</P>
<P>
GM has opened some 10 subsidiaries in China, including the
Shanghai General Motors Corp. set up in 1997 by the Shanghai
Automobile Industry Corporation and GM at a cost of 1.52 billion U.
S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Murtaugh said that GM took into account the possibility of
China's entry into the WTO when it initiated its China operations
years ago, and has therefore set the goal of maintaining its
production and services in this country at international standards
to brace for possible competition from other automakers.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Murtaugh said, GM has been improving its Buick car
service centers in major Chinese cities while stepping up
development of new models.
</P>
<P>
"China is our most important market and we have full confidence
of maintaining our competitiveness here," Murtaugh added.

York proximity talks between Turkish and Greek Cypriot leaders to
be held December 3, but Ankara responded by insisting on
confederation on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials reiterated on Monday that Turkey would not
agree to any settlement that would alter the 1960 guarantee
scheme that provides unilateral intervention to both Greece and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Annan, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
stressed that Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots would not agree to
an international security scheme.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said that Turkey would not
hurry for imprisoned outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) leader
Abdullah Ocalan's death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit made the remarks by answering U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's question about Ocalan's death penalty.
</P>
<P>
He stated that "we will wait for the decision of the European
Court of Human Rights. Then the issue will be brought to the
parliament. But we are not in a hurry to discuss the issue."
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- As the Helsinki summit approaches, pressures of human
rights' conditions upon Turkey began to increase.
</P>
<P>
A sign of these pressures is the letter brought to Turkey by
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari. Europeans obviously say to
Turkey, which already declared its acceptance of Copenhagen
Criteria, "there are more conditions other than them."
</P>
<P>
If those conditions are intended to hurt the honor of Turkey as
it was in the Luxembourg summit of 1997 December, Europeans must
know that they are going to be refused.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, China Have Common Views on Major Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and China
Tuesday reached a great consensus on deepening bilateral
cooperation and on international and regional issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
This was the outcome of the talks between Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad and visiting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
who had a sincere, friendly and in-depth exchange of views on
bilateral, international and regional issues, a Chinese delegation
official told Chinese reporters after the talks.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral cooperation, Mahathir said Zhu's ongoing visit to
Malaysia is part of the frequent exchange of visits between
leaders of the two countries which promoted the bilateral
relations to further strength.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past 25 years, the relations between
Malaysia and China strengthened and, particularly, the joint
statement signed last May between the two countries for the future
bilateral cooperation was a big step forward in the development of
the bilateral ties and laid the foundation for better development
of the relations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Rongji described the present Sino-Malaysian relations as at
the best stage, saying Malaysia has become China's very close
friend in its Southeast Asia relations. He spoke highly of
Mahathir's contribution to the development.
</P>
<P>
On how to further strengthen the bilateral relations between
China and Malaysia in the near future, Zhu pointed out that the
momentum of frequent exchange of visits between leaders of the
two countries in the recent years, which helped to deepen mutual
understanding and beneficial cooperation, should be maintained.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges and cooperation at all levels involving
parliaments, academia and press should be further expanded for
the all-round development of the bilateral relations, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said the mutual beneficial economic and
trade cooperation, which constitutes a significant part of the
bilateral ties, should be further promoted.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should also strengthen scientific and
technological cooperation through cooperative researches,
development and technical transfer to share the benefits, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the two sides have set up basis for the exchanges and
cooperation in the fields of culture and education and the Culture
Agreement signed this time is conducive to promoting cooperation
in the relative field, adding that China holds active attitude in
expanding cooperation in the fields of culture, education and
tourism.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with Zhu's views, Mahathir hoped the exchange of
visits at the top levels of the two countries would be continued,
and exchanges and cooperation in the economic, trade, scientific
and technological and cultural fields would be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
On international and regional issues of common interest, the
two leaders were of the view that the major issue facing the East
Asian region is to strengthen economic, financial and scientific
and technological cooperation and that the forthcoming informal
meeting in Manila between leaders of ASEAN and China, Japan and
South Korea should reflect the common aspiration of the East Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that the countries in the region should
resort to proper ways through friendly bilateral consultations to
resolve the differences among them and expressed the confidence
that the friendship and mutual trust existing among them would
solve problems that may arise.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said both Malaysia and China have common stands on
many issues which enable the two sides to cooperate properly in
the international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir reiterated that Malaysia will continue to pursue and
give full support to the "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
He lauded China's commitment not to devalue its Renminbi during
the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Rongji suggested that the two countries strengthen
cooperation in international and regional affairs and said that
under the new circumstances, both sides should further strengthen
consultations on how to resist hegemonism and power politics, to
promote East Asian economic cooperation and to maintain regional
peace and stability in order to safeguard the common interests and
peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Mahathir and Zhu witnessed the signing of
three documents between the two countries including the Culture
Agreement.

economies appears to be a beginning of a cyclical upswing as the
region is expected to maintain the same rate of growth in the year
2000 supported by a higher rate of growth of world GDP and trade.
</P>
<P>
Since the first quarter of 1999, the Asian economies have
experienced a faster-than-expected recovery fueled by expansionary
monetary and fiscal policies, a pickup in external trade, and
strengthening of foreign capital inflows, said the report.
</P>
<P>
According to the ADB, Korea leads the recovery among the
crisis-affected economies, with a 1999 economic growth forecast of
9 percent.
</P>
<P>
China's Taipei, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and
Malaysia follow Korea with growth in the range of 3 to 5 percent
as they also experience a stronger than expected recovery from the
crisis, said the ADB.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said the growth in China is expected to slow down from
7.8 percent in 1998 to 7.2 percent in 1999 and its export growth
will remain modest.
</P>
<P>
According to the ADB, South Asia continues to be a strong
performer in the region with a forecast aggregate growth rate of
5.5 percent for 1999 due largely to pick-up in agriculture and
industry, expansion in manufacture and software exports.
</P>
<P>
However, the ADB stressed, continued commitment to and speedy
implementation of structural reforms is necessary if growth
momentum is to be maintained and social costs of any future
downturns are to be minimized.

BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
met with members of the international advisory committee of the
China Development Bank (CDB) led by former French prime minister
Raymond Barre here this morning at Zhongnanhai, the seat of the
central government.

advisors in supporting China's economic construction and reform

whom are renowned political and financial figures. The China
Development Bank, as the country's first policy bank, is playing
an important role in promoting economic growth in China, Jiang
said. Moreover, the establishment of the advisory committee
enables the CDB to learn from the advanced experience of foreign
countries and listen to the opinions and suggestions of the
advisors, he said, describing this matter as "meaningful" for all
involved.

Jiang also briefed the guests on China's economic development

<HEADLINE> Pacers Lose Winning Streak to Celtics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in more
than two years, the Boston Celtics eventually beat Larry Bird and
his Indiana Pacers with a 95-85 victory on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Since taking over as head coach of the Pacers in 1997, Bird,
the former Celtics legend, won all eight previous encounters
against the club he led to three NBA titles.
</P>
<P>
Dana Barros scored 11 of his 15 points, including three 3-
pointers, in a crucial 19-4 fourth-quarter run that put the
Celtics in control down the stretch as the Celtics outscored
Indiana 34-20 in the fourth quarter, with their bench accounting
for 27 of those points.
</P>
<P>
Bird spent all 13 seasons of his Hall of Fame career with the
Celtics before taking over the helm of the NBA team from his home
state of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
Paul Pierce added 17 points and 12 rebounds and Kenny Anderson
chipped in 13 points to Boston's balanced attack.
</P>
<P>
Dale Davis had 19 points and 12 rebounds, Reggie Miller scored
18 and Jalen Rose contributed 17 for Indiana.
</P>
<P>
At Utah, Karl Malone poured in 34 points and grabbed 11
rebounds to lead the Utah Jazz to a 108-93 trouncing of the
Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
Malone, who scored 40 points on Saturday at Milwaukee, was hot
from the start as he scored 23 first-half points to help the Jazz
build a commanding 69-54 lead at the intermission.
</P>
<P>
The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player also scored eight points
in a game-ending 14-3 run after the T-wolves threatened to make it
close.
</P>
<P>
John Stockton added 12 points and handed out a season-high 15
assists for Utah, which improved to 5-1 at home.
</P>
<P>
Terrell Brandon paced the Minnesota attack with 21 points,
while Minnesota sensation Kevin Garnett had 20 and seven rebounds,
failing to record a double-double for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
In Philadelphia, Tim Duncan and David Robinson proved too much
for Allen Iverson as San Antonio's "Twin Towers" led the Spurs to
a 94-91 victory over the 76ers.
</P>
<P>
Duncan finished with 26 points, 17 rebounds and 5 blocked shots,
while Robinson had 19 points, 11 boards and seven blocks for the
defending NBA champions.
</P>
<P>
Iverson kept Philadelphia in the game with 35 points, but he
made just 13-of-34 shots and missed a potential tying layup with
three seconds remaining.

<HEADLINE> Improper State Intervention Leads to Romania's Sluggish Economy: Senator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Romania's economic downslide
is mainly caused by improper government intervention, Petre Roman,
president of the Senate, said at a parliament meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past decade, people have been
increasingly disappointed with the various political promises that
did nothing to improve their lives while the gap between the poor
and rich has widened to an astonishing degree.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that such a situation was caused neither by under-
intervention nor over-intervention but by inappropriate government
intervention in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Roman charged that the government has offered too much subsidy
to poorly-run businesses, with no proper intervention in
legislation, public order, education and health, while often using
obsolete methods to intervene in the market.
</P>
<P>
He noted that joining the European Union is one of the major
strategies of the country, which has the support from the people
and all political forces in the country, but Romania's membership

<HEADLINE> Thailand Reaffirms AFTA Tariff Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand said it will not
delay the implementation of scheduled import tariff cuts on all
its product categories under the framework of the ASEAN Free Trade
Area (AFTA), The Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The firm stand was taken by the Council of Economic Ministers
at its meeting Monday to demonstrate to other ASEAN members that
Thailand is serious in following the AFTA spirit of liberalizing
international trade, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers maintained that all existing product items on the
"Inclusion List" will remain intact, while those on the "Temporary
Exclusion List" would be moved to the inclusion list.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion list is a list of products whose tax cuts would
come under tariff reduction according to the original schedule
laid down by ASEAN while the temporary exclusion list is a list of
product items whose tax cuts would be postponed at the request of
member countries.
</P>
<P>
Products on the temporarily exclusion list will be gradually
subject to tax cuts until the rates are brought down to zero to
five percent by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The council said that Thailand will go ahead with the planned
tax cuts for products on the inclusion list whose tax cuts will
start being brought down to zero to five percent early next year.
</P>
<P>
The council, however, provided Thailand's team of negotiators
with the flexibility to make some optional demands when it attends
the ASEAN Summit Meeting Wednesday in Manila.
</P>
<P>
One of the demands is about that member countries wanting to
extend the timeframe for tax cuts for items on the inclusion list
can make an extension for only three categories -- automobiles,
petrochemical and palm oil, and the extension must be based on the
same standard.
</P>
<P>
The other demand will be that the period of tax cut extension
applied for temporarily excluded products must be extended no
longer than three years from the previous deadline of 2003. In
other words, all temporarily exclusion list product items must
have their tariff rates brought down to zero to five percent by
the year 2006.

BANGKOK, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government agreed to
raise the country's export growth target for this year to six
percent, eyeing export to be the main engine of growth for the
economy, The Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Based on confirmation from the Commerce and Finance ministries,
the Council of Economic Ministers approved Monday the revision of
Thailand's export growth forecast for 1999 to 6.08 percent, up
from the earlier official figure of four percent.
</P>
<P>
Only a few weeks ago, the Commerce Ministry came up with a 5.5
percent export growth forecast.
</P>
<P>
Thai government spokesman Akapol Surasuchart was quoted as
saying that the economic council expected Thailand to export goods
worth at least 5 billion U.S. dollars each for November and
December, enabling an annual export growth of 6.08 percent to be
achieved this year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports totaled 53 billion dollars last year.
Exports in the first nine months of this year reached 42.3 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of several Asian economies, including South Korea
and Japan, assisted the export growth prospects of Thailand,
though a potential downturn of the U.S. economy remains a worry,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Commerce Ministry, Thailand's
exports have risen at a higher rate than other crisis-hit
countries, including South Korea and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the ministry was quoted as saying that
export will be the engine of growth for the Thai economy this year
and next year and growing exports will also assist private
consumption.

<HEADLINE> Thai Foreign Minister Visits Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan arrived here Tuesday on his first friendly visit to
Myanmar since the siege of the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok on
October 1 by five Myanmar gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Surin's visit is aimed at seeking ways of improving the
strained Thai-Myanmar relations following the incident.
</P>
<P>
His trip also came more than a month after Myanmar closed its
border with Thailand and temporarily suspended fishing concession
in Myanmar waters by Thai fishing vessels as a response to the
Thai handling of the embassy siege incident.
</P>
<P>
Surin's meeting with his Myanmar counterpart U Win Aung during
the one-day visit is expected to discuss issues of the handling of
the embassy siege, lifting of fishing concession suspension,
reopening of border and resettlement of anti-government Myanmar
students in exile in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Five Myanmar gunmen, who are all students, stormed their
country's embassy in Bangkok and held embassy staff, their
families and some foreigners as hostages on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The siege ended peacefully on the next day with all the 89
hostages freed before the gunmen were flown by the Thai side to
the Thai-Myanmar border and allowed to go free after negotiations
in exchange for the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government has been unhappy about the way the
gunmen were treated and was annoyed by Thai official description
of the gunmen as fighters for democracy rather than terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has warned that the October 1 incident could bring
about some adverse effect on the bilateral relations between
Myanmar and Thailand and expressed concern over the future safety
of Myanmar diplomats in Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Possibility of Y2K's Disastrous Effect in Bangladesh Ruled out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The much-feared Y2K problem or
the millennium bug would not cause any disastrous effect in
Bangladesh as most of the sectors in the country are manually
operated instead of computerized systems.
</P>
<P>
Rather, the Y2K preparedness in the country is "satisfactory"
as the majority of the sectors are prepared to cope with the
change of the century, newspapers here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Information Technology professionals of the
country who are dealing with the matter at the national level,
different sectors in Bangladesh are not computerized like the
developed countries. That is why the Y2K would not create any
major problem in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Officials who are coordinating the matters relating to
identification of the Y2K problem, said that utility services like
power, gas, water supply, telecommunications and financial sectors
such as bank and insurance are major areas of concern for the Y2K
problem in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, disruption of supply lines for
energy, oil and gas etc. may disrupt communications and
distribution networks for foodgrains.
</P>
<P>
They observed that since Bangladesh was dependent on imports of
foodgrains, petroleum products and agricultural inputs, any
disturbance in the international economies and supply lines would
affect Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Vows to Push Germany into Information Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder called here Monday on the government, businesses and
society to work concertedly to push the country into the
information era.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to about 100 leading industrialists at the "Germany
21" congress, Schroeder said, "we must know that in terms of the
application of new technologies, we rank among the late-comers
internationally."
</P>
<P>
He said that in the United States, the information industry
accounted for 7.6 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in
1998, while the figure in Germany was only 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
And the overall connections to the Internet in the U.S. are
three times that in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Germany is even behind the Scandinavian countries and the
Netherlands, he added, noting that in those countries 9 percent of
the labor force work in the information technology (IT) field,
while in Germany it is merely 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The common goal of everyone responsible must be reducing the
distance to other countries as quickly as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder described computer and IT, which is among the five
leading sectors in the German economy, as more and more
significant to the German economy.
</P>
<P>
The turnover of the IT branch will overtake that of automotive
industry this year, said Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder projected that the IT branch will develop even faster
in the years to come and bring Germany 250,000 more jobs by the
year 2005.
</P>
<P>
"One important duty for us is to qualify the people for what
the information society has offered," said Schroeder, referring to
the shortage of professional resources in IT companies.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, there are some 75,000 jobs waiting for qualified
workers in the IT sector. The old-styled educational program in
schools is short of content on information knowledge.
</P>
<P>
"To today's youngsters, knowledge on information technology is
as important for a job as a driving license on the road," said the
chancellor. "Our goal is to provide every school with at least one
Internet connection before year 2001, thus let every student learn
how to deal with the new technology."
</P>
<P>
By now about one-third German schools are equipped with
computers with access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
He called on the government to reform the education program
with more courses on computer science and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"Germany 21," an initiative raised by some 70 German IT
companies, aims to strengthen the teaching of modern information
knowledge in schools and further education in work.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, the companies will provide 20,000 German
schools with computers and help build a "virtual classroom" in
every school.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton on Monday pledged to help Bulgaria in its bid to join the
European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
Western countries must make more investment in Bulgaria and
help the beautiful country build its future, Clinton said in a
speech delivered to an open-air concert and rally at the St.
Alexander Nevsky Square.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived here Sunday evening on a three-day visit to
Bulgaria at the invitation of his Bulgarian counterpart Peter
Stoyanov. This is the first ever visit by a U.S. president to
Sofia since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the
two countries in 1901.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Stoyanov said "the process of the integration in
Europe is more difficult and slower than we expected."
</P>
<P>
"The Western countries cannot remain indifferent to such a
situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Clinton and his delegation held talks with Stoyanov,
Prime Minister Ivan Kostov and National Assembly Speaker Jordan
Sokolov.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also discussed the blocked traffic along the
Danube, which Stoyanov described as a major cause for Bulgaria's
trade losses.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the Kosovo issue, Stoyanov said that the
positive developments there should not be reversed.
</P>
<P>
"Ethnic violence against the Serbs ... should be avoided by
all means," he said.

<TEXT>

<P>
TIRANA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian Socialist Party (
SP) on Monday informed its coalition-government parties of the so-
called "Alliance for state" draft-plan on cooperation between them
at a meeting held at its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
 Premier Ilir Meta, who is also the SP leader, said that the
round-table meeting is aimed at further promoting his country's
preparations for the implementation of the Stability Pact so that
Albania and Albanians won't miss the valuable chance offered to
them.
</P>
<P>
 The Socialist Party has set some fundamental objectives for
drafting a national strategy for Euro-Atlantic integration.
</P>
<P>
 Within the framework Meta said the government is prepared to
create a ministerial council which will not only include ministers
directly engaged in the work for Albania's integration into the
Euro-Atlantic structures, but also representatives from some
Western countries.
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the "Alliance for State" also agreed in
principle to develop all political initiatives and support all
institutional reforms so that Albania can take on all the
obligations demanded by the Council of Europe and the
International Community for the abolition of death penalty by the
end of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen more members of the
Kayinni National Progressive Party (KNPP), an anti-government
ethnic armed group operating in Myanmar's southeastern Kayah
state, surrendered to the government forces last weekend,
official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 16 KNPP members, who "exchanged arms for peace," were led
by the party's township secretary U Saw Bae Bay in the Gekaw area
along with 10 assorted guns and 115 rounds of ammunitions.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony marking the move took place in Loikaw, capital of
the Kayah state, on last Sunday, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In March 1995, the KNPP, with 7,790 members led by its
vice-chairman U Khudhe Buphe, returned to the legal fold after
negotiations in response to the government's peace offer in
November 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, a total of 525 members from
various anti-government armed groups "exchanged arms for peace"
with the government last year.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 17 anti-government ethnic armed groups as well as
the Mong Tai Army, led by former drug warlord Khun Sa, have made
peace with the government since late 1988.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Disagrees with Tariff, Trade Wars: Vice FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Tariff and trade wars should not
be allowed to take the place of the former cold war or shooting
war in the course of the economic globalization, Ukrainian first
deputy foreign minister Yevgeny Bersheda said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting of Ukraine-NATO Economic Security
Working Group that opened Monday, Bersheda said that it is
prevailing that economic influence and pressure are used to solve
political issues in the world community.
</P>
<P>
Some NATO member states that carried out economic reform before
Ukraine have adopted the above-mentioned measures against Ukraine,
said the deputy minister.
</P>
<P>
Bersheda said that economic reform might in the end adversely
affect the sovereignty of the country in question while benefiting
these countries.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he noted, Ukraine will continue its dialogue with
NATO and work out detailed cooperative plans with the organization,
so that Ukraine will be able to enter the security system of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Ukraine's strategy of guaranteeing its economic security" has
been hammered out and awaits to be considered and approved by the
government, said the deputy minister, adding that the core of the
strategy is to provide social security to state-owned and private
operations as well as those of mixed ownership.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing meeting of the working group is scheduled to end
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Urges Early Dredging of Danube River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Foreign Minister
Martonyi Janos on Monday called for international efforts to
dredge the Danube river as soon as possible to prevent flooding in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The debris of Danube bridges damaged by NATO air strikes on
Yugoslavia could block the downflow of ices and lead to serious
floods, he told the Hungarian news agency.
</P>
<P>
With winter coming and temperature going down, measures should
be taken quickly to clear away the debris and restore the Danube
waterway to normal to avert the flooding threats, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
A total of eight bridges across the Danube in the Yugoslav
section were destroyed during the NATO air strikes earlier this
year, severely affecting navigation along the river.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia, Croatia and Hungary, situated in the middle reaches
of the river, are facing flood threats posed by a possible block
of the ice flow.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian foreign minister said he discussed the matter
with the coordinating officials of the Stability Pact for
Southeastern Europe and U.S officials last week on sidelines of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
summit held in the Turkish capital Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Hungary, Croatia and Yugoslavia are scheduled to
meet in Hungary in mid-December to discuss a plan of breaking the
ice on the Danube.
</P>
<P>
The Danube is Europe's second largest river. It passes Germany,
Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia,
Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan left here Tuesday to the Myanmar capital of Rangoon for a
fence-mending visit.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day visit, Surin is expected to meet his Myanmar
counterpart Win Aung and Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the ruling
State Peace and Development council.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to raise various issues including bilateral
problems, an official from the Foreign Ministry's Information
Department said.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations between the two neighbors have turned sour
after the October 1-2 Myanmar embassy siege.
</P>
<P>
In the incident, five Myanmar gunmen raided the embassy and
took 83 hostages within the embassy compound for 25 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government gave safe passage to the gunmen to the
Thai-Myanmar border in exchange for the freedom of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Upset by Thailand's handling of the matter, Myanmar closed its
border with Thailand and temporarily banned Thai fishing in the
Myanmar waters.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties worsened when Thailand began to crack down on
illegal Myanmar workers and repatriate them back to Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Surin is also expected to raise the repatriation issue to his
Myanmar counterpart and asked for the cooperation from the Myanmar
government in the safe return of the illegal workers.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Minister: Govt Aims to Focus on Food Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Minister of
Agriculture Muhammad Prakosa has said his programs for the year
2000 would concentrate on food security and agribusiness
development.
</P>
<P>
"We will further encourage rice cultivation to regain food
self-sufficiency," Prakosa was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's per capita rice consumption averaged 135 kilograms
per year. With a population of 207 million, Indonesia achieved
food self-sufficiency in 1985, but became dependent on imports
from the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Logistics Agency, Indonesia imported
5.7 million tons of rice last year and 1.7 million tons in the
first nine months of this year.
</P>
<P>
"The food security program will also include diversification of
staple foods into such crops as corn and various tuber plants to
prevent too heavy a dependency on rice," said Prakosa.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that domestic production combined with imported
stocks would be sufficient to meet consumption needs until the end
of the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
Prakosa said unhusked rice production next year was expected to
reach 51 million tons, a 2.26 percent increase from this year's
output.
</P>
<P>
He set a corn production target for next year at 10.5 million
tons and soybean at 1.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The minister said 22 million families, or 58 percent of the
total population, depended on the agricultural sector for their
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
The agribusiness program would focus on small holders through
an integrated approach encompassing production and marketing.
</P>
<P>
"We will still provide subsidies for seeds for rice and
secondary food crops, fertilizer and farm credit," he added.

<HEADLINE> Canada Introduces Amendments to Ban Water Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Canada introduced amendments to
the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act on Monday in a bid to
formally ban water exports to other countries.
</P>
<P>
"These amendments represent an important step towards the
protection of Canada's freshwater resources," said Canadian
Environment Minister David Anderson in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to seek agreement on a Canada-wide accord "for the
prohibition of bulk water removal from all of Canada's major
watersheds."
</P>
<P>
Government sources say that the water ban will apply
principally to the Great Lakes and other boundary waters,
including the St. Lawrence River, the St. Croix and Upper St. John
rivers, as well as Lake of the Woods.
</P>
<P>
Four of the five Great Lakes straddle the Canada-U.S. boundary.
In August, the International Joint Commission between the two
countries recommended a six-month moratorium on water exports from
the lakes, which hold an estimated 20 percent of the world's fresh
water.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Farmers Told It Takes Time to Export Genetic Engineered Foods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Some U.S. farmers believe
that the coming WTO meeting in Seattle would rectify the
controversy over genetic engineered foods, but the American Corn
Growers Association (ACGA) said Monday that won't happen.
</P>
<P>
By all indications, the ACGA said, consumer resistance to
genetic engineered foods, also referred to as genetically modified
organisms (GMOs) continues to grow in Europe, Asia, Australia, New
Zealand and Mexico. Even Canada has begun expressing apprehension
over the planting of the GMO, calling for the labeling of genetic
engineered foods.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that four days in Seattle will not bring an end to
this contentious debate," the ACGA said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ACGA, the U.S. government is pushing some sort
of a solution to the issue at the WTO meeting, claiming there is
no scientific justification for European and Asian restrictions on
GMO foods. However, many countries have stated that the Seattle
meeting is neither the time nor the place to address this issue.
</P>
<P>
The organization quoted deputy head of the European delegation
in Washington D.C., John Richardson, as saying that it may take
some time, even a generation for biotech to be accepted in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The American farmers have been placed in the middle of this
dispute between seed dealers, chemical companies, grain exporters,
foreign consumers and the U.S. government, the ACGA said. In
addition, they have seen the uncertainty over export markets lower
the prices they receive for their grain, opening those markets to
their trading competitors.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that if farmers have any uncertainty over the
availability of a market for GMO crops next year or questions over
certification, segregation, cross-pollination or liability, the
ACGA said, they should consider planting alternatives.
</P>
<P>
"With the consumers in many countries expressing reservations
over the importation of genetically modified foods," the ACGA
added, "U.S. farmers cannot count on these export markets for our
gain sales."

<P>
TOKYO, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices soared in Tokyo
Monday,led mainly by high-tech, and information and telecom-
related issues,with the key Nikkei index closing at a 27-month
high.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 251.28 points, or 1.35
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 18,822.12.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark index closed above 18,800 for the first time
since August 26, 1997, when it finished at 18,814.98.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, advanced 19.30 points or 1.17 percent to 1,
661.97, renewing this year's closing high for the third straight
trading day.
</P>
<P>

shares from 648.65 million shares last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Niigata Engineering was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Active purchases of technology issues were stirred by the good
performance of the Nasdaq composite index in New York and a report
on a business tie-up between Hitachi and NEC, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar's rise to the 106 yen level was another factor
leading investors to buy export-oriented high-tech issues in Japan,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers narrowly
outnumbered gainers 632 to 599 despite the rises in the Nikkei and
the TOPIX, with 115 issues closing unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Senna Trail: Italian Court Upholds Acquittals For Williams Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 22 (Xinhua) -- An appeals court in Italy's
central city of Bologna Monday upheld acquittals for the technical
director and designer of Williams racing team after re-examined
the fatal crash of Brazilian Formula One ace Ayrton Senna in 1994.
</P>
<P>
But while the judge confirmed the earlier court ruling, he
altered the original verdict to remove any shadow of blame from
Senna's team and attribute the driver's death to chance
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The appeals trial focused on the Williams team's technical
director, Patrick Head, and the designer, Adrian Newey, whom
prosecutors insisted were responsible for the fatal fault in Senna
's steering column, and hence guilty of manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
Head and Newey, who has since moved to McLaren, were acquitted
in 1997 along with team boss Frank Williams and three race
officials.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, who sought one-year sentence for the director and
designer, had only appealed the acquittals in their two cases.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian driver died of massive head injuries soon after
the start of the San Marino Grand Prix on May 4, 1994. His
Williams car shot straight off the track at the high-speed
Tamburello bend, hitting a concrete wall at an estimated 220 kph.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's charges were based on a forensic inquiry
which suggested that Senna's came off the track because his
steering column snapped.
</P>
<P>
This was said to have been the result of a faulty weld two
weeks before the race, when the car was modified to make the
driver more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
In the first trial judges ruled that neither Head nor Newey
were "juridically" responsible for the mistake, but they accepted
the theory that the cause of the crash was the faulty steering
column.
</P>
<P>
The verdict also seemed to imply that the real culprits were
the team mechanics that made the adjustment.
</P>
<P>
But, after hearing expert testimony, the appeals court ruled
today that the steering column had still been intact when Senna's
car left the track.
</P>
<P>
The cause of death was said to be a series of coincidences for
which no one was to blame.
</P>
<P>
An autopsy report presented in court during the first trial in
1997 said the three times world champion was killed by a piece of
his wheel suspension, which freakishly shot between his helmet and
visor, when the loose wheel hit his head.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's verdict also accepted the defense's argument that if
Senna had been driving at any other speed, the piece of metal
would not have hit his head at the fatal angle.

<HEADLINE> World Class Athlete Might be Killed by Drug Reaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A world class athlete may have
died after suffering a reaction to anti-psychotic drugs, an
inquest heard on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sophia Smith, 24 - who was a member of the Great Britain Women
's 4x100m relay team in the 1995 world championships in Sweden -
died in Nether Edge hospital's mental health unit at her home town
of Sheffield in May.
</P>
<P>
According to the local report, the Loughborough University
student was found face down in a pillow on her hospital bed, the
Sheffield inquest was told.
</P>
<P>
Pathologist Dr John Clark said the exact cause of Miss Smith's
death was unknown, although minor signs that her brain had been
starved of oxygen might indicate that she suffocated on the pillow,
or had experienced a rare reaction to anti-psychotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
Toxicologist Professor Robert Forest said that side effects
from the drugs were extremely rare, but that they could sometimes
have an adverse reaction on the heart.
</P>
<P>
The inquest heard that it was unlikely that Miss Smith had been
restrained, and that she had not taken an overdose.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Accuses FARC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Andres Pastrana Arango Monday accused rebel Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC) of lacking the will of signing a peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana, after visiting jungle locality of Puerto Inirida
which was attacked by FARC, said this helpless town was assaulted
and if the zone is to remain without soldiers, this will depend on
actions carried out by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The President told residents of the zone that "if FARC had 40
percent of the willingness I have to make peace, peace accord
would have been signed already."
</P>
<P>
FARC attacked last Wednesday inhabitants of Puerto Inirida,
bordering with Brazil, and left a civilian and a soldier dead, as
well as 6 marine infantrymen injured.
</P>
<P>
The Armed authorities assured having caused about 30 casualties
to FARC during the clash, but a guerrilla spokesperson, Raul
Reyes, denied this assertion.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana reiterated the zone was demilitarized a year ago by
his government in the south of the country in order to sign a
peace accord with the FARC, a rebel group with some 12,000 members
in its ranks.
</P>
<P>
The 42,000 square kilometer- distension area at the south of
Colombia is under FARC domination since November 1998, when
Colombian government readied the withdrawal of the Army in order
to begin talks with FARC, the oldest guerrilla force in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Blair Claims New World Role for Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Monday that Britain has recovered from the loss of empire and
now must stand at the crux of world Affair.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Lord Mayor of London's banquet, Blair said
Britain's role was that of a "pivotal power".
</P>
<P>
He said Britain must stand guard against "the siren voices of
isolationism" and aim to bridge Europe and the United States on the
world stage.
</P>
<P>
Britain should strive to be "engaged, open and dynamic, a partner
and where possible, a leader," the Prime Minister said.
</P>
<P>
Blair said those who argued that Britain should resist
closer ties with Europe in favor of a more independent stance
and stronger transatlantic partnership were offering a "false
choice".
</P>
<P>
Britain had to reject the view that "a nation is only independent
if it stands aloof," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that we are listened to more closely in
Washington if we are leading in Europe. And we have more weight
in Europe if we are listened to in Washington," Blair said in his
speech to the City of London dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
But he stopped short of saying entry to the euro common
currency was necessary to maintain Britain's international
influence, sticking to the usual mantra that Britain will enter
when the economic conditions are right and if backed in a
referendum.

HAVANA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Cuba and Japan signed Monday a
protocol to strength economic, trade and financial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed by Cuban Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo
Cabrisas and Masalake Kusamichi, head of the Japanese delegation

Both parties expressed their satisfaction over the talks on
short term official debt.
</P>

Cuba's delegation expressed their hope that Japanese firms
actively participate in trade, investments and business together
to back up accords of debt reprogramming, as the island has
difficulties of financial liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Cuban officials also expressed their interest in doing business
with Japan in different sectors, including sugar, fishing,
electronic and tourist sectors.
</P>
<P>
The 10th Meeting of Economic Japan-Cuba Conferences, suspended

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain's first undisputed
world heavyweight boxing champion this century, Lennox Lewis,
arrived home to a hero's welcome on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lewis flew into London's Heathrow Airport Monday and showed off
to his fans his world title belts which he won in the recent
heavyweight unification match against Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of fans who gathered in the terminal building to welcome
Lewis home cheered and clapped as he got off his flight from
Newark, New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
The champion, who was wearing dark glasses and a black woollen
hat, said plans for his next fight would be disclosed at a news
conference on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lewis, 34, explained what it was like to be the first
undisputed world champion from Britain since Bob Fitzsimmons 100
years ago: "It is something I have dreamt about and I was glad I
was able to do it.
</P>
<P>
"I would love to defend it here because you have to remember
the Americans always made us go over there and I would love one of
them to come over here, " he said.

LONDON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper
Ian Walker denied Monday suggestions that he spat at fans after
Saturday's victory at Southampton.
</P>
<P>
Walker was alleged to have spat after a confrontation with
supporters outside the players' tunnel at The Dell following the
stormy game which Spurs won 1-0.
</P>
<P>
Saints chief safety officer Mike Pallett said the club had
received complaints from a number of fans and these had been
passed on to the police.
</P>
<P>
But England keeper Walker told Sky Sports in a statement: "It's
absolute rubbish to say I spat at anyone. I think spitting at
people is disgusting and I would never do that.
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like supporters trying to get me into trouble
because their team lost. But I'm quite happy for the FA to
investigate these claims because I'm innocent. I have nothing to
be ashamed of. My conscience is clear."

<HEADLINE> McRae Crashed out at British Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Scot Colin McRae crashed out of
the British Rally while English Richard Burns proved he was the
Prince of Wales after second day races on Monday.
</P>
<P>
McRae's dismal first season as Ford's six million man ended in
familiar fashion and he could be forced to watch arch-rival Burns
be crowned King of the Brits on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Burns literally lit up his home rally as he overcame an engine
fire to take a commanding lead while McRae bowed out on the final
stage.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Englishman won six of the eight special stages
in the fog-bound forests of mid-Wales to establish an advantage of
29 seconds going into Tuesday's longest and final day.
</P>
<P>
McRae struggled in his Ford Focus and was well back in fourth
place when he went off midway through the concluding stage which
took place in darkness.
</P>
<P>
The former world champion's retirement was his eighth in
succession as his frustrating first season in the Focus was
brought to a premature climax.
</P>
<P>
Burns lived up to his name midway through the day when a pin-
hole gap in his engine's oil filter caused a fire which forced him
to stop on a road section with flames licking from the bonnet.
</P>
<P>
Reading-born Burns, who triumphed on the last rally in
Australia, and co-driver Robert Reid used up all the extinguisher
in the car putting out the flames.
</P>
<P>
But they were forced to stop twice more on a nerve-wracking 10-
mile drive to the safety of the service area to let resulting
fires die out naturally as oil continued to seep through.
</P>
<P>
Burns eventually limped into the service station at Builth
Wells- where McRae was forced to retire when leading last year -
for Subaru mechanics to put out the fire for good and change the
faulty filter.

<P>
ATHENS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The development of business
ties between Greece and Turkey could help improve their bilateral
relations, said a joint communique Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued here Monday, The Federation of
Greek Industries (SEB) and the Union of Turkish Industrialists and
Businessmen (TUSIAD) said that economic relations between the two
neighboring countries had been on a steady increase over the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
Under the right circumstances, the business communities of the
two countries foresaw greater possibilities for trade as well as
for investment and business partnerships between the two
neighbors, they said.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the acceptance of Turkey as an European
Union (EU) candidate country would advance its internal efforts to
satisfy the political and economic criteria for entry into the EU,
in this way promoting effective solutions to the political
problems existing between Greece and Turkey, as well as the
Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Russia Wants to See Improvements in U.N. Oil-For-Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian said Monday
that it wants to see some improvements in a renewed U.N.
oil-for-food program in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the U.N. correspondents in the United Nations
Correspondents Association, Russia Permanent Representative to the
U.N. Sergey Lavrov said that in the seventh phase of the program,
there should be some improved elements and it cannot be a simple
one of rollover.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov said the oil revenue Iraq can use to import spare parts
and equipment for its dilapidated oil industry should be doubled,
a move supported by the U.N. secretary-general and some members of
the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Russia had never asked for the lifting of the sanctions against
Iraq before it had fully complied with relevant U.N. resolutions,
Lavrov stressed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. weapons inspection system should be established in
Iraq first, strictly performing the tasks the United Nations
Security Council has authorized, Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on Iraq's decision not to sign agreement with
the U.N. governing the oil-for-food program, Lavrov said he was
unaware of that.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been deadlocked on the Iraq issue since
the U.S.-led military strikes against the country last December.
Consultations and discussions have been undertaken by the Security
Council but they are still far from reaching a new comprehensive
policy towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has informed the United Nations that it will not renew the
oil-for-food deal with the United Nations, a move widely seen here
as a protest to the continuing sanctions against the country.

London's FTSE 100 ended lower for the fourth consecutive

<HEADLINE> Russian Ambassador Reports "Mixed Impressions" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Permanent
Representative to the United Nations Sergei Lavrov, speaking
Monday about his "mixed impressions" on his recent visit to
Kosovo, the Yugoslav province, said that there is a gap between
what he was told and what he has seen on the ground as Security
Council resolution 1244 is concerned.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov paid a visit to Kosovo in early November, where he held
talks with representatives from the U.N. Interim Administration
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), the international peacekeeping force,
known as the KFOR, and representatives of the Yugoslav government
and the communities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov told a press conference here that "everybody wants to
implement (the resolution) 1244 in all its aspects, and I was told
that everybody believes that Kosovo must remain, or become, or be
restored as a multiethnic society, and that the status of Kosovo
should be determined through political dialogue," and "that all
those living in Kosovo should have the right to do so."
</P>
<P>
"On this point, nobody has actually disagreed," he said. "But
in practical terms, what I've seen and what I was told, things are
not moving well to achieve the objective of the (resolution) 1244,
including the objective of respecting the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and
starting the political dialogue on the future of Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"We see quite an organized campaign to intimidate the
non-Albanian population and drive them out of the province," he
said.
</P>
<P>
His finding was reaffirmed by the Monday report by the New York
Times newspaper, which said, "The burning of Serbs' homes takes
place almost daily in an organized fashion, increasing the
pressure on the Serbian minority to flee the province or ghettoize
itself in enclaves."
</P>
<P>
"Even some Albanians, for example, Catholic Albanians are being
intimidated" by "the extremist of the Albanian community," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "The KFOR must do much more (in promoting the
security situation) than it has been doing until now, and the
UNMIK should pay much more attention to maintain the goal of its
mandate," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned with the way the Kosovo Protection Corps
was created," he said. "It keeps the basical structure of the
former KLA (rebel Kosovo Liberation Army), it keeps quite a lot of
arms in the hands of the people who will be remaining in this
corps, and they, to a very large extent, represent the former KLA,
and non-Albanians are not very eager to join."
</P>
<P>
Under resolution 1244, which was adopted on June 10, the KLA,
the Albanian-dominated armed rebel group, should be fully disarmed
after the U.N. presence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The corps creation "was not consulted with the Security
Council, and not endorsed by the Security Council," he said.
"Those who created it must bear the responsibility of making sure
that their assessment proves true, namely this decision is the
only way out to strengthen security and exclude the intimidation."
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador told Xinhua that he backs the repeated
protests from Belgrade against what the U.N. Mission in Kosovo is
doing to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia by the introduction of foreign currencies into the
province, the opening of the Pristina airport, and the creation of
the banking system.
</P>
<P>
Russia, with the traditionally close ties with Yugoslavia, had
been one of the leading critics of the U.N. administration and the
KFOR peacekeeping force since they moved into Kosovo, accusing them
of not doing enough to protect Serbs and other non-Albanian
residents in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
"There was no attempt so far to start a dialogue between
Belgrade and Kosovo," he said. "For this purpose, we encourage the
UNMIK to have more frequent contacts with official representatives
of Belgrade."

<HEADLINE> Internet Buying Increasing Among U.S. Households </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Almost a quarter of U.S.
households bought something over the Internet during the past
year, according to a survey released Monday by the Conference
Board, a business-financed research group.
</P>
<P>
While privacy and security concerns are clearly keeping many
consumers off the Net, the survey report said, these issues will
be resolved over time and marketers will effectively penetrate
this vast but still untapped market.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was based on a representative sample of 5,000
households, shows that younger households were more likely than
older households to have made an online transaction, and so were
consumers in the more affluent brackets, compared with poorer
households.
</P>
<P>
Consumers mostly favored entertainment items, making books, CDs
and computer accessories the top sellers over the Internet,
according to the survey. These items are relatively inexpensive; a
substantial proportion of survey participants said their biggest
single purchase was under 100 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Householders age 25-34 are the most likely online shoppers,
with more than 40 percent having made such a purchase. Those in
the 65-and-over group are the least likely to shop online, with
less than 10 percent having made such a transaction.
</P>
<P>
Affluent householders, whose earning in excess of 50,000
dollars, tend to spend well-above average, with more than 40
percent having purchased via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
When asked about purchasing further online, more than 60
percent claim that the price of goods plays heavily in their
decision. Improved security ranked as the second issue. Navigation
was listed the third block, as nearly 40 percent of respondents
would like greater ease in finding their products.

NEW YORK, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended
mixed Monday with the Dow Jones industrial average rising.

<P>
The Dow Index closed up 85.63 at 11,089.52. The blue chip
index fell 31.81 points last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's

Nasdaq composite index rose 23.31 at 3,392.56, surpassing
the record closing high of 3,369.25 points set Friday.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft continued to rise today in a hope for an
out-of-court agreement between the company and the government
after appointment of a mediator to oversee antitrust
settlement talks. The rise pushed the Dow and the Nasdaq higher.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola, AT&AMP;T and several large Internet companies also
helped the two indexes to move higher. But S&AMP;P and other
indexes fell on profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE fell 1.48 at 644.64 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 0.50 at 460.77. But the American Stock

<HEADLINE> Britain Might End Up Alone Outside Euro, Cook Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook warned on Monday that Britain could one day be the only
European Union nation clinging to its own currency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the House of Commons, Cook reaffirmed his position
as the government's most pro-euro campaigner. He said the decision
about whether to ditch the British pound or not was of huge
importance to the country's future.
</P>
<P>
"It is important we get it right and it is important that we
make the right decision for Britain. A decision must be made by
giving honest answers to questions that reflect the real world,
one in which Britain could soon be the only country in the
European Union outside the eurozone," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that Britain would only adopt the euro if five
economic conditions set down by the government earlier this year
are met and if the public vote for it in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary said the euro was a reality for Britain
whether it signed up or not.
