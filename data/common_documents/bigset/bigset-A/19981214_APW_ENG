<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Just hours before three local children
drowned Monday at a New South Wales beach, a tourist official
called for a surf safety awareness program targeting international
tourists.
	   The children were from a church group in western Sydney, on an
outing at Cellito beach south of the mid-north coast town of
Forster, some 135 miles (220 km) north of Sydney.
	   The accident happened when six children were caught in a rip
tide after being swept off a sandbar by a wave.
	   An ambulance spokesman said a rescue helicopter airlifted a
12-year-old child to Manning Base hospital in Taree in a serious
but stable condition.
	   The other two other children were uninjured, the ambulance
spokesman said.
	   Meanwhile, Tourism Task Force chairman John Brown said Australia
had a duty of care to its visitors and it was the joint
responsibility of governments and the tourism industry to educate
travelers about surf safety.
	   ``Many foreign tourists arrive in Australia with little or no
experience in surf and get themselves and their rescuers in
trouble,'' Brown said.
	   An elderly Russian tourist on an outing with a tour group at
Bondi Beach drowned after being swept up in a rip about 200 feet
(60 meters) from the shoreline on Saturday afternoon.
	   The man, aged in his 60s, had been swimming outside the flagged
safety zone, where beach life savers patrol the waters. Areas
beyond the flags could have rip tides, undertows, and other
hazards.
	   On Friday a young South Korean man died in what lifesavers
described as a freak accident in knee-depth water at Bronte Beach.
	   Three men were dragged under the surface and two of them
resurfaced quickly but they were unable to locate their friend.

Coal companies seek injunction to halt 48-hour strike

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with court ordering Rio Tinto miners back to work;
trims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Coal mining companies on Monday
began legal action to end a nationwide miners' strike called to
protest lower coal prices for Japan's steel industry.
	   A coalition of companies sought the intervention of the
Australian Industrial Relations Commission, applying for an order
against the Construction, Forestry Mining and Energy Union.
	   Union members walked off the job Monday, angered at miners MIM,
Shell and the North Goonyella Mine accepting an 18 percent, U.S.
dlrs 9 a metric ton, cut in the Japanese price of coking coal, used
for making steel.
	   Later Monday, coal company Rio Tinto won a New South Wales
Supreme Court order against strike action at its Hunter Valley
mines, which had joined in a sympathy strike along with all other
coal miners nationwide.
	   Federal Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith described the
strike as ``totally unauthorized'' because union members have
breached no-strike agreements under the Workplace Relations Act.
	   Companies now have the option of seeking compensation from union
members for any losses from the strike, he said.
	   According to CFMEU spokesman Paddy Gorman, the union was
prepared to test the government's claims the strike action was
illegal.
	   ``This is a test for the current government ... I think it is
the first time they've had a national strike against them, so if
they think it's illegal, let's see them in court,'' he said.
	   Mining companies estimate the strike will cost the industry 56
million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 34 million) in lost
production.
	   ``This union is infamous for taking industrial action,'' Reith
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Reith said the coal industry had one of the highest levels of
strikes, undermining Australia's reputation as a reliable and
consistent supplier.
	   ``The CFMEU are bloody-minded when it comes to the national
interest, they undermine the interests of their own workers, they
run a political agenda,'' he said.
	   ``Now they want the Australian government to control the
international price of a major commodity, obviously something
outside our control,'' he said.
	   But CFMEU mining division general president Tony Maher said the
government had failed to address a general coal crisis that had
sparked major job losses and is threatening more.
	   ``Coal is Australia's biggest export earner _ it earns 10
billion (Australian dollars) a year for the country so a 20 percent
drop means 2 billion lost to Australia,'' Maher said.
	   He said the price cut would mean further job losses in an
industry already reeling from the loss of 4,000 jobs in the past 12
months.
	   ``For every mine worker lost, another three jobs are lost from
the flow on effect _ that means 16,000 jobs lost,'' he said.
	   ``Now there'll be many more on the scrap heap.''
	   Maher believes the problems in the coal industry stem from an
oversupply of coal.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea's Ji Sung-hwan upstaged
Japan's Olympic bronze medal winner Takanobu Jumonji to claim the
opening race of the Asian Games track cycling program Monday.
	   Ji finished in 1 minute, 5.406 seconds in the 1-kilometer time
trial to beat the games record and easily account for his more
illustrious opponent.
	   Jumonji, who covered the distance in 1:03.261 at the Atlanta
Olympics, was well off that mark Monday, finishing in 1:07.011.
	   ``I didn't expect a gold medal today because the Japanese rider
is very strong. I just tried my best,'' said the 27-year-old Ji.
	   Ji, a member of the winning pursuit team in 1994, went under the
1:05.851 record held by Japan's Masanaga Shiohara.
	   Jumonji said he was beaten by a stronger opponent.
	   ``I am not strong enough to win,'' said the 23-year-old Jumonji.
``I was sorry that I did not win the first velodrome gold for
Japan. I will start anew to prepare for the Sydney Games.''
	   Taiwan's Chen Keng-hsien came third in 1:08.364.

Malaysian industrial production sinks 10.4 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Recession-plagued Malaysia's
industrial production fell steeply again in October, government
statistics show.
	   Industrial production fell 10.4 percent in October from the same
month last year, the Statistics Department said Sunday. But the
extent of the fall is beginning to moderate.
	   The industrial production index fell 10.5 percent in September
and 10.9 percent in August compared to the same months last year.
	   Malaysia, along with its neighbors, has been shaken by the Asian
economic crisis.
	   The economy shrank 8.6 percent in the third quarter, a dramatic
slowdown from 7.8 percent expansion in 1997 and the once booming
economic growth rates recorded over the past decade.
	   The government has even said it may have to revise its full year
forecast of a 4.8 percent contraction.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his economic team have said
the nation's economy would grow by 1 percent next year as a result
of strict capital controls introduced in September.
	   The curbs were aimed at protecting the nation's economy from the
regional financial turmoil.
	   So far, however, there has been little evidence of improvement.

Prosecution to bring semen-stained mattress to court
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE throughout with prosecution announcing plans
to exhibit semen-stained mattress, other details; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By R. MAGESWARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The sex and corruption trial of
former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim took a sensational turn
Monday when the prosecution said it would exhibit a semen-stained
mattress to prove Anwar had indulged in illegal sex.
	   Deputy Public Prosecutor Azahar Mohamed told the court that the
mattress, seized by police in July from an apartment here, had
already been examined by the police laboratory.
	   He did not disclose the findings, but said the mattress would be
shown to the court Tuesday.
	   Anwar, the Southeast Asian country's deputy premier before being
sacked in September, currently faces abuse of power charges and
will be tried separately for allegedly having engaged in illegal
sex acts.
	   The prosecutor made the statement after Assistant Commissioner
of Police Musa Hassan, the 13th witness in the trial, said he had
ordered the mattress and pillow to be taken when he was
investigating whether Anwar had an affair with his former
secretary's wife.
	   ``I saw a few patches of seminal fluid on the mattress,'' Musa
told the court.
	   Earlier, Musa said Anwar could have been prosecuted for sexual
misconduct as early as last year had he not forced police to coerce
retractions from two people who made accusations against him.
	   Musa testified police detectives were unaware last year that the
retractions had been drafted and obtained by colleagues in the
police department's special branch _ allegedly on Anwar's orders.
	   Otherwise, charges would have been brought against the former
deputy prime minister on the basis of initial allegations made by
Ummi Hafilda Ali and Azizan Abu Bakar, the prosecution witness
said.
	   ``I suggested no further action because I was influenced by the
retraction letters,'' Musa told the court on Monday.
	   Azizan, the former driver of the jailed politician's wife, has
testified that Anwar repeatedly sodomized him in 1992, while Ummi
has accused Anwar of sleeping with her brother's wife, Shamsida
Tahrin.
	   The original allegations were contained in a letter Ummi, the
sister of Anwar's former secretary, sent to Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Last week, Musa said regular police officers were prevented from
interrogating Ummi and Azizan. Musa, who belongs to the criminal
investigation department, conducted a probe against Anwar this year
after the accusations resurfaced in a book.
	   Azizan's sodomy claims and Ummi's letter form the core of the 10
charges against Anwar, who was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 on
grounds of immorality.
	   Anwar is being tried for four counts of allegedly using his
influence with the police to force the two accusers to sign
retractions. He also faces trial on five illegal sex charges and
one more count of corruption.
	   But his sacking and subsequent arrest and beating while in
police custody have led to demands for political reforms and
anti-government protests.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's Liu Hongyu, fourth at last
year's world championships, was unchallenged to win the women's
10-kilometer walk at the Asian Games on Monday.
	   Liu finished the road race in 43 minutes, 57.28 seconds,
comfortably ahead of Japan's Rie Mitsumori (44:29.82) and
Kazakstan's Svetlana Tolstaya (45:29.95).
	   Liu, who has a best of 42:38.00, said she never felt threatened
Monday.
	   ``If they pushed me hard, the time might have been faster,'' Liu
said.
	   Liu's teammate Li Yuxin, gold medalist in the Asian
championships in July, was disqualified two kilometers from the
finish after receiving a third warning.
	   ``I have nothing to say,'' Li said. ``I can only say that I
should perfect my technique in future.''
	   The race was the final women's walk event over 10 kilometers.
International meets are changing to 20 kilometers next year.
	   Liu said she would cope with the decision.
	   ``I will be more confident of winning the longer race,'' Liu
said.
	   The walk was the first of 11 track and field medals on offer
Monday, including the glamor 100-meter sprint events.

Environmental group slams Vietnamese logging in Cambodia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Vietnam is exploiting Cambodia by
stripping its neighbor's underdeveloped, resource-rich eastern
forests of high-quality timber, a London-based environmental
watchdog said Monday.
	   The criticism comes as Vietnam hosts a summit of Association of
Southeast Asian nations at which it is pushing for Cambodia to be
admitted to the regional group.
	   ``It is ironic that with so much talk of regional cooperation
surrounding the ASEAN summit, right now Vietnamese loggers are
illegally felling trees in Cambodia with the full sanction of the
Vietnamese government,'' Global Witness Director Patrick Alley said
in a statement.
	   ``Rather than cooperation it smacks of exploitation,'' he said.
	   Cambodia is one of the most deforested countries in a region
where illegal logging is rampant and the destruction of tropical
rainforests is a major environmental concern.
	   Various factions in Cambodia's recently concluded civil war,
including the government, have used proceeds from illegal logging
to fund their armies and enrich their leaders, various
environmental groups have charged.
	   The International Monetary Fund suspended assistance to Cambodia
in 1996 when the government failed to account for timber revenues
in its national budget.
	   Cambodia's western neighbor, Thailand, which has also been
criticized by Global Witness for its role in illegal logging, has a
ban on cutting hardwood forests, and so looks to Cambodia for
supplies of timber.
	   Citing a World Bank-funded study, Global Witness said all
commercially valuable timber will be extracted from Cambodia within
five years if logging continues unchecked.
	   Global Witness also cited a document signed in July by
Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung permitting
Vietnam's state-owned forestry company to re-export Cambodian and
Laotian timber.
	   The environmental group has documented the export of more than
260,000 cubic meters (338,000 cubic yards) of Cambodian timber _
worth upwards of dlrs 40 million _ to Vietnam since late 1997.
	   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen is in Hanoi for the ASEAN
summit.
	   Vietnam has been the most vocal supporter at the summit of
Cambodia's admission into ASEAN, a move which has divided the
group. Cambodia's membership was put on hold last year when Hun Sen
ousted his co-prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh in a violent
coup.
	   Hun Sen's new administration has embarked on a campaign to
restore legitimacy and regain foreign aid that was lost after the
coup.
	   Several highly publicized timber seizures in recent months have
been touted by the government as proof it is reining in the illegal
trade. But Global Witness said in its statement that the felling of
timber in eastern Cambodia has not abated.

Prime Minister Tony Blair calls for ''maturity'' in relationship
</HEADLINE>
with Europe &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair called Monday for ''some
maturity'' in Britain's relationship with the rest of Europe.
	   Following a summit of European Union leaders, Blair wrote in The
Times that he wants Britain to be a leading partner in Europe. He
said that by working with European countries and not isolating
itself, Britain could help shape the region's future.
	   ''I believe that our interests lie clearly in Europe and that
the best policy for Britain is to engage constructively in order to
argue effectively for the type of Europe we want,'' he wrote in
Monday's edition of the London-based newspaper. ''It is time to get
some maturity into our relationship with Europe.''
	   Britain's relationship with the rest of Europe has always been
tricky. Conservative Prime Minister John Major declared that he
wanted to put Britain ''at the heart of Europe'' after he succeeded
Margaret Thatcher in 1990. The European issue contributed to her
downfall, and it bedeviled Major until the Conservatives went down
in a landslide defeat in 1997.
	   When the Labor party came to power, Blair was eager to be seen
as a major force in Europe. But recently, government officials have
expressed fears of becoming sidelined from the 15-nation EU when
the European single currency is launched on January 1. Eleven
nations will take part, but Britain has decided to remain out. The
government has said it will not make a decision until it has seen
the effect of the new currency.
	   Britain also came under fire last week as leaders at the summit
discussed ways to reform the union's financing to pay for plans to
welcome new members.
	   Blair has been urged to concede Britain's 2 million pounds (dlrs
3.2 million) rebate. But he has said that is ''nonnegotiable.''
Blair also had to contend with some British tabloids, which
predicted before the summit that efforts were underway to achieve
tax harmony across Europe, leading to higher taxes in Britain.
Officials have denied that sort of tax coordination is being
discussed.
	   ''Naturally, if Europe proposes something foolish, I will work
to stop it,'' Blair wrote in the newspaper.
	   But while insisting he understood that Britain's relations with
Europe can ''cause anguish,'' Blair said that Britain cannot simply
''opt out'' of the debate about Europe's future.
	   ''Then what? The debate could be lost, with us still hanging on,
half in, half out, affected by developments in Europe but never
affecting them,'' he wrote.
	   The opposition Conservative Party has vowed to fight the next
election, which must be held by 2002, in favor of saving the
British pound and staying out of the single currency, the euro.

ASEAN leaders arrive for summit

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Southeast Asian leaders flew in Monday for
their annual summit as it appeared that Cambodia would have to wait
another year before it can participate as a full-fledged member.
	   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who had hoped admission to the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations would add further legitimacy
to his new coalition government, sounded almost resigned to being
relegated to observer status again.
	   While he said he was hopeful his fellow leaders would be able to
reach a consensus that their foreign ministers could not, Hun Sen
said if Cambodia is not accepted this time, next year would be
acceptable.
	   ``We can wait,'' he said. ``Late or soon, we must join.''
	   The issue of Cambodia's membership has been a hot topic at
pre-summit meetings by the foreign ministers. The country had been
scheduled to join in July 1997, but political turmoil led to its
admission being put on hold.
	   Vietnam, host of this year's ASEAN summit, has spearheaded the
effort to get its neighbor accepted now.
	   However, the foreign ministers of the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand stuck to their views that Hun Sen's coalition with his
former enemy, put together late last month, must prove stable
first.
	   The leaders arrived in quick succession at Hanoi's Noibai
Airport, where an honor guard stood shivering on the tarmac on a
cool overcast day.
	   Women in flowing ao dai tunics handed the leaders bouquets as
their national flags were raised and a military band played their
anthems.
	   Most of the leaders had no comment, although Myanmar's Than Shwe
issued a statement lauding ASEAN's efforts to deal with the
regional economic crisis that has battered the region.
	   ``Today ASEAN faces a number of daunting challenges, but Myanmar
is confident that with the unity and solidarity of its members,
ASEAN will surely be able to overcome them,'' he said.
	   The leaders were to attend a state dinner Monday night hosted by
Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, then have two days of
formal talks and bilateral meetings, along with discussions with
three ``dialogue partners'' _ Japan, China and South Korea.
	   They also are expected to endorse four documents that have been
prepared by their foreign and economic ministers and lay out
specific plans for helping the region recover from the economic
crisis.
	   The centerpiece is a batch of ``bold measures'' that would cut
into tax revenues in an effort to attract investment and create new
jobs.
	   A draft of the measures includes tariff cuts, investor
incentives, duty-free status for capital equipment, relaxed rules
on foreign ownership of land on a ``best-effort'' basis, and
speeded-up implementation of an ASEAN Free Trade Area and ASEAN
Investment Area.
	   Some of the measures would be put on a dual-track scenario that
would allow developing countries more time and leeway.
	   Some are to take effect almost immediately in an effort to shore
up investor confidence and show the world the region is willing to
take tough action instead of just talking about it.
	   ``I feel it will put us back on the investment map again,''
Philippine Trade Secretary Jose Pardo said. ``It will be too
difficult for investors in the West to refuse to take a hard look
at the opportunities that are here.''

Philippines will achieve export target, official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Philippines will achieve its export
target of dlrs 29 billion this year, despite a slowdown in exports
over the past month, according to trade secretary Jose Pardo.
	   The target is 16 percent higher than the country's dlrs 25
billion of exports last year. For the January to October period,
exports were up 18 percent from the same 10 months of last year.
	   But in October, exports fell 8.7 percent from September, and
were up only 9.3 percent from October 1997.
	   In an interview Sunday, Pardo did not provide a target for next
year but said by early 1999 Philippine officials will have finished
their review of a study predicting between dlrs 30 billion and dlrs
34 billion of exports next year.
	   Pardo said strong demand for electronics _ two-thirds of the
country's external shipments _ provides a reason for confidence
about exports, despite a slight strengthening of the peso recently.
	   Pardo, in Hanoi for meetings of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, said exporters are not worried about the peso's
recent rebound as long as it remains between 36 and 44 pesos to the
dollar.
	   But Pardo, who serves on the monetary board of the Philippines
central bank, stressed that the market must decide the right level
for the currency. ``I can't try to second guess the market,'' Pardo
said. ``We only intervene when it's subject to speculative
attack.''
	   Asked about Malaysia's move earlier this year to impose capital
controls, Pardo noted that past attempts in the Philippines at such
measures have failed _ breeding graft and dollar hoarding _ and
said it's unlikely other Southeast Asian countries will follow
Malaysia's example.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad urged other countries
to try controls at the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit, but was unsuccessful, Pardo noted.
	   ``He tried but it didn't fly. There were no takers,'' Pardo
said.

Blood feud Pakistani couple seek asylum in Britain, newspaper says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A couple are seeking refuge in Britain after their
marriage across rival tribes led to rioting and killings in
Pakistan, a British newspaper reported.
	   Kanwar Ahsan, 30 and Riffat Afridi, 19, who come from rival
tribes, have formally asked the British government for help after
receiving 6,000 death threats, the Sunday Telegraph said.
	   ``We are existing, but we are not allowed to live because we
defied our tradition and married for love,'' Ahsan was quoted as
saying. ``Now we want to live in peace without fear. I have no
doubt that my wife's family will try to kill us _ they have tried
before.''
	   The Telegraph said a bounty of 5,000 pounds (dlrs 8,250) has
been put on their heads. Ahsan, a clerical worker from the Mohajir
community and Ms. Afridi, a member of a powerful family of the
Pathan tribe, met four years ago and eloped in February after an
illicit friendship.
	   Ms. Afridi's father led demonstrations in Karachi, claiming she
had been kidnapped. Violence erupted between the two communities,
sparking riots and killings before Ms. Afridi and her husband were
sentenced to death by her father's tribe.
	   The couple were arrested when they returned to Karachi, and
Ahsan had to appear before a Pakistani court on charges of
kidnapping. He was shot at as he entered the courtroom. Ms.
Afridi's father and brother now face charges of attempted murder.
	   Ms. Afridi appeared in court and declared that she had married
for love. The two were found innocent and freed, the newspaper
said.
	   The couple say they still fear for their lives, the newspaper
said.

Controversial women's bill can't get a hearing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ For the fourth time this year, turmoil
in the Indian parliament delayed an attempt to debate a bill
setting aside a third of the chamber's seats for women.
	   The governing coalition had planned to table the bill Monday
morning, but just a few minutes into the session, Speaker G.M.C.
Balayogi was forced to temporarily adjourn because of angry shouts
from two dozen lawmakers protesting against a woman colleague who
had scuffled with one of the bill's opponents last week.
	   Monday's protesters said Mamata Banerjee should be expelled from
parliament because of her actions Friday, when she grabbed at the
clothing of another lawmaker to try to stop him from joining a
protest against the bill that ended with another early adjournment.
Two other attempts in July to introduce the bill also failed amid
scuffling and shouting.
	   Balayogi planned to reconvene Monday afternoon. But with
emotions running so high, it is doubtful the women's quota bill
will ever even be officially debated, let alone put to a vote.
	   The bill, meant to increase women's participation in India's
democracy, was first introduced in 1996 by a previous government,
but met with similar opposition and never came to a vote in a
country where religion and tradition have limited women's public
role.
	   Members of parties who rely on the votes of Muslims and lower
class Hindus say they won't let the bill be considered unless it
includes quotas within the quota for the groups they represent.
Women's groups say the quota-within-a-quota demand may be a tactic
to stall the bill by men who do not want to give up any power,
rather than a legitimate attempt to help minorities.
	   The bill would also set aside a third of state assembly seats
for women. A similar measure was passed in 1995 for municipal and
village councils. Results have been mixed at the local level. Some
women politicians are merely fronts for husbands or fathers, or
have been ousted in no-confidence votes.

Korea Electric Power sells thermal facilities to U.S. company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ State-run Korea Electric Power Corp.
said Monday it has signed a contract to sell used thermal power
generating facilities to a U.S. company for dlrs 28.2 million.
	   The deal calls for IBC Turbine Inc. to take over four gas
turbines, one steam turbine and related facilities at a heavy
oil-fired plant in Youngwol, 170 kilometers (100 miles) southeast
of Seoul.
	   The 300,000-kilowatt power plant was built in 1978 and has been
generating electricity for household and industrial use. The Korean
state utility stopped plant operation in March to build a new power
plant there.
	   IBC plans to move the facilities to the United States where it
will remodel and sell them.
	   Based in Houston, Texas, IBC Turbine specializes in renovating
power plants.

American Chamber of Commerce survey predicts more gloom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The economy will weather another tough year in
1999 before recovering in two years, according to a survey of more
than 400 companies in Hong Kong released Monday.
	   ``The results confirm that the extent of the hardship caused by
the Asian financial crisis was underestimated,'' said Jeffrey Muir,
chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce, which surveyed member
companies.
	   Sixty-one percent of respondents said they expected Hong Kong's
economy to recover in 2000, with 22 percent not expecting a
recovery until 2001.
	   Fifty-four percent of the companies said they expected Hong
Kong's business environment to be good or satisfactory next year.
The rest said the business environment would be unfavorable in
1999.
	   Despite the gloomy outlook next year, 90 percent of companies
who have regional headquarters in Hong Kong said they would retain
their bases in the territory, mainly because falling property
prices will help keep costs down. Prices for many commercial
properties have halved since their peaks last year.
	   Respondents were positive, but increasingly cautious, on the
outlook for mainland China. A large majority, or 91 percent, said
they saw the business environment as being favorable or very
favorable in the next five years, down from 94 percent last year.
	   ``The bloom is off the rose,'' Muir said, noting that foreign
businesses operating in mainland China found excessive bureaucracy,
lack of transparency in laws and regulations, and corruption as
some of the main disincentives to doing business there.
	   He also noted that 78 percent of the respondents expected their
companies to increase their China investment in the coming year,
down from 85 percent last year.
	   That reflected the mainland government's tighter restrictions on
foreign exchange, Muir said.
	   The survey was sent to 1,086 companies. Between Oct. 23 and Nov.
18, 430 responses were received by AC Nielsen, which conducted the
survey for the chamber.
	   No margin of error was given.

Kabaddi: A sport with a past
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Some of the strictly Asian sports in
the region's version of the Olympics are easy to understand, but
organizers of the Asian Games decided kabaddi needed some
explanation.
	   ``It's over 4,000 years old, it has the characteristics of
wrestling and rugby (and) was invented by the Indians,'' said a
summary issued by the organizing committee Monday.
	   Competition in the Asian subcontinent specialty began Sunday,
with defending champion India beating archrival Pakistan 17-9 in
the opening game of the preliminary round.
	   Teams of 10 players each send raiders into each other's
territory. Raiders score points for each opponent tagged, but must
keep chanting ``kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi ...'' in one breath. If
the raider is held down long enough that he can't return to his own
territory in that one breath, the raider is out.
	   At these games, seven nations are competing for kabaddi medals _
India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Japan and Thailand.
	   Other Asian sports in the games include sepak takraw _ a
no-hands version of volleyball using a small rattan ball and
featuring acrobatic kicking _ and softball tennis. The latter uses
a regular tennis court, but soft rubber balls, smaller rackets and
a different scoring system.
	   The Japanese sport of judo already is in the Olympics, and the
Korean martial art of taekwondo is to be included in the 2000 games
in Sydney.
	   Among other sports here, karate is not in the Olympics, but has
spread worldwide. Wushu is a blanket term for several forms of
Chinese martial arts.
	   In all, some 6,000 athletes from 41 nations are competing in 36
sports in the Bangkok games.

Japanese stocks close lower, dollar falls against yen in Tokyo

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks fell Monday on concern about the
health of the banking system after the nationalization of a major
lender and a central bank report that business sentiment has
deteriorated. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 294.02 points,
or 2.04 percent, to close at 14,111.62 for a third straight day of
losses. On Friday, the average fell 402.16 points, or 2.72 percent.
	   The dollar bought 116.12 yen in mid-afternoon trading, down 1.16
yen from late Friday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of
116.42 yen Friday.
	   Led down by bank shares, Japanese stocks slid amid rekindled
fears of instability in the bad debt-ridden banking system after
the government took over ailing lender Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. on
Sunday, traders said.
	   The compulsory nationalization of Nippon Credit marked the
second time a top lender has come under state control in less than
two months. The government took over the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd. on Oct. 23.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 17.85 points, or 1.60 percent, to 1,100.31
points. The TOPIX closed down 21.62 points, 1.90 points, on Friday.
	   The market was also weighed down by worse-than-expected results
from a closely-watched quarterly Bank of Japan survey tracking
business sentiment.
	   A slide in U.S. stock prices on Friday also spooked investors,
traders said.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 19.82 points on Friday
to close the week at 8,821.76.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar lost ground
against the yen amid mounting concern over an impending vote in the
U.S. Congress on articles of impeachment against President Bill
Clinton, traders said.
	   Worry over the direction of the American economy also weighed on
the U.S. currency, they said.
	   ``The uncertainty surrounding the impeachment proceedings will
depress the dollar,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of
foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank in Tokyo. ``And the outlook for
the U.S. economy is getting worse because of falling commodity
prices,'' he added.
	   The U.S. House or Representatives was scheduled to begin debate
Thursday on four impeachment articles.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.270 percent from 1.160 percent on Friday,
pushing its price down to 104.49 yen from Friday's 105.47 yen.

Two South Korean prisoners of war, their children arrive in Seoul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two South Korean soldiers, believed
killed during the 1950-53 Korean War, have returned home after
being held captive in communist North Korea for 45 years,
government officials said Monday.
	   Kim Bok-ki, 67, and Park Dong-il, 71, along with their two
children who are a married couple, flew in from a ``third country''
where they had been living in hiding since escaping North Korea
early this year, they said.
	   The Seoul government generally uses the term ``third country''
to avoid naming China, which is required by a treaty with North
Korea to return defectors to their homeland.
	   The two men were captured by Chinese troops, which were fighting
on the North Korean side, toward the end of the Korean War and had
been listed as killed in action, officials said.
	   The two were initially detained in a POW camp near the North's
capital, Pyongyang, but were later sent to a coal mine in northern
North Korea where they had been forced to work until they escaped
the country, the officials said.
	   Other details, including when the two arrived and whether they
have other family members still living in the North, were not
revealed.
	   Seoul says more than 40,000 South Korean prisoners were not
returned at the end of the Korean conflict, but the North claims
that all southern POWs went home in 1953.
	   Only five Southern POWs, including Kim and Park, have
successfully escaped the North since.
	   Without a peace treaty, the two Koreas are still technically at
war.

Nagano governor denies bribery in Olympic selection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Olympics-Bribes

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The head of Nagano's campaign to host the 1998
Winter Olympics reportedly denied allegations that officials bribed
International Olympic Committee members to back the city's bid.
	   Nagano Prefectural Gov. Goro Yoshimura, who chaired the
committee that organized the northern Japanese city's bid, told
Kyodo News agency on Monday that IOC members were not paid off for
their votes.
	   ``There were no agents interfering in deciding the host site at
the time of the drive to bring (the Olympics) to Nagano,''
Yoshimura reportedly said.
	   Marc Hodler, a senior member of the IOC executive board, alleged
over the weekend in Lausanne, Switzerland that bids for the Nagano
Games and at least three other host cities were tainted by bribery.
	   Hodler said he believed 5 to 7 percent of IOC members have
solicited bribes. There are currently 115 IOC members.
	   A Nagano Olympic official said he could not confirm Yoshimura's
reported remarks.
	   Hodler claimed there were also irregularities in the campaigns
organized by Atlanta for the 1996 Summer Games, Sydney for the
Summer Olympics in 2000 and Salt Lake City for the 2002 Winter
Games.
	   On Sunday, the mayor of the city of Nagano also denied
allegations that city officials bribed members of the IOC to win
the right to host the 1998 Games, held in February.
	   ``As far as Nagano is concerned, we haven't done anything wrong.
We were selected as host of the Olympics through our efforts. We
can't believe that Mr. Hodler has made such a statement,'' Nagano
Mayor Tasuku Tsukada told the Associated Press.
	   Nagano, a central Japan city, 179 kilometers (111 miles),
northwest of Tokyo, became the first Asian city to host the Winter
Games since Sapporo, Japan, staged the 1972 Winter Games.

Thai aviation officials say absence of landing system not behind
</HEADLINE>
crash
 &UR; By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SURAT THANI, Thailand (AP) _ Military helicopters began removing
the wreckage of a Thai Airways jetliner from a swamp on Monday,
while aviation officials said the absence of a state-of-the-art
landing system should not have caused the crash that killed 101
people.
	   ``I want to reiterate that the systems we have in place are
capable of guiding the plane in a similar manner,'' said Sawat
Sitiwon, director general of the Department of Aviation.
	   Both the pilot and aviation authorities have come under fire for
the crash of Flight TG261 during a heavy rainstorm Friday evening
in Surat Thani, 530 kilometers (33 miles) southwest of Bangkok.
	   An investigation by government officials and Airbus, the French
manufacturer of the A310-200 plane, to determine what caused the
accident, is already underway.
	   Several of the 45 survivors said the pilot, who died of his
injuries after the crash, should never have made a third attempt to
land after failing the first two times.
	   The spotlight has also fallen, however, on aviation authorities
after they admitted that Surat Thani airport's instrument landing
system had been removed during renovation work several months ago.
	   That meant the pilot would have had to land based only on what
he could see of the runway, or possibly with radio navigation aids
less precise than an instrument landing system.
	   ILS systems make it possible for airliners to land in poor
visibility. Many airports lack ILS systems, but that limits the
kind of weather in which airliners can land safely.
	   Chamnong Sanarksorn, director of air navigation facilities at
Surat Thani airport, said all airlines had been informed about the
renovation work and absence of the ILS system.
	   He also refused to answer questions about reports that the air
traffic controller on duty during the crash, who has not been
produced by airport officials to answer reporters' questions, had
been ordered to take leave.
	   ``Because of the investigation, no one is supposed to tell you
anything,'' he said.
	   Chamnong said that, in any event, it was the pilot's decision
whether to try and land or fly to another airport where conditions
were better, and aviation experts agreed.
	   ``The pilot is always in charge,'' said an international
aviation authority executive, who spoke to The Associated Press
only on condition of anonymity.
	   While survivors faulted the pilot, they also praised Thai rescue
workers and volunteers who came to their aid in the moments after
the plane slammed into a flooded rubber plantation 700 meters (760
yards) from the airport runway.
	   ``The rescue workers were just great,'' said Melanie McNamee of
Australia.
	   She struggled free from the wreckage and pulled her friend,
Lucinda Rhodes, to safety moments before the jetliner caught fire.
	   Thai volunteers quickly arrived with stretchers to carry them
out of the swamp. Rhodes had suffered broken ribs and vertebrae.
	   Seven-year-old Apichart Petcharat, who is suffering from
leukemia, also was a hero during the ordeal.
	   Apichart pulled himself through a crack in the fuselage and
stumbled through the darkness to guide rescue workers toward his
family, Sawaporn Kongyongyuen, his aunt told ITV, an independent
television station.
	   Along with the boy's mother, she was caught in the twisted metal
of the plane.
	   ``I saw flashlights and ran to the rescue men, and they said
`Where's your Mom,' '' Apichart said.
	   Thai Airways President Thamnoon Wanglee also praised the efforts
of the rescue workers, pointing out there had been no reports of
passengers' valuables being looted, as has happened after several
air crashes in the region.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ By a slight majority, Puerto Ricans
rejected statehood and signaled a desire to retain their status as
a quasi-colony of the United States.
	   The vote reaffirmed a desire to retain U.S. citizenship and
federal aid, while enjoying some of the trappings of an independent
nation.
	   Final results gave 50.2 percent of votes to ``none of the
above'' _ the option adopted by the commonwealth party _ while
statehood had 46.5 percent, a trifle more than in a similar
non-binding referendum in 1993 when commonwealth beat out statehood
by 48.58 percent to 46.34 percent.
	   ``We have gone to the ballot boxes and said: `No, this country
is ours,'' said San Juan mayor Sila Calderon, a key statehood
opponent. ``We continue being Puerto Ricans forever.''
	   Voter Cesar Santiago, 72, agreed: ``I'm 100 percent American,
but I'm not a statehooder,'' he siad. ``We have to protect Puerto
Rico the way it is.''
	   It was a major blow to pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello, though
he dismissed ``none of the above'' votes, arguing his cause had won
because statehood supporters made up the vast majority of those who
chose among four options defined by Congress. Of the other three,
independence got 2.5 percent of votes, a ``free association'' form
of independence with U.S. treaty ties 0.3 percent and the official
territorial commonwealth choice just 0.1 percent.

``independentistas.'' About half of the 4.5 percent who voted for
independence in 1993 appeared to have given their vote to ``none of
the above.''
	   Nevertheless, Rossello said he would use his interpretation to
petition Congress to make Puerto Rico a state.
	   ``Today, the people spoke and they said statehood is the future
of Puerto Rico,'' Rossello told cheering supporters at a
victory-type rally with fireworks exploding into the sky, salsa and
merengue music blaring from speakers and food and drink flowing
liberally.
	   At the Two Brothers Bridge leading to the colonial old city of
San Juan, dozens of young voters who supported the two leading
options celebrated with equal verve, blocking the highway as they
hung out of cars with screeching horns, waving flags and banners
with campaign slogans.

held back statehood party secretary general Jose Aponte when he
attacked a car sporting commonwealth supporters with a stick. And
police broke up a confrontation between statehood and commonwealth
supporters as Rossello arrived at his party headquarters.
	   President Bill Clinton has asked Congress to abide by the result
of the referendum, but it was unclear what kind of message a ``none
of the above'' victory would send to Congress. Different
interpretations of the result likely will spark a bitter and
prolonged argument over interpretation, though most Puerto Ricans
appear to have made it clear they do not want to become the 51st
state, fearing it would erode their 400-year-old Hispanic culture
and that English would supplant Spanish. Seventy-one percent of 2.2
million registered voters cast ballots.
	   The commonwealth party had urged a ``none of the above'' vote
because it objected to the ballot's commonwealth description, which
was written by the statehood party and suggested Congress could
revoke Puerto Ricans' U.S. citizenship.
	   Pro-commonwealth Sen. Eudaldo Baez Galib countered, ``If they go
to Washington to petition for statehood ... they would be violating
the right to vote of the majority.''
	   Rossello called Sunday's referendum in hopes of persuading
Congress to end a colonial relationship that dates from the 1898
U.S. occupation of Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American War.
	   Rossello sought to present Congress with a mandate to pursue
statehood _ and eliminate what he calls Puerto Ricans' second-class
U.S. citizenship.
	   Noting that Congress has begun to question spending dlrs 10
billion a year in a territory that pays no federal taxes, he
insisted that statehood would raise the island's standard of living
and allow it to pay its fair share. Puerto Rico's per capita income
of dlrs 8,000 a year is half that of the poorest U.S. state,
Mississippi.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ By a slight majority, Puerto Ricans
rejected statehood and signaled a desire to retain their status as
a quasi-colony of the United States.
	   The vote reaffirmed a desire to retain U.S. citizenship and
federal aid, while enjoying some of the trappings of an independent
nation.
	   Final results gave 50.2 percent of votes to ``none of the
above'' _ the option adopted by the commonwealth party _ while
statehood had 46.5 percent, a trifle more than in a similar
non-binding referendum in 1993 when commonwealth beat out statehood
by 48.58 percent to 46.34 percent.
	   ``We have gone to the ballot boxes and said: `No, this country
is ours,'' said San Juan mayor Sila Calderon, a key statehood
opponent. ``We continue being Puerto Ricans forever.''
	   Voter Cesar Santiago, 72, agreed: ``I'm 100 percent American,
but I'm not a statehooder,'' he siad. ``We have to protect Puerto
Rico the way it is.''
	   It was a major blow to pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello, though
he dismissed ``none of the above'' votes, arguing his cause had won
because statehood supporters made up the vast majority of those who
chose among four options defined by Congress. Of the other three,
independence got 2.5 percent of votes, a ``free association'' form
of independence with U.S. treaty ties 0.3 percent and the official
territorial commonwealth choice just 0.1 percent.
	   The commonwealth party option appeared to get its edge from
``independentistas.'' About half of the 4.5 percent who voted for

Report: Indonesia's president ready for questioning over
</HEADLINE>
predecessor

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's President B.J. Habibie is
ready to be questioned by state lawyers investigating corruption
allegations against his predecessor ex-President Suharto, a news
report said Monday.
	   Newspaper Media Indonesia quoted State Secretary Minister Akbar
Tanjung as saying President B.J. Habibie is prepared to supply
information if requested.
	   ``As a former Research and Technology Minister, President B.J.
Habibie will definitely be ready to give a necessary explanation
regarding the investigation of former President Suharto by the
attorney general,'' Media Indonesia quoted Tanjung as saying.
	   Last Wednesday, ex-autocrat Suharto was questioned by state
prosecutors over allegations that he abused his power to enrich his
family and cronies during 32 years of authoritarian power.
	   Suharto quit office last May after a wave of riots and protests.
He has denied any wrong doing.
	   Habibie is a longtime friend of Suharto and had been a loyal
member of his Cabinet for 20 years.
	   State lawyers investigated Suharto soon after his resignation,
but said they failed to find any evidence against him.
	   Habibie ordered a new investigation be launched after a recent
wave of protests by students who have demanded that Suharto be put
on trial.

Puerto Rican voters rebuff statehood, affirm identity

 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By DAN PERRY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ In rebuffing U.S. statehood, Puerto
Ricans affirmed their distinct identity and fundamental
satisfaction with an in-between status that many here see as the
best of both worlds.
	   Sunday's vote, a blow for pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello,
underscored the obstacles to making a U.S. state out of a territory
whose residents largely see themselves as a nation and who prize
their Spanish language and Latino culture.
	   ``We have gone to the ballot boxes and said: `No, this country
is ours,''' said San Juan mayor Sila Calderon, the key statehood
opponent. ``We continue being Puerto Ricans forever. We want to
live as Puerto Ricans and die as Puerto Ricans.''
	   Formally, the winner in the nonbinding referendum was ``none of
the above,'' which outpolled statehood by 50.2 to 46.5 percent.
	   The commonwealth party had urged a ``none of the above'' vote
because it objected to the ballot's commonwealth description, which
was written by the statehood party and suggested Congress could
revoke Puerto Ricans' U.S. citizenship.
	   Rossello (pronounced Ro-SELL-io) refused to concede defeat,
arguing that most people who voted for an explicit option chose
statehood. ``In my interpretation this is a victory for
statehood,'' he said. His aides said he would employ that argument
in Washington.
	   But that will be an extremely hard sell to the U.S. Congress,
the body that has ultimate authority over Puerto Rico's status and
whose members want to see a supermajority of island voters favoring
statehood before moving on the problematic idea.
	   The depressing reality for statehooders is that Rossello's years
of crusading _ and even the federal government's dlrs 1.5 billion
aid package in the wake of September's Hurricane Georges _ failed
to persuade even half the people to vote for that option.
	   Simply put, Puerto Ricans value the advantages they have under
the commonwealth established in 1952: They are U.S. citizens who
can travel and work and live on the mainland _ but they also have
symbols of sovereignty like an Olympic team.
	   Statehooders say it's a colonial situation, because Puerto
Ricans have no vote for the U.S. President or Congress who can send
them to war.
	   Noting that Congress has begun to question spending dlrs 10
billion a year in a territory that pays no federal taxes, Rossello
also insisted that statehood would raise the island's standard of
living. Puerto Rico's per capita income of dlrs 8,000 a year is
half that of the poorest state, Mississippi.
	   But such arguments again failed to overcome fears about
statehood. Would English be imposed? Would their culture be overrun
by Americana? Would they end up paying more taxes?
	   The statehood campaign may have been undone by a strategy that
tried to persuade voters there was nothing unusual about a
Spanish-speaking U.S. state. Its TV ads said U.S. statehood would
in fact guarantee ``your flag, your language, your culture!''
	   President Clinton had asked Congress to abide by the result of
the referendum _ but that idea will now likely sink in a sea of
confusion and debate over the vote result.
	   In any case, there is certain to be tremendous opposition on
Capitol Hill to fully incorporating a territory where a majority
don't speak English, two-thirds earn too little to pay federal
taxes and where the privilege of statehood appears unable to muster
even a simple majority.
	   Statehooders' best hope for the future appears to be that one
day Congress will present their people with a stark choice of
statehood or independence _ as one radio caller put it, ``in or
out.''
	   That would likely yield a statehood majority, because Puerto
Ricans prize their U.S. citizenship.
	   The pro-commonwealth party did not support the commonwealth
option on the ballot primarily because it said islanders' U.S.
citizenship was ``statutory'' and thus potentially revocable.
	   One factor in the result appeared to be that about half of the
4.5 percent who supported independence in 1993 shifted their
support to ``none of the above'' this time around.
	   The commonwealth definition on the ballot and a fourth option
called ``free association''_ essentially independence with treaty
ties _ received only fractions of a percentage point.

India plans expressways to boost investors' confidence in economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The Indian government will set up a
special fund to finance the construction of expressways throughout
the country, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said Monday.
	   ``This integrated project has a tremendous potential for
employment generation,'' Vajpayee was quoted as saying by Dow Jones
News Wires at the inauguration of an International Congress on
Highways Development in India.
	   Surface Transport Minister M. Thambi Durai said his ministry
envisages spending 1.2 trillion rupees (dlrs 28 billion) to build
12,000 kilometers (7,500 miles) of expressway over the next 20
years.
	   The announcement comes at a time when India is battling an
economic slowdown with inflation around eight percent, exports
plummeting and a fiscal deficit of around six percent undermining
investor confidence.
	   The prime minister earlier this year announced a 7,000-kilometer
(4,375-mile) expressway would be built linking Kashmir in the north
to Kanyakumari in the south and Silchar in the east to Saurashtra
in the west of India. The government committee recommended merging
that project with an earlier proposal to connect India's four main
metropolitan cities.
	   Vajpayee is scheduled to launch work on the project later this
month in the southern city of Bangalore.
	   India's road network is in such poor condition that
manufacturers routinely complain they cannot get export goods from
factories to ports in time to meet deadlines.
	   Only 2 percent of the 162,000 kilometers (101,250 miles) of
state and national highways in India are four-lane and only 34
percent two-lane, according to a survey by the Bombay Chamber of
Commerce. The majority _ 64 percent _ are just one lane. Only about
half are paved.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Turmoil in the Indian parliament Monday
delayed an attempt to debate a bill setting aside a third of the
chamber's seats for women.
	   The governing coalition had planned to table the bill Monday
morning, but just a few minutes into the session, Speaker G.M.C.
Balayogi was forced to temporarily adjourn because of angry shouts
from two dozen lawmakers protesting against a woman colleague who
had scuffled with one of the bill's opponents last week. The
afternoon session was also adjourned because of a similar
disruption.
	   Monday's protesters said Mamata Banerjee should be expelled from
parliament because of her actions Friday, when she grabbed at the
clothing of another lawmaker to try to stop him from joining a
protest against the bill that ended with another early adjournment.
Two other attempts in July to introduce the bill also failed amid
scuffling and shouting.
	   With emotions running so high, it is doubtful the women's quota
bill will ever even be officially debated, let alone put to a vote.

Australia tightens its grip on the Ashes

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ England's hopes of salvaging a draw
and keep afloat the Ashes dream gradually faded away as Australia
tightened its grip on the third cricket test at the Adelaide Oval
Monday.
	   England slumped to 122 for four in the face of a record
fourth-innings total after Australia set 443 runs to win in a
minimum of 140 overs over four
	   sessions.
	   Australia is just six wickets away from treasuring the Ashes for
a record
	   sixth consecutive time and taking an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the
five-match series.
	   Nasser Hussain and Mark Ramprakash, first-innings' batting
heroes, stood temporarily between Australia and another meek
English capitulation with a 89-run stand.
	   But off spinner Colin Miller (3-36) produced two decisive blows,
removing Hussain and night watchman Dean Headley (2) in his 13th
over.
	   England, at 120 for two, lost two wickets in four balls.
	   The third-wicket pair came together after the two openers _ Mark
Butcher and Mike Atherton _ were dismissed in the space of 10
deliveries 15 minutes before the tea break.
	   Skipper Mark Taylor surprisingly prolonged his declaration till
40 minutes after lunch after a classic Michael Slater century had
propped Australia to 278 for five.
	   Australia's 315 for six against England in 1901-02 remains the
only time a team has scored over 300 runs to win a test in
Adelaide.
	   Batting became increasingly difficult on a spinning pitch
producing disconcerting bounce. While leg spinner Stuart MacGill
turned the deliveries square, balls from Glenn McGrath and Damien
Fleming kept low at the Cathedral End.
	   MacGill was the chief destroyer in England's 7-40 collapse in
the first innings with 4-53.
	   After successfully negotiating 12 overs, lefthander Butcher
sparred at Damien Fleming and under-edged a catch to wicketkeeper
Ian Healy.
	   Miller got one of his off-breaks to explode of the rough and
Atherton lobbed a simple catch to Mark Waugh at silly point.
	   Ramprakash was 43 not out and an out-of-form Alec Stewart was
yet to face a delivery.
	   Slater, 74 overnight, raced to his sixth Ashes century in 14
tests before
	   being trapped leg before by Darren Gough while both Justin
Langer and Waugh hit half-centuries.
	   Slater's 103 was his second hundred of the series. He scored 113
in the second innings in the drawn first test in Brisbane. He hit
eight fours and a six in his 4 1-2 hours at the crease.
	   Langer batted for another 227 minutes to score 52 runs and
shared a 134-run stand for the second wicket in three hours with
Slater, who faced 191 balls. (djp)

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ India's cricketers showed some
character for the first time on tour when they clawed their way
into a strong position on the third day of their four-day match
against Wellington at the Basin Reserve on Monday.
	   India should complete a morale-boosting win Tuesday when it
resumes on 30
	   for one in their second innings, needing to reach 174 for
victory.
	   India turned the game around after trailing Wellington by 49
runs on the first innings by rolling the home side for 124 in their
second innings.
	   After losing their tour opener against Central Districts in
Napier by seven wickets, India badly need a win with the first test
against New Zealand starting in Dunedin on Friday.
	   Saurav Ganguly led the comeback on Monday morning when his 93
helped India improve from their overnight 219 for seven to 268 all
out.
	   The Indian bowling attack, minus medium-fast bowler Javagal
Srinath because of a minor elbow injury, then strangled the
Wellington batsmen. (djp)

Siberian power company threatens to cut off debtors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Siberian power company threatened to cut off
heat and electricity to all debtors, including the army and the
police, saying it was receiving barely one-third of the money
needed to operate.
	   Yevgeny Belov, director-general of Omskenergo in the southern
Siberian region of Omsk, said the company was running low on coal
supplies and couldn't afford to purchase more, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   The company needs about 70 million rubles (dlrs 3.5 million) a
month to pay for coal, gas and fuel oil, but is collecting no more
than 25 million rubles (dlrs 1.3 million) from consumers.
	   Temperatures remain below freezing for months at a time during
the Siberian winter, but the company said it cannot afford to
continue supplying heat and electricity to customers who aren't
paying their bills.
	   Power companies across Russia face similar problems, but
traditionally they have refrained to cutting off services to
debtors, particularly in the winter months.
	   With Russia in the midst of an economic crisis this winter, one
of its most urgent problems is guaranteeing adequate heat and
electricity supplies, particularly to more remote regions.
	   Many places in the Russian Far East are low on fuel supplies,
including Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the main city on the Kamchatka
peninsula, which has suffered several power cuts already this
winter.
	   Fuel deliveries Sunday allowed engineers to restore electrical
power throughout the city on Monday, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   But existing fuel supplies and those expected to be delivered
this week will only last until the end of the month, the report
said.

	   WOODBURN, Ore. (AP) _ Growing up as a Russian Old Believer,
Kalin Ayhan learned that preserving his religion came above all.
	   Their centuries-old Christian orthodox rituals and their way of
life, transported from pre-Communist Russia to Turkey to the United
States, were sovereign.
	   It often meant working on a farm or in furniture factories. It
meant socializing and marrying within the Old Believer community.
It meant men didn't shave.
	   It certainly didn't mean becoming a police officer. But 4{ years
ago, Ayhan became the first Old Believer on the Woodburn police
force. Today, the 29-year-old patrols the streets of this Portland
suburb, an ideological world away from where he grew up.
	   The simple choice of shaving his beard has made him something of
an outcast.
	   He cannot be an active member of his church without his beard,
and was able to marry in his church only because his supervisors
gave him permission to temporarily grow it.
	   ``Some people just hate the idea that one of their own is
policing,'' Ayhan said.
	   From a community that started settling here in the 1960s and
remains largely closed to retain its identity, Ayhan chose a job
that put him in the thick of one of Oregon's most diverse
communities.
	   The town is part agricultural, part retirement community and
part growing freeway interchange with strong Latino and Russian
influences.
	   There are longtime Pentecostal Russians and newer Soviet
Russians as well. They have a language in common but differ in
their religious beliefs and on whether to ``Americanize.''
	   In January, Ayhan will receive one of six annual awards from the
Woodburn Human Rights Commission for people who bridge cultures in
the community.
	   Ayhan was born here but spoke little English when he showed up
for first grade in 1976. He and the other Russian-speaking children
were grouped in a classroom with a bilingual teacher.
	   At home, he was admonished not to speak English by parents
worried he would forget his language.
	   Ayhan's father unknowingly sparked his interest in police work.
	   ``My dad had a lot of respect for the police and whenever we
would travel, my dad would point out that the police are good
people and they're there to help,'' Ayhan said.
	   As a teen-ager, Ayhan landed a job pumping gasoline at a
convenience store owned by former Marion County Sheriff Robert
Prinslow, who was running for office. He encouraged the teen to
pursue his interest in police work.
	   At 18, Ayhan enlisted in the U.S. Army with a plan: He would be
a military policeman.
	   A recruiter picked him up at his house. His parents cried. Ayhan
hugged his mom and rode away. That night, for the first time, he
shaved. There wasn't much to shave, some peach fuzz and a little
mustache.
	   After four years in the military, traveling to 25 countries,
Ayhan returned to Oregon.
	   He put himself through community college while working as a bank
security guard, then applied to the Woodburn Police Department.
	   ``As hard as it is to be a police officer, it's probably twice
as hard in Woodburn because of cultural and language barriers,'' he
said.
	   The department figures it will be hard to keep him because of
demand for his bilingual and bicultural background.
	   He figures his parents are proud, although ``they would more
likely to be more happy with me in a career that would allow me to
practice the religion.''
	   Once he returned to Woodburn, he renewed an acquaintance with
Mary Lisoff, an Old Believer. When they decided to marry, she
wanted a wedding within the culture. That required Ayhan to be an
active member of the church. That required a beard.
	   The department, which bans beards so they cannot be grabbed by
suspects, let him grow one, and the day before the October 1995
wedding, he was let back into the church.
	   About four months later, he shaved it again.
	   ``That was the hardest time for me,'' he said. ``My parents were
really, really disappointed. It started all over again, as far as
getting away from the religion and such.''
	   Mary Ayhan, a former volunteer firefighter, decided she wanted a
career. Now, she's a parole-probation officer with the Marion
County Juvenile Department.
	   Kalin Ayhan long ago abandoned traditional Russian dress. His
Russian accent is barely detectable.
	   He still loves his culture. But what he hopes to pass along to
his children will be the language and what he knows about his
family's struggle to preserve a religious way of life.
	   ``I'm not accepted in the church because of my appearance,'' he
said. ``Appearance seems to be more important than conduct.''

Darsha dashes to gold as Sri Lanka gets double
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Sri Lankan sprinters Damayanthi Darsha
and Sugath Tillekeratne gave their country its first Asian Games
gold medals since 1974 with a double blast Monday.
	   Darsha won the women's 400 meters, giving Sri Lanka its first
gold since her coach Sunil Gumawardeme was a member of the 1974
4x100-meter relay team.
	   ``This is the first time that Sri Lanka has won a gold medal in
24 years,'' Darsha said. ``I am extremely happy, not only because I
have won the gold but it was my coach who had won the last gold in
1974.''
	   Darsha had the field under her control after the opening 100 and
cruised down the final straight, crossing the line in 51.57. In
contrast to the comfortable run by the Asian champion, China's Chen
Yuxiang battled home with a face covered in pain to get silver in
52.50. Bronze went to Svetlana Bodritskaya (53.00) of Kazakstan
while veteran Indian P.T. Usha was sixth in 54.37.
	   Tillekeratne had to work harder to win the men's 400 in 44.99,
overcoming a strong challenge by Ibrahim Faraj of Qatar, who
clocked 45.32 after easing up near the line. India's Paramjit Singh
got the bronze.
	   Eleven of the 43 track and field gold medals were on offer in
Monday's packed program, including those in the glamor 100-meter
event. But the late afternoon session was largely ignored by the
public, with only about 5,000 people in the 20,000-capacity main
stadium.
	   Earlier, China's Liu Hongyu, fourth at last year's world
championships, was unchallenged to win the women's 10-kilometer
walk.
	   Liu finished the road race in 43 minutes, 57.28 seconds,
comfortably ahead of Japan's Rie Mitsumori (44:29.82) and
Kazakstan's Svetlana Tolstaya (45:29.95).
	   Liu, who has a best of 42:38.00, said she never felt threatened
Monday.
	   ``If they pushed me hard, the time might have been faster,'' Liu
said.
	   Liu's teammate Li Yuxin, gold medalist in the Asian
championships in July, was disqualified two kilometers from the
finish after receiving a third warning.
	   ``I have nothing to say,'' Li said. ``I can only say that I
should perfect my technique in future.''
	   The race was the final women's walk event over 10 kilometers.
International meets are changing to 20 kilometers next year.
	   Liu said she would cope with the decision.
	   ``I will be more confident of winning the longer race,'' Liu
said.

Hodler appears to back off Sydney claims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Senior International Olympic Committee
member Marc Hodler appears to have backed off claims that Sydney
illegally bought votes to win its bid to host the 2000 Olympics.
	   Hodler sent the IOC into its biggest scandal since Canadian
sprinter Ben Johnson tested positive for steroids 10 years ago when
he claimed on Saturday that four agents _ including one IOC member
_ had been involved in vote-buying for the past 12 to 15 years for
bidding cities.
	   Australian IOC member Phil Coles said Hodler had later
acknowledged he had been ``way off target'' in alleging that Sydney
had paid for votes.
	   Hodler, an 80-year-old Swiss lawyer, said Monday that agents
claimed that votes had been bought on behalf of bidding cities.
	   ``We believe that the agents are the real villains, the crooks,
the corrupters, not the cities,'' he told Australian Broadcasting
Corp. radio.
	   ``I know that Sydney claims to have been resisting the offers or
the blackmails from the agencies, I don't know, I never said this
was not true ... but the agents claim they have corrupted all
cities.
	   ``I don't know anything about Sydney, I only know that Sydney
very firmly says they never did anything against the existing
rules.''
	   This contradicted the position he took on Saturday, when he
said: ``I can't imagine that Sydney is different from the others.
Sydney pretends it is completely clean, clean, clean.''
	   Coles said that Hodler had backed down on his earlier
suggestions that the Sydney bid committee had been involved in
bribery.
	   ``He said he never said Sydney was involved, he just wondered
how they escaped the temptations,'' said Coles.
	   ``That was the nearest to an apology we are going to get.''
	   ``There probably is a need for a change. It has been changed
over the years and it's pretty strictly controlled at the moment.''
	   ``I don't know how you stop it. It's a huge prize for the city
that won and when there is a lot at stake there is a lot of savage
disappointment.''
	   Sallyanne Atkinson, who was heavily involved in Brisbane's bid
to host the 1992 Games, Melbourne's campaign for 1996 and Sydney's
successful bid for 2000, said she was aware of lavish gifts being
given as part of the process to decide the host cities.
	   Atkinson said gifts including offers of holidays, entertainment
and ``sometimes material things'' were part of the way the system
operated and the ``wining and dining'' was often lavish.
	   But she claimed she never saw money change hands in an underhand
fashion. (djp)

Hyundai sends 50 cars to North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's Hyundai business group
sent 50 passenger cars worth dlrs 540,000 to North Korea Monday as
part of its payment for a tourism project in the North.
	   The cars were sent through the heavily armed border village of
Panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone that separates the two
Koreas.
	   The shipment preceded a scheduled visit to the North by
Hyundai's owner, Chung Ju-yung, on Tuesday. The visit, Chung's
third this year, is to discuss tourism and other business deals in
the communist country.
	   Chung visited his native North Korea with a gift of 1001 cattle
in June and October and received approval for several business
deals, including sightseeing tours of scenic Diamond Mountain on
the North's east coast.
	   About 5,700 South Koreans have visited the mountain by cruise
ship since the tours began on Nov. 18.
	   In return for the right to organize the tours, Hyundai must pay
North Korea dlrs 906 million over the next six years. The cars were
sent as part of the payment.
	   During this week's visit, Chung will follow up other joint
venture projects agreed on earlier, including a thermal power
plant, a car assembly plant and an industrial park, Hyundai
officials said.

Libyan TV: Russian Communist chief condemns sanctions on Libya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Russian Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov is in Libya to enhance cooperation between the two
countries, Libyan television reported.
	   Zyuganov arrived in Tripoli Sunday at the invitation of Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi, said the TV report late Sunday. He is
expected to meet with leaders of the General People's Congress, or
Parliament.
	   Zyuganov called for the lifting of U.N. sanctions that were
imposed on Libya in 1992 to force it to hand over two suspects in
the bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Scotland.
	   He ``condemned the unjust measures,'' saying they contravened
all international values and principles, said the Libyan TV report
which was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   The General People's Congress, which has been meeting since last
Tuesday, is expected to decide on the fate of the two Libyans.
	   Libya has accepted in principle to a trial of the two suspects
before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands. But the
handover of the men has been held up because of Libya's demand for
a guarantee that the two men, if convicted, will be jailed in
Libya.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects serve
their prison term in Britain.
	   Some 270 people were killed on board and on ground when the
jetliner blew up over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on Dec. 21,
1988.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Sri Lanka went 24 years without an
Asian Games gold medal. Then sprinters Damayanthi Darsha and Sugath
Tillekeratne gave it two within less than an hour Monday.
	   The island nation had won its first medal of these games, a
bronze in yachting, on Sunday.
	   Then Darsha won the women's 400 meters in 51.57 seconds,
comfortably ahead of China's Chen Yuxiang, who struggled to a 52.50
finish. P.T. Usha, India's star before retiring eight years ago,
finished sixth in 54.37 in a return to the track.
	   In the next race, Tillekeratne held off Qatar's Ibrahim Faraj in
the men's 400, winning 44.99 to 45.32.
	   ``This is the first time that Sri Lanka has won a gold medal in
24 years,'' Darsha said. ``I am extremely happy, not only because I
have won the gold but it was my coach who had won the last gold in
1974.''
	   Coach Sunil Gumawardeme was a member of the 1974 winning
4x100-meter relay team.
	   China's Liu Hongyu, fourth at last year's world championships,
won the women's 10-kilometer walk in 43 minutes, 57.28 seconds, and
said she might have gone faster if her rivals had put up more
challenge.
	   Japan's Rie Mitsumori took silver in 44:29.82, while China's Li
Yuxin, gold medalist in the Asian championships in July, was
disqualified two kilometers from the finish after receiving a third
warning.
	   Liu's was China's 80th gold of these games.
	   South Korea stood second with 37 after South Korean cyclist Ji
Sung-hwan beat Olympic bronze medalist Takanobu Jumonji of Japan in
the men's 1-kilometer time trial. Ji won in 1 minute, 5.406
seconds. Jumonji, who turned in a 1:03.261 at the Atlanta Olympics,
could make only 1:07.011 Monday.
	   Japan gained its 32nd gold when Miya Tachibana, the world
championship bronze medalist, won the solo synchronized swimming.
	   Tachibana scored 98.400 in her free routine, worth 65 percent of
the total score, for a final score of 97.933. South Korea's Choi
Yoo-jin won silver with 95.850.
	   Meanwhile, the Thais, who take numbers seriously were
celebrating winning their 13th gold medal of the 13th Asian Games
on Sunday _ Dec. 13.
	   Their original target had been 10 golds at their home games.
Their best previous was 12 at the 1966 games in Bangkok.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Only South Korea's Lee Hyung-taik had
to struggle Monday as Korea, Japan, India and Uzbekistan each put
two men in tennis quarterfinals at the Asian Games.
	   Lee served 12 aces and converted four of six break points on his
way to a 7-6 (7-2), 2-6, 6-0 victory over Taiwan's Lin Bing-chao.
He was joined in the quarterfinals by teammate Yoon Yong-il, a 6-3,
6-3 winner over Iran's Ramin Raziani.
	   India's best hope, Leander Paes, who stands 91st in the ATP
rankings, had to drop out of the games with an injury. He was the
only Asian in the rankings' top 100.
	   But India still gained quarterfinal places when Mahesh Bhupathi
beat Bryan Junio of the Philippines 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, and Srinath
Prahlad ousted Taiwan's Chen Wei-ju 6-4, 7-5.
	   For Japan, Satoshi Iwabuchi beat Qatar's Sultan Al-Awai 6-0,
6-1, and Takahiro Terachi defeated Thailand's Paradorn Srichaphan,
Thailand, 6-1, 6-3
	   Uzbekistan's quarterfinalists are Oleg Ogorodov, a 6-3, 6-4
winner over Thailand's Danai Udomchoke, and Vadim Kutsenko, a 6-0,

Line between eligibles and pros further obscured

 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Now that Michelle Kwan and Alexei Yagudin are
world champions on both figure skating levels, maybe it's time for
some unification in the sport.
	   Kwan and Yagudin, who won the world titles for Olympic-eligible
skaters in April, added the World Professional Figure Skating
Championships crowns on Saturday. They took advantage of the
sanctioning of 10 open events by the International Skating Union,
which runs eligible-level skating.
	   Now they head back to such events as their national
championships and the other worlds.
	   Is all of this necessary?
	   ``It's a nice idea for amateur and professional skaters to
compete together,'' said the 18-year-old Yagudin, who was ill at
the Nagano Olympics and finished fifth. ``I liked it very much and
would do it again.''
	   Kwan, the biggest star in the sport now that Tara Lipinski has
gone the tour route and is being held out of the significant
professional competitions, admitted to being somewhat in awe of the
skaters surrounding her.
	   ``If the roof came down, the whole history of figure skating
would come down with it,'' Kwan said of being on the ice with
Katarina Witt, Oksana Baiul, Yuka Sato, Lu Chen and Nicole Bobek.
	   ``I had the chills in the warmup today. I looked at Oksana and
saw her '94 performance at the Olympics and Katarina and saw her at
the Olympics, and Lulu at worlds ... It was like a flashback. I saw
all their performances right before my eyes.''
	   What fans would like to see is not something akin to the tennis
tours, with several events on different continents each weekend.
When viewers turn on the television set and see a figure skating
competition, they'd like to have an idea just what that event means
and who is in it? Was it created for television, or does it have a
history?
	   ``Where are all the skaters at the top going to go and where are
the new skaters coming up going to go?'' asked James Disbrow,
president of the U.S. Figure Skating Association. ``The ISU is the
father figure, if you will, the leading organization. It has
provided to date all of the significant events all these skaters
are in.
	   ``But it isn't about the strongest federation or not wanting to
hurt ISU relationships, but to have a look at how we will work this
together.
	   ``It's the entertainers vs. the competitors, and how do we blend
this together? We're trying to do it, but it's been a tough year.
	   ``I'm worried we are going to dilute ourselves.''
	   The skaters, like the public, would benefit from some sort of
reorganization. So would the ISU, and so would the professional
tours.
	   Disbrow believes the sport has six months to make some concrete
plans for the future. The ISU already has its Grand Prix series and
the world championships. But the Grand Prix was watered down this
year by the open competitions, particularly with Kwan skating only
in the pro-ams.
	   Nearly every professional skater isn't interested in returning
to a series of events conducted under ISU rules, in which quads for
the men and multiple triple jumps for the women are a necessity.
Those pros are far removed from the jumping-jack world that leads
to the Olympics.
	   But they do like the idea of measuring themselves against the
Kwans and Yagudins in a setting where artistry, skating maturity
and entertainment value are paramount.
	   ``I believe all of the skating world is in somewhat of a
dilemma,'' Disbrow said. ``The key factor is the eligible and
ineligible skaters and how all of this interplays. Nobody has a
hardcore answer at this moment.''

Report: Prominent Chinese dissident plans to visit Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Exiled Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng
said he wants to visit Taiwan to urge its people not to abandon
their mainland brethren while searching for a separate island
identity, Taipei's state-run news agency reported Monday.
	   In an interview in Paris with the Central News Agency, Wei
praised Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui for his ``New Taiwanese''
campaign to promote solidarity between native-born Taiwanese and
those who fled to the island from mainland China in 1949.
	   Lee's concept narrowed the ethnic divide and led to the ruling
Nationalist Party's wins in national and mayoral elections early
this month, Wei said.
	   But Wei said the assertion of a separate Taiwanese identity
should not become a barrier to eventual reunification with the
motherland.
	   ``As new Taiwanese, they don't have to stress that they are no
longer Chinese, especially when their mainland brothers are still
suffering,'' Wei was quoted as saying.
	   ``They must not cause their mainland compatriots despair nor
incite a war that could bring destruction to themselves.
	   ``We share the same culture and our futures are intertwined.
Taiwan should offer its assistance to mainlanders struggling for
democracy,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Wei Jingsheng led the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement in China.
He spent all but six months of the next 18 years in prison until he
was released late last year and sent into exile.
	   The report said Wei plans to visit Taiwan early next year. He
visited Paris to attend activities marking the 50th anniversary of
the signing of the United Nations human rights charter, it said.
	   In Paris, Wei has called for an alliance of human rights
associations to pressure for democratic and political reforms in
Asia's remaining autocratic countries, the agency said.

Former cricket star accuses government of smear campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Former cricket star Imran Khan accused
the government Monday of conducting a smear campaign against him
and his wife, Jemima Khan, the daughter of the late British
millionaire James Goldsmith.
	   Khan also promised to sue the Pakistani custom authorities for
tarnishing his wife's name alleging that she was trying to smuggle
antique tiles out of the country.
	   Ms. Khan was sending more than 300 Iranian tiles to her mother
in Britain when customs authorities last week seized the package.
	   ``We will challenge the customs authority in court because they
politicized the issue under pressure from the government,'' he told
a news conference in the southern port city. He said the government
is behind accusations against his wife in an attempt to smear his
name.
	   Khan, cricketer turned politician, has been openly critical of
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government accusing it of widespread
corruption and nepotism.
	   Khan blasted customs officials who notified local newspapers
that his wife's shipment to Britain had been confiscated, alleging
she was trying to export antiquities from Pakistan, a crime that
carries a fine or jail sentence or both.
	   ``Without first verifying whether they were antiquities or not
they gave it to the press,'' he said.
	   Khan also said customs officials originally charged that his
wife had taken the tiles from the site of a Muslim shrine, a charge
he vehemently denied.
	   ``They are Iranian tiles that are openly sold in the market,''
he said.
	   His wife's tiles have been sent to the archeological department
to determine their age and Khan said he will wait for the report
before going ahead with charges.
	   He said his wife bought the tiles in the federal capital of
Islamabad and had a certificate from the storekeeper that the tiles
were not antiques.

Japanese stocks close lower, dollar falls against yen in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with late dollar, bond, other details.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Concerns about Japan's economic outlook caused by
the nationalization of a major bank and new data revealing eroding
business confidence pushed Tokyo stock lower Monday. The U.S.
dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 294.02 points,
or 2.04 percent, to close at 14,111.62 for a third straight day of
losses. On Friday, the average fell 402.16 points, or 2.72 percent.
	   The dollar bought 115.62 yen in late afternoon trading, down
1.66 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
level of 116.42 yen Friday.
	   Led down by bank shares, Japanese stocks slid amid rekindled
fears of instability in the bad-debt-ridden banking system after
the government took over ailing lender Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. on
Sunday, traders said.
	   The compulsory nationalization of Nippon Credit marked the
second time a top lender has come under state control in less than
two months. The government took over the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd. on Oct. 23.
	   Share prices of all of Japan's 17 largest banks declined,
despite Financial Reconstruction Minister Hakuo Yanagisawa's
assurances Sunday that he was aware of no other banks that were
close to insolvency.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 17.85 points, or 1.60 percent, to 1,100.31
points. The TOPIX closed down 21.62 points, 1.90 points, on Friday.
	   The market was also weighed down by worse-than-expected results
from a closely-watched quarterly Bank of Japan survey tracking
business sentiment.
	   The report showed that confidence at small and medium-sized
Japanese companies had fallen to a record low.
	   ``There weren't any sectors to buy, and players can only hope
public and pension funds will support the market,'' said Kunihiro
Hatae, general manager at Tokyo Securities Co.
	   A slide in U.S. stock prices on Friday also spooked investors,
traders said.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 19.82 points on Friday
to close the week at 8,821.76.
	   An estimated 306 million shares changed hands on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 787.29 million
Friday. Declines outnumbered advances 872 to 295, while 147 issues
were unchanged.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar lost ground
against the yen amid mounting concern over an impending vote in the
U.S. Congress on articles of impeachment against President Bill
Clinton, traders said.
	   Worry over the direction of the American economy also weighed on
the U.S. currency, they said.
	   ``The uncertainty surrounding the impeachment proceedings will
depress the dollar,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of
foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank in Tokyo. ``And the outlook for
the U.S. economy is getting worse because of falling commodity
prices,'' he added.
	   The U.S. House or Representatives was scheduled to begin debate
Thursday on four impeachment articles.
	   The dollar ranged between 115.55 yen and 116.82 yen in trading
Monday in Tokyo.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.270 percent from 1.160 percent on Friday,
pushing its price down to 104.49 yen from Friday's 105.47 yen.

No. 13 proves golden for Thais at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Thais planning party; new to some points &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thirteen has proved a lucky number for
Thailand, where millions swear by the numbers.
	   At the 13th Asian Games Sunday _ Dec. 13 _ the hosts reached
their record number of gold medals _ 13.
	   Thailand's best previous performance at Asia's version of the
Olympics was 12 gold at the 1966 Games in Bangkok. Before the
current event started, Thai sports officials had targeted just 10
golds.
	   The Thais, including political leaders, are great believers in
numerology and frequently make decisions based on numbers.
	   With a record number of golds already assured, the government on
Monday scheduled a celebration for its athletes on Dec. 21, the day
after the games' closing, at Government House.
	   It also announced a Christmas Day party by Deputy Prime Minister
Bhichai Rattakul, chairman of the games' organizing committee, for
other committee members to celebrate the games' success.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TRASHY ART: Spectators at the Asian Games are being asked to
throw trash into art.
	   To recycle some of the 70 tons of rubbish discarded daily at one
of the major sports complexes, four plastic sculptures are being
used as mega-garbage cans.
	   Encouraged by free gifts, fans at the Thammasat Sports Complex
are urged to toss empty aluminum cans into the sculptures for
recycling. Additionally, the Asian Games rubbish contractors employ
600 people just to keep the one complex clean.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TUK-TUK THREAT: Drivers of Bangkok's noisy, fume-belching but
beloved ``tuk-tuk'' taxis are threatening to strand athletes and
officials at the Asian Games.
	   Some 70 drivers of the three-wheeled, open-sided vehicles were
hired to shuttle games' participants at the Thammasat Sports
Complex, one of the major games centers.
	   They first went on strike before the games started Dec. 6
because they had not been paid their promised daily allowance of
300 baht (dlrs 8) even though they had been working since November.
	   Now, about 20 of the drivers have gone home while the rest are
threatening to strike again. They don't trust organizers to honor
the contract since the last payment is not due until Dec. 23 when
the games will have finished.
	   Negotiations are under way.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TICKETLESS THAIS: Thais scouring for hard-to-get tickets to
watch their soccer team play at the Asian Games have turned to
touts, who in turn are being rounded up by police.
	   Authorities arrested about 70 people selling black market
tickets to Saturday's match between Thailand and Qatar, sometimes
asking for 300 percent over the official price.
	   Ticketless Thais scaled fences and hurled bottles, cans and
shoes at police when they could't buy tickets to Saturday's game,
which Qatar won 2-1. Despite the loss, the Thais reached the
quarterfinals anyway.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ An moderate earthquake with a 4.3
magnitude shook the Aures Mountains on Monday about 500 kilometers
(300 miles) east of Algiers, the national geophysics institute
said.
	   A communique from the Center for Research in Astronomy,
Astrophysics and Geophysics did not say whether the quake caused
any injuries or damage.
	   The epicenter of the quake, which occurred at 1:40 a.m. (0140
GMT), was located 60 kilometers southwest of the town of Batna, the
geophysics institute said.
	   An earthquake with a 4 magnitude can cause moderate damage.

Netanyahu seeks delay on next Israeli West Bank withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-Mideast &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is standing
pat.
	   Despite the presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton and a major
Palestinian concession, the Israeli leader says he is not ready to
carry out the next phase of withdrawal, which was set for later
this week.
	   He is demanding that further obligations be fulfilled by the
Palestinians.
	   What Netanyahu really needs is time _ a delay of at least a week
and probably two or three. He is seeking breathing space so that he
can weather the latest political crisis in his shaky coalition
which has little love for the Clinton-brokered Wye River
land-for-security agreement.
	   Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Netanayahu, confirmed the need for
a delay in an interview Monday and said the Israeli leader had
raised the issue with Clinton.
	   But he said the reason was not domestic Israeli politics but to
make sure that the Palestinians fulfilled their obligations under
accord negotiated at Wye River, Maryland, with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in Washington.
	   ``There's no definite time, but you can say a delay _ a week,
two weeks, a month, so that Israel will be able to check and
monitor whether the Palestinians fulfilled their obligations,''
Bushinsky told The Associated Press.
	   He listed a number of things the Palestinians needed to do in
addition to affirming in a vote Monday that anti-Israel provisions
in the Palestinian charter had been eliminated.
	   These included collecting illegal weapons from militant groups
like Hamas, halting incitement over the issue of freeing
Palestinian prisoners and stopping violent protests in the West
Bank.
	   In one week's time, Netanyahu must resume a political fight in
the 120-member Knesset, which came close to voting for new
elections a few days before Clinton's visit.
	   If he adheres to the Wye summit timetable for the next West Bank
withdrawal, he will lose key members of the right-wing coalition
and risk being thrown out of office.
	   Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon spoke openly of new elections with
a U.S. delegation that accompanied Clinton and which includes
influential members of Congress and Clinton's Cabinet. But Sharon
said if there was an election campaign further pullbacks would have
to be halted for six months.
	   Natan Sharansky, head of a Russian immigrant party and minister
of trade and industry in Netanyahu's Cabinet, has a different
vision: a national unity government with the dovish Labor Party,
which supports further West Bank pullbacks.
	   Forming such a government, however, will also need time _ weeks
at least, during which the peace process would be on the back
burner.
	   If Netanyahu is to survive the crisis with his current six-party
coalition, he needs to be able to point to a major change in
Palestinian behavior.
	   With his right-wing core constituency in mind, Netanyahu told a
gathering Sunday night that he wanted to see an ``education for
peace'' in which Palestinians dropped their anti-Israel rhetoric
and sought reconciliation.
	   Hemi Shalev, a commentator writing the daily Maariv, said
Netanyahu ``prefers to save himself'' in the current situation and
that Clinton was in no position to pressure Israel in view of the
impeachment crisis in Washington.
	   ``Netanyahu, a talented short-distance runner, is calculating
that in the near future the president will not have the time nor
the desire to deal with those stubborn people in the Middle East,''
he said.
	   As a result, Netanyahu will likely be able to get a majority in
his 18-member Cabinet for further delaying implementation of the
Wye agreement. He would thus prevent defections that would endanger
his future in the no-confidence vote in the Knesset next Monday.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's Hyundai business group
sent 50 passenger cars worth dlrs 540,000 to North Korea Monday as
part of its payment for a tourism project in the North.
	   The cars were sent through the heavily armed border village of
Panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone that separates the two
Koreas.
	   The shipment preceded a scheduled visit to the North by
Hyundai's owner, Chung Ju-yung, on Tuesday. The visit, Chung's
third this year, is to discuss tourism and other business deals in
the communist country.
	   Chung visited his native North Korea with a gift of 1001 cattle
in June and October and received approval for several business
deals, including sightseeing tours of scenic Diamond Mountain on
the North's east coast.
	   About 5,700 South Koreans have visited the mountain by cruise
ship since the tours began on Nov. 18.
	   In return for the right to organize the tours, Hyundai must pay
North Korea dlrs 906 million over the next six years. The cars were
sent as part of the payment.
	   During this week's visit, Chung will follow up other joint
venture projects agreed on earlier, including a thermal power
plant, a car assembly plant and an industrial park, Hyundai
officials said.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ State-run Korea Electric Power Corp.
said Monday it has signed a contract to sell used thermal power
generating facilities to a U.S. company for dlrs 28.2 million.
	   The deal calls for IBC Turbine Inc. to take over four gas
turbines, one steam turbine and related facilities at a heavy
oil-fired plant in Youngwol, 170 kilometers (100 miles) southeast
of Seoul.
	   The 300,000-kilowatt power plant was built in 1978 and has been
generating electricity for household and industrial use. The Korean
state utility stopped plant operation in March to build a new power
plant there.
	   IBC plans to move the facilities to the United States where it
will remodel and sell them.
	   Based in Houston, Texas, IBC Turbine specializes in renovating
power plants.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hurt by a severe credit crunch and prolonged
economic slump, business confidence at Japan's recession-hit small
and medium-sized manufacturers has fallen to a record low, the Bank
of Japan said Monday.
	   In a closely-watched quarterly report on business sentiment, the
central bank said sentiment had deteriorated in the past three
months to minus 60, down from minus 57 in September and the lowest
level since its ``tankan'' survey was begun in 1967.
	   The influential survey measures the percentage of firms seeing
business conditions improve minus the percentage seeing conditions
worsen.
	   Confidence at major Japanese manufacturers also continued to
erode, falling to a lower-than-expected minus 56 _ the worst since
February 1994 when it hit the same level, the Bank of Japan said.
	   Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a slight
deterioration, to minus 53, in the central bank's latest poll of
9,129 companies.
	   The previous survey, released in October, had registered a minus
51.
	   Investors appeared unnerved by the news, sending down Japanese
share prices. The benchmark stock index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
slid 1.03 percent to 14,256.96 as of midday.
	   The nosediving survey numbers come as Japan has slid into its
worst recession since World War II. Unemployment has risen to
all-time highs, bankruptcies have soared and consumer spending has
shriveled.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The economy will weather another tough year in
1999 before recovering in two years, according to a survey of more
than 400 companies in Hong Kong released Monday.
	   ``The results confirm that the extent of the hardship caused by
the Asian financial crisis was underestimated,'' said Jeffrey Muir,
chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce, which surveyed member
companies.
	   Sixty-one percent of respondents said they expected Hong Kong's
economy to recover in 2000, with 22 percent not expecting a
recovery until 2001.
	   Fifty-four percent of the companies said they expected Hong
Kong's business environment to be good or satisfactory next year.
The rest said the business environment would be unfavorable in
1999.
	   Despite the gloomy outlook next year, 90 percent of companies
who have regional headquarters in Hong Kong said they would retain
their bases in the territory, mainly because falling property
prices will help keep costs down. Prices for many commercial
properties have halved since their peaks last year.
	   Respondents were positive, but increasingly cautious, on the
outlook for mainland China. A large majority, or 91 percent, said
they saw the business environment as being favorable or very
favorable in the next five years, down from 94 percent last year.
	   The survey was sent to 1,086 companies. Between Oct. 23 and Nov.
18, 430 responses were received by AC Nielsen, which conducted the
survey for the chamber. No margin of error was given.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Philippines will achieve its export
target of dlrs 29 billion this year, despite a slowdown in exports
over the past month, according to trade secretary Jose Pardo.
	   The target is 16 percent higher than the country's dlrs 25
billion of exports last year. For the January to October period,
exports were up 18 percent from the same 10 months of last year.
But in October, exports fell 8.7 percent from September, and were
up only 9.3 percent from October 1997.
	   In an interview Sunday, Pardo did not provide a target for next
year but said by early 1999, Philippine officials will have
finished their review of a study predicting between dlrs 30 billion
and dlrs 34 billion of exports next year.
	   Pardo said strong demand for electronics _ two-thirds of the
country's exports _ provides a reason for confidence about the
country's exports, despite a slight strengthening of the peso
recently.
	   Pardo, in Hanoi for meetings of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, said exporters are not worried about the peso's
recent rebound as long as it remains between 36 and 44 pesos to the
dollar.
	   But Pardo, who serves on the monetary board of the Philippines
central bank, stressed that the market must decide the right level
for the peso. ``I can't try to second guess the market,'' Pardo
said. ``We only intervene when it's subject to speculative
attack.''

Sri Lanka wins first Asian Games golds in 24 years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with later medals &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Sri Lanka went 24 years without an
Asian Games gold medal. Then sprinters Damayanthi Darsha and Sugath
Tillekeratne gave it two within less than an hour Monday.
	   The island nation had won its first medal of these games, a
bronze in yachting, on Sunday.
	   Then Darsha won the women's 400 meters in 51.57 seconds,
comfortably ahead of China's Chen Yuxiang, who struggled to a 52.50
finish. P.T. Usha, India's star before retiring eight years ago,
finished sixth in 54.37 in a return to the track.
	   In the next race, Tillekeratne held off Qatar's Ibrahim Faraj in
the men's 400, winning 44.99 to 45.32.
	   ``This is the first time that Sri Lanka has won a gold medal in
24 years,'' Darsha said. ``I am extremely happy, not only because I
have won the gold but it was my coach who had won the last gold in
1974.''
	   Coach Sunil Gumawardeme was a member of the 1974 winning
4x100-meter relay team.
	   China's Liu Hongyu, fourth at last year's world championships,
won the women's 10-kilometer walk in 43 minutes, 57.28 seconds, and
said she might have gone faster if her rivals had put up more
challenge.
	   Japan's Rie Mitsumori took silver in 44:29.82, while China's Li
Yuxin, gold medalist in the Asian championships in July, was
disqualified two kilometers from the finish after receiving a third
warning.
	   Liu's was China's 80th gold of these games.
	   South Korea stood second with 37 after South Korean cyclist Ji
Sung-hwan beat Olympic bronze medalist Takanobu Jumonji of Japan in
the men's 1-kilometer time trial. Ji won in 1 minute, 5.406
seconds. Jumonji, who turned in a 1:03.261 at the Atlanta Olympics,
could make only 1:07.011 Monday.
	   Japan gained its 32nd gold when Miya Tachibana, the world
championship bronze medalist, won the solo synchronized swimming.
	   Tachibana scored 98.400 in her free routine, worth 65 percent of
the total score, for a final score of 97.933. South Korea's Choi
Yoo-jin won silver with 95.850.
	   Meanwhile, the Thais, who take numbers seriously were
celebrating winning their 13th gold medal of the 13th Asian Games
on Sunday _ Dec. 13.
	   Their original target had been 10 golds at their home games.
Their best previous was 12 at the 1966 games in Bangkok.

Zanzibar asks China for help in combatting drug abuse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Zanzibar has asked China for help in
combating drug abuse stemming from the islands' increasing
importance as a drug transit point, the weekly East African said
Monday.
	   The independent newspaper said when Deputy Chief Minister
Abdulghani Msoma returned from China last week, he said a team of
Chinese experts would arrive in January to set up a drug
rehabilitation center outside Zanzibar town.
	   The Indian Ocean archipelago of Zanzibar, made up of Unguja,
Pemba and Mafia islands, is a semi-autonomous region within
Tanzania.
	   Police say Zanzibar's small airport has become a major transit
point for Southeast Asian heroin via India to South Africa and
Europe and that a growing number of local youths are now consuming
heroin.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The governing party managed to formally
present to Parliament Monday a controversial bill amending the
constitution to set aside a third of the chamber's seats for women.
	   Despite angry shouts from parties representing low-caste
Indians, Speaker G.M.C. Balayogi kept an afternoon session open
just long enough for Law Minister M.Thambi Durai to table the bill.
Earlier, the opposition had been so fierce Balayogi twice
temporarily adjourned the house.
	   Two other attempts in July to introduce the bill failed amid
scuffling and shouting similar to the scene in parliament earlier
Monday and on Friday.
	   The Bharatiya Janata Party, which leads India's governing
coalition, and the main opposition Congress party both support the
bill, ensuring its passage when it comes to a vote. No date for a
vote has been set, and minority parties had until Monday succeeded
in keeping the bill from even being formally proposed for debate.

Analysts say ASEAN measures aren't bold enough
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-ASEAN Summit
 &UR; By DAVID THURBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Southeast Asian officials are finalizing a
package of ``bold measures'' to restore confidence in the region's
devastated economies. But analysts say they aren't bold enough to
spark a turnaround of the 17-month-old financial crisis.
	   ``This is very disappointing actually; these are not bold
initiatives,'' said Maria Socorro Bautista, an economist at the
University of the Philippines. ``This is not new.''
	   Regional stock and currency markets Monday showed no appreciable
reaction to the package. Asian stocks opened slightly weaker, while
regional currencies were flat.
	   The measures, to be announced later this week at a summit of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, include faster trade and
investment liberalization and relaxed rules on foreign ownership of
land.
	   ASEAN economic ministers consider the measures so important that
they took the unusual step of throwing them back twice to their
senior officials for strengthening _ once in October and again last
Saturday.
	   They say they're pleased with the results.
	   ``It's going to be significant,'' Indonesian Economic Minister
Ginandjar Kartasasmita said. ``It signals the seriousness of the
countries in this region ... these will not be easy measures.''
	   The package must still be approved by the ASEAN leaders, who
were arriving in Hanoi on Monday for their two-day summit.
	   A draft of the measures says the countries will eliminate
tariffs on most products traded within the region by 2002, a year
faster than previously envisaged. However, poorer members of the
nine-member group will be given more time.
	   The group also will establish an ASEAN Investment Area in 2003,
seven years ahead of schedule. That will open more industries to
foreign investment and give businessmen from other ASEAN nations
the same legal rights as local investors. It also will allow 100
percent foreign ownership of land and of more industries.
	   However, countries with constitutional restrictions on foreign
ownership, such as the Philippines and Vietnam, will be allowed
exemptions.
	   In October, the economic ministers, alarmed by a sharp drop in
foreign investment in the region, decided they needed to take
strong measures to attract investors back, and expressed
dissatisfaction with plans lower-level officials had prepared.
	   ASEAN figures show foreign investment has fallen by 33.6 percent
among its members since Asia's financial crisis erupted in July
1997.
	   The ministers ordered the officials to come up with a set of
``bold measures'' in time for this week's summit.
	   When they reviewed the measures last Saturday, they again
decided that more needed to be done, and sent the package back once
again to their senior officials.
	   The current package also includes duty-free imports of capital
equipment and says a new round of negotiations on trade in services
will begin early in 1999 and end in 2001.
	   Some countries also offered individual concessions to start in
1999. Several, however, were already planned or have already begun.
	   The Philippines, for example, pledged to open retail trade and
distribution businesses to foreign equity _ a step contained in a
bill already submitted to its Congress.
	   Indonesia said it will allow 100 percent foreign equity in
manufacturing and listed banks, which Ginandjar said it had already
planned.
	   ``We were going to do it anyway. But if we do it together, the
impact will be much greater,'' he said.
	   Officials say they've realized that foreign investors tend to
see Southeast Asia as a single region, and therefore it's important
that the whole region send a message that it is coping with its
economic difficulties.
	   ``This is a collective move by the ASEAN members to show they're
still committed to trade and liberalization,'' said Song Sen Wun,
regional economist for G.K. Goh in Singapore.
	   ``This may look bold, but these are just brave words at these
trying times.''
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Rebel Kurdish leader calls on fighters to abandon armed struggle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan has
called on his guerrilla fighters to give up armed struggle and
concentrate on finding a political solution to their war for
autonomy.
	   In an interview late Sunday with London-based Kurdish MED TV,
Ocalan said he was ready to give up the leadership of his Kurdistan
Workers Party, known as the PKK.
	   ``The Kurdish guerrillas have been fighting for 15 years but
this cannot continue like this anymore,'' Ocalan said. ``They
should give up their arms and they should go back to their homes.''
	   But Ocalan added that the movement could be quick to return to
its current violent methods.
	   ``If there is no way for a political solution, I say that the
solution only lies with the army, the guerrilla army,'' he said.
	   Ocalan took part in the news program by phone. MED TV can be
viewed in southeast Turkey by satellite.
	   Close to 37,000 people have been killed since the PKK launched
its struggle for autonomy in southeastern Turkey in 1984.
	   Ocalan was detained in Rome in November and has since been
calling for an international debate on the Kurdish issue. Turkey
has been seeking his extradition, but Italy has rejected it because
Ocalan could face the death penalty in Turkey.
	   He has asked for political asylum.
	   ``I will of course continue to play my role but it is O.K. for
me if someone else is prepared to take the leadership,'' Ocalan
said.
	   Indicating a possible power struggle within the PKK, Ocalan
criticized his own rebels.
	   ``I have serious criticisms. They have to correct themselves,
reorganize and restructure themselves,'' he said, adding that
``being ready to give their lives (for the cause) is not enough.''

Jayasinghe misses 100-meter final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Controversial Sri Lankan sprinter
Susantika Jayasinghe missed the 100-meter final at the Asian Games
on Monday after suffering an injury the previous day.
	   The world 200-meter silver medalist, who is under investigation
by the International Amateur Athletic Federation after a positive
test for steroids, said Sunday, ``I pulled a hamstring in the race
and I'm having a severe headache.''
	   Jayasinghe had been expected to win the sprint double
comfortably here.
	   She tested positive for a steroid in March and is competing
while the IAAF waits to hold an arbitration meeting to decide her
fate.
	   The Sri Lankan federation dismissed the charge after she
maintained she took the drug, Nandralone-19, to control her
menstrual cycle.
	   If the IAAF rules against her and orders a ban, Jayasinghe would
lose any medals won here.

Japanese business sentiment deteriorates to record low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hurt by a severe credit crunch and prolonged
economic slump, business confidence at Japan's recession-hit small
and medium-sized manufacturers has fallen to a record low, the Bank
of Japan said Monday.
	   Confidence at major Japanese manufacturers also continued to
erode, falling to its worst level since February 1994, the central
bank said.
	   In a closely-watched quarterly report, the bank said business
sentiment at small and medium-sized manufacturers had deteriorated
in the past three months to minus 60, the lowest since it began
compiling the ``tankan'' survey in 1967.
	   That was down from the negative 57 reported in the last survey.
	   The tankan measures the percentage of firms seeing business
conditions improve minus the percentage seeing conditions worsen.
	   For large manufacturers, the confidence measurement fell to a
lower-than-expected negative 56 _ down from negative 51 in
September.
	   Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a slight
deterioration, to minus 53, in the central bank's latest poll of
9,129 companies.
	   Investors appeared unnerved by the report, which helped send
down Japanese share prices. The benchmark stock index on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange slid 2.04 percent to close at 14,111.62.
	   The nose-diving survey numbers come as Japan struggles with its
worst recession since World War II. Unemployment has risen to
all-time highs, bankruptcies have soared and consumer spending has
shriveled.
	   Less than two weeks ago, the government said the world's
second-largest economy shrank at an annualized pace of 2.6 percent
in the most recent quarter, marking the longest slump in more than
four decades.
	   The Bank of Japan survey showed that major manufactures expect
export sales _ a mainstay for their businesses _ will likely
decline in the second half of the current fiscal year through
March.
	   That appears to reflect concern about slowing growth in the
United States and continued doubts about the outlook for a recovery
in Asian neighbors suffering from a regional crisis.
	   Amid growing pressure both at home and from abroad to jump start
domestic-led growth, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's
government has drawn up a stimulus package worth a record 24
trillion yen (dlrs 206 billion).
	   Yet some economists say a full recovery remains a distant
prospect.
	   ``We have seen the economy worsen in the past year, but we
cannot expect a dramatic turnaround because consumption remains
quite weak,'' said Naomi Hasegawa, senior economist at
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Securities Co.
	   Over the next three months, major manufactures expect a modest
improvement in their businesses. The tankan showed they forecast
the main index for these companies will reach minus 48.
	   But small and mid-sized companies, which have had increasing
difficulty obtaining financing from risk-averse banks, expect
little to change. They predicted the next survey in March will hold
steady at a worst-ever minus 60.

	   RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Greeted by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and a giant American flag draping Gaza's new airport control
towers, U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday carried an appeal for
reconciliation with Israel to the Palestinians.
	   Clinton became the first American president to set foot on
Palestinian land, bothering some Israelis and giving a morale boost
to Arafat in his drive for an independent state.
	   Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton alighted from
their Marine One helicopter to a red carpet greeting and handshakes
from Arafat and other Palestinians.
	   ``It's an honor to have you here,'' said Arafat, as he asked
Clinton to cut a wide red ribbon opening the airport. Clinton made
no statement at the ceremonies but he and his wife waved small
sections of the ribbon and applauded along with Arafat and a crowd
of Palestinian dignitaries.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called Clinton's trip
to Gaza historic. ``It's a very important sign of progress here in
the peace process,'' she said. ``It's a visible sign of what we
accomplished in the Wye talks.''

Air pollution forces closure of Iranian elementary schools
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Acute air pollution has forced the closure
of several thousand elementary schools in the Iranian capital, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday.
	   Tehran's education department decided Monday to close the
schools based on a recommendation by the Environmental Protection
Organization, the agency said.
	   State-run Tehran radio said levels of ozone _ a colorless,
odorless pollutant formed by a chemical reaction between exhaust
fumes and sunlight _ were six times higher than the acceptable
level. Hundred points is considered the maximum acceptable limit.
	   The radio issued an advisory recommending that people with heart
problems and the elderly stay indoors until the pollution clears.
	   This week, many residents of the capital of 10 million have been
wearing masks outdoors due to the thick haze of smog enveloping the
city.
	   The pollution and smog were worsened due to stagnant weather,
lack of rain and the city's fleet of old cars which emit noxious
exhaust fumes.

Taiwanese banks report record overdue loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwanese banks are reporting a record
number of overdue loans because of growing business bankruptcies
and financial troubles, the Central Bank governor said Monday.
	   Perng Fai-nan said that on average 4.95 percent of bank loans
were overdue in September while total overdue loans amounted to
nearly 700 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 22 billion).
	   He said some businesses were unable to pay their loans on time
because they had used company funds for stock speculation.
	   Several business groups have failed to settle their huge stock
purchases as banks tightened their credit policies at a time of
economic slowdown.
	   Analysts say many companies buy stocks to prop up their share
prices and use the shares as collateral to obtain loans from banks.
	   Taiwan Ratings Corp., a joint venture with Standard and Poor,
has predicted that the overdue loan ratio could rise to 8 percent
next year.
	   Taiwan has been hit by financial turmoil in the past few months
in the aftermath of the regional economic crisis, leaving many
companies struggling to pay off debts that they had incurred when
times were better.
	   Perng told a legislative committee that the government has asked
banks not to provide loans simply by taking shares as collaterals.
Banks should first assess what the loans are to be used for, he
said.
	   Banks are also asked to raise their bad debt reserves to 2
percent from the current rate of 1 percent, he said.
	   Perng also dismissed several legislators' forecast that growing
financial troubles could lead to an economic crisis next year.
	   ``There should never be such a pessimistic outlook,'' Perng
said, citing several research organizations' prediction of a 5.2
percent economic growth rate next year.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to ADD Suharto not planning to leave Indonesia; ADDS
 &UR; Report: Indonesia's president ready for questioning over
predecessor

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's President B.J. Habibie is
ready to be questioned about corruption allegations against his
predecessor ex-President Suharto who in turn says he has no plans
to flee the country, news reports said Monday.
	   ``I was born in Indonesia, helped develop Indonesia as well. I
have become part of Indonesia. And I want to die here in Indonesia.
So do not worry about me running away overseas,'' Juan Felix
Tampubolon quoted Suharto, 77, as telling state prosecutors last
week, the news magazine Gatra reported.
	   Newspaper Media Indonesia quoted State Secretary Minister Akbar
Tanjung as saying Habibie is prepared to supply information if
requested.
	   ``As a former research and technology minister, President B.J.
Habibie will definitely be ready to give a necessary explanation
regarding the investigation of former President Suharto by the
attorney general,'' Media Indonesia quoted Tanjung as saying.
	   Last Wednesday, ex-autocrat Suharto was questioned by state
prosecutors over allegations that he abused his power to enrich his
family and cronies during 32 years of authoritarian power.
	   Suharto quit office last May after a wave of riots and protests.
He has since denied any wrong doing.
	   Habibie is a longtime friend of Suharto and had been a loyal
member of his Cabinet for 20 years.
	   State lawyers investigated Suharto soon after his resignation,
but said they failed to find any evidence against him.
	   Habibie ordered a new investigation after a recent wave of
protests by students who have demanded that Suharto be put on
trial.
	   Earlier this year Forbes magazine estimated Suharto's wealth at
about dlrs 4 billion. Others say it is far higher.
	   Suharto has denied he has amassed fortune and says he has no
money placed in foreign bank accounts.
	   During his questioning, Suharto was asked about
multimillion-dollar charitable foundations formerly under his
control, a national car project run by his youngest son Tommy with
huge tax breaks, the contents of his bank accounts and presidential
decrees that allegedly benefited his family and friends.
	   The newsmagazine Forum Keadilan reported Monday that Suharto had
defended Tommy's involvement in the national car project, through
which South Korean-made cars were imported into Indonesia free of
duties and other taxes.
	   ``It just so happens that only Tommy made a proposal,'' for the
car project, one of the prosecutors later quoted Suharto as saying,
the magazine reported. It did not identify the lawyer.
	   Critics of the car project complained that cars imported
tax-free by Tommy were sold far more cheaply than competing models
and that this was in contravention of international trade rules.
	   Recently the government said it would demand billions of dollars
in back taxes from Tommy who it accused of failing to fulfill
obligations to increase the Indonesian-made content of the Timor
cars.
	   Under the terms of the project, tax breaks were granted to a
company controlled by Tommy on the understanding that local content
of its cars would be increased over several years leading
eventually to the production of a totally Indonesian-made car.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ In rebuffing U.S. statehood, Puerto
Ricans affirmed their distinct identity and fundamental
satisfaction with an in-between status that many here see as the
best of both worlds.
	   Sunday's vote, a blow for pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello,
underscored the obstacles to making a U.S. state out of a territory
whose residents largely see themselves as a nation and who prize
their Spanish language and Latino culture.
	   ``We have gone to the ballot boxes and said: `No, this country
is ours,''' said San Juan mayor Sila Calderon, the key statehood
opponent. ``We continue being Puerto Ricans forever. We want to
live as Puerto Ricans and die as Puerto Ricans.''
	   Formally, the winner in the nonbinding referendum was ``none of
the above,'' which outpolled statehood by 50.2 to 46.5 percent.
	   The commonwealth party had urged a ``none of the above'' vote
because it objected to the ballot's commonwealth description, which
was written by the statehood party and suggested Congress could
revoke Puerto Ricans' U.S. citizenship.
	   Rossello (pronounced Ro-say-YOH) refused to concede defeat,
arguing that most people who voted for an explicit option chose
statehood. ``In my interpretation this is a victory for
statehood,'' he said. His aides said he would employ that argument
in Washington.

Palestinians celebrate Clinton's landing as seal of statehood

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details from airport ceremony, background. &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton's message
was in the symmetry. Flags, honor guards and brass bands at an
Israeli airport one day and at the new Palestinian airport the
next.
	   For the Palestinians, it was a presidential seal on their claims
to statehood when Clinton's Marine One helicopter touched down at
Gaza International Airport on Monday.
	   Dozens of Palestinian dignitaries jumped to their feet, flashed
victory signs and clapped rhythmically when Clinton cut a crimson
ribbon to inaugurate the passenger terminal, an Oriental-style
building with graceful arches and Moroccan tiles.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, hoping to savor the historic
moment just a while longer, made a surprised Clinton cut slices off
the ribbon, then handed pieces of cloth to the president and his
wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, as mementoes.
	   ``It's a recognition of Palestinian identity,'' Palestinian
Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said proudly of Clinton's airport
visit. ``I think its an important step on the road to realizing
freedom and recognition.''
	   Aware of the symbolic importance, Israel's government had tried
to dissuade Clinton from landing at the airport, to no avail.
	   Late Saturday, Clinton was met in a similar ceremony by Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Ben Gurion International
Airport.
	   In a clear gesture to the Palestinians, Clinton made a special
detour to visit the airport which opened Nov. 24 as part of the Wye
River land-for-security agreement the president helped negotiate.
Clinton flew from Jerusalem to the airport and from there traveled
by car to a meeting with Arafat in Gaza City.
	   The Palestinians spared no effort to underscore the symbolic
value of the visit, of a head of state receiving a head of state.
	   Two huge flags, one American and one Palestinian, draped side by
side over the control tower, covering its entire length. ``Welcome
to Palestine, Mr. Clinton,'' read a banner strung alongside the
airport access road.
	   Even an armored personnel carrier parked at the airport entrance
had a large poster of Clinton and Arafat shaking hands taped to one
of its sides.
	   ``This is huge for us that he (Clinton) would visit us as we
take the first step toward building our country,'' said Nimer
Duekat, manager of passenger services.
	   After Clinton's helicopter landed, he was greeted by Arafat and
walked past an honor guard, then shook hands with Palestinian
Cabinet ministers and dignitaries lining a red carpet.

Foley: Japan's trade surplus could cause tension
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo TOK104

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A growing trade imbalance between Japan and the
United States could raise tensions between the two nations in the
coming year, U.S. ambassador Thomas Foley said Monday.
	   A trade confrontation is avoidable only if Tokyo opens its doors
further to foreign investment and imports, Foley said in a year-end
speech at the Japan National Press Club.
	   Japan's trade surplus with the United States stood at dlrs 5.95
billion in October, 31.9 percent higher than the year before.
	   Regarding reports that Japan is considering tariffs of up to
1,300 percent on imported rice, Foley said such an action would
``cripple'' rice imports to Japan.
	   The United States has asked to consult with Japan on the issue,
but is still waiting for a response.
	   Consultation is urgent, ``to avoid what could be a very serious
disagreement,'' Foley said.
	   But despite the two countries differences, Foley stressed that
Japan is still the United State's closest partner in Asia.
	   He allayed fears of so-called ``Japan passing,'' or the concern
that the United States has chosen China over Japan as its strongest
Asian ally.
	   Rather, Foley said, the improvement in U.S. ties with China is a
``win-win situation'' for both countries in that it will help
Japan's relations with Beijing as well.
	   Foley praised the government's recent efforts to stimulate
Japan's sagging economy through increased public spending and tax
cuts.
	   Japan has ``made a very good start'' in boosting its economy, he
said.
	   ``We welcome the steps Japan has taken, including the enactment
of banking legislation, which we now hope will be implemented
aggressively and transparently, and the government's submission of
a new economic stimulus package,'' he said.
	   The ambassador called on Tokyo to quickly pass laws supporting
new security guidelines between Japan and the United States
announced in last September.
	   The security treaty between the two countries not only protects
Japan, ``but underwrites peace and stability throughout Asia,'' he
said.
	   Foley said the United States will cooperate with Japan to reduce
the effects of the military in places like Okinawa, where strained
relations between the military and residents have long been a
problem.
	   However, ``the security we enjoy does come with costs,'' he
said, ``and that means a U.S. military footprint in Japan.''

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Sprint stars Koji Ito and Susantika
Jayasinghe both missed the start at the Asian Games on Monday.
	   While the Sri Lankan skipped the women's 100 altogether, Ito was
just too slow out of the blocks, costing him any chance of becoming
the first non-black athlete to crack 10 seconds for the sprint. He
still won the gold.
	   Only 26 men, all black, have broken the 10-second barrier.
Poland's Marian Woronin just missed out, having the best time of a
white athlete with 10.00 in Warsaw in 1984.
	   Ito stood on the verge of entry into the exclusive under-10 club
when he clocked an Asian record 10.00 in Sunday's semifinals.
	   His chances looked to have been blown away by strong gusts of
wind Monday, before it dropped to a rare lull. He got a legal
tailwind reading of 1.6, but finished in 10.05 for the gold.
	   ``Maybe I failed to live up to everyone's expectations to be
under 10 seconds,'' Ito said. ``But at least I excited everyone.''
	   Teammate Yasukatsu Otsuki and Thailand's tied for silver at
10.31 in a photo finish.
	   Sri Lankan fans had not heard their national anthem at an Asian
Games for five editions and 24 years but despite Jayasinghe's
decision to miss the sprint because of injury, the country got two
anthems in succession.
	   Its 400-meter sprinters Damayanthi Darsha and Sugath
Tillekeratne delivered a double blast.
	   Jayasinghe, competing here under a drug cloud, complained of a
hamstring injury and headache after qualifying in Sunday's
semifinals. She tested positive for a steroid in March but is
allowed to compete while the International Amateur Athletic
Federation awaits an arbitration hearing.
	   With the world 200 silver medalist missing, China's Asian record
holder Li Xuemei won in a wind-aided 11.05 seconds. China's Yali Li
was third.
	   Darsha won the women's 400 meters, giving Sri Lanka its first
gold since her coach Sunil Gumawardeme was a member of the 1974
4x100-meter relay team.
	   ``This is the first time that Sri Lanka has won a gold medal in
24 years,'' Darsha said. ``I am extremely happy, not only because I
have won the gold but it was my coach who had won the last gold in
1974.''
	   Darsha had the field under her control after the opening 100 and
cruised down the final straight, crossing the line in 51.57. In
contrast to the comfortable run by the Asian champion, China's Chen
Yuxiang battled home with a face covered in pain to get silver in
52.50. Bronze went to Svetlana Bodritskaya (53.00) of Kazakstan
while veteran Indian P.T. Usha was sixth in 54.37.
	   Tillekeratne had to work harder to win the men's 400 in 44.99,
overcoming a strong challenge by Ibrahim Faraj of Qatar, who
clocked 45.32 after easing up near the line. India's Paramjit Singh
got the bronze.
	   Eleven of the 43 track and field gold medals were on offer in
Monday's packed program, but the late afternoon session was largely
ignored by the public, with only about 5,000 people in the
20,000-capacity main stadium.
	   Tiny Indian Jyotirmoy Sikdhar continued a great session for
subcontinent athletes when she outsprinted China's Wang Qingfen to
win the women's 1,500 in 4:12.82. Wang finished in 4:13.19, with
India's Sunita Rani adding a bronze.
	   ``The bronze was in my pocket so I decided why not run for the
gold,'' said Sikdhar.
	   Organizers angered Indian fans by playing the wrong anthem at
Sikdhar's medal ceremony.
	   South Korea's Lee Yong-sun won an uninspiring women's javelin
event, throwing 62.09 meters. Liang Lili of China was second with
Gurmeet Kaur of India third.
	   China's Liu Hongyu, fourth at last year's world championships,
was unchallenged to win the women's 10-kilometer walk.
	   Liu finished the road race in 43 minutes, 57.28 seconds,
comfortably ahead of Japan's Rie Mitsumori (44:29.82) and
Kazakstan's Svetlana Tolstaya (45:29.95).
	   Liu, who has a best of 42:38.00, said she never felt threatened
Monday.
	   ``If they pushed me hard, the time might have been faster,'' Liu
said.
	   Liu's teammate Li Yuxin, gold medalist in the Asian
championships in July, was disqualified two kilometers from the
finish after receiving a third warning.
	   ``I have nothing to say,'' Li said. ``I can only say that I
should perfect my technique in future.''
	   The race was the final women's walk event over 10 kilometers.
International meets are changing to 20 kilometers next year.
	   Liu said she would cope with the decision.
	   ``I will be more confident of winning the longer race,'' Liu
said.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong stocks slumped for a third
consecutive session Monday following falls in overseas markets.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 126.79 points, or 1.3
percent, closing at 9,825.21. On Friday, the index had lost 363.44
points, or 3.5 percent.
	   Turnover fell to 3.3 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 423
million), down from 5.71 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 732
million).
	   The Hong Kong market was dragged down by weakness in other Asian
bourses, such as Japan, and also by Friday's fall on Wall Street,
brokers said.
	   ``The fall in the Japanese stock market casts a shadow over the
Hong Kong stock market,'' said Terry Cheung, institutional sales
director at Core Pacific-Yamaichi.
	   On Monday, Tokyo's key 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average tumbled
294.02 points, or 2.04 percent, to close at 14,111.62 on concerns
over the Japanese economy.
	   Among real estate shares, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 1.00 Hong
Kong dollar to 53.50, and Cheung Kong fell 75 cents to 53.00.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 1.50 dollars to
187.50, and Hang Seng Bank fell 50 cents to 65.75.
	   Elsewhere, Swire Pacific ``A'' fell 40 cents to 34.80, and Hong
Kong Telecom fell 35 cents to 13.25.

Russia plans 11 commercial space launches in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is planning 11 commercial space launches
next year, though officials warned Monday that several may be
postponed, as was the case this year.
	   Only six of the 12 planned launches lifted off this year, and a
number of those delayed will take place in 1999, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   The first commercial launch set for next year is on Jan. 30,
when the U.S. communications satellite Telestar-6 is to lift off.
The original plan called for it to go up this past October.
	   Russia will use its Proton rockets, made by the Khrunichev
Center, for the launches.
	   Russia's space program is plagued by money shortages, though the
commercial satellite launches offer the country its best
opportunity to generate income for its space efforts.

China backs investigation into IOC bribery allegations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A senior Chinese sports official on
Monday welcomed investigations into allegations of misconduct
within the International Olympic Committee and said he did not rule
out that corruption played a part in Beijing's loss of the 2000
Olympics to Sydney.
	   Wu Shouzhang, a leader of China's delegation to the Asian Games,
repeated Chinese claims that ``non-sports factors,'' including U.S.
criticism of China's human rights record, were partly to blame for
Beijing losing the games to Sydney in a vote in 1993.
	   Asked whether corruption also was involved in Beijing's loss, Wu
said: ``It cannot be completely discounted.''
	   But he added: ``You also cannot say that this problem exists.
There has to be a foundation.'' He also said China had not been
involved in any corrupt acts.
	   Wu, secretary-general of the Chinese delegation, was speaking
after a senior IOC executive board member, Marc Hodler, said over
the weekend that four people _ including one IOC member _ were
involved in vote-buying over the past 10 years.
	   Hodler cited supposed irregularities in the selections of at
least four Olympic cities _ Atlanta; Nagano, Japan; Sydney,
Australia; and Salt Lake City.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said the allegations would
be investigated by the special panel looking into alleged
violations by the bid committee that won the 2002 Winter Games for
Salt Lake City.
	   ``We welcome investigation,'' said Wu. ``We are resolutely
opposed to corruption. We hope that the International Olympic
Committee is clean.''
	   Beijing city leaders have applied to the Chinese Olympic
Committee for the right to bid for the 2008 Olympics. He Huixian, a
spokeswoman for the committee, said China hoped that the race will
be a ``a friendly competition based on openness, equality and
fairness.''

Air pollution forces closure of Iranian elementary schools
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Acute air pollution has forced the closure
of several thousand elementary schools in the Iranian capital, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday.
	   Tehran's education department decided Monday to close the
schools based on a recommendation by the Environmental Protection
Organization, the agency said.
	   State-run Tehran radio said levels of ozone _ a colorless,
odorless pollutant formed by a chemical reaction between exhaust
fumes and sunlight _ were six times higher than the acceptable
level.
	   The radio issued an advisory recommending that people with heart
problems and the elderly stay indoors until the pollution clears.
	   This week, many residents of the capital of 10 million have been
wearing masks outdoors due to the thick haze of smog enveloping the
city.
	   The pollution and smog were worsened due to stagnant weather,
lack of rain and the city's fleet of old cars which emit noxious
exhaust fumes.

Prosecution to bring semen-stained mattress to court
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Inserts three grafs after the 12th to UPDATE with defense
lawyers alleging fabrication of evidence at the end of Monday's
hearing
 &UR; By R. MAGESWARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The sex and corruption trial of
former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim took a sensational turn
Monday when the prosecution said it would exhibit a semen-stained
mattress to prove Anwar had indulged in illegal sex.
	   Deputy Public Prosecutor Azahar Mohamed told the court that the
mattress, seized by police in July from an apartment here, had
already been examined by the police laboratory.
	   He did not disclose the findings, but said the mattress would be
shown to the court Tuesday.
	   Anwar, the Southeast Asian country's deputy premier before being
sacked in September, currently faces abuse of power charges and
will be tried separately for allegedly having engaged in illegal
sex acts.
	   The prosecutor made the statement after Assistant Commissioner
of Police Musa Hassan, the 13th witness in the trial, said he had
ordered the mattress and pillow to be taken when he was
investigating whether Anwar had an affair with his former
secretary's wife.
	   ``I saw a few patches of seminal fluid on the mattress,'' Musa
told the court.
	   Earlier, Musa said Anwar could have been prosecuted for sexual
misconduct as early as last year had he not forced police to coerce
retractions from two people who made accusations against him.
	   Musa testified police detectives were unaware last year that the
retractions had been drafted and obtained by colleagues in the
police department's special branch _ allegedly on Anwar's orders.
	   Otherwise, charges would have been brought against the former
deputy prime minister on the basis of initial allegations made by
Ummi Hafilda Ali and Azizan Abu Bakar, the prosecution witness
said.
	   ``I suggested no further action because I was influenced by the
retraction letters,'' Musa told the court on Monday.
	   Azizan, the former driver of the jailed politician's wife, has
testified that Anwar repeatedly sodomized him in 1992, while Ummi
has accused Anwar of sleeping with her brother's wife, Shamsidar
Taharin.
	   The original allegations were contained in a letter Ummi, the
sister of Anwar's former secretary, sent to Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Defense attorney, Christopher Fernando accused Musa of trying to
malign Anwar and the prosecutors of fabricating evidence.
	   ``There seems to be a systematic campaign. One witness after the
other,'' Fernando said. ``It fortifies our earlier statement that
there is a conspiracy to bring down Anwar and to destroy him.''
	   Judge Augustine Paul warned Fernando that he could be punished
for contempt of court if he failed to prove his allegations against
prosecution lawyers. ``These are serious allegations.''
	   Last week, Musa said regular police officers were prevented from
interrogating Ummi and Azizan. Musa, who belongs to the criminal
investigation department, conducted a probe against Anwar this year
after the accusations resurfaced in a book.
	   Azizan's sodomy claims and Ummi's letter form the core of the 10
charges against Anwar, who was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 on
grounds of immorality.
	   Anwar is being tried for four counts of allegedly using his
influence with the police to force the two accusers to sign
retractions. He also faces trial on five illegal sex charges and
one more count of corruption. He denies the charges.
	   His sacking and subsequent arrest and beating while in police
custody have led to demands for political reforms and
anti-government protests.

Palestinians meet to vote on charter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-Mideast &QL;

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ For years, since the first peace
treaty with Israel in 1993, Palestinian leaders have been saying
they consider clauses in their charter calling for the destruction
of the Jewish state null and void.
	   The Palestinian National Council voted in April 1996 to revoke
those clauses. But when he took office soon afterward, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Palestinians had not
completed their task.
	   Fulfilling a promise made to the United States and Israel under
the Wye River peace accords, the PNC was taking up the revocation
issue again Monday.
	   The only issue was whether there would be a formal vote _ as the
Israelis have demanded.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, in the first trip to Gaza by an
American president, planned to witness the action.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Yasser Arafat would
ask the delegates whether they support the peace process and a
letter he sent to Clinton in January declaring the 28 of the 33
clauses written in 1964 either void or amended.
	   ``Then we will raise our hands and stand up and applaud,''
Asfour said. Despite the show of hands, this should not be
considered a formal vote, he added.
	   Nabil Shaath, a minister in Arafat's Cabinet, said any vote
``will be based on a guarantee that we won't deal with this issue
any longer, that it will be gone and done with.''
	   Last week, when the smaller Palestinian Central Council, revoked
the clauses, Tayeb Abdel Rahim, secretary general of the
Palestinian Authority, said the PLO charter has been an anachronism
for years.
	   Those sections calling for Israel's destruction ``have not been
valid since the day we signed'' the first peace agreement with
Israel in 1993, he said.
	   Netanyahu has said he would not go forward with the Wye accords
and withdraw troops from the West Bank without a formal vote.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser David Bar-Illan, said Sunday ``a
respectable majority, a decisive majority, was necessary.'' Israeli
officials were reluctant to discuss acceptable voting
technicalities but suggested that a show of hands should suffice.
	   The PNC session is the most sensitive stop of Clinton's trip and
could lead to a showdown if he and Netanyahu disagree over whether
the PNC has completed its task.
	   The possibility of a three-way summit following the PNC session
depends on whether a vote is taken, Bar-Illan said.

	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ The second cricket Test between Pakistan
and Zimbabwe ended in a draw Monday after fog and poor light
canceled play on the fifth and final day.
	   This allowed Zimbabwe to keep its three match series lead 1-0.
The final Test will begin Thursday in Faisalabad.

Pakistan's ambitions of squaring the series. A total of 223 overs
of play were lost.
	   Zimbabwe was to resume its second innings Monday at 48 without
loss after conceding 142-run first innings lead. Pakistan made 325
in its first outing in reply to Zimbabwe's 183.
	   ``We're not too disappointed. It's nice that our 1-0 lead is
intact,'' said Zimbabwean skipper Alistair Campbell. ``Now we have
to ensure a draw or a win at Faisalabad to clinch the series.''
	   Umpires called off the match with the mutual consent of both
captains Moin Khan and Campbell.
	   ``We tried to level the series, but unfortunately weather played
a cruel role in our plans,'' said Khan. ``We got a substantial
first innings lead and our plan was to dismiss the Zimbabweans
cheaply and put pressure on them.''
	   Khan said Waqar Younis had a temperature when Zimbabwe started
its second innings on Sunday making it impossible for him to play.
	   And said Khan, ``that too affected our plans.''
	   Khan was uncertain whether he would continue as captain or
whether regular captain Aamir Sohail would return for the final
Test. Sohail pulled out of the Lahore match because of low blood
pressure.

Havel ill, takes a break from duties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel is
suffering from a viral infection of the lungs and is resting at
home, his spokesman said Monday.
	   Spokesman Ladislav Spacek said Havel fell ill over the weekend
but was not hospitalized. Havel will be taking a break from duties
until Wednesday, when doctors will decide on any future treatment,
he said .
	   Havel, 62, fought off a life-threatening case of pneumonia in
August and had emergency surgery for a ruptured colon in April.
	   A former chain smoker, Havel has been hospitalized five times
since December 1996, when a third of his lung and a cancerous tumor
were removed.

Iran, Thailand into semifinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thatwachai Damrong-Ongtrakul sent in a
40-meter kick in sudden death extra time Monday as host Thailand
knocked the favored South Koreans out of the Asian Games soccer
tournament.
	   The 2-1 victory that put Thailand into the semifinals sent the
packed stadium into ecstasy.
	   Meanwhile, Iran cruised into the semifinals with an easy 4-0
victory over Uzbekistan. Bayern Munich star Ali Daei scored three
goals within seven minutes in the second half.
	   For Thailand, Damrong-Ontrakul took a short pass off a free kick
and drove the ball into the net from near the left sideline six
minutes into extra time. His shot went into the top left corner of
the goal over a leaping Kim Byung-ji, who was a bit slow to react
after appearing to be partially screened by a teammate trying to
block the ball.
	   The Thais were down to nine men after losing two in the second
half. A red card to Worrawoot Srimaka nine minutes into the half
put the Thais one man down. Despite that, Kiatisuk Senamuang scored
10 minutes before the end of regulation time.
	   Surachi Jirasirchote was booked for his second yellow card of
the game four minutes later and Yoo Sang-chul scored on the free
kick to tie the game at 1-1, forcing an overtime with the first
goal to win.
	   Damrong-Ontrakul followed his winning shot by circling the track
with a flag, and British coach Peter Withe also went on a
flag-waving parade.
	   Daei went on a scoring spree in the second half to power Iran
into the Asian games semifinals.
	   Iran went ahead 1-0 in the first half on Ali Reza
Mosavi-Hasanzadeh's goal in the 28th minute.
	   Then Iran turned up its game and dominated the second half.
	   Daei chipped in a shot just inside the penalty area to make it
2-0 in the 37th minute. Then he made a brilliant individual effort
for 3-0, scampering past two defenders to score from just outside
the penalty area in front of the goal.
	   Barely two minutes later, he added another. On a corner kick, he
was in front of the goal with one defender trying to mark him and
Karim Bagheri. The ball sailed over Bagheri's head and Daei headed
a bouncer that Uzbek goalie Pavel Bugaio got a hand on it but
couldn't stop from going into the net.
	   In the semifinals Wednesday, Iran takes on the winner of
China-Turkmenistan while Thailand meets the Qatar-Kuwait winner.

Creditors reject rehab plan for top Thai chip maker Alphatec
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai and foreign creditors of Alphatec
Electronics, once regarded as Thailand's leading computer chip
manufacturer, rejected a rehabilitation plan on Monday to revive
the debt-laden company.
	   Until 1997, Alphatec was at the cutting edge in the quest among
Thai electronics companies to produce higher-technology
manufacturing.
	   But as Thailand's economic crisis broke in July 1997, so did
allegations that Alphatec's chairman, Charn Usawachoke, had been
doctoring the company's financial records and siphoning off
profits.
	   The scandal and the country's economic downturn left the company
with a mountain of foreign-denominated debt that increased with the
devaluation of Thailand's currency, the baht.
	   Kraisie Keoparadai, managing director of Krung Thai Legal
Services, told reporters the rejection meant that court-appointed
PricewaterhouseCoopers is no longer the advisor on the
rehabilitation plan.
	   Kraisie told reporters after the meeting of creditors that Krung
Thai Bank, the parent company of Krung Thai Legal Services, was
among the lenders who voted Monday against the plan to write off
most of Alphatec's dlrs 375 million in bad debt.
	   According to Kraisie, Krung Thai Bank voted against the plan
drawn up by PricewaterhouseCoopers because it focused only on
writing off bad debt and not the rehabilitation of Alphatec's
business operations.
	   ``The Krung Thai Bank board doesn't want Alphatec to be bankrupt
and believes the company can be revived,'' Kraisie said.
	   It was unclear whether the ailing electronics company will now
face liquidation or if creditors will attempt to draw up a new
rehabilitation plan.
	   ``The next step we will consider is whether to appoint a new
advisor to replace PricewaterhouseCoopers or not,'' Kraisie said.

Ito misses barrier, Jayasinghe pulls out

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Sprint stars Koji Ito and Susantika
Jayasinghe both missed the start at the Asian Games on Monday.
	   While the Sri Lankan skipped the women's 100 altogether, Ito was
the slowest of the eight finalists out of the blocks, costing him
any chance of becoming the first non-black athlete to crack 10
seconds for the sprint. He still won the gold.
	   Only 26 men, all black, have broken the 10-second barrier.
Poland's Marian Woronin just missed out, having the best time of a
white athlete with 10.00 in Warsaw in 1984.
	   Ito stood on the verge of entry into the exclusive under-10 club
when he clocked an Asian record 10.00 in Sunday's semifinals.
	   His chances looked to have been blown away by strong gusts of
wind Monday, before it dropped to a rare lull. He got a legal
tailwind reading of 1.6, but finished in 10.05.
	   ``Maybe I failed to live up to everyone's expectations to be
under 10 seconds,'' Ito said. ``But at least I excited everyone.''
	   Thailand's Seeharwong Reanchai edged Japan's Yasukatsu Otsuki
for the silver medal in a photo finish after both clocked 10.31.
	   Sri Lankan fans had not heard their national anthem at an Asian
Games for five editions and 24 years but despite Jayasinghe's
decision to miss the sprint because of injury, the country got two
anthems in succession. Its 400-meter sprinters Damayanthi Darsha
and Sugath Tillekeratne delivered a double blast.
	   Jayasinghe, competing here under a drug cloud, complained of a
hamstring injury and headache after qualifying in Sunday's
semifinals. She tested positive for a steroid in March but is
allowed to compete while the International Amateur Athletic
Federation awaits an arbitration hearing.
	   With the world 200 silver medalist missing, China's Asian record
holder Li Xuemei won in a wind-aided 11.05 seconds. China's Yali Li
was second and India's Rachita Mistry got a photo decision to take
bronze. Li Xuemei said she hardly slept overnight because of
diarrhea and a fever.
	   Darsha won the women's 400 meters, giving Sri Lanka its first
gold since her coach Sunil Gumawardeme was a member of the 1974
4x100-meter relay team.
	   ``This is the first time that Sri Lanka has won a gold medal in
24 years,'' Darsha said. ``I am extremely happy, not only because I
have won the gold but it was my coach who had won the last gold in
1974.''
	   Darsha had the field under her control after the opening 100 and
cruised down the final straight, crossing the line in 51.57. In
contrast to the comfortable run by the Asian champion, China's Chen
Yuxiang battled home with a face covered in pain to get silver in
52.50. Bronze went to Svetlana Bodritskaya (53.00) of Kazakstan
while veteran Indian P.T. Usha was sixth in 54.37.
	   Tillekeratne had to work harder to win the men's 400 in 44.99,
overcoming a strong challenge by Ibrahim Faraj of Qatar, who
clocked 45.32 after easing up near the line. India's Paramjit Singh
got the bronze.
	   Eleven of the 43 track and field gold medals were on offer in
Monday's packed program, but the late afternoon session was largely
ignored by the public, with only about 5,000 people in the
20,000-capacity main stadium.
	   Tiny Indian Jyotirmoy Sikdhar continued a great session for
subcontinent athletes when she outsprinted China's Wang Qingfen to
win the women's 1,500 in 4:12.82. Wang finished in 4:13.19, with
India's Sunita Rani adding a bronze.
	   ``The bronze was in my pocket so I decided why not run for the
gold,'' said Sikdhar.
	   Organizers angered jeering Indian fans by playing the wrong
anthem at Sikdhar's medal ceremony, so 10 minutes later they
brought the medalists out and played the right anthem.
	   Qatar's Mohamad Taib won the men's 1,500 for the third
successive games in a bizarre finish. He slowed right down near the
end, waving his rivals closer, then turned around and made a rude
gesture down the track.
	   South Korea's Lee Yong-sun won an uninspiring women's javelin
event, throwing 62.09 meters. Liang Lili of China was second with
Gurmeet Kaur of India third.
	   Shen Shengfei of China won the gold medal of the heptathlon with
a total of 5,817 points. Svetlana Kazanina of Kazakstan was second
at 5,775, followed by Ma Chun-ping of Taiwan in third at 5,659.
	   China's Liu Hongyu, fourth at last year's world championships,
was unchallenged to win the women's 10-kilometer walk. Liu finished
the road race in 43 minutes, 57.28 seconds, comfortably ahead of
Japan's Rie Mitsumori (44:29.82) and Kazakstan's Svetlana Tolstaya
(45:29.95).
	   ``If they pushed me hard, the time might have been faster,'' Liu
said.
	   Liu's teammate Li Yuxin, gold medalist in the Asian
championships in July, was disqualified two kilometers from the
finish after receiving a third warning.

Japan's newest nationalized bank seeks to calm nervous depositors

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A day after the Japan took over a second major bank
in as many months, branches of Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. opened
Monday with extra staffers on hand to assure anxious customers that
their savings were safe.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi put the ailing bank under
state control on Sunday after it had been declared insolvent. It
came on the heels of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.'s
nationalization in October.
	   A handful of customers waited outside a Nippon Credit branch in
the central-Tokyo district of Shinjuku before it opened early
Monday. But a bank spokesman said there were no signs of panic.
	   ``All branches opened as usual, but extra employees were made
available to deal with questions from customers,'' Nippon Credit
spokesman Yoichi Morozumi said.
	   The bank was nationalized with at least 3.2 trillion yen (dlrs
28 billion) in unrecoverable or high-risk loans and massive stock
valuation losses, financial authorities said. Many of the loans
went bad after the bursting of a speculative asset price bubble at
the outset of the 1990s.
	   All deposits and transactions at the bank have been guaranteed
by the government. New managers were expected to be appointed by a
special government panel as soon as Tuesday after top Nippon Credit
executives stepped down Sunday.
	   Prime Minister Obuchi has pledged to restructure Nippon Credit,
but its ultimate fate remains unknown.
	   The Yomiuri newspaper, Japan's largest daily, reported in its
evening edition that Nippon Credit's operations would likely be
transferred to Chuo Trust and Banking Co.
	   Chuo Trust had denied reports last week that it was considering
a buyout of Nippon Credit, triggering the government's move toward
nationalization.
	   Meanwhile, U.S. credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service
welcomed the government's move by announcing it has placed Nippon
Credit's rating on review for a possible upgrade.
	   Also Monday, the Obuchi government defended a decision made by
its predecessor to pump 60 billion yen (dlrs 519 billion) in
taxpayer funds into Nippon Credit back in March.
	   Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka told reporters the
previous administration of former premier Ryutaro Hashimoto ``did
not have a grasp on the situation'' of the bank's depleted capital
reserves, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   The Financial Supervisory Agency, which was set up in June, has
said Nippon Credit had become insolvent by late March.
	   Separately, securities authorities said Monday they have
launched an investigation into possible insider trading of Nippon
Credit stock immediately prior to the bank's nationalization.
	   The joint probe by the Securities and Exchange Surveillance
Commission and Tokyo Stock Exchange was triggered by suspicions
about a tenfold surge in the number of Nippon Credit shares traded
last Thursday and Friday compared to a recent daily average.
	   The stock exchange on Monday delisted shares of Nippon Credit,
which traded for the last time Friday, closing down 3.1 percent to
158 yen (dlrs 1.37).
	   Nippon Credit, with 2,000 employees, was among the world's top
50 banks in 1997, according to Fortune magazine, with assets
totaling 12.3 trillion yen (dlrs 106 billion).

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police said they are mystified as
to who placed a bomb at the Democracy Monument in Bangkok and what
their motive might have been, local papers reported on Monday.
	   The small bomb exploded on Friday near the base of the monument,
which was a rallying point for students and other demonstrators who
helped overthrow military governments in 1973 and 1992.
	   The blast scattered bricks and glass, but no one was injured.
	   Police said they are keeping a close watch on the leaders of
``certain political groups'' who may be ``ill-intentioned''
according to the Bangkok Post.

Miners protest against pension reform and planned restructuring

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ An underground sit-in by coal miners
spread to two more mines Monday to protest proposed pension changes
and the planned closing of inefficient mines.
	   Ten miners from the Czeczott mine in Miedzna-Wola, 340
kilometers (200 miles) south of Warsaw, started the sit-in 650
meters (about 600 yards) underground on Thursday to protest the new
pension proposal under debate in parliament.
	   Some workers at two other mines joined later in the week, and
the protest spread to two more mines on Monday, bringing the total
number of miners involved to 42, the PAP state news agency
reported.
	   The lower chamber of parliament has approved changing the
retirement rules, setting age limits of 65 for men and 60 for
women. Under the current formula, miners could retire with full
pensions after 25 years of work, no matter their age.
	   Marek Gora, the government official in charge of pension reform,
said the new law would allow early retirement for people working in
harmful conditions until 2006.
	   But the Solidarity union plans a two-hour warning strike next
week and a vote on whether to call a general strike over the
pension reform and a plan to restructure the mining sector.
	   A mining restructuring plan adopted by the lower parliament
chamber in November calls for reducing production and cutting jobs
to strengthen the bloated, inefficient industry.
	   The restructuring plan would reduce production from 137 million
tons last year to 110 million tons in 2002. Wage increases would be
limited and the number of jobs would be cut by more than 40 percent
_ from 245,000 now to 138,000 in three years.
	   Restructuring loss-making industries such as mining, steel and
transportation is part of Poland's strategy to reform its economy
after decades of communist rule and prepare for membership in the
European Union.
	   Coal mining, once the country's leading hard-currency earner
during communist times, is still heavily subsidized under Poland's
market reforms that began in 1990.

Malaysia sees no need yet to take action against CNN and CNBC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The government said Monday it saw
no need as yet to punish two foreign television networks for what
it called ``biased'' and ``sensational reports'' on the troubled
country, a news report said.
	   Information Minister Mohamad Rahmat told parliament that the
ministry had met officials of the Atlanta-based Cable News Network
and Asia's CNBC and asked them to be more professional and less
sensational, the government news agency, Bernama, reported.
	   The government has accused foreign media that descended on
Malaysia to cover recent anti-government demonstrations of rooting
for the overthrow of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year
rule.
	   The leadership has charged that favorable coverage was given to
Mahathir's rival and ousted deputy, Anwar Ibrahim. News coverage of
Anwar's ongoing sex and corruption trial has drawn similar
complaints.
	   Officials from CNBC and other foreign news organizations have

Last of visiting U.N. weapons inspectors leave Iraq

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Two of the last three visiting U.N.
inspection teams left Baghdad Monday, ending their current round of
search for Iraq's illegal weapons, a U.N. official said.
	   The remaining team will leave later Monday, said Caroline Cross,
spokeswoman for the United Nations Special Commission.
	   Up to 140 resident experts, however, will remain in the country
to ensure that Iraq does not use the weapons for illegal purposes.
	   Cross said those inspectors continued their work Monday.
	   ``Our inspectors are on their way for another day of
inspections,'' she said.
	   The surprise inspections are the final test of Iraq's compliance
with UNSCOM before chief weapons inspector Richard Butler reports
to the U.N. Security Council this week on whether Baghdad has kept
its promise to fully cooperate in the search for banned weapons.
	   The United States and Britain called off air strikes after Iraq
pledged to resume cooperation with UNSCOM on Nov. 14. Washington
and London maintain that military strikes remain an option to
compel Baghdad to cooperate with the inspectors.
	   The council must decide that Iraq is fully cooperating with
inspectors before it will undertake a comprehensive review of
Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Iraqi leaders see the review as the quickest route to easing or
lifting sweeping economic sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
	   UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency must certify
that Baghdad has eliminated banned weapons before the Security
Council can lift the sanctions.
	   Al-Jumhuriya, Iraq's government newspaper said Monday that
Baghdad was not too optimistic about Butler's report. Iraq, which
accuses the U.N. disarmament commission of spying for the United
States and Israel, says Butler works for the Americans.
	   ``What should we expect from a report of a failing diplomat and
an irresponsible spy like Butler or his spy teams?'' al-Jumhuriya
said in an editorial.

High school teachers strike, demand bigger salaries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ High school teachers went on a day-long
strike on Monday, demanding a 12-percent salary hike and a larger
share of the government budget for education.
	   The teachers' union called on students to stay at home.
	   The union decided to stage the strike after months of fruitless
negotiations with the government and a series of warning protests
and walkouts.
	   Teachers, who earn the equivalent of dlrs 360 per month _ less
than the national average salary of dlrs 450 _ had already staged
strikes in May, June and November, briefly paralyzing the education
system.
	   The government argues it cannot meet wage demands.
	   Parliament is to discuss the 1999 budget later this week. Vesna
Kanizaj, head of the nation's five largest teachers' unions, said
the unions appealed to parliamentary deputies to earmark 210
million kuna (dlrs 35 million) for teachers' salary increases. The
unions also say the annual 8 percent presently spent on education
by the government is too little.
	   Workers increasingly resort to strikes and rallies to express
frustration with low wages and rising costs and the perception that
a tiny majority is growing richer through corruption and political
connections.

Iran, Thailand into semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; ADDS details, quotes, byline &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK MCDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Down to nine men in extra time against
South Korea, underdog Thailand pulled one of the biggest upsets of
the Asian Games Monday when Thawatchai Damrong-Ongtrakul took a
short pass from a free kick and fired 40 meters to win 2-1.
	   Iran cruised into the semifinals with an easy 4-0 victory over
Uzbekistan, with Bayern Munich star Ali Daei scoring three goals
within seven minutes in the second half.
	   The capacity crowd at Rajamangala National Stadium erupted into
cheers and flag-waving when Thawatchai's low shot cleared the South
Korean defensive wall and blew past keeper Kim Byung-ji to
unexpectedly put the host nation into the semifinals.
	   Now South Korea and Japan, co-hosts of the 2002 World Cup and
both finalists in this year's World Cup, are both out of the Asian
Games tournament, although neither sent its top team to Bangkok.
	   The Thais played with grit and persistence in the largely
scoreless match, refusing to give up a goal even when top striker
Worrawoot Srimaka was sent off early in the second half for a
retaliatory elbow into the face of Korean defender Park Jin-sup.
	   When a goal finally came, it was Thai striker Kiatisuk
Senamuang, 10 minutes before the end of regulation time, collecting
a pass and shipping it in from seven meters.
	   Six minutes later, a second Thai defender was sent off for
bringing down Yoo Sang-chul at the top of the penalty area.
	   Yoo fired the free kick cleanly into the goal to make it 1-1.
	   Peter Withe, the British coach who put confidence into the Thai
side, told reporters later that after regulation time ended, he
told Thawatchai that if he had any chances on a free kick to take
them.
	   Thawatchai got his chance six minutes into sudden death extra
time and knocked the stunned Koreans out of the Asian Games.
	   ``I went on to the pitch when we were down to nine players and I
told them we could still win the game,'' Withe said. ``When it was
sudden death I told them, `Look at Korea, they're sitting down.' ''
	   Korean coach Huh Jung-moo said the Thais had fouled his players
every time they neared the goal mouth and that the referees
consistently failed to catch it.
	   Star striker Choi Yong-soo, who had seven goals going into the
match, was completely shut down.
	   Huh said that his side, heavily favored to finish with a medal,
had come to Bangkok mainly looking for experience to take to the
2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
	   Daei went on a scoring spree in the second half to power Iran
into the Asian games semifinals.
	   Iran went ahead 1-0 in the first half on Ali Reza
Mosavi-Hasanzadeh's goal in the 28th minute.
	   Then Iran turned up its game and dominated the second half.
	   Daei chipped in a shot just inside the penalty area to make it
2-0 in the 37th minute. Then he made a brilliant individual effort
for 3-0, scampering past two defenders to score from just outside
the penalty area in front of the goal.
	   Barely two minutes later, he added another. On a corner kick, he
was in front of the goal with one defender trying to mark him and
Karim Bagheri. The ball sailed over Bagheri's head and Daei headed
a bouncer that Uzbek goalie Pavel Bugaio got a hand on it but
couldn't stop from going into the net.
	   In the semifinals Wednesday, Iran takes on the winner of
China-Turkmenistan while Thailand meets the Qatar-Kuwait winner.

Chinese dissident back from exile faces subversion charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Foreign reporters will be barred from the most
high-profile prosecution of a dissident in China in two years, a
government official said Monday.
	   Three days before Wang Youcai's trial on subversion charges,
court officials in Hangzhou city have not decided if any public
observers will be allowed to attend, said a Zhejiang provincial
government spokesman, who only gave his surname, Bao.
	   Wang was a principal organizer of the would-be China Democracy
Party, which sought to challenge the Communist Party's 49-year ban
on opposition politics. He was among the first to announce the
opposition group's formation in June.
	   His trial on Thursday will likely be the first of several
against prominent dissidents involved in the party. Xu Wenli and
Qin Yongmin, arrested at the start of the crackdown two weeks ago,
have also been accused of endangering state security, a catchall
crime that includes subversion.
	   A long-exiled dissident who sneaked into China to help boost the
democracy party's organization, Wang Ce, has also been charged with
endangering state security, the Hong Kong-based Information Center
of Human Rights and Democratic Movement reported Monday.
	   Wang Ce, who left China in 1984, earned a Ph.D. in Hawaii and
then settled in Spain, slipped into China via Macau in October.
Authorities in Hangzhou city detained him on Nov. 2 immediately
after he met with Wang Youcai, the Information Center said.
	   Two other activists detained along with Wang Ce _ Li Li, who had
been living in France, and Huang Heqing, a local activist from
Zhejiang province _ remain in detention.
	   Wang Ce was an active participant in Chinese dissident politics
abroad and had been refused permission previously to return to
China, the group said.
	   The charge against Wang Ce probably stems from his plans to give
dlrs 1,000 to Wang Youcai to buy a computer, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center said.
	   Wang Youcai first rose to prominence as a student leader of the
democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989. He would be
the most influential member of the dissident community to be put on
trial since fellow student leader Wang Dan in 1996.
	   Although foreign reporters have been barred, judicial officials
in Hangzhou have not decided whether the trial will be closed to
the public, said the Zhejiang spokesman, Bao.
	   Prominent trials almost always result in guilty verdicts in
China's politically malleable judicial system.
	   Wang Youcai's efforts to form a defense have been frustrated.
One lawyer who planned to take the case, Wang Wenjiang, has been
detained three times in the past two days and was believed to be in
custody on Monday, the Information Center said. Calls to the
lawyer's office for comment were not answered.
	   Despite the intensity of the crackdown, small but bold groups in
China have called on the government to release the democracy
advocates.
	   A friend of Wang Youcai in his hometown in Zhejiang province
gathered signatures from 180 farmers, private businessmen and
others arguing he had been exercising legitimate rights and
appealing for his immediate release, the Information Center
reported.
	   Exiled dissidents also have been lobbying on behalf of the
democracy campaigners. On Monday, 22 of them released a statement
calling on U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and governments and
human rights groups to pressure China for the release of Xu, Qin,
Wang Youcai and Wang Ce.
	   The statement from the Washington-based Free China Movement said
the crackdown showed China was violating rights protected under two
key U.N. human rights treaties Beijing signed in the past 14
months.

Antagonists in German Holocaust debate agree talking must go on
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The two leading players in a new German debate
over how to remember the Holocaust agreed in their first
face-to-face meeting that the right language for Germany's past had
yet to be found.
	   In a weekend discussion arranged by the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung newspaper and published Monday, German Jewish leader Ignatz
Bubis retracted his earlier charge that a speech about Holocaust
memory by prize-winning author Martin Walser amounted to
``spiritual arson.''
	   In the October speech, Walser warned against ``exploitation'' of
German guilt about the Holocaust ``for present purposes,'' and said
that the horror of Auschwitz should not become ``a routine
threat.''
	   In their face-to-face meeting, Bubis said he believed Walser had
``the very best intentions,'' but accused him of lending indirect
support to neo-Nazis by speaking in imprecise terms.
	   ``You are pillorying those who use Auschwitz as a means of
intimidation,'' Bubis said to Walser. ``Whom do you mean? German
politicians? Survivors elsewhere?''
	   Walser said he was referring generally to media coverage of
German unification, for example, when Auschwitz was cited by some
critics as a just reason for Germany's Cold War division, and that
reuniting the country would ``inevitably'' lead to a new Auschwitz.
	   He also was angry with critics who fault any new German
literature that doesn't mention the Holocaust, he said.
	   Walser denied that he was referring to new claims for
compensation from former Nazi-era slave laborers _ as some have
charged.
	   ``Why then couldn't I have spoken of banks and insurance
companies,'' he asked rhetorically.
	   Walser said he perhaps should have stressed more that the German
public should keep the memory of the Holocaust alive, but said
feelings cannot be dictated to individuals.
	   He said he wanted to ``find a language in which many people can
see themselves expressed, because in the end how they think of
Auschwitz remains left to them.''
	   Both Walser and Bubis agreed that an appropriate language for
dealing with Germany's past has yet to be found.

South Korean workers protest business swap
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Tens of thousands of workers rallied
and marched in two cities Monday, demanding cancellation of an
industry shakeup they fear will lead to mass layoffs.
	   The protests were the largest by workers of Samsung Motors Inc.
and Daewoo Electronics Co. since their parent conglomerates agreed
to swap, or merge, many debt-ridden subsidiaries as part of a
government-mediated restructuring plan.
	   One industry study estimates that the dlrs 10 billion deal would
result in up to 40,000 workers being laid off.
	   ``Scrap the swap deal,'' an estimated 10,000 Daewoo workers
shouted at a rally in front of their head office in central Seoul.
They later marched several blocks to a Roman Catholic church.
Thousands of police stood by but did not intervene.
	   In the southern port city of Pusan, about 10,000 Samsung Motors
workers held a rally, shouting for the cancellation of the deal.
	   The Samsung-Daewoo deal is a key part of an industrial
restructuring in which the nation's top five conglomerates _
Hyundai, Samsung, LG, Daewoo and SK _ will spin off half of their
264 subsidiaries.
	   Samsung Motors will be absorbed by Daewoo Motors, the nation's
No. 2 carmaker, while Daewoo Electronics will be merged into
Samsung's home appliance arm, the nation's largest.
	   Workers at the two companies have staged daily rallies since the
deal was announced on Monday.
	   President Kim Dae-jung said restructuring South Korea's bloated,
family-controlled conglomerates, or chaebol, was crucial to
boosting foreign confidence in the country's battered economy.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ In 1962, with the Cold War at its frostiest, a
young baker risked his life to get his family out of communist East
Germany by tunneling under the newly built Berlin Wall.
	   In the West, he was hailed as a hero. On the other side of the
wall, however, Rudolf Mueller was called a killer because he made
his getaway by shooting point-blank at a startled young border
guard.
	   The Wall is gone now, as is East Germany, but the case has been

	   Proceedings were suspended after only 90 minutes, however, after
the defense challenged the neutrality of the judges. Another court
was expected to rule on the motion by Friday.
	   Mueller's case is believed to be the first to reverse the

of former East German border guards and officials on charges
related to shooting those trying to flee to the West.

Kohl hits new German government over NATO flap with U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Speaking out for the first time since his
election defeat, former chancellor Helmut Kohl scolded Germany's
new government for challenging the United States over NATO nuclear
weapons strategy.
	   In an interview with the Sunday weekly Welt am Sonntag, Kohl
said it was ``incomprehensible'' that his successors had launched a
debate about whether to keep the policy that allows NATO to launch
a nuclear attack first.
	   ``Everyone knows that we west Germans were the main beneficiary
of the Americans' nuclear protection during the Cold War,'' said
Kohl, who lost September elections that brought a center-left
government to power.
	   ``If one knows what the Americans did for us, then one also
knows what impression a debate launched by Germany about first use
of nuclear weapons makes in America.''
	   Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer has suggested that, with the
Cold War over, NATO should drop the nuclear threat and adopt a ``no
first use'' policy. The Clinton administration has flatly ruled
that out.
	   The United States believes NATO still needs the nuclear threat,
particularly to deter attacks with chemical or biological arms.
	   Fischer is a leader of the Greens, an environmentalist party
with an anti-NATO tradition. The Greens are the junior governing
partner of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat.
	   In an interview aired Sunday night on German television ZDF,
Kohl said that despite political differences, he had had
discussions since his defeat with the new chancellor and foreign
minister.
	   ``One has to talk when it's about our country,'' he said,
declining to detail specifics.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton took
his quest for Mideast peace for the first time to Palestinian
territory Monday, and Yasser Arafat declared that through Clinton
``peace will prevail in the Middle East.''
	   Giant American and Palestinian flags draped the new Palestinian
airport control tower and a high-rise apartment building downtown,
as Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton artrived in Gaza
from Israel aboard his Marine One helicopter.
	   ``We should never forget that under President Clinton's
sponsorship we signed a number of agreements at the White House and
through President Clinton, peace will prevail in the Middle East,''
Palestinian leader Arafat said in a meeting at his headquarters
with Clinton.
	   Clinton rieterated a commitment to the agreement negotiated at
Wye River, Maryland, by Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
	   ``I'm hoping it will be implemented by both sides,'' Clinton
said, sitting alongside Arafat.
	   He said Palestinians have an opportunity ``to make it clear they
are choosing the path of peace and partnership with Israel. We all
hope this will lead to a change of mind everywhere. This is a truly
significant thing.''
	   Clinton's visit was the first by an American president to
Palestinian land, bothering some Israelis and giving a morale boost
to Arafat in his drive for an independent state.
	   The Clintons alighted from their helicopter to a red carpet
greeting and handshakes from Arafat and other Palestinians.
	   ``It's an honor to have you here,'' said Arafat, as he asked
Clinton to cut a wide red ribbon opening the airport. Clinton made
no statement at the ceremonies but he and his wife waved small
sections of the ribbon and applauded along with Arafat and a crowd
of Palestinian dignitaries.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called Clinton's trip
to Gaza historic. ``It's a very important sign of progress here in
the peace process,'' she said. ``It's a visible sign of what we
accomplished in the Wye talks.''
	   Banners strung along the airport access road read ``Welcome to
Palestine, Mr. Clinton'' and posters on walls in Gaza City
proclaimed: ``We have a dream. Free Palestine.''
	   Clinton's appearance at a special session of the Palestine
National Council on Monday was to be the centerpiece of his
three-day Middle East trip aimed at salvaging the crisis-plagued
land-for-security peace accord he helped broker in October.
	   The main dividend for Israel is the expected confirmation by the
PNC that clauses in its 1964 charter proposing the destruction of
the Jewish state are nullified.
	   ``That will be a welcomed development,'' Netanyahu said Sunday.
	   For the nearly 3 million Palestinians who live on the West Bank
and in Gaza, the president's visit has symbolic significance,
beginning with his arrival by helicopter at their own international
airport at Rafah.
	   Arafat, other top officials of the Palestinian Authority and an
honor guard welcomed Clinton, while on the eastern edge of the
strip, U.S. Commerce Secretary William M. Daley was opening an
industrial zone.
	   Still, Clinton and his senior aides say their intention was not
to encourage Palestinian statehood aspirations and the issue
remains to be considered in negotiations with Israel.
	   Clinton appealed to Palestinians Sunday in Jerusalem to prove
their peaceful intentions ``in word and deed.'' He also urged
Israel to acknowledge the ``legitimate expectations'' of their
longtime foes.
	   ``The violent past and the difficult present do not have to be
repeated forever,'' Clinton said,
	   Netanyahu assured Clinton that Israel was ``prepared to do our
part,'' but he linked any further Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank to Arafat renouncing his plans to declare statehood and taking
steps to squelch violence.
	   ``I'm sure that we can achieve peace between Palestinians and
Israelis if we stand firm on Palestinian compliance,'' Netanyahu
said.
	   He urged Clinton to take that message to Arafat in Gaza.

Germany praised Greece's austerity program
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Countries hoping to join the European
Union should look to Greece as an example of successful integration
into the bloc, Germany's foreign minister said Monday.
	   ``Greece is an important example of European integration. The
countries due to come into the EU must pay particular attention to
this example,'' said Joschka Fischer, whose country is due to take
over the EU's rotating presidency on Jan. 1.
	   For years, Greece lagged behind its EU partners, suffering with
double-digit inflation and a bloated public sector. But its efforts
to streamline its economy appear to be paying off.
	   Inflation has fallen to 4.2 percent and the deficit has been
trimmed to below 3 percent of its gross domestic product, which is
one of the criteria for joining the EU's single currency.
	   ``We are particularly glad for (Greece's) economic successes and
the efforts being made, and for the capability Greece has to join
the euro,'' Fischer said.
	   Greece is the only EU nation that failed to meet fiscal
requirements to join the group planning to introduce the euro Jan.
1.
	   Britain, Sweden and Denmark have opted out of participation for
now.
	   Greece's Socialist government has staked its political
reputation on being ready to join by 2001, the year the euro is
expected to go into circulation.
	   Negotiations for the entry of new members into the EU are
expected to be one of the top issues during the six-month German
presidency.
	   While in Athens, Fischer made no public comments on a major
dispute between the EU's rich and poorer nations, including Greece,
over how to pay to expand the 15-nation bloc.
	   A German-led initiative seeks to freeze EU spending at its
current level. The EU's poorest members _ Spain, Portugal, Greece
and Ireland _ fear that they could lose important EU funds as
spending is diverted to helping the new nations meet EU standards.
	   The EU has begun membership negotiations with six countries -
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus.

Most Asian stock markets close lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed sharply lower
Monday, with prices slumping both in Tokyo and Hong Kong for a
third consecutive session.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 294.02
points, or 2.04 percent, to close at 14,111.62 for a third straight
day of losses. On Friday, the average fell 402.16 points, or 2.72
percent.
	   Japanese stocks fell amid rekindled fears of instability in the
bad debt-ridden banking system after the government took over
ailing lender Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. on Sunday, traders said.
	   The compulsory nationalization of Nippon Credit marked the
second time a top lender has come under state control in less than
two months. The government took over the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd. on Oct. 23.
	   The market was also pushed down by worse-than-expected results
from a closely-watched quarterly Bank of Japan survey tracking
business sentiment.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 115.62 yen in late
afternoon trading, down 1.66 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also
below its late New York level of 116.42 yen Friday.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong slumped as investors continued to take
profits following falls in overseas markets.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 126.79 points, or 1.3
percent, closing at 9,825.21. On Friday, the index had lost 363.44
points, or 3.5 percent.
	   The Hong Kong market was dragged down by weakness in other Asian
bourses as well as Friday's fall on Wall Street, brokers said.
	   Thai share prices also tumbled as local investors sold the
market down in line with regional declines, traders said.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index lost 15.41 points, or 4.3
percent, to close 344.89.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed sharply lower in reaction to
falls in most Asian stock markets. The Straits Times Index fell 2.3
percent, or 31.77 points, to 1,379.50.
	   SYDNEY : Australian share prices closed sharply lower as weaker
Asian and European markets and a tumble in resources stocks
combined to snuff out investor confidence. The All Ordinaries Index
fell 2 percent, or 53.5 points, to 2,676.5.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower for the fifth consecutive
session. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 50.24
points, or 0.72 percent, to 6,889.50.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower in line with
regional markets. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 22.02
points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,919.55.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower as most blue-chips
succumbed to profit-taking after two sessions of strong gains. The
30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 34.81 points, or 1.9
percent, to 1,800.80.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed higher on buying by small local
investors. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 4.13 points,
or 0.7 percent, to 559.30.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed mixed. The Composite Index
slipped 0.892 point to 404.703.

Official: Ukraine ponders restructuring of its 1999 foreign debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Unless it receives more international aid,
Ukraine might have to ask foreign lenders if it can delay next
year's debt payments, the finance minister was quoted as saying
Monday.
	   The government is already working out proposals for
restructuring its 1999 foreign debt obligations, but still hopes
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank will resume
their aid to Ukraine, Ihor Mitiukov told the independent Ukrainian
News agency.
	   The IMF postponed the latest tranche of its dlrs 2.2 billion
loan to Ukraine last month over the government's poor tax
collection and sluggish reforms. It said it would resume aid only
when Ukraine approves a realistic 1999 budget and radical reform
steps.
	   The delay also automatically put off further disbursement of the
World Bank's dlrs 950 million aid package, which depends on the
IMF's positive assessment of the Ukrainian government's reform
policies.
	   Mitiukov said the failure to receive foreign aid in 1999 would
mean further destabilization of Ukraine's declining economy and
devaluation of the national currency, the hryvna.
	   ``We would have to impose additional controls on the currency
market to raise the hard currency, and that could lead to a
significant devaluation of the hryvna,'' Mitiukov told Ukrainian
News.
	   Ukraine badly needs foreign loans to replenish its hard currency
reserves, now at around dlrs 1 billion, because its debt
obligations in 1999 so far exceed the amount of the reserves.
	   The former Soviet republic's economy has been steadily declining
since 1991, when it won independence. The government never carried
out reforms to boost business activity and instead accumulated huge
debts in its efforts to resolve mounting economic problems.
	   The Cabinet is now owed more than dlrs 2.5 billion in unpaid
taxes, and owes more than dlrs 1 billion in overdue wages to state
employees, which would force it to seek more loans next year to pay
off foreign debts.
	   Government officials have acknowledged that Ukraine does not
have reliable sources of foreign aid for 1999 except for the IMF
and the World Bank because foreign investors have largely fled the
region following Russia's economic crisis, which struck in
mid-August.

Toulouse bus drivers go on strike after bus is burned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Bus drivers in Toulouse went on strike
Monday after youths burned one of their buses during a night of
rioting to avenge the shooting death of one of their friends.
	   The buses drivers justified their walkout by saying it wasn't
safe to work. Striking drivers also picketed the local bus depot in
Toulouse, a city of 350,000 people in south-central France.
	   The strikers also said the driver of the bus that was set on
fire was attacked by rioters. However, management said the driver
was stuck by glass after the windshield was shattered by a baseball
bat.
	   Youths in Toulouse rioted Sunday to avenge the shooting death of
a youth who was killed earlier in the morning by a stray police
bullet.
	   At least 150 police faced off up to 200 youths in a working
class district with an unemployment rate of 35 percent. The angry
youths threw stones and Molotov cocktails at security forces.
	   Six policemen were injured. No youths were reported hurt.

Officials planning to seek Japan's help to save Philippine Airlines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government is planning
to seek Japan's help to save the financially beleaguered Philippine
Airlines, which needs a new foreign investor, officials said
Monday.
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said the Philippines would
ask Japan to provide about dlrs 150 million to PAL using a dlrs 30
billion fund Tokyo has set aside to provide loans to Asian
countries hit by the region's financial crisis.
	   The Philippines has earlier sought financing for 33 government
projects totaling dlrs 7.9 billion from the so-called Miyazawa
fund, which Japan has prepared to help revive East Asian economies
battered by the financial turmoil.
	   ``Considering the importance of PAL, we're now looking under the
Miyazawa initiative for support,'' Espiritu told reporters.
	   PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 following labor
disputes and mounting losses worsened by Asia's financial crisis.
It then began negotiations with Cathay Pacific, but the Hong Kong
carrier later pulled out of the talks.
	   Negotiations with other prospective investors, including
Northwest Airlines, have also failed. PAL is seeking government
approval of a rehabilitation plan calling for the infusion of at
least dlrs 150 million in new capital, which should be financed by
PAL's current owner and a new foreign investor.
	   Espiritu did not say if potential financing from the Japanese
fund would be used as new capital or take the form of a loan for
PAL.
	   He said they would notify Japanese government agencies
overseeing the Miyazawa fund, including Tokyo's Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund, to agree to provide money to the Philippine flag
carrier.
	   The Philippines, however, isn't regarded by Tokyo as an urgent
case for assistance, because its economy has remained robust amid
the regional crisis.
	   In June, PAL sought relief from payment of dlrs 2.1 billion in
debts due to its financial problems, which it attributed to
mounting losses in most of the past 15 years.
	   In the fiscal year that ended March, PAL posted a loss of 8.08
billion pesos (dlrs 205 million), its biggest loss in its 57-year
history.

 &UR; Unions face court action over strike

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Coal miners who began a 48-hour
strike Monday over low coal prices offered to Japan's steel
industry have been ordered back to work by the nation's labor
relations board.
	   A coalition of companies had sought the intervention of the
Australian Industrial Relations Commission, applying for an order
against the Construction, Forestry Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU).
	   Union members walked off the job Monday, angered at miners MIM,
Shell and
	   the North Goonyella Mine accepting an 18 percent, U.S. dlrs 9 a
metric ton, cut in the Japanese price of coking coal, used for
making steel.
	   Federal Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith described the
strike as ``totally unauthorized'' because union members have
breached no-strike agreements under the Workplace Relations Act.
	   Companies now have the option of seeking compensation from union
members for any losses from the strike, he said.
	   According to CFMEU spokesman Paddy Gorman, the union was
prepared to test
	   the government's claims the strike action was illegal.
	   ``This is a test for the current government ... I think it is
the first time they've had a national strike against them, so if
they think it's illegal, let's see them in court,'' he said.
	   Mining companies estimate the strike will cost the industry 56
million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 34 million) in lost
production.
	   Reith said the coal industry had one of the highest levels of
strikes, undermining Australia's reputation as a reliable and
consistent supplier.
	   ``The CFMEU are bloody-minded when it comes to the national
interest, they undermine the interests of their own workers, they
run a political agenda,'' he said.
	   ``Now they want the Australian government to control the
international price of a major commodity, obviously something
outside our control,'' he said.
	   But CFMEU mining division general president Tony Maher said the
government had failed to address a general coal crisis that had
sparked major job losses and are threatening more.
	   ``Coal is Australia's biggest export earner -- it earns 10
billion (Australian dollars) a year for the country so a 20 percent
drop means 2 billion lost to Australia,'' Maher said.
	   He said the price cut would mean further job losses in an
industry already reeling from the loss of 4,000 jobs in the past 12
months.
	   ``For every mine worker lost, another three jobs are lost from
the flow on effect -- that means 16,000 jobs lost,'' he said.
	   ``Now there'll be many more on the scrap heap.''
	   Maher believes the problems in the coal industry stem from an
oversupply of coal.
	   ``There's 20 million ton excess capacity coming out of
Australia,'' he said.
	   ``We're allowing too many new mines to come on stream and the
government just sits back and lets them open up new mines.''
	   In accepting the price cut, mine owners had made a ``blind
grab'' for market share instead of price, Maher said.

Muslim leaders split on civilian militia plan in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALI KOTARUMALOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's Muslim political leaders
were split Monday over a proposal by the powerful armed forces to
raise a civilian militia as precaution against pro-democracy
protests ahead of elections next year.
	   One opposition party denounced the plan as illogical and costly.
Human rights activists also criticized it.
	   However, Abdurrahman Wahid, the leader of Indonesia's largest
Islamic group, Nahdlatul Ulama, said he supported the setting up of
a militia as long as it was run by the Indonesia's military
commander Gen. Wiranto.
	   Wahid, whose group has 30 million members, has held separate
talks with Wiranto and President B.J. Habibie in recent days.
	   Under the controversial plan, about 40,000 young people are to
be trained for three-months by the army. They will be equipped with
sticks, riot shields and handcuffs while being granted powers of
arrest.
	   Officials said as many 200,000 young, unemployed people might
eventually be recruited for the group to be known as ``Rakyat
Terlatih,'' or ``trained people.''
	   Wiranto said Sunday the militia would assist police and troops
whose resources have been stretched by a prolonged campaign of
student protests during recent weeks.
	   Last month thousands of unemployed youths were hired as private
security guards to protect the nation's highest legislative body,
the People's Consultative Assembly, against protests when it met
last month.
	   However, most of the recruits were taken off the streets after
they brawled with demonstrating students.
	   Sporadic rioting and looting has increased in recent months amid
economic and political turmoil in the world's fourth most populous
nation since authoritarian President Suharto quit power in May.
	   A breakdown in law and order in several areas has given rise to
a wave of politically-linked murders and vigilante groups.
	   Tensions between the Muslim majority and Christian minority have
flared with dozens of mosques and churches burned or ransacked.
	   Suharto's successor, Habibie, has promised democratic change,
including parliamentary election next June followed by a
presidential ballot by a special assembly late next year.
	   However, students have repeatedly taken to the streets, saying
his reform agenda is too slow and limited.
	   They also want Suharto, now being investigated for corruption,
put on trial immediately.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   Several major Muslim political parties have been set up in
recent months and are expected to play a crucial role in next
year's poll.
	   Opposition figure and likely presidential candidate, Amien Rais,
said the creation of a militia could trigger new security problems
for crisis-ridden Indonesia.
	   ``Its members could feel that they are special citizens and
could tend to be arrogant,'' said Rais, who is the former leader of
the 28 million-member Muhamadiyah Islamic group.
	   The opposition Islamic-based United Development Party criticized
the plan on grounds of cost at a time when Indonesia is grappling
with its worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   The party ``is sternly opposed the establishment of (a militia).
It is not necessary for the time being,'' said Zarkasih Nur, who
heads the party in Indonesia's parliament.
	   ``This will only create a problem of abuse of power by recruits
who won't be trained professionals,'' said Bambang Wijoyanto,
chairman of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation.

Sri Lanka wins first Asian Games golds in 24 years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 100-meter sprints, other track, bowling; South
Korea upset in soccer; will be updated with later medals &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's Koji Ito rebounded from a slow
start to claim honors Monday as Asia's fastest man, and looked on
the bright side of not joining the exclusive club of sprinters
faster than 10 seconds.
	   ``At least I excited everyone,'' he said after winning the 100
meters in 10.05. He had raised hopes by setting an Asian record of
10.00 in Sunday's semifinals.
	   Sri Lanka's runners were excited too, after winning their
nation's first two Asian Games gold medals in 24 years _ within
less than an hour.
	   But Asia's co-hosts for the 2002 World Cup soccer finals _ South
Korea and Japan _ suffered the embarrassment of not reaching the
Asian Games semifinals. Japan went out in the second round, and
Thailand upset South Korea in the quarterfinals Monday, 2-1, on
Thatwachai Damrong-Ongtrakul's 40-meter goal six minutes into extra
time, when the Thais were down to nine men.
	   Iran joined the Thais in the semifinals with an easy 4-0 victory
over Uzbekistan. Bayern Munich star Ali Daei scored three goals
within seven minutes in the second half.
	   The other semifinals were being decided later Monday, in games
between China and Turkmenistan, and between Qatar and Kuwait.
	   On the track, Ito was the slowest of the eight finalists out of
the blocks, costing him any chance of becoming the first non-black
athlete to crack 10 seconds for the 100.
	   Thailand's Seeharwong Reanchai edged Japan's Yasukatsu Otsuki
for the silver medal in a photo finish after both clocked 10.31.
	   In the women's 100, favored Susantika Jayasinghe of Sri Lanka
didn't even show up. The world 200 silver medalist said she had
hurt a hamstring in Sunday's semifinals.
	   China's Asian record holder Li Xuemei won in a wind-aided 11.05
seconds. China's Yali Li was second and India's Rachita Mistry got
a photo decision to take bronze. Li Xuemei said she hardly slept
overnight because of diarrhea and a fever.
	   But Sri Lankans won both the men's and women's 400 meters.
	   Damayanthi Darsha won the women's 400 in 51.57 seconds,
comfortably ahead of China's Chen Yuxiang, who struggled to a 52.50
finish. P.T. Usha, India's star before retiring eight years ago,
finished sixth in 54.37 in a return to the track.
	   In the next race, Sugath Tillekeratne held off Qatar's Ibrahim
Faraj in the men's 400, winning 44.99 to 45.32.
	   ``This is the first time that Sri Lanka has won a gold medal in
24 years,'' Darsha said. ``I am extremely happy, not only because I
have won the gold but it was my coach who had won the last gold in
1974.''
	   Coach Sunil Gumawardeme was a member of the 1974 winning
4x100-meter relay team.
	   Aside from Li's victory in the women's 100, China had golds in
the women's 10-kilometer walk, by Liu Hongyu, and the heptathlon,
where Shen Shengfei amassed 5,817 points for the seven events.
Kazakstan's Svetlana Kazanina was second at 5,775.
	   That boosted its total for the games to 82 golds.
	   South Korea's second-place total climbed to 38 as Lee Yong-sun
won the women's javelin event and cyclist Ji Sung-hwan beat Olympic
bronze medalist Takanobu Jumonji of Japan in the men's 1-kilometer
time trial.
	   Japan had 33, gained gold Monday from Ito and victory in the
solo synchronized swimming by Miya Tachibana, the world
championship bronze medalist.
	   India and Qatar won their first golds of these games, in the
women's and men's 1,500-meter races.
	   India's Jyotirmoy Sikdhar outsprinted China's Wang Qingfen to
win the women's 1,500.
	   Organizers angered jeering Indian fans by playing the wrong
anthem at Sikdhar's medal ceremony, so 10 minutes later they
brought the medalists out and played the right anthem.
	   Qatar's Mohamad Taib won the men's 1,500 for the third
successive games. He slowed down near the end, waving his rivals
closer, then turned around and made a rude gesture down the track.
	   Hong Kong won its second gold when Hui Cheung-kwok emerged the
winner in men's masters bowling competition. Taiwan's Chou Miao-lin
was the women's winner.
	   Even before their soccer upset, the Thais, who take numbers
seriously were celebrating winning their 13th gold medal of the
13th Asian Games on Sunday _ Dec. 13.
	   Their original target had been 10 golds at their home games.
Their best previous was 12 at the 1966 games in Bangkok.

Committees meet in lead-up to fourth round of peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Three of the five committees formed to
determine how to end five years of violence in Burundi began
week-long meetings Monday in a lead-up to the fourth round of peace
talks for the tiny Central African nation.
	   Former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, the mediator of the
talks, told participants that the talks were at a crucial stage and
``everybody expects a tangible outcome.''
	   During the last round of talks in October in this northern
Tanzanian town, representatives of 18 parties, movements and armed
factions discussed issues of democracy and good governance as well
as peace and security.
	   The next round of full-scale talks is scheduled to begin Jan.
18.
	   The democracy and good governance and peace and security
committees have been joined by the committee looking into the
nature of the conflict during this week's round of preparatory
meetings.
	   The current cycle of violence in Burundi broke out in October
1993 when Tutsi paratroopers killed the country's first
democratically elected president _ Hutu Melchior Ndadaye _ in a
failed coup attempt.
	   Since then at least 200,000 people have been killed, most of
them civilians caught in crossfire between the Tutsi-dominated army
and Hutu rebels.
	   Hutus account fo 65 percent of Burundi's population of 6.2
million, Tutsis make up 14 percent.

Clinton carries appeal for reconciliation to Arafat in Gaza
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more from Arafat, Clinton meeting; edits
throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton took
his quest for Mideast peace for the first time to Palestinian
territory Monday, and Yasser Arafat declared that through Clinton
``peace will prevail in the Middle East.''
	   Giant American and Palestinian flags draped the new Palestinian
airport control tower and a high-rise apartment building downtown,
as Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived in Gaza to
a red-carpet welcome by Arafat.
	   ``We should never forget that under President Clinton's
sponsorship we signed a number of agreements at the White House and
through President Clinton, peace will prevail in the Middle East,''
Palestinian leader Arafat said in a meeting at his headquarters
with Clinton.
	   ``Through President Clinton, peace will prevail in the Middle
East,'' Arafat added.
	   Clinton appealed for a reconciliation with Israel and a
recommitment to the Wye River land-for-security accord.
	   Clinton, who held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Sunday, said of the Wye River accord,
``I'm committed to this agreement. I'm hoping it will be
implemented by both sides.
	   ``There are two historic elements to this day,'' he said. One is
Clinton's opportunity to witness a milestone meeting of the
Palestinian National Concil, Clinton said, and the other is the
Palestinians' chance to ``make it clear they are choosing the path
of peace and partnership with Israel. We all hope this will lead to
a change of mind everywhere. This is a truly significant thing.''
	   Clinton's visit, which is the first ever by an American
president to Palestinian-controlled land, could give a morale boost
to Palestinians in their drive for an independent state.
	   At the airport, one U.S. flag covered the entire length of the
control tower and smaller American and Palestinian fluttered from
lamp posts and buildings. Seemingly everywhere were posters
reading, ``We have a dream. Free Palestine.''
	   As he sat with Clinton in front of reporters and photographers,
Arafat said he wished Clinton had been driven to his headquarters
instead of flying by helicopter, ``because the people have lined
the streets from the airport, waiting to catch a glimpse of the
president and show their love and appreciation.''
	   Hundreds of school children lined Gaza's main north-south road
from the airport. They held American and Palestinian flags and
signs in Arabic and English reading ``Settlements Kill Peace,'' and
``Bill Clinton, welcome to Palestine.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called Clinton's trip
to Gaza historic. ``It's a very important sign of progress here in
the peace process,'' she said. ``It's a visible sign of what we
accomplished in the Wye talks.''
	   Banners strung along the airport access road read ``Welcome to
Palestine, Mr. Clinton'' and posters on walls in Gaza City
proclaimed: ``We have a dream. Free Palestine.''
	   Clinton's appearance at a special session of the Palestine
National Council on Monday was to be the centerpiece of his
three-day Middle East trip aimed at salvaging the crisis-plagued
land-for-security peace accord he helped broker in October.
	   The main dividend for Israel is the expected confirmation by the
PNC that clauses in its 1964 charter proposing the destruction of
the Jewish state are nullified.
	   ``That will be a welcomed development,'' Netanyahu said Sunday.
	   For the nearly 3 million Palestinians who live on the West Bank
and in Gaza, the president's visit has symbolic significance,
beginning with his arrival by helicopter at their own international
airport at Rafah.
	   Arafat, other top officials of the Palestinian Authority and an
honor guard welcomed Clinton, while on the eastern edge of the
strip, U.S. Commerce Secretary William M. Daley was opening an
industrial zone.
	   Still, Clinton and his senior aides say their intention was not
to encourage Palestinian statehood aspirations and the issue
remains to be considered in negotiations with Israel.
	   Clinton appealed to Palestinians Sunday in Jerusalem to prove
their peaceful intentions ``in word and deed.'' He also urged
Israel to acknowledge the ``legitimate expectations'' of their
longtime foes.
	   ``The violent past and the difficult present do not have to be
repeated forever,'' Clinton said,
	   Netanyahu assured Clinton that Israel was ``prepared to do our
part,'' but he linked any further Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank to Arafat renouncing his plans to declare statehood and taking
steps to squelch violence.
	   ``I'm sure that we can achieve peace between Palestinians and
Israelis if we stand firm on Palestinian compliance,'' Netanyahu
said.
	   He urged Clinton to take that message to Arafat in Gaza.

ASEAN leaders arrive for summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with Goh's comments that consensus unlikely,
Thai comment.

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Southeast Asian leaders flew in Monday for
their annual summit only to find that Cambodia once again was
grabbing the spotlight instead of the ``bold measures'' they are
expected to endorse to spark an economic turnaround.
	   There also were questions as to just how bold the measures were.
	   The leaders were peppered with questions as they arrived about
Cambodia's prospects of being admitted to the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations in time to participate as a full-fledged
member at the summit Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   The issue also dominated a Thai news conference, and reporters
closely watched every move and comment by Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen as he lobbied all day for support.
	   But it appeared unlikely that his efforts would be successful.
	   Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chuk Tong said there had been no
change in his country's position that Cambodia needs more time to
cement its new coalition government. He also tried, as other
officials have unsuccessfully, to shift the focus.
	   ``Cambodia is not the most important topic to be discussed,''
Goh said. ``The most important issue for us is how to recover from
the economic crisis.''
	   Hun Sen, who had hoped admission would add further legitimacy to
his new coalition government, sounded almost resigned to being
relegated to observer status again, saying that if Cambodia is not
accepted this time, next year would be acceptable.
	   ``We can wait,'' he said. ``Late or soon, we must join.''
	   Cambodia had been scheduled to join ASEAN in July 1997, but
political turmoil led to its admission being put on hold.
	   The leaders arrived in quick succession at Hanoi's Noibai
Airport, where an honor guard stood shivering on the tarmac on a
cool overcast day.
	   They were to attend a state dinner Monday night hosted by
Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, then have two days of
formal talks and bilateral meetings, along with discussions with
three ``dialogue partners'' _ Japan, China and South Korea.
	   They also are expected to endorse four documents that have been
prepared by their foreign and economic ministers and lay out
specific plans for helping the region recover from the economic
crisis.
	   The centerpiece is a batch of ``bold measures'' that would cut
into tax revenues in an effort to attract investment and create new
jobs.
	   ``The measures may not be as bold as some expected,'' Thai
government spokesman Akatol Sorasuchart said. ``But they will
include liberalization, open markets, tariff cuts with deadlines
that will be met. It's a step forward.''
	   A draft of the measures includes tariff cuts, investor
incentives, duty-free status for capital equipment, relaxed rules
on foreign ownership of land on a ``best-effort'' basis, and
speeded-up implementation of an ASEAN Free Trade Area and ASEAN
Investment Area.
	   Some of the measures would be put on a dual-track scenario that
would allow developing countries more time and leeway.
	   Some are to take effect almost immediately in an effort to shore
up investor confidence and show the world the region is willing to
take tough action instead of just talking about it.
	   ``I feel it will put us back on the investment map again,''
Philippine Trade Secretary Jose Pardo said. ``It will be too
difficult for investors in the West to refuse to take a hard look
at the opportunities that are here.''

Philippine peso closes higher, shares end lower on profit-taking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso closed slightly
higher against the U.S. dollar Monday, boosted by a stronger
Japanese yen and slack demand for dollars, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 38.956 pesos on the Philippine Dealing
System, down 4.8 centavos from 39.004 pesos Friday.
	   The peso has been gaining steadily in recent weeks due to light
domestic corporate demand and strong inflows of the U.S. currency,
mostly brought by thousands of Filipino workers returning home from
abroad for the Christmas holidays. A stronger yen also has propped
up the peso, traders said.
	   Dealers expect the peso to trade largely sideways in the coming
days, with some demand for dollars expected around the 38.80 peso
level.
	   Volume declined to dlrs 109 million from Friday's dlrs 170.5
million.
	   Philippine shares, meanwhile, closed lower Monday as most
blue-chips succumbed to profit-taking after two sessions of strong
gains, traders said.
	   Wall Street's losses Friday and continued worries over a
slowdown in U.S. and European economies likewise gave investors in
Philippine stocks an excuse to unload some of their portfolios.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 34.81 points,
or 1.9 percent, to close at 1800.80 points Monday from Friday's
1835.61 points.
	   ``The market is merely testing the resistance level of 1800
points in the absence of any market-moving domestic news,'' said
Erwin Bautista, an analyst at Securities 2000, Inc.
	   Bautista noted that blue-chips are suffering the most from the
technical sell down as these are held by foreign portfolio
managers.
	   Joey Roxas, president of Eagle Securities Inc., said the
market's decline partly was caused by the approach of the Christmas
holidays, which has dampened activity in the local bourse.
	   Most investors in the market are local traders, he said, with
foreign portfolio managers continuing to soften their holdings in
the Philippines and other Asian countries.
	   ``The market is continuing the slide for December mainly because
of lesser volumes and less interest in the market,'' he said.
	   Volume of shares transacted Monday totaled 2.66 billion worth
PHP988.6 million. Losers swamped gainers 78 to 26, with 33 issues
left unchanged.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thirty-two more Laotians have graduated
from a training course on how to dispose of unexploded bombs and
ammunition and will start removing the deadly devices from their
country's landscape, Lao government radio said on Monday.
	   Laos is littered with thousands of unexploded bombs dropped by
American planes during the Vietnam War, which ended in 1975.
	   American and Lao instructors trained the ordinance removers in
the nine-week course. On Friday, they joined 780 others already
working to rid the country of the bombs, the report said.
	   The program is funded by the government of Laos, the United
Nations Development Program, the United Nations International
Children's Fund, several European government and the United States.

Salt Lake regrets embarrassment from alleged rules violations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Salt Lake City Olympic organizers,
embroiled in a scandal over alleged bribes, received a vote of
confidence Monday in their preparations for the 2002 Winter Games.
	   Winter sports federations ``unanimously and quite movingly
expressed their support'' for the Salt Lake committee, organizing
chief Frank Joklik said.
	   ``It was totally spontaneous and, to us, somewhat unexpected,''
Joklik said after a meeting with leaders of the seven sports on the
Winter Games program.
	   Among those praising the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC)
was Marc Hodler, the Swiss IOC member who has used the word
``bribe'' to describe the controversial scholarship program
operated during Salt Lake's bid for the games.
	   The IOC has launched a high-level investigation into the
project, which provided nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to 13
people, including six relatives of IOC members.
	   Joklik, who apologized Sunday for the ``embarrassment'' caused
by the program, said the scandal did not taint Monday's meeting.
	   ``There was no semblance of a cloud,'' he said. ``There is a
sense of reality that the preparation for the games should go on.''
	   Joklik said he was encouraged by IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch's statement that he believes that Salt Lake will put on
the best winter games ever.
	   ``I think we can make it happen,'' Joklik said.
	   Meanwhile, Joklik confirmed that Salt Lake officials met for the
second time Sunday night with the IOC panel investigating the
scholarship fund.
	   IOC vice president Dick Pound, who is heading the inquiry, said
the two sides met for just over an hour. They had met for 90
minutes Friday night.
	   Pound said he hopes to complete the investigation before the end
of January.
	   ``I'd like to have it out of the way so it doesn't impinge on
our doping congress in February, he said.
	   On Sunday, Joklik said, ``With hindsight, I believe this program
should not have been part of the bid campaign,'' Joklik said. ``I
apologize to the Olympic family and to the citizens of Utah for the
embarrassment caused by the bid committee program.''
	   Joklik said he still supported giving academic aid and athletic
training to young people from developing countries.
	   ``However, it should not be done in a way that might possibly
appear to influence improperly the voting of IOC members,'' he
said.
	   Samaranch said he was surprised and disappointed to learn of the
scholarships, but didn't regard them as grounds for taking the
games away from Salt Lake City.
	   ``We trust the organizing committee of Salt Lake City,'' he
said.
	   Utah's largest health care provider, meanwhile, has said it gave
free surgical services in 1994 to at least two people associated
with the IOC, one a relative of a committee member and the other
possibly a committee member.
	   ``We did this in a sincere effort, and in the spirit of being a
good community citizen,'' said Daron Cowley, spokesman for
Intermountain Health Care.
	   Cowley denied IHC did the free work to bolster its chances to
become primary medical provider for the 2002 Winter Olympics, which
it subsequently became.
	   Hodler described the scholarship hfund as a bribe, but he didn't
blame the city.
	   ``Salt Lake is a victim,'' Hodler said, adding that the bid
committee felt compelled to offer the scholarships rather than
collude with agents promising to deliver votes in exchange for
large cash payments.
	   Both Joklik and Pound said Salt Lake City won the bid on its own
merits, not because of the scholarships.
	   Pound said the IOC executive board expressed ``complete, I
repeat complete, confidence'' in the organizing committee.
	   ``We'd like to put this behind us as quickly as possible,'' said
Robert Garf, chairman of the organizing committee. ``We would not
like to be distracted. It's imperative that we don't fall behind in
the preparation of the games.''

Scandalized Australian crickets asked to return to Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Accusing Australian cricketer Mark Waugh
of possible perjury, a judicial inquiry into match-fixing
allegations has summoned him to reappear in a Pakistani court,
cricket officials said Monday.
	   ``Mark (Waugh) did not make a complete disclosure and we need
him to come here again and be re-examined,'' said Sibtain Fazli,
legal adviser to the Pakistan Cricket Board.
	   The Pakistan Cricket Board is alleging that Waugh made a false
statement while testifying in October before a judicial inquiry,
which was launched as a result of his, Shane Warne's and Tom May's
allegations of match fixing against Pakistani cricketer Salim
Malik.
	   The three Australians claimed that Malik offered them thousands
of dollars to concede a match in 1994.
	   The summons to return to Pakistan follows admission by Waugh and
Shane Warne that they took money from an Indian bookmaker in 1994
in exchange for weather and pitch reports _ information which
affects the odds bookmakers give to people betting on the game.
	   The Australian Cricket Board fined the two players a total of
dlrs 10,000 in 1995 and kept their misdeeds a secret, something
that has angered the Pakistan Cricket Board.
	   The Pakistan Cricket Board said that the misdeeds of Waugh and
Warne were pertinent to the case against Malik and should have come
out in their testimony before the judicial inquiry.
	   It also affects their credibility, said Fazli.
	   He said Waugh told the judicial inquiry that: ``I told Malik
that it was not a good idea and that the Australians did not play
cricket that way. We play cricket to win for our country all the
time.''
	   Fazli Also said Waugh told the inquiry that he didn't
immediately report Malik's involvement in match fixing because
``such things had never happened before and this came as a shock.''
	   Yet Fazli said the alleged match fixing occurred after Waugh
already had taken money from the Indian bookmaker.
	   ``One cannot rule out the possibility of other players'
involvement or any Australian involvement and we should get both
the Australians back before the inquiry,'' Fazli said.

Palestinians celebrate Clinton's landing as seal of statehood
</HEADLINE>

helicopter into the city. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton's message
was in the symmetry. Flags, honor guards and brass bands at an
Israeli airport one day and at the new Palestinian airport the
next.
	   For the Palestinians, it was a presidential seal on their claims
to statehood when Clinton's Marine One helicopter touched down at
Gaza International Airport on Monday.
	   Dozens of Palestinian dignitaries jumped to their feet, flashed
victory signs and clapped rhythmically when Clinton cut a crimson
ribbon to inaugurate the passenger terminal, an Oriental-style
building with graceful arches and Moroccan tiles.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, hoping to savor the historic
moment just a while longer, made a surprised Clinton cut slices off
the ribbon, then handed pieces of cloth to the president and his
wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, as mementoes.
	   ``It's a recognition of Palestinian identity,'' Palestinian
Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said proudly of Clinton's airport
visit. ``I think its an important step on the road to realizing
freedom and recognition.''
	   Aware of the symbolic importance, Israel's government had tried
to dissuade Clinton from landing at the airport, to no avail.
	   Late Saturday, Clinton was met in a similar ceremony by Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Ben Gurion International
Airport.
	   In a clear gesture to the Palestinians, Clinton made a special
detour to visit the airport which opened Nov. 24 as part of the Wye
River land-for-security agreement the president helped negotiate.
Clinton flew from Jerusalem to the airport and then to a meeting
with Arafat in Gaza City.
	   Arafat later told Clinton he wishes he had taken a car from the
airport because he would have seen the Palestinians lining streets
to welcome with flags and banners.
	   The Palestinians spared no effort to underscore the symbolic
value of the visit, of a head of state receiving a head of state.
	   Two huge flags, one American and one Palestinian, draped side by
side over the control tower, covering its entire length. ``Welcome
to Palestine, Mr. Clinton,'' read a banner strung alongside the
airport access road.
	   Even an armored personnel carrier parked at the airport entrance
had a large poster of Clinton and Arafat shaking hands taped to one
of its sides.
	   ``This is huge for us that he (Clinton) would visit us as we
take the first step toward building our country,'' said Nimer
Duekat, manager of passenger services.
	   After Clinton's helicopter landed, he was greeted by Arafat and
walked past an honor guard, then shook hands with Palestinian
Cabinet ministers and dignitaries lining a red carpet.

Coal companies win injunction to halt 48-hour strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with labor relations board ordering miners back to
work, unions facing court action &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Coal miners who began a 48-hour
strike Monday over low coal prices offered to Japan's steel
industry have been ordered back to work by the nation's labor
relations board.
	   A coalition of companies had sought the intervention of the
Australian Industrial Relations Commission, applying for an order
against the Construction, Forestry Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU).
	   Union members walked off the job Monday, angered at miners MIM,
Shell and the North Goonyella Mine accepting an 18 percent, U.S.
dlrs 9 a metric ton, cut in the Japanese price of coking coal, used
for making steel.
	   Federal Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith described the
strike as ``totally unauthorized'' because union members have
breached no-strike agreements under the Workplace Relations Act.
	   Companies now have the option of seeking compensation from union
members for any losses from the strike, he said.
	   According to CFMEU spokesman Paddy Gorman, the union was
prepared to test the government's claims the strike action was
illegal.
	   ``This is a test for the current government ... I think it is
the first time they've had a national strike against them, so if
they think it's illegal, let's see them in court,'' he said.
	   Mining companies estimate the strike will cost the industry 56
million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 34 million) in lost
production.
	   Reith said the coal industry had one of the highest levels of
strikes, undermining Australia's reputation as a reliable and
consistent supplier.
	   ``The CFMEU are bloody-minded when it comes to the national
interest, they undermine the interests of their own workers, they
run a political agenda,'' he said.
	   ``Now they want the Australian government to control the
international price of a major commodity, obviously something
outside our control,'' he said.
	   But CFMEU mining division general president Tony Maher said the
government had failed to address a general coal crisis that had
sparked major job losses and are threatening more.
	   ``Coal is Australia's biggest export earner _ it earns 10
billion (Australian dollars) a year for the country so a 20 percent
drop means 2 billion lost to Australia,'' Maher said.
	   He said the price cut would mean further job losses in an
industry already reeling from the loss of 4,000 jobs in the past 12
months.
	   ``For every mine worker lost, another three jobs are lost from
the flow on effect _ that means 16,000 jobs lost,'' he said.
	   ``Now there'll be many more on the scrap heap.''
	   Maher believes the problems in the coal industry stem from an
oversupply of coal.
	   ``There's 20 million ton excess capacity coming out of
Australia,'' he said.
	   ``We're allowing too many new mines to come on stream and the
government just sits back and lets them open up new mines.''
	   In accepting the price cut, mine owners had made a ``blind
grab'' for market share instead of price, Maher said.

Father denies comeback of triple Olympic champion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ Alberto Tomba's father on Monday denied
reports of a sensational comeback of the triple Olympic champion in
the 1999 World Alpine Ski Championships at Vail.
	   Tomba, one of the most successful and popular skiers ever,
announced his retirement last October and did not start in the
current World Cup.
	   According to published reports in Italy the 31-year-old Italian
skier was considering the possibility to start in gate events in
the February championships.
	   ``By now Alberto has other commitments. It's too late (for him)
to think of the championships,'' said Franco Tomba, his son's
business manager.
	   Tomba, who ended his skiing career for an acting debut in a
two-part television movie, has been recently indicted, along with
his father, on charges of tax fraud.

Israelis apathetic about Clinton's historic visit to Gaza
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-Mideast &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ While their leaders fretted over U.S. President
Bill Clinton's virtual recognition of a Palestinian state in the
making by visiting Gaza, Israelis on Monday went about their daily
business.
	   Leaning in the open doorway of his videotape rental store in
downtown Jerusalem, Azriel Danieli shrugged, ``I'm not that
interested.''
	   Asked why the TV hanging from the ceiling of his shop wasn't
tuned into live coverage of Clinton in Gaza, Danieli laughed and
said: ``This is a video store _ that's a movie.''
	   Like other Israelis shopping or working in Israel's two main
cities Monday, Danieli didn't think the Clinton visit would affect
the way he feels about peace prospects with the Palestinians.
	   ``The Palestinians will get a state,'' he said. ``I don't know
if I'm for it or against it, but that's what's going to happen.''
	   A tiny TV in the display window of an electronics store on the
Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall showed Clinton's helicopter at the Gaza
airport. Israelis walked by, ignoring the pictures.
	   Palestinian and Israeli leaders alike call Clinton's visit a
historic recognition of Palestinian aspirations to independence.
Israel's Cabinet had a long and noisy exchange over who's idea it
was to invite Clinton to Gaza in the first place.
	   In Tel Aviv, as in Jerusalem, Israelis went to work or went
shopping as they do every day. ``This won't change very much
because there are many complicated things that still need to be
solved,'' said Dafna Shoham, selling lottery tickets on a downtown
Tel Aviv street, holding her dog in her lap.
	   A 25-inch TV suspended from the ceiling of a pizza parlor in
downtown Jerusalem showed Clinton dedicating the passenger terminal
at Gaza International Airport.
	   Kneading a wad of yellow dough with his hands, Asher Aramin, a
Palestinian from traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, smiled.
	   ``It's good that he's here. He should pressure both sides to
make peace,'' he said. ``People on both sides have suffered
enough.''

World health experts praise Hong Kong for stamping out bird flu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ World health experts have expressed their
gratitude to Hong Kong for slaughering the territory's 1.6 million
chicken in stamping out a bird flu last year, the government
reported Monday.
	   The international health experts said in a joint proclamation
that the slaughter of the chickens last December was considered at
the time as ``controversial and the outcome was uncertain.''
	   ``In retrospect, that action may have saved the world from an
influenza pandemic,'' it said.
	   The proclamation was signed by Dr. Daniel Lavanchy of the World
Health Organization, and 18 other experts on influenza from the
United States, Britain, Japan, Australia, Norway and Germany, a
government statement said.
	   The bird flu killed six people and sickened a dozen others. The
flu was the first evidence of an avian virus jumping directly from
bird to human.
	   Since the government killed all the territory's chickens late
last year, no new cases of the bird flu have been reported.
	   Hong Kong lifted a ban on live chicken imports in February.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In the space of 90 minutes at the Asian
Games Monday, four Indian and Sri Lankan athletes wrote their
scripts differently.
	   A 29-year-old Indian railroad worker from Calcutta stunned
everyone by winning the gold in 1,500 meters. A 23-year-old
business executive from Sri Lanka won the gold in 400 meters. A
33-year-old mother of a 6-year-old son from India's southern state
of Kerala made an exit from her favorite event. And a 23-year-old
village girl from Sri Lanka, under investigation for drug abuse,
didn't even turn up.
	   ``I was waiting for this day,'' Jyotirmoy Sikdar of India said
after winning the 1,500 meters. ``The bronze was in my pocket, so I
thought I should run for the gold.
	   ``Maybe this is my last Asian Games,'' said Sikdar, 29, who
clocked 4 minutes, 12.82 seconds. ``At home I don't see anyone in
front of me, but here I had some. So I just ran and ran.''
	   For Damayanthi Darsha of Sri Lanka, the gold gave her double
ecstasy. ``This is the first time that any Sri Lankan has won a
gold in track at the Asian Games since 1984.''
	   ``I am so happy that it was my coach, Sunil Gunawardene, who won
the gold in 1974,'' Darsha added. Gunawardene had anchored Sri
Lanka's 4x400 men's relay.
	   For P.T. Usha of India it was a sad exit from her favorite
event, the 400 meters, where she was sixth.
	   ``Well, I did try,'' Usha said. ``I missed practice for 20 days
and I think this is the reason that I could not do well.''
	   Usha had pulled a hamstring muscle in November in a home meet.
	   For Susantika Jayasinghe, Sri Lanka's best known athlete, but
under investigation after a positive drug test, it was an
inglorious exit.
	   Jayasinghe, 23, did not turn up for the women's 100 meters.
	   ``We are not sure if she was really not fit to run, but she
insisted that she was not in a position to run,'' said a Sri Lankan
sports official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   She had said she hurt a hamstring in Sunday's semifinals.
	   For Usha and Jayasinghe, there was much at stake.
	   If Usha had won even a bronze, she would have burnished her
international reputation and had her name enshrined in India's book
of athletic legends, which is very thin for a nation of 980 million
people. No Indian has ever won an Olympic medal in track and field,
although Usha came within .01 seconds in 1984.
	   Usha took everyone by surprise when she came out of eight years
of retirement to run in the Asian Track Championships in Fukuoka,
Japan, in July.
	   She was third in the 200 meters. The same day, she anchored
India's victorious 4x100-meter relay. Usha also anchored India's
silver medal team in the 4x400.
	   A medal for Jayasinghe would have restored her fame in Sri
Lanka, a nation of 18.5 million people off India's southern coast.
	   Jayasinghe, the youngest of the five daughters of parents living
in the rubber plantations of central Sri Lanka, made her
war-scarred nation proud when she returned from the 1997 World
Track Championships in Athens with a silver for finishing ahead of
Jamaican runner Merlene Ottey.
	   She was given money and a three-bedroom flat in Colombo, and was
honored by President Chandrika Kumaratunga, a woman.
	   But the good times did not last. She raised a storm by accusing
unnamed Sri Lankan sports officials of sexual harassment. And then
she had to undergo an out of competition test for drugs, where she
tested positive. The Sri Lankan federation accepted her
explanation, but the matter has gone to an international hearing.

Cyclist stabs motorist in Dutch road rage incident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A 35-year-old cyclist wielding a
13-centimeter (five-inch) kitchen knife stabbed to death a car
driver in a rare Dutch incident of road rage, police said Monday.
	   The cyclist blocked the path of a car which was trying to turn
into a street on the edge of Amsterdam's red light district late
Sunday night, according to a police press release.
	   In the argument and fight that followed, the cyclist stabbed the
25-year-old car driver in the chest with the kitchen knife. The
driver died later in a hospital.
	   Police officers who tried to break up the argument arrested the
cyclist as he tried to escape. The identities of the cyclist and
his victim were not released.

Eight dead, 17 people missing in central Philippines from tropical

storm &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Officials said on Monday at least
eight people have died and 17 others remained missing after
tropical storm Faith blew across central Philippine islands last
week.
	   The dead either drowned or were hit by falling trees in four
provinces, the Office of Civil Defense said.
	   ``The search is continuing,'' said Emilia Tadeo, a civil defense
spokeswoman. She said most of those missing were coastal villagers
swept to sea by floodwaters or fishermen, who were at sea when the
storm struck.
	   The tropical storm, the 11th to hit the country this year,
sliced through central Philippines Saturday then blew towards
Vietnam. It triggered flash floods, uprooted trees and electrical
posts and left a wide swath in the central Philippines without
electricity.
	   Faith had peak winds of 120 kilometers (75 miles) per hour and
gusts of up to 150 kilometers (94 miles). It was moving west
southwest at 24 kilometers (15 miles) per hour towards Vietnam, the
Manila weather bureau said.
	   The storm left at least 20,000 people homeless and damaged 328
million pesos (dlrs 8.4 million) worth of crops and infrastructure,
officials said.

Alatas hospitalized for exhaustion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas was
hospitalized, apparently for exhaustion, while attending the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations pre-summit meetings,
officials said Monday.
	   There were conflicting reports as to how serious Alatas'
condition was when he was admitted to Vietnam International
Hospital on Sunday. Alatas has had heart bypass surgery in the
past.
	   ``He did not have a heart attack,'' close aide Hadi Wayarabi
told Dow Jones Newswires. ``He went to a hospital in Hanoi last
night for a checkup and some blood tests.''
	   An embassy official said Alatas spent Sunday night at the
hospital. There were no plans for him to leave the summit.
	   ``He's just feeling tired and he's taking rest,'' said
Indonesian State Secretary Akbar Tanjung.
	   Alatas did not attend a dinner Sunday night for ASEAN foreign
and economic ministers, but Wayarabi said he would be at a dinner
for ASEAN's nine leaders Monday night. He was seen late Monday
afternoon in the lobby of the Horison Hotel.
	   The leaders will hold their annual summit Tuesday and Wednesday.

Father denies comeback of triple Olympic champion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ Alberto Tomba's father on Monday denied
reports of a sensational comeback of the triple Olympic champion in
the 1999 World Alpine Ski Championships at Vail.
	   Tomba, one of the most successful and popular skiers ever,
announced his retirement last October and did not start in the
current World Cup.
	   According to published reports in Italy the 31-year-old Italian
skier was considering the possibility to start in gate events in
the February championships.
	   ``By now Alberto has other commitments. It's too late (for him)
to think of the championships,'' said Franco Tomba, his son's
business manager.
	   Tomba, who ended his skiing career for an acting debut in a
two-part television movie, has been recently indicted, along with
his father, on charges of tax fraud.

Cyclist stabs motorist in Dutch road rage incident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A 35-year-old cyclist wielding a
13-centimeter (five-inch) kitchen knife stabbed to death a car
driver in a rare Dutch incident of road rage, police said Monday.
	   The cyclist blocked the path of a car which was trying to turn
into a street on the edge of Amsterdam's red light district late
Sunday night, according to a police press release.
	   In the argument and fight that followed, the cyclist stabbed the
25-year-old car driver in the chest with the kitchen knife. The
driver died later in a hospital.
	   Police officers who tried to break up the argument arrested the
cyclist as he tried to escape. The identities of the cyclist and
his victim were not released.

French bank pays dlrs 200 million for majority share in Romanian

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ France's Societe Generale signed a
dlrs 200 million deal Monday, giving it a majority stake in the
Romanian Bank for Development.
	   ``It's a first step to create a healthy and competitive banking
system,'' said Prime Minister Radu Vasile after the signing. It is
the first Romanian bank to be privatized.
	   Societe Generale won the bid for a 51 percent stake in the bank
earlier this month. It will pay dlrs 135 million to the Romanian
government and dlrs 65 million to raise the bank's share capital by
20 percent.
	   The Romanian Bank for Development is the country's
fourth-largest state-owned bank, and had a net profit of dlrs 100
million last year. Societe Generale is one of France's big retail
lenders and has operations worldwide.
	   The International Monetary Fund, which is expected to resume
negotiations for a new stand-by loan for Romania in January, has
conditioned further loans on the privatization of banks.
	   The agreement with IMF is badly needed to help the government
pay off dlrs 2.2 billion of foreign debts next year.
	   The IMF suspended a dlrs 430 million loan for the country in
May, due to political bickering and an economic crisis.
	   The other bank short-listed for the purchase was Banque
Nationale de Paris SA, but its offer was considered less
interesting, Romanian officials said.

Drug trade thrives among resorts on Mexico's Caribbean coast
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By MARK STEVENSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PLAYA DEL CARMEN, Mexico (AP) _ Luxury hotels, pristine white
beaches and excursion boats plying turquoise waters _ all are part
of the image of paradise that draws tourists to Mexico's Caribbean
coast.
	   All also have become key elements in drug smugglers' efforts to
make the area a new hotspot for cocaine smuggling, law enforcement
sources say.
	   Drug traffickers are using the special resources of the area to
their full advantage, sneaking in drug-laden boats among the fleets
of yachts, hiding drug profits in the guise of wealthy homes that
line the coast, and even blackmailing tourists into moving their
cargo to its destination.
	   ``There are a lot of ways to get drugs in, and they use them
all,'' said Juan Miguel Ponce Edmundson, director of Interpol's
Mexico office.
	   In the early 1990s, the Caribbean drug trade dropped off as
smugglers moved west to mainland Mexico, where large planes stuffed
with drugs could drop shipments on desert landing strips.
	   But as U.S. and Mexican authorities crack down on drug smuggling
along the 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) border joining the two
nations, officials say smugglers have increasingly returned to the
Caribbean _ and in a new twist, to Quintana Roo state, which covers
the Mexican Caribbean.
	   ``In recent years, there has been a growth in the entry of
cocaine and other drugs through Colombia, Central America, then on
to Quintana Roo and into the United States,'' U.S. Ambassador
Jeffrey Davidow said this week.
	   ``We have more than 25,000 Americans visiting Cancun every day,
so for us it is very important that the state be a safe place.''
	   Quintana Roo Gov. Mario Villanueva insists that the throngs of
tourists actually discourage the trade.
	   ``It's very difficult for drug traffickers to set up operations
here ... because the state's tourism activity is of such an open
nature,'' he said.
	   But law enforcement officials say the opposite is true, and that
smugglers are increasingly using the area's heavy tourism to cloak
their activities.
	   ``If there are 100 boats at a resort, it's easier to get one
boat in loaded with drugs,'' Ponce Edmundson said. ``It's easier to
get gasoline at a marina in Cozumel or Cancun than to haul drums of
gas through the jungle.''
	   Meanwhile, prosecutors are investigating whether Villanueva
himself is linked to the drug trade.
	   Villanueva denies that he is. ``In the past in Mexico, when they
wanted to damage someone politically, they accused him of
corruption,'' he said. ``Today, they accuse him of drug
trafficking.''
	   The cocaine trade itself is increasingly sophisticated:
Airplanes or boats from Colombia drop packages of drugs into the
sea, and ground crews on small boats pick them up in as little as
10 minutes.
	   Drug traffickers ``look for deserted stretches of coast, and
then they come in with boats, ships, airplanes,'' said Andres
Irrola Flores of the Cozumel Fishermen's Cooperative Society.
	   Sailors in Cozumel, a tropical island off the coast favored by
scuba divers and for cruise ship stopovers, stand guard over more
than a dozen small boats seized in the last year from drug
smugglers.
	   On the nearly virgin beaches of the Sian Kaan biosphere reserve
about 30 miles (50 kilometers) to the south, patrols of armed
soldiers drive down the single dirt road along the coast every
half-hour.
	   A caretaker at the abandoned Pez Maya hotel said an army
helicopter lands every three or four days to search the beach in
front of the building, apparently looking for drugs washing up.
	   From the Caribbean, the drugs then go by land or air to the
United States or Europe.
	   It would be easy to move the drugs through a commercial airport
like Cancun _ where most tourists enter Mexico's Caribbean _ if
drug smugglers controlled the airport's private security guards.
Until recently, prosecutors say, they did.
	   In early November, police raided the offices of the Cancun
airport's Lualti private security company, on the grounds that the
company was probably owned by a member of Mexico's Juarez cocaine
cartel.
	   Local news media said the private guards kept watch on the
movements of federal anti-drug police at the terminal.
	   Now, the smugglers have even turned to the tourists themselves
to get their drugs to market, law enforcement officials say.
	   At a crowded seaside bar in Playa Del Carmen, a laid-back beach
resort 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of Cancun, a waiter
identifying himself only as ``William'' offered foreign men the
chance to meet young, attractive women. Just an introduction, not
prostitution, he said.
	   Ponce Edmundson said that's a typical opening line. The tourist
gets the introduction _ and within days finds himself deep in debt
for wild cocaine parties. Smugglers threaten the tourist with
death, then offer an easy way out: take an extra load on their
flight home, then turn it over to local dealers.
	   ``We've detected several cases, mostly involving European
tourists,'' Ponce Edmundson said. ``They (tourists) go to the
Caribbean and they think they're in paradise. They don't have the
sophistication to handle these situations.''
	   U.S. officials said they weren't aware of any cases involving
Americans.
	   Mexico's Caribbean isn't just a convenient spot to smuggle
drugs, officials say, but also an ideal place to hide the profits.
	   With all the luxurious properties rapidly springing up along the
75-mile (120-kilometer) stretch of coast between Cancun and Tulum,
it's easy to be inconspicuous.
	   ``Many people buy homes here, but never come to live in them,''
said real estate salesman Enrique Medina as he shuttled a reporter
around in a golf cart on a tour of the million-dollar homes of the
Isla Dorada community.
	   Weeks later, the attorney general's office announced it had
seized 16 of the houses at Isla Dorada _ whose name means ``Golden
Island''_ and two unbuilt lots there ``as properties related to
money laundering, probably as a result of drug trafficking.''
	   In the same sweep that netted 33 Cancun properties, it seized
four high-priced hotels, three restaurants and four yachts.
	   But Villanueva, the governor, said money laundering is such a
minor problem that he has no qualms about supporting proposals to
legalize casinos in his state.
	   ``Having a casino or two in the state won't do us any harm,''
Villanueva said. ``As it is now, gambling goes on ... and the only
ones who benefit are low-level federal officials who blackmail the
gamblers.''

Indian policeman wins medal, but misses reward

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A police officer feuding with an Indian
sports legend over a 38-year-old national record won an Asian Games
bronze medal Monday in the 400 meters, but wasn't fast enough to
settle the dispute.
	   At stake is an award of 200,000 rupees (dlrs 4,770) promised by
Milkha Singh, nicknamed the ``flying Sikh,'' for anyone who could
break the national record of 45.6 seconds he set in the 1960 Rome
Olympics, where he missed a bronze by 0.01 seconds. No Indian ever
has won an Olympic track and field medal.
	   Paramjeet Singh, a former volleyball player and a triple jumper,
won his Asian Games bronze Monday in 45.93.
	   Paramjeet has contended, however, that he broke Milkha's record
with a 45.70 at a home meet in November.
	   The problem is that Paramjeet's record was hand-timed, and thus
subject to the likelihood he gained a tiny advantage while the
timer was reacting to the starting gun.
	   Now that all international meets are electronically timed, old
records have been recalculated to allow for that reaction time.
	   In a review of Milkha's Rome run, officials had added 0.14
seconds to the hand-timed 45.6, making it 45.74 _ slower than
Paramjeet's November time.
	   But Milkha does not accept the change.
	   ``My record of 45.6 still stands. If a timing is registered, it
is there. You cannot change it after some years,'' Milkha said in a
recent interview.
	   And he has insisted that he will pay the 200,000 rupees only if
Paramjeet runs faster than 45.6. He also has added another
condition _ the record must be broken at an international meet.

Melbourne's Crown to become part of Packer empire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd.,
owned by Australian billionaire Kerry Packer, will take over
Melbourne's Crown Casino in a deal worth 785 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 486 million), the companies announced Monday.
	   The debt-laden casino will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Packer's television and magazine group, creating a
media-entertainment hybrid similar to the MGM film group, which
also owns the MGM Grand casino in Las Vegas.
	   Under the plan, Crown shareholders will receive one PBL share
for every 11 shares held, valuing Crown shares at 55.8 Australian
cents (34.5 U.S. cents).
	   Crown chairman Lloyd Williams, a close friend of Packer, would
remain in his position along with newly appointed chief executive
Robert Riley, with Crown maintaining its own board with appointees
from PBL.
	   The deal came just a month after Crown scuttled a proposed 425
million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 263 million) joint venture
with the Packer's private company Consolidated Press Holdings.
	   The latest proposal requires approval from shareholders of
Crown, PBL and Crown's major shareholder Hudson Conway Ltd. as well
as the Victorian Casino and Gaming Authority.
	   If approval is received, the merger will be completed in April
1999.
	   After spending more than 2 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.24 billion) in building a huge casino complex designed to woo
Asian high rolling gamblers, the casino ran head long into an Asian
crisis that stripped Crown of its most vital customers.
	   Crown recorded a 350 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 217
million) loss in 1997/98.

Egyptian wants to be Muslim world's first woman mufti
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Souad Ibrahim Saleh is a prominent professor
of Islamic studies who spent most of her life lecturing on Muslim
law and theology.
	   Now she thinks the academic world is too small for her scholarly
skills and wants to be a mufti _ a top Muslim cleric who issues
edicts to interpret the faith.
	   In Egypt, where women's rights and Islamic law seem to be in
constant collision, her pursuit of the title has sparked further
debate by newspapers and among Muslim scholars already arguing
whether women can be judges or hold top government jobs.
	   If Saleh succeeds, she would be the Muslim world's first woman
mufti, and that would likely cause a furor in more conservative
Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia, where women may not even drive
cars.
	   Saleh, a 58-year-old wife and mother, expects a long struggle.
But she offers a practical reason she should be a mufti: She can
help women hesitant to deal with male scholars about such sensitive
subjects as sex, contraceptives and breast feeding.
	   ``Some women are shy to ask about such issues,'' she said in an
interview. ``If they cannot get proper answers for their problems,
they might not be able to exercise their rituals as good Muslims.''
	   Saleh now meets with women at mosques near her house and female
students at the college where she lectures, a branch of Al-Azhar
University. She also receives calls at home from women with all
manner of questions about how to be good Muslims.
	   For example, a nurse wants to know if it is religiously
acceptable for her to see the sexual organs of a man during an
operation. Her answer is no, Saleh says, citing a verse from the
Koran, Islam's holy book.
	   Another caller says she is pregnant by a man to whom she is
legally married, but with whom she has not had a formal wedding.
She wants to know, will the child be legitimate?
	   ``Yes, because the marriage is religiously sound and the wedding
is only ceremonial,'' Saleh replies.
	   To give weight to her opinions, Saleh wrote early this year to
Egypt's top Islamic official, Grand Mufti Sheik Nasr Farid Wasel,
asking him to officially nominate her as a mufti.
	   She wants to join dozens of male clerics who assist him in
interpreting Islam and telling the faithful what they should or
should not do.
	   Wasel, whose job is government-appointed, has so far refused to
nominate Saleh. Attempts by The Associated Press to reach him for
comment failed. His aides _ who spoke on condition of anonymity _
dismissed Saleh's request as pointless.
	   But her case has received backing from some key Muslim scholars,
including Abdel Muati Beiyomi, head of religious studies at
Al-Azhar, the most important center of learning in mainstream Sunni
Islam.
	   ``If a woman is well-versed in Koran and sharia (Islamic law)
and she is capable of reasoning and making sound judgment, then why
couldn't she be a mufti? Of course she can,'' Beiyomi said in an
interview.
	   But Sheik Youssef el-Badri _ who has fought a long series of
court cases against Egyptian liberal intellectuals _ said Souad can
certainly advise women on Islamic issues but she cannot become a
mufti.
	   ``A woman has no right to hold a post of jurisdiction in Islam.
She cannot be a judge. She cannot be a mufti,'' he said.
	   Saleh has reason to expect a long struggle: Her request to
become a mufti follows lawyer Fatima Lashin's 10-year battle to be
named a judge. Egypt's highest court has agreed to hear Lashin's
plea, but no date has been set for a decision.
	   But Saleh can also take heart that the head of Al-Azhar, Sheik
Mohammed Sayyed Tantawi, has decreed in response to Lashin's case
that women are not forbidden from any post under Islam.
	   But Saleh does not think it should be that complicated for her
to fulfill her goal.
	   ``What I want to do is just to advise women on what is
religiously prohibited or accepted,'' she said. ``So what is wrong
with that?''

Boesak lawyers ask for case to be dismissed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Lawyers for former top African
National Congress official Allan Boesak on Monday asked a court to
dismiss embezzlement charges against him.
	   Boesak faces 32 charges of fraud and theft of more than a
million rand (dlrs 300,000 at the time) from an anti-apartheid
organization he headed.
	   The prosecution case was hit by a dramatic about-turn last month
from key witness Freddie Steenkamp, Boesak's former bookkeeper. He
recanted previous testimony damaging to Boesak and apologized for
lying about his ex-boss.
	   Steenkamp is serving six years for embezzlement and said he had
acted because of a personal grudge.
	   In moving to have the charges thrown out of court, defense
lawyer Mike Maritz said many of them relied upon Steenkamp's
testimony, which was now admitted to be false.
	   ``The accused clearly ought to be set free,'' Maritz said.
	   Boesak, wearing a dark blue suit, looked relaxed in court and
chatted and joked with dozens of family and supporters packing the
small chamber in the Cape Town High Court.
	   A former minister who once headed the World Alliance of Reformed
Churches, Boesak is accused of embezzling the money from the
Foundation for Peace and Justice charity.
	   Donations came from pop singer Paul Simon, the Coca-Cola
Foundation, Scandinavian aid agencies and other individuals and
groups.
	   Prosecutor J.C. Gerber had hoped to call Simon to the stand, but
the singer refused to travel to South Africa and Judge John
Foxcroft denied an application to temporarily move the court to the
United States, dealing another blow to the state's case.
	   Boesak played a prominent role in the anti-apartheid struggle
that ended in the country's first all-race elections in 1994.

S.Africa signs training agreement to fight drug trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ National police chief George
Fivaz on Monday signed a United Nations-sponsored agreement to
train South African police officers in fighting the drug trade.
	   Fivaz signed the 2 million rand (dlrs 330,00) accord at a
ceremony in Cape Town with Frank Albert of the United Nations
International Drug Control Program.
	   Italy is providing the cash for the plan, which will provide up
to six months training for an initial batch of 300 police officers.
Customs staff will be included later.
	   Albert said the U.N. program had opened an office in South
Africa last year and that combating the flow of illegal drugs
needed international cooperation.
	   ``No police service in the world has the capacity to deal with
these things on its own,'' he said.

Former militia leader pleads guilty to genocide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Former Rwandan Hutu militia leader Omar
Serushago pleaded guilty Monday to four counts of genocide and
crimes against humanity before a U.N. tribunal trying suspects in
the 1994 Rwanda massacre.
	   But he denied a fifth count of rape brought against him by the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.
	   After a 10-minute recess requested by Deputy Prosecutor Bernard
Muna, the prosecution withdrew the count, a move granted by the
court headed by Judge Laity Kama of Senegal.
	   Serushago, one of the five leaders of the Interahamwe militia
that were responsible for the deaths of more than 500,000 minority
Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus between April and July 1994,
pleaded guilty to counts of genocide, crime against humanity
(murder), crime against humanity (extermination) and crime against
humanity (torture).
	   Serushago, 37, was the Interahamwe leader in Gisenyi Prefecture.
He was charged with having led groups of militiamen in the
government-orchestrated mass killing.
	   He was the second person indicted to plead guilty. The tribunal
is holding 32 suspects.
	   Former Rwandan Prime Minister Jean Kambanda pleaded guilty May 1
and was sentenced to life in prison on Sept. 2.
	   Serushago told the court his plea was free, voluntary and
unequivocal and that he had reached agreement with the prosecution
on all the considerations.
	   The chamber then pronounced him guilty and set his pre-sentence
hearing for Jan. 29.
	   The tribunal has convicted and sentenced one person _ former
mayor of Taba commune Jean-Paul Akayesu _ to life imprisonment,
maximum sentence it can impose.
	   Akayesu is appealing.

Palestinians consider charter dead letter despite vote Monday

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ For years, since the first peace
treaty with Israel in 1993, Palestinian leaders have been saying
that clauses in their charter calling for the destruction of the
Jewish state are null and void.
	   The 727-member Palestinian National Council voted in April 1996
to revoke those clauses. But when he took office soon afterward,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted the Palestinians
had not completed their task.
	   Fulfilling a promise made to the United States and Israel under
the Wye River peace accords, the PNC was taking up the revocation
issue again Monday. The only issue was whether there would be a
formal vote _ as the Israelis have demanded.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, in the first trip to Gaza by an
American president, planned to witness the action.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Yasser Arafat would
ask the delegates whether they support the peace process and a
letter he sent to Clinton in January declaring 28 of the 33 clauses
written in 1964 either void or amended.
	   The session also was to be attended by delegates from other
Palestinian groups. The PNC delegates were identifiable by blue
badges on their lapels.
	   ``Then we will raise our hands and stand up and applaud,''
Asfour said. Despite the show of hands, this should not be
considered a formal vote, he added.
	   Nabil Shaath, a minister in Arafat's Cabinet, said any vote
``will be based on a guarantee that we won't deal with this issue
any longer, that it will be gone and done with.''
	   Last week, when the smaller Palestinian Central Council revoked
the clauses, Tayeb Abdel Rahim, secretary general of the
Palestinian Authority, said the PLO charter has been an anachronism
for years.
	   Those sections calling for Israel's destruction ``have not been
valid since the day we signed'' the first peace agreement with
Israel in 1993, he said.
	   Netanyahu has said he would not go forward with the Wye accords
and withdraw troops from the West Bank without a formal vote on the
1964 charter.
	   Article 19 of the charter reads: ``The partition of Palestine in
1947 and the establishment of the State of Israel are entirely
illegal, regardless of the passage of time.''
	   Article 21 rejects ``all solutions which are substitutes for the
total liberation of Palestine.''
	   ``According to that Palestinian Covenant, the State of Israel,
and we, have no right to exist,'' Netanyahu told a gathering of
Israeli youth he addressed with Clinton on Sunday. Renunciation of
the offending articles ``is a first, essential step.''
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser David Bar-Illan, said Sunday ``a
respectable majority, a decisive majority, was necessary.''
	   Palestinians say Israel cannot dictate the terms of their
parliamentary procedures.
	   ``Anything more than a general vote _ like voting on specific
articles again _ is a humiliation,'' said Jordan-based delegate,
Tawfik Abu Bakr. ``It will be only to save Netanyahu politically
and help him with his internal problems. It is not our job to do
this.''
	   Abu Bakr said he had counted more than 500 delegates there _
providing Arafat with two-thirds of the 727-member PNC.

Lagos crippled by water shortage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A strike by workers of the state-owned
water company entered its seventh day Monday, leaving many
residents scrambling for water.
	   The strike continued despite a report that the government was
considering paying the demanded salary increases.
	   On Sunday, the News Agency of Nigeria quoted Lagos military
administrator Col. Mohammed Marwa as saying that Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar, Nigeria's junta leader, had agreed to consider pay raises
for the Lagos workers.
	   But it was unclear whether the workers would call off the strike
without a more definite sign that their demands would be met.
	   The past week has seen the bustling commercial capital filled
with thousands of residents searching desperately for water at
canals and wells with buckets and containers. Sales of bottled
water soared.
	   Soon after taking power in June, Abubakar promised to increase
the minimum monthly wage for federal civil servants by more than
600 percent, effective September 1.
	   Salaries for Nigeria's 4.2 million state civil servants were to
be negotiated state-by-state, the government said.
	   Lagos workers initiated the strike because the increase had
still not been applied to them.
	   For years, Nigerian civil servants have had to live on abysmal
salaries in an economy which had crumbled under years of corruption
and mismanagement.

Covers come off Christo's wrapped trees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIEHEN, Switzerland (AP) _ After four weeks under wraps draped
by Christo and Jeanne-Claude, the first of 178 trees in a Swiss
museum park were uncovered Monday.
	   The unwrapping operation, supervised by the husband-and-wife
team's field manager Frank Seltenheim and open to the public, is
expected to last a week.
	   Local officials said the trees had suffered only minimal damage
under their woven polyester fabric covering.
	   The 55,000 square meters (461,000 square feet) of fabric and 23
kilometers (14 miles) of rope are to be recycled.
	   The exhibit has attracted some 300,000 visitors since it opened
last month, transforming this quiet suburb of the city of Basel.
	   Some 65,000 people visited the exhibit, which had been expected
to stay in place until late January, on its final weekend. The
artists last week announced it was being dismantled early for
artistic reasons.
	   ``With all our previous temporary works of art, the 14-day
duration of the project's exhibition had been an aesthetic
choice,'' they said.
	   Christo and Jeanne-Claude devised the concept after studying
gardeners draping fabric on trees against winter snow and frost in
Japan, but were rejected in previous attempts to realize it.
	   The Saint Louis Museum of Art in Missouri and the Museum of
Modern Art in New York turned them down in the 1960s. Paris nixed a
1969 bid to wrap the 330 trees along the Champs Elysees.
	   In 1995 they grabbed the global imagination with the sensational
wrapping of the Reichstag in Berlin.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Second-seeded Li Fang of China breezed
into the Asian Games women's tennis semifinals Monday with a 6-1,
6-2 victory over India's Nirupama Vaidyanathan.
	   Li, ranked 40th by the WTA, took advantage of frequent mistakes
by her opponent.
	   Third seed Yayuk Basuki, ranked 56th by the WTA, also advanced
with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Iroda Tulyaganova of Uzbekistan.
	   The top-ranked player in the field, at No. 37, Thailand's
Tamarine Tanasugarn wasn't due to play her quarterfinal until
Tuesday.
	   Two seeds from Taiwan, No. 4 Wang Shi-ting and No. 5 Janet Lee,
lost in the round of 16 on Sunday.
	   In the men's round of 16 only South Korea's Lee Hyung-taik had
to struggle Monday as Korea, Japan, India and Uzbekistan each put
two men in the quarterfinals.
	   Lee served 12 aces and converted four of six break points on his
way to a 7-6 (7-2), 2-6, 6-0 victory over Taiwan's Lin Bing-chao.
He was joined in the quarterfinals by teammate Yoon Yong-il, a 6-3,
6-3 winner over Iran's Ramin Raziani.
	   India's best hope, Leander Paes, who stands 91st in the ATP
rankings, had to drop out of the games with an injury. He was the
only Asian in the rankings' top 100.
	   But India still gained quarterfinal places when Mahesh Bhupathi
beat Bryan Junio of the Philippines 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, and Srinath
Prahlad ousted Taiwan's Chen Wei-ju 6-4, 7-5.
	   For Japan, Satoshi Iwabuchi beat Qatar's Sultan Al-Awai 6-0,
6-1, and Takahiro Terachi defeated Thailand's Paradorn Srichaphan,
Thailand, 6-1, 6-3
	   Uzbekistan's quarterfinalists are Oleg Ogorodov, a 6-3, 6-4
winner over Thailand's Danai Udomchoke, and Vadim Kutsenko, a 6-0,
6-4 winner over Hong Kong's Tong Man-Chung.

Pinochet lawyers confirm appeal attempt of extradition decision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet
plans to try to challenge a British Cabinet member's decision to
allow Spain to extradite him on charges of murder and other human
rights abuses committed during his 17-year rule, his lawyers
confirmed Monday.
	   Michael Caplan of Kinsley Napley said his firm would ask
England's High Court for leave to challenge Home Secretary Jack
Straw's approval of the Spanish extradition request.
	   Caplan would not elaborate on the grounds for the appeal, but
such applications normally contend a decision was wrong in law.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in a hospital while recuperating
from back surgery during one of his regular visits to Britain.
	   An official Chilean report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of his secret police after he overthrew
Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist, in a violent 1973 coup. The
Spanish judge seeking Pinochet's extradition says Spanish citizens
were among the victims.
	   The 83-year-old general's lawyers are unlikely to file their
application with the High Court until after a two-day hearing
beginning Tuesday in the House of Lords, Britain's highest court,
in which they are seeking to overturn the Lords' earlier 3-2
decision that Pinochet had no immunity from prosecution as a former
foreign head of state.
	   In Chile, rightist Sen. Ignacio Perez Walker told the Santiago
daily El Mercurio that the House of Lords appeal will be based on
the ties of one of the law lords who ruled on the case to Amnesty
International, which has campaigned to have Pinochet brought to
trial.
	   Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann is the unpaid director of the
fundraising arm of Amnesty, but the group says he did not take part
in the Pinochet campaign.
	   Pinochet is under police guard at a rented mansion called
Wentworth, 20 miles (30 kms) west of London.
	   A magistrate has set a Jan. 18 hearing date for the formal start
of proceedings to extradite him to Spain.

Muslim leaders split on civilian militia plan in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS suggestion that settlers be armed, grafs 2, 13-16; TRIMS
 &UR; By ALI KOTARUMALOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's Muslim political leaders
were split Monday over a proposal by the powerful armed forces to
raise a civilian militia as precaution against pro-democracy
protests ahead of elections next year.
	   Also a cabinet minister has suggested that settlers on remote
islands be armed against rising attacks from indigenous people.
	   One opposition party denounced the militia plan as illogical and
costly. Human rights activists also criticized it.
	   However, Abdurrahman Wahid, the leader of Indonesia's largest
Islamic group, the 30 million-member Nahdlatul Ulama, said he
supported the setting up of a militia as long as it was run by
Indonesia's military commander Gen. Wiranto.
	   About 40,000 young people are to be trained for three-months by
the army. They will be equipped with sticks, riot shields and
handcuffs and will have powers of arrest.
	   Officials said as many 200,000 young, unemployed people might
eventually be recruited for the group to be known as ``Rakyat
Terlatih,'' or ``trained people.''
	   Wiranto said Sunday the militia would assist police and troops
whose resources have been stretched by a prolonged campaign of
student protests.
	   Last month thousands of unemployed youths were hired as private
security guards to protect the nation's highest legislative body,
the People's Consultative Assembly, against protests.
	   However, most were taken off the streets after they brawled with
demonstrating students.
	   Sporadic rioting and looting has increased in recent months amid
economic and political turmoil in the world's fourth most populous
nation since authoritarian President Suharto quit in May.
	   A breakdown in law and order in several areas has given rise to
a wave of politically-linked murders and vigilante groups.
	   Tensions between the Muslim majority and Christian minority have
flared with dozens of mosques and churches burned or ransacked.
	   On Monday a parliamentary committee was told that settlers on
remote islands were being attacked by indigenous gangs and needed
to be armed.
	   Thousands of people from overpopulated islands in Indonesia have
settled in remote and relatively underdeveloped areas under a
policy known as transmigration.
	   Transmigration Minister Hendropriyono said settlers face
abduction, torture, arson and murder.
	   ``There is no other way but to organize their own defense. And,
of course, they need to be armed,'' he said.
	   Suharto's successor, Habibie, has promised democratic change,
including parliamentary election next June followed by a
presidential ballot by a special assembly late next year.
	   However, students have repeatedly taken to the streets, saying
his reform agenda is too slow and limited.
	   They also want Suharto, now being investigated for corruption,
put on trial immediately.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   Several major Muslim political parties have been set up in
recent months and are expected to play a crucial role in next
year's poll.
	   Opposition figure and likely presidential candidate, Amien Rais,
said a militia could trigger new security problems.
	   ``Its members could feel that they are special citizens and
could tend to be arrogant,'' said Rais, who is the former leader of
the 28 million-member Muhamadiyah Islamic group.
	   The opposition Islamic-based United Development Party criticized
the plan on grounds of cost at a time when Indonesia is grappling
with its worst economic crisis in 30 years.

Refugees to top agenda of Bosnia peace conference
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Helping Bosnian war refugees return home,
three years after the conflict ended, is expected to dominate the
agenda of the Peace Implementation Council's annual conference that
begins here Tuesday.
	   ``The return of refugees is the emblematic issue of this
conference that must provide political and financial support for
those who want to return,'' Carlos Westendorp, the international
community's High Representative to Bosnia, was quoted as saying
Monday by the Spanish daily El Mundo.
	   The council, which represents some 40 countries and
organizations, was set up to oversee the implementation of the Dec.
1995 Dayton peace accords that ended Bosnia's four-year civil war.
	   The Dayton accords divided the country into the Muslim-Croat
Federation and the Serb Republic, and deployed a NATO-led peace
keeping force.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and U.S. Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott are among those expected at the two-day
Madrid conference.
	   The 1995 accords promised a safe return home and compensation
for property lost to the hundreds of thousands of refugees who fled
Bosnia or were internally displaced during the 1992-1995
ethnic-based war involving Muslims, Serbs and Croats.
	   The international organizations have admitted that their
forecast that 1998 would be the year of a mass refugee return was
premature.
	   The council is also expected to focus on the status of the town
of Brcko - a key strategic location claimed by both the
Muslem-Croat Federation and the Serb Republic and the last
territorial issue still outstanding from the Dayton accords.
	   Some 12,000 Muslims who lived in Brcko before the war now live
in neighboring villages waiting to find out if they will be able to
return to the town that is now dominated by Serbs, many of whom are
refugees from Sarajevo.
	   Meanwhile, the Muslim-led Federation has said it will use the
conference to raise the issue of long sentences handed down
Saturday by a Serb court to three Muslims found guilty of murder.
	   Westendorp, who has said the implementation of a functioning and
fair judicial system is a key condition for stability of peace in
Bosnia, issued a statement condemning the sentences because of the
scant evidence presented at the trial.
	   Earlier this month, the top official, who currently has
extensive powers over Bosnian institutions and politicians, said
the aim for 1999 was to create a self-sustaining peace in Bosnia
and prepare the country to live without foreign aid.
	   Meanwhile, street posters in Madrid called for a demonstration
to coincide with the conference demanding that Serbian leaders
responsible for ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and the Yugoslavian
province of Kosovo to be brought to justice.

Ito misses barrier, Jayasinghe pulls out

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's Koji Ito missed the start and
blew his chances of joining the exclusive club of sub-10-second
sprinters at the Asian Games Monday.
	   Sri Lanka's Susantika Jayasinghe missed the whole race, making a
late withdrawal from the women's 100 in the latest chapter of a
controversial year for the world championship silver medalist.
	   Ito's reaction time at the gun was the worst of the eight
runners but he recovered to win the gold. His bid to become the
first non-black athlete under 10 seconds disappeared as he crossed
in 10.05.
	   Only 26 men, all black, have broken the 10-second barrier.
Poland's Marian Woronin just missed out, having the best time of a
white athlete with 10.00 in Warsaw in 1984. Ito also had an Asian
record 10.00 in Sunday's semifinals, raising the prospect of a
better run Monday.
	   His chances looked to have been blown away by strong gusts of
wind Monday, before it dropped to a rare lull. He got a legal
tailwind reading of 1.6, but was unable to make up for lost time.
	   ``Maybe I failed to live up to everyone's expectations to be
under 10 seconds,'' Ito said. ``But at least I excited everyone.''
	   Thailand's Seeharwong Reanchai edged Japan's Yasukatsu Otsuki
for the silver medal in a photo finish after both clocked 10.31.
	   Sri Lankan fans had not heard their national anthem at an Asian
Games for five editions and 24 years but despite Jayasinghe's
decision to miss the sprint because of injury, the country got two
anthems in succession. Its 400-meter sprinters Damayanthi Darsha
and Sugath Tillekeratne delivered a double blast.
	   Jayasinghe, competing here under a drug cloud, complained of a
hamstring injury and headache after qualifying in Sunday's
semifinals. She tested positive for a steroid in March but is
allowed to compete while the International Amateur Athletic
Federation awaits an arbitration hearing.
	   With the world 200 silver medalist missing, China's Asian record
holder Li Xuemei won in a wind-aided 11.05 seconds. China's Yali Li
was second and India's Rachita Mistry got a photo decision to take
bronze. Li Xuemei said she had suffered diarrhea and a fever.
	   ``I'm not satisfied with my time,'' she said. ``I felt too tired
since I ran a fever as high as 39 Centigrade (102 F) yesterday. I
failed to go to sleep last night.''
	   Darsha's win in the 400 gave Sri Lanka its first gold since her
coach Sunil Gumawardeme was a member of the 1974 4x100-meter relay
team.
	   ``This is the first time that Sri Lanka has won a gold medal in
24 years,'' Darsha said. ``I am extremely happy, not only because I
have won the gold but it was my coach who had won the last gold in
1974.''
	   Darsha had the field under her control after the opening 100 and
cruised down the final straight, crossing the line in 51.57. In
contrast to the comfortable run by the Asian champion, China's Chen
Yuxiang battled home with a face covered in pain to get silver in
52.50. Bronze went to Svetlana Bodritskaya (53.00) of Kazakstan
while veteran Indian P.T. Usha was sixth in 54.37.
	   Tillekeratne had to work harder to win the men's 400 in 44.99,
overcoming a strong challenge by Ibrahim Faraj of Qatar, who
clocked 45.32 after easing up near the line. India's Paramjit Singh
got the bronze.
	   Eleven of the 43 track and field gold medals were on offer in
Monday's packed program, but the late afternoon session was largely
ignored by the public, with only about 5,000 people in the
20,000-capacity main stadium.
	   Tiny Indian Jyotirmoy Sikdhar continued a great session for
subcontinent athletes when she outsprinted China's Wang Qingfen to
win the women's 1,500 in 4:12.82. Wang finished in 4:13.19, with
India's Sunita Rani adding a bronze.
	   ``The bronze was in my pocket so I decided why not run for the
gold,'' said Sikdhar.
	   Organizers angered jeering Indian fans by playing the wrong
anthem at Sikdhar's medal ceremony, so 10 minutes later they
brought the medalists out and played the right tune.
	   Qatar's Mohamad Taib won the men's 1,500 for the third
successive games in a bizarre finish. He slowed right down near the
end, waving his rivals closer, then turned around and made a rude
gesture down the track.
	   South Korea's Lee Yong-sun won an uninspiring women's javelin
event, throwing 62.09 meters. Liang Lili of China was second with
Gurmeet Kaur of India third.
	   Shen Shengfei of China won the gold medal of the heptathlon with
a total of 5,817 points. Svetlana Kazanina of Kazakstan was second
at 5,775, followed by Ma Chun-ping of Taiwan in third at 5,659.
	   Japan's Yuko Kawakami continued her country's dominance in the
distance events at this meet, adding the women's 10,000-meter gold
to earlier victories by compatriots in the men's 10,000 and women's
marathon.
	   China's Liu Hongyu, fourth at last year's world championships,
was unchallenged to win the women's 10-kilometer walk. Liu finished
the road race in 43 minutes, 57.28 seconds, comfortably ahead of
Japan's Rie Mitsumori (44:29.82) and Kazakstan's Svetlana Tolstaya
(45:29.95).
	   ``If they pushed me hard, the time might have been faster,'' Liu
said.
	   Liu's teammate Li Yuxin, gold medalist in the Asian
championships in July, was disqualified two kilometers from the
finish after receiving a third warning.
	   Japan and China finished the second full day of track and field
each with six of the 17 gold medals.

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton took
his quest for Mideast peace for the first time to Palestinian
territory Monday, and Yasser Arafat declared that through Clinton
``peace will prevail in the Middle East.'' Giant American and
Palestinian flags draped the new Palestinian airport control tower
and a high-rise apartment building downtown, as Clinton and first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived in Gaza to a red-carpet welcome
by Arafat. Clinton appealed for a reconciliation with Israel and a
recommitment to the Wye River land-for-security accord.
(CLINTON-MIDEAST)
	   WASHINGTON _ Undecided Republican legislators expressed dismay
over President Bill Clinton's insistence that he did not commit
perjury. ``I think the president hurt himself very clearly,'' Rep.
Bob Ney of Ohio said as focus shifted to this week's full House of
Representatives vote on impeachment. That vote, on four articles of
impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee, could come
on Thursday. If the House endorses impeachment on charges of
perjury, obstruction of justice and misuse of power, the case will
be sent for trial in the Senate. (US-IMPEACHMENT-CLINTON).
	   CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) _ Soldiers were on guard throughout Guinea
on Monday to prevent violence in Monday's election, which was
widely expected to be won by President Lansana Conte, who first
took control of this West African country in a military coup. Even
Conte's opponents were expecting that he would win the vote, noting
his government funding, military support, control of the broadcast
media and a political party that is tightly entwined with the
government. (GUINEA-ELECTIONS)
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ By a slight majority, Puerto Ricans
rejected statehood and signaled a desire to retain their status as
a quasi-colony of the United States. The vote on the Caribbean
island reaffirmed a desire to retain U.S. citizenship and federal
aid, while enjoying some of the trappings of an independent nation.
Final results gave 50.2 percent of Sunday's votes to ``none of the
above'' _ the option adopted by the commonwealth party _ while
statehood had 46.5 percent, a trifle more than in a similar
non-binding referendum in 1993 when commonwealth beat out statehood
by 48.58 percent to 46.34 percent. (PUERTO RICO-REFERENDUM)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The sex and corruption trial of
former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim took a sensational turn
Monday when the prosecution said it would exhibit a semen-stained
mattress to prove Anwar had indulged in illegal sex. Deputy Public
Prosecutor Azahar Mohamed told the court that the mattress, seized
by police in July from an apartment here, had already been examined
by the police laboratory. He did not disclose the findings, but
said the mattress would be shown to the court Tuesday. Anwar, the
Southeast Asian country's deputy premier before being sacked in
September, faces abuse of power charges and will be tried
separately for allegedly having engaged in illegal sex acts.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed sharply lower
Monday, with prices slumping both in Tokyo and Hong Kong for a
third consecutive session. Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average shed 294.02 points, or 2.04 percent, to close at 14,111.62
for a third straight day of losses. On Friday, the average fell
402.16 points, or 2.72 percent. Japanese stocks fell amid rekindled
fears of instability in the bad debt-ridden banking system after
the government took over ailing lender Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. on
Sunday, traders said. The nationalization of Nippon Credit marked
the second time a top lender has come under state control in less
than two months. The government took over the Long-Term Credit Bank
of Japan Ltd. on Oct. 23. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Southeast Asian leaders flew in Monday for
their annual summit only to find that Cambodia once again was
grabbing the spotlight instead of the ``bold measures'' they are
expected to endorse to spark an economic turnaround. The leaders
were peppered with questions as they arrived about Cambodia's
prospects of being admitted to the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations in time to participate as a full-fledged member at the
summit Tuesday and Wednesday. Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chuk
Tong said there had been no change in his country's position that
Cambodia needs more time to cement its new coalition government.
(ASEAN-SUMMIT)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hurt by a severe credit crunch and prolonged
economic slump, business confidence at Japan's recession-hit small
and medium-sized manufacturers has fallen to a record low, the Bank
of Japan said Monday. Confidence at major Japanese manufacturers
also continued to erode, falling to its worst level since February
1994, the central bank said. In a closely-watched quarterly report,
the bank said business sentiment at small and medium-sized
manufacturers had deteriorated in the past three months to minus
60, the lowest since it began compiling the ``tankan'' survey in
1967. (JAPAN-ECONOMY)
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Taiwanese banks are reporting a record number
of overdue loans because of growing business bankruptcies and
financial troubles, the Central Bank governor said Monday. Perng
Fai-nan said that on average 4.95 percent of bank loans were
overdue in September while total overdue loans amounted to nearly
700 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 22 billion). He said some
businesses were unable to pay their loans on time because they had
used company funds for stock speculation. Several business groups
have failed to settle their huge stock purchases as banks tightened
their credit policies at a time of economic slowdown. (TAIWAN-BANK
WOES)
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Coal miners who began a 48-hour
strike Monday over low coal prices offered to Japan's steel
industry have been ordered back to work by the nation's labor
relations board. A coalition of companies had sought the
intervention of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission,
applying for an order against the Construction, Forestry Mining and
Energy Union (CFMEU). Union members walked off the job Monday,
angered at miners MIM, Shell and the North Goonyella Mine accepting
an 18 percent, U.S. dlrs 9 a metric ton, cut in the Japanese price
of coking coal, used for making steel. (AUSTRALIA-COAL STRIKE)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ State-run Korea Electric Power Corp.
said Monday it has signed a contract to sell used thermal power
generating facilities to a U.S. company for dlrs 28.2 million. The
deal calls for IBC Turbine Inc. to take over four gas turbines, one
steam turbine and related facilities at a heavy oil-fired plant in
Youngwol, 170 kilometers (100 miles) southeast of Seoul.
(SKOREA-US-THERMAL POWER)
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Unless it receives more international aid,
Ukraine might have to ask foreign lenders if it can delay next
year's debt payments, the finance minister was quoted as saying
Monday. The government is already working out proposals for
restructuring its 1999 foreign debt obligations, but still hopes
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank will resume
their aid to Ukraine, Ihor Mitiukov told the independent Ukrainian
News agency. The IMF postponed the latest tranche of its dlrs 2.2
billion loan to Ukraine last month over the government's poor tax
collection and sluggish reforms. It said it would resume aid only
when Ukraine approves a realistic 1999 budget and radical reform
steps. (UKRAINE-ECONOMY).

 &UR; National Grid to take over New England Electric System &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statements by officials of New England Electric
and National Grid confirming deal. CHANGES dateline. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WESTBOROUGH, Massachusetts (AP) _ New England Electric System
announced Monday that it has agreed to be taken over by National
Grid, the English and Welsh electricity operator, in a deal valued
at approximately dlrs 3.2 billion.
	   New England Electric System, which provides electricity to more
than 1.3 million customers in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and
Rhode Island, will become a subsidiary of National Grid.
	   National Grid, which operates a monopoly in England and Wales
with more than 3,100 miles (5,000 kilometers) of high voltage
transmission lines, had been looking to expand outside of Britain.
	   The British electricity company is also expected to assume dlrs
1 billion of the New England company's debt, the London-based
Financial Times said in Monday's editions.
	   Shareholders were told last month that the company expected to
complete a U.S. purchase by March and it planned to generate at
least 20 percent of its sales from outside the highly-regulated
British industry within three years.
	   NEES will become a wholly owned subsidiary of National Grid, and
it will retain its name, as will its subsidiaries _ Massachusetts
Electric, Narragansett Electric, Granite State Electric and
Nantucket Electric. Headquarters will remain in Massachusetts.
	   ``Most important, our customers will continue to receive the
same great service from the same people in the yellow trucks, 24
hours a day, and they will continue to receive rates among the
lowest in the region,'' said Rick Sergel, president and chief
executive officer of NEES in a written statement. ``The only
difference is that we will have the resources of an international
leader behind us.''
	   The deal is still subject to regulator and shareholder approval.
	   In London, National Grid said the acquisition ``provides the
right point of entry into the U.S. for National Grid, given New
England's favorable economic climate and its more advanced state of
regulatory evolution towards performance-based regulation.''
	   National Grid's statement said the move provides ``an excellent
regional platform for growth in transmission and distribution.''
	   National Grid said Sergel would continue as president and chief
executive officer of NEES and become an excutive director of the
National Grid Board.
	   ``NEES has a strong reputation for efficient service to
customers and has already played a prominent role in the regulatory
developments in the region,'' said David Jones, chief executive of
National Grid. ``I am confident that as a group we will be able to
deliver on the exciting prospects in the Northeast U.S. and
continune to enhance value for National Grid shareholders.''
	   On March 1, Massachusetts passed an electricity deregulation
law, which has created strong incentives for electric companies to
sell off their generating plants and related assets. Separating the
generation of electricity from its delivery is supposed to create
greater competition among utilities and lower rates for customers.
	   Massachusetts and California are the only two states with
comprehensive electricity deregulation plans.
	   The deal between National Grid and New England Electric follows
the announcement last week of ScottishPower's dlrs 7.9 billion
takeover of the U.S.' PacifiCorp, which serves seven Western
states.
	   If that acquisition goes ahead, it will be the first ever
purchase of a U.S. electric utility by a foreign company. The
combined company would have 7 million customers in Britain and the
United States with 23,500 employees worldwide.

Clash reported on Yugoslav-Albanian border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) - Kosovo Albanian rebels and Yugoslav
border guards clashed Monday, and an unspecified number of ethnic
Albanians were killed and injured, Serbian media reported.
	   The clash occurred near the Kosovo border town of Prizren when
``a large group of armed Albanians'' tried to illegally cross the
border from Albania, the pro-government Media Center in Kosovo
said.
	   It said ``there are killed and injured among the Albanians''
after the clash with Yugoslav border guards. There were no
casualties among the government troops.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels, who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence, have frequently used illegal border routes to arm
themselves in neighboring Albania.
	   In a similar clash near the same region Dec. 3, Yugoslav army
border guards killed eight ethnic Albanians apparently trying to
smuggle arms from Albania.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 were left
homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown against Kosovo separatists in February.
	   Bloodshed abated _ but did not ceases _ after Milosevic promised
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on Oct. 12 to end the Kosovo campaign
and begin political negotiations on the province's future. The
cease-fire was reached under threat of NATO airstrikes.
	   NATO is setting up a 1,700-member force in Macedonia to rescue
international personnel monitoring the October peace accord in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic, Serbia.
	   U.S. efforts to arrange direct talks between the Serbs and
ethnic Albanian politicians have bogged down, with one side or the
other rejecting four U.S. drafts on the future of the province.

ICC to probe cricket betting and match fixing charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Changing its hands-off approach,
cricket's international governing body may probe charges of
match-fixing and betting by cricket players, an official said
Monday.
	   The executive board of the International Cricket Council will
meet at Christchurch, New Zealand, next month to consider setting
up a high powered commission to investigate these charges, Jagmohan
Dalmiya, the ICC president, told reporters in New Delhi.
	   ``I will recommend setting up such a commission,'' Dalmiya said.
``In this situation, the ICC cannot merely be a passive spectator
and its intervention in the matter at the earliest is essential.''
	   The ICC's decision to intervene came days after two Australian
cricketers admitted that they had taken money from an Indian bookie
for providing information about weather and field conditions that
could have affected play, and therefore affected betting odds. The
two, Shane Warne and Mark Waugh, also have alleged that two
Pakistani players had offered them money to lose a match in 1994 in
Sri Lanka, but they declined.
	   Both Waugh and Warne denied any involvement in match fixing or
bribery and said they had never bet on cricket.
	   Australian spinner Greg Matthews and former New Zealand fast
bowler Danny Morrison claimed they also had been approached to
provide match information.
	   Until now the ICC's approach was to leave the matter to cricket
boards of respective countries.
	   The Australian Cricket Board admitted it had at first covered up
Warne-Waugh affair and asked the International Cricket Council to
do the same.
	   ``In the best interests of the game of cricket and in order to
find out the veracity of the charges and allegations, the ICC shall
collect all possible available data and discuss the matter
thoroughly during the forthcoming meeting of the executive board on
Jan.11-12 at Christchurch under a special agenda,'' Dalmiya said.
	   The ICE, he promised , would not hesitate to take stringent
measures against match-fixing.
	   Australia, New Zealand, England, the West Indies, India,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe are the key cricket playing
nations.

One nuclear reactor restarted; Chernobyl reactor shutdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A nuclear reactor at one power plant was
restarted after lengthy repairs, permitting the long-delayed
shutdown of a reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, officials
said Monday.
	   Reactor No. 1 at the Zaporizhia plant was restarted late Sunday
after remaining idle for several months, and was being gradually
brought to full capacity, the state nuclear energy company
Energoatom said.
	   Ukraine has chronic energy problems, and the additional power
helped convince energy authorities they could temporarily turn off
and repair Chernobyl's only operational reactor, which has had
frequent malfunctions.
	   Reactor No. 3 at Chernobyl was to be stopped at midnight Monday,
and its output was being reduced during the day, said the Nuclear
Regulation Administration, Ukraine's nuclear safety agency.
	   The troubled reactor, which has been stopped many times since
undergoing major repairs between July 1997 and May 1998, was to be
shut down Dec. 1 to repair and upgrade safety equipment.
	   The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has agreed
to provide dlrs 118 million for the Chernobyl repairs.
	   But with Ukraine facing energy shortages this winter, the
government decided to put off the repairs until Dec. 15, saying it
would shut down Chernobyl's reactor only another reactor was
restarted to make up for the energy loss.
	   Many towns and villages in Ukraine, as well as hundreds of
industrial enterprises, already have electricity cuts for several
hours every day.
	   Reactor No. 3 has been Chernobyl's only working reactor since
1996, and plans call for the plant to be shut down entirely by
2000.
	   The plant has four reactors. One was closed in 1996, another was
halted after a 1991 fire, and the fourth was destroyed in 1986, in
the world's worst nuclear accident.
	   Ukraine has five nuclear power plants that account for more than
40 percent of the country's electricity production.

Refugees to top agenda of Bosnia peace conference
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Helping Bosnian war refugees return home,
three years after the conflict ended, is expected to dominate the
agenda of the Peace Implementation Council's annual conference that
begins here Tuesday.
	   ``The return of refugees is the emblematic issue of this
conference that must provide political and financial support for
those who want to return,'' Carlos Westendorp, the international
community's High Representative to Bosnia, was quoted as saying
Monday by the Spanish daily El Mundo.
	   The council, which represents some 40 countries and
organizations, was set up to oversee the implementation of the Dec.
1995 Dayton peace accords that ended Bosnia's four-year civil war.
	   The Dayton accords divided the country into the Muslim-Croat
Federation and the Serb Republic, and deployed a NATO-led peace
keeping force.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and U.S. Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott are among those expected at the two-day
Madrid conference.
	   The 1995 accords promised a safe return home and compensation
for property lost to the hundreds of thousands of refugees who fled
Bosnia or were internally displaced during the 1992-1995
ethnic-based war involving Muslims, Serbs and Croats.
	   The international organizations have admitted that their
forecast that 1998 would be the year of a mass refugee return was
premature.

territorial issue still outstanding from the Dayton accords.
	   Some 12,000 Muslims who lived in Brcko before the war now live
in neighboring villages waiting to find out if they will be able to
return to the town that is now dominated by Serbs, many of whom are
refugees from Sarajevo.

conference to raise the issue of long sentences handed down
Saturday by a Serb court to three Muslims found guilty of murder.
	   Westendorp, who has said the implementation of a functioning and
fair judicial system is a key condition for stability of peace in
Bosnia, issued a statement condemning the sentences because of the
scant evidence presented at the trial.
	   Earlier this month, the top official, who currently has
extensive powers over Bosnian institutions and politicians, said
the aim for 1999 was to create a self-sustaining peace in Bosnia
and prepare the country to live without foreign aid.
	   Meanwhile, street posters in Madrid called for a demonstration
to coincide with the conference demanding that Serbian leaders
responsible for ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and the Yugoslavian
province of Kosovo to be brought to justice.

One nuclear reactor restarted; Chernobyl reactor shutdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A nuclear reactor at one power plant was
restarted after lengthy repairs, permitting the long-delayed
shutdown of a reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, officials
said Monday.
	   Reactor No. 1 at the Zaporizhia plant was restarted late Sunday
after remaining idle for several months, and was being gradually
brought to full capacity, the state nuclear energy company
Energoatom said.
	   Ukraine has chronic energy problems, and the additional power
helped convince energy authorities they could temporarily turn off
and repair Chernobyl's only operational reactor, which has had
frequent malfunctions.
	   Reactor No. 3 at Chernobyl was to be stopped at midnight Monday,
and its output was being reduced during the day, said the Nuclear
Regulation Administration, Ukraine's nuclear safety agency.
	   The troubled reactor, which has been stopped many times since
undergoing major repairs between July 1997 and May 1998, was to be
shut down Dec. 1 to repair and upgrade safety equipment.
	   The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has agreed
to provide dlrs 118 million for the Chernobyl repairs.
	   But with Ukraine facing energy shortages this winter, the
government decided to put off the repairs until Dec. 15, saying it
would shut down Chernobyl's reactor only another reactor was
restarted to make up for the energy loss.
	   Many towns and villages in Ukraine, as well as hundreds of
industrial enterprises, already have electricity cuts for several
hours every day.
	   Reactor No. 3 has been Chernobyl's only working reactor since
1996, and plans call for the plant to be shut down entirely by
2000.
	   The plant has four reactors. One was closed in 1996, another was
halted after a 1991 fire, and the fourth was destroyed in 1986, in
the world's worst nuclear accident.
	   Ukraine has five nuclear power plants that account for more than
40 percent of the country's electricity production.

Refugees to top agenda of Bosnia peace conference
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Helping Bosnian war refugees return home,
three years after the conflict ended, is expected to dominate the
agenda of the Peace Implementation Council's annual conference that
begins here Tuesday.
	   ``The return of refugees is the emblematic issue of this
conference that must provide political and financial support for
those who want to return,'' Carlos Westendorp, the international
community's High Representative to Bosnia, was quoted as saying
Monday by the Spanish daily El Mundo.
	   The council, which represents some 40 countries and
organizations, was set up to oversee the implementation of the Dec.
1995 Dayton peace accords that ended Bosnia's four-year civil war.
	   The Dayton accords divided the country into the Muslim-Croat
Federation and the Serb Republic, and deployed a NATO-led peace
keeping force.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and U.S. Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott are among those expected at the two-day
Madrid conference.
	   The 1995 accords promised a safe return home and compensation
for property lost to the hundreds of thousands of refugees who fled
Bosnia or were internally displaced during the 1992-1995
ethnic-based war involving Muslims, Serbs and Croats.
	   The international organizations have admitted that their
forecast that 1998 would be the year of a mass refugee return was
premature.
	   The council is also expected to focus on the status of the town
of Brcko _ a key strategic location claimed by both the
Muslem-Croat Federation and the Serb Republic and the last
territorial issue still outstanding from the Dayton accords.
	   Some 12,000 Muslims who lived in Brcko before the war now live
in neighboring villages waiting to find out if they will be able to
return to the town that is now dominated by Serbs, many of whom are
refugees from Sarajevo.
	   Meanwhile, the Muslim-led Federation has said it will use the

Saturday by a Serb court to three Muslims found guilty of murder.
	   Westendorp, who has said the implementation of a functioning and
fair judicial system is a key condition for stability of peace in

scant evidence presented at the trial.

	   CONAKRY, Guinea _ Watched over by platoons of soldiers and
police, thousands of Guineans walked to polling stations throughout
the country Monday for the second multi-party presidential
elections since independence in 1958.
	   The election was widely expected to be won by President Lansana
Conte, who first seized power in a 1984 coup.
	   The country's land borders, airport and seaports have been
closed to stave off any possible violence, and no traffic was
allowed on Monday. Voters, others than those with special
government permits, had to walk to the more than 8,000 polling
stations.
	   There were no immediate reports of violence or disturbances. On
Saturday, six people are believed to have been killed in Conakry
street clashes after a ruling party rally.
	   Even Conte's opponents were expecting that Conte would win the
vote, noting his government funding, military support, control of
the broadcast media and a political party that is tightly entwined
with the government.
	   Soldiers have been deployed throughout the country for the
voting in case of violence. Polls opened at 8 a.m. (0800 GMT) and
close at 6 p.m. (1800 GMT). It was unclear when results would be
released.

Clash reported on Yugoslav-Albanian border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo Albanian rebels and Yugoslav
border guards clashed Monday, and an unspecified number of ethnic
Albanians were killed and injured, Serbian media reported.
	   The clash occurred near the Kosovo town of Prizren, on
Yugoslavia's border with Albania, when ``a large group of armed
Albanians'' tried to illegally cross the border from Albania, the
pro-government Media Center in Kosovo said.
	   It said ``there are killed and injured among the Albanians''
after the clash with Yugoslav border guards. There were no
casualties reported among the government troops.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels, who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence, have frequently used illegal border routes to arm
themselves in neighboring Albania.
	   In a similar clash near the same region Dec. 3, Yugoslav army
border guards killed eight ethnic Albanians apparently trying to
smuggle arms from Albania.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 were left
homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown against Kosovo separatists in February.
	   Bloodshed abated _ but did not cease _ after Milosevic promised
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on Oct. 12 to end the Kosovo campaign
and begin political negotiations on the province's future. The
cease-fire was reached under threat of NATO airstrikes.
	   NATO is setting up a 1,700-member force in Macedonia to rescue
international personnel monitoring the October peace accord in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic, Serbia.
	   U.S. efforts to arrange direct talks between the Serbs and
ethnic Albanian politicians have bogged down, with one side or the
other rejecting four U.S. drafts on the future of the province.

German official suggests Holocaust museum instead of memorial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's new culture minister on Monday proposed
abandoning long-debated plans for a giant Holocaust memorial in
Berlin and building a Holocaust museum, research center and park on
the site instead.
	   Michael Naumann told Berlin's Tagesspiegel newspaper that the
new concept he is working on would be aimed above all at educating
young people about the Holocaust, rather than simply erecting a
``landscape of stone.''
	   Naumann said he wants to cooperate with Holocaust museums in
Washington and Jerusalem and the Leo Baeck Institute in New York in
setting up a Holocaust library and research center in Berlin as
well as a teaching museum.
	   He also proposed financing the project by selling a third of the
two-hectare (five-acre) site that had been donated for the memorial
by the federal government under former chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Naumann called the empty plot, in the heart of Berlin,
``oversized anyway.'' The Tagesspiegel said it was worth at least
150 million marks (dlrs 90 million).
	   Plans for a national Holocaust memorial have been in contention
for 10 years, with politicians and intellectuals arguing over
whether a single, giant sculpture could adequately represent an
atrocity so sweeping and horrific. Six million Jews were killed in
the Holocaust.
	   The leading design had been a cemetery-like field of 2,700
concrete pillars designed by U.S. architect Peter Eisenman.
	   Kohl was the project's biggest backer, but he put it on hold
before the election, saying he didn't want it to become a campaign
issue.
	   The new chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, has expressed doubts
about the monument and plans to have parliament decide how to
proceed next year.

 &UR; Croatian, Bosnian officials meet to discuss border dispute

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatian and Bosnian experts met Monday
on a border dispute stemming from the Bosnian war that is further
burdening tense bilateral relations.
	   The meeting came on the eve of a talks in Madrid, Spain, between
Bosnian and international officials on how much progress has been
made in erasing the scars of the war that ended in 1995.
	   The state-run news agency HINA reported that the Bosnian
delegation came to Zagreb despite threats it would not attend talks
until Croatia pulls out its border police from the disputed border
town of Martin Brod in northwestern Bosnia.
	   Martin Brod was part of Bosnia before the 1991-95 war. But
during the 1995 battles that preceded the Dayton peace accord,
Croatian forces routed Serbs in that area and moved the border
deeper into Bosnian territory, deploying police on the river Una,
which runs through the city.
	   Croatia said some prewar maps justified the move.
	   Bosnia rejects the claims and wants Croatian forces out of the
town.
	   Last week, Bosnia's top international official, Carlos
Westendorp, sent a letter to the two neighboring countries, saying
he considers the prewar border valid until the two sides resolve
the problem.
	   The Martin Brod dispute has further burdened relations between
the two countries. Croatia supported Bosnian Croats in their
1993-1994 conflict with Bosnia's Muslims.

Sri Lankan dam-runner takes Asian Games gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Sri Lankan sprinter who trained by
running along the top of a dam wall in the mountains won gold
Monday at the Asian Games, in a story of success from humble
beginnings.
	   Sugath Tillekeratne won the 400 meters in 44.99 seconds. His
medal and a victory in the women's 400 meters by Damayanthi Darsha
gave Sri Lanka its first Asian Games golds in 24 years.
	   Tillekeratne, a quiet 25-year-old from a poor family of five
children in central Sri Lanka, started training seven years ago by
running back and forth along the 90-meter- (300-foot-) long dam _
the only flat piece of land in the mountains around his family
home. He ran in canvas shoes and said it was boring to always cover
the same piece of land.
	   But the hard work paid off. He was picked for national training
and now lives in Colombo, the capital.
	   ``I started from humble beginnings, but I'm comfortable now,''
he said after his win Monday.
	   Asked how he compares as a runner to Michael Johnson, the
Olympic champion, Tillekeratne said: ``We'll see at the 2000
Olympics.''
	   Tillekeratne also won a bronze in the Commonwealth Games. He was
welcomed as a hero by the sports minister after that victory but
treated like a criminal by soldiers after he was slow to show his
identity papers at a checkpoint.
	   He said the soldiers were rude and threatening. Hours earlier,
he had been greeted with a garland of flowers at the airport by
Sports Minister Sumanaweera Dissanayake. When he told the troops
who he was, the soldiers said they didn't care and tried to beat
him up.

Filipino beheaded in Saudi for 1996 murder of American couple
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A Filipino accused of murdering an
American couple was beheaded in the Saudi capital Riyadh Monday,
the Interior Ministry said.
	   Bernie Morante was convicted of the 1996 murder of Berry Bailey
and his wife, Mary Anne.
	   Morante, 27, was arrested Dec. 8, 1996, on the day of the
killing, while trying to board a flight to the Philippines.
	   His wife and two children live in Manila.
	   Morante _ a computer operator in the facilities and utilities
department of the King Khaled International Airport in Riyadh _ was
accused of fatally stabbing Bailey at his home due to a personal
grudge.
	   Bailey, 50, who was Morante's supervisor, named his assailant
before he died in hospital.
	   Mrs. Bailey was stabbed by the killer as she tried to intervene
to save her husband. She ran to a neighbor's home, where she died
of her wounds.
	   The couple had grown children who live in Texas.
	   Morante's execution raised to 28 the number of beheadings in the
kingdom this year. Last year 124 people were executed. Saudi
Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for murder, rape,
drug trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are carried out with
a sword in public.
	   Human rights groups have criticized the executions, saying that
the suspects do not receive fair trials, are denied lawyers and do
not have the right to appeal.

Russia's Yeltsin to meet presidents of Switzerland, Belarus

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, who is still recuperating
from his latest illness, plans to meet this week with the
presidents of Switzerland and Belarus, his spokesman said Monday.
	   Swiss President Flavio Cotti begins a three-day visit to Russia

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, who is still recuperating
from his latest illness, plans to meet this week with the
presidents of Switzerland and Belarus, his spokesman said Monday.

ICC to probe cricket betting and match fixing charges

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Changing its hands-off approach,
cricket's international governing body may probe charges of
match-fixing and betting by cricket players, an official said
Monday.
	   The executive board of the International Cricket Council will
meet at Christchurch, New Zealand, next month to consider setting
up a high powered commission to investigate these charges, Jagmohan
Dalmiya, the ICC president, told reporters in New Delhi.
	   ``I will recommend setting up such a commission,'' Dalmiya said.
``In this situation, the ICC cannot merely be a passive spectator
and its intervention in the matter at the earliest is essential.''
	   The ICC's decision to intervene came days after two Australian
cricketers admitted that they had taken money from an Indian bookie
for providing information about weather and field conditions that
could have affected play, and therefore affected betting odds. The
two, Shane Warne and Mark Waugh, also have alleged that two
Pakistani players had offered them money to lose a match in 1994 in
Sri Lanka, but they declined.
	   Both Waugh and Warne denied any involvement in match fixing or
bribery and said they had never bet on cricket.
	   Australian spinner Greg Matthews and former New Zealand fast
bowler Danny Morrison claimed they also had been approached to
provide match information.
	   Until now the ICC's approach was to leave the matter to cricket
boards of respective countries.
	   The Australian Cricket Board admitted it had at first covered up
Warne-Waugh affair and asked the International Cricket Council to
do the same.
	   ``In the best interests of the game of cricket and in order to
find out the veracity of the charges and allegations, the ICC shall
collect all possible available data and discuss the matter
thoroughly during the forthcoming meeting of the executive board on
Jan.11-12 at Christchurch under a special agenda,'' Dalmiya said.
	   The ICC, he promised , would not hesitate to take stringent
measures against match-fixing.
	   Australia, New Zealand, England, the West Indies, India,
Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe are the key cricket
playing nations.

Judge in India calls for protection for actors in controversial
</HEADLINE>
film &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The Supreme Court ordered the government
Monday to provide body guards for actors and others who have filed
a lawsuit to get a film on lesbian love back in the theaters.
	   The court responded after actors' lawyers told the three-judge
bench hearing their case that they had been threatened by the
films' opponents, United News of India reported.
	   Saturday, some 80 members of the right-wing Shiv Sena party clad
only in their underwear _ as a statement about what they see as the
film world's immorality _ protested at the Bombay home of one of
the actors, Dilip Kumar. Shi Sena is known for its sometimes
violent tactics.
	   When Saturday's protest was criticized by some members of the
upper house of parliament Monday, a Shiv Sena lawmaker called Kumar
a ``Pakistani,'' Press Trust of India news agency reported. The
comment was tantamount to labeling Kumar a traitor given the long
history of hostility between India and neighboring Pakistan.
	   Kumar is not directly connected with the movie, but is one of
the most prominent film personalities who signed a petition in
support of ``Fire'' filed before the Supreme Court. The petitioners
asked the court to ensure that the film can be shown without
disruption in India.
	   In recent weeks, Sena members have stormed into movie theaters,
tearing down posters and breaking windows to force cinemas to stop
showing the film, saying its sexual content is an affront to Hindu
values.
	   ``Fire'' is the story of women in unhappy marriages to two
brothers living in New Delhi. The sisters-in-law, seeking comfort,
develops a lesbian relationship.
	   Until the Shiv Sena protests erupted, ``Fire'' showed for three
weeks with little comment in India, though sex is rarely discussed
in this traditional society and issues such as homosexuality are
rarely even acknowledged.

	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Four military police officers died Monday
after their helicopter hit some tree branches and crashed in
northern Italy.
	   Police said thick fog apparently obscured the pilot's vision,
causing the A-109 helicopter to hit the tree. The helicopter fell
minutes after taking off from the military airport of Volpiano,
about 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Turin.
	   The victims, all officers in Italy's Carabinieri military
police, included general Franco Romano, chief of the unit in
Piedmont, the northern Italian region which borders with France.
The helicopter's pilot, co-pilot and a Swiss-born officer also
died.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ France's Societe Generale signed a
dlrs 200 million deal Monday to give it a majority stake in the
Romanian Bank for Development.
	   ``It's a first step to create a healthy and competitive banking
system,'' said Prime Minister Radu Vasile after the signing. It is
the first Romanian bank to be privatized.
	   Societe Generale won the bid for a 51 percent stake in the bank
earlier this month. It will pay dlrs 135 million to the Romanian
government and dlrs 65 million to raise the bank's share capital by
20 percent.
	   The Romanian Bank for Development is the country's
fourth-largest state-owned bank, and had a net profit of dlrs 100
million last year. Societe Generale is one of France's big retail
lenders and has operations worldwide.
	   The International Monetary Fund, which is expected to resume
negotiations for a new stand-by loan for Romania in January, has
conditioned further loans on the privatization of banks.
	   The agreement with IMF is badly needed to help the government
pay off dlrs 2.2 billion of foreign debts next year.
	   The IMF suspended a dlrs 430 million loan for the country in
May, due to political bickering and an economic crisis.

Ukrainian miner sets self on fire to protest non-payment of wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A 35-year-old miner doused himself with
gasoline and set himself on fire Monday to protest unpaid wages.
Police and fellow miners put out the flames and rushed him to a
hospital.
	   Oleksandr Mykhalevych was hospitalized in the eastern city of
Luhansk with burns covering nearly half his body, the independent
UNIAN news agency said. Doctors were treating Mykhalevych, but it
was not immediately clear if he would survive.
	   Mykhalevych, a father to three children, set himself ablaze in
front of a government building to protest against the chronic
non-payment of wages. He and his colleagues from a mine in the
nearby town of Alchevsk have not been paid in more than six months.
	   Mykhalevych was among 200 miners from Alchevsk who have picketed
the regional administration building since the summer to demand
overdue salaries.
	   But despite living for months in tents in a city park in front
of Luhansk government headquarters, the miners have failed to get
their money.
	   Before setting himself on fire, Mykhalevych wrote a note saying
he was acting because he had lost hope of receiving the money due
him.
	   ``I'm tired of being scorned by mine directors and the regional
administration. My (self-immolation) is hardly a way out, but it
might help resolve the matter more quickly,'' read the note,
according to UNIAN.
	   Coal miners have been protesting throughout Ukraine, but to
little avail.
	   More than 40,000 coal workers at various mines demonstrated two
weeks ago, part of a series of protests that have kept dozens of
Ukraine's 275 mines idled for months.
	   Despite the protests, the government has so far failed to pay
back salaries in the mining industry. Miners are currently owed
more than 2 billion hryvna (dlrs 584 million) in back wages, and
the debt has been increasing.
	   Many of the mines are unprofitable and the cash-strapped
government lacks money for wages and subsidies.

More than 200 treated after melee in Ho Chi Minh City
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ More than 200 people received medical
treatment after disturbances erupted during performances attended
by hundreds of thousands of people commemorating the 300th
anniversary of Ho Chi Minh City, a city official said Monday.
	   Dang Viet Tinh, director of the city's emergency center, said
237 people were treated after they fainted Saturday night in a
stampede set off by people who pressed forward in the massive crowd
to get a better view of the performers.
	   He said no violence was involved. But a videotape taken by the
British Broadcasting Corp. showed people throwing chairs, plastic
bottles and shoes. At least one woman's face was bloodied, and one
man received mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
	   The videotape showed people panicking as the crowd pressed
forward, and some young people climbing on the stage and damaging
equipment there.
	   There was no immediate explanation of what set off the incident.
	   Hundreds of thousands of people attended concerts, fashion shows
and other events on Saturday launching a week of festivities
commemorating the 300th anniversary of Ho Chi Minh City, formerly
called Saigon.
	   The crowd was the largest in the city since the end of the
Vietnam War in 1975, Tinh said.
	   The performances were interrupted several times as people were
brought to the stage for first aid, Tinh said.
	   He said nine people were slightly hurt with bruises and other
injuries. All 237 were released the same night after receiving
medical treatment.
	   The center provided four ambulances during the celebrations, but
they could not be used because of the crowded streets, Tinh said.
	   Violence and protests are rare in Vietnam and seldom are
publicized.
	   Hundreds of villagers were arrested last year in Thai Binh
province, about 90 kilometers (55 miles) south of Hanoi, in a wave
of protests triggered by farmers' anger over corruption among local
officials.

 &UR; U.S. envoy Holbrooke tries to defuse Russian missile crisis &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Holbrooke arriving in Athens for meetings. No
pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK QUINN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ With the Cyprus impasse reaching a
critical juncture, U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke tried Monday to
prevent the deployment of missiles that could start a war between
NATO allies Greece and Turkey.
	   Holbrooke arrived from Istanbul, Turkey, where he met with
business leaders from the war-divided island.
	   While in Turkey, Holbrooke studiously avoided commenting on the
crisis over the Russian S-300 missiles, planned for deployment on
Cyprus. The United States strongly opposes Cyprus' plans to install
the anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Reports said the initial delivery schedule had the missiles
leaving Russia on Tuesday. But there was no independent
confirmation that the repeatedly delayed delivery was imminent.
	   Turkey has said it will use force to stop them, which could
touch off a conflict with regional rival Greece. Athens has a
defense accord with Greek Cypriots.
	   The eastern Mediterranean island has been separated since 1974,
when Turkish troops invaded its northern third after an abortive
Athens-backed coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in a northern breakaway state
recognized only by Ankara.
	   While in Athens, Holbrooke planned a meeting with Defense
Minister Akis Tsochadzopoulos, and later have a private dinner
meeting with Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos at the residence
of U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns. Pangalos said the two men would
make no public comments after their talks.
	   It was uncertain if Holbrooke would see Premier Costas Simitis,
who has the most clout to persuade the Cypriots to change their
minds on the missiles.
	   Holbrooke and others are said to favor placing the missiles in
storage here, or deploying them on the Greek island of Crete.
	   Worried about the political cost of such a move, Simitis has
firmly placed the decision with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides.
On Sunday, Clerides said the deployment will go ahead as scheduled.
	   In Istanbul, Holbrooke avoided the political difficulties as
part of a low-stakes strategy to encourage business contacts across
the U.N.-monitored line dividing Cyprus.
	   Greek and Turkish Cypriot entrepreneurs at the meeting agreed to
try and cooperate on several initiatives, including solving a water
shortage; having their languages taught in each others' schools;
establishing an island-wide cellular phone network and make efforts
to restore historic monuments.
	   It was a small step considering that U.N.-sponsored talks have
been deadlocked since late 1997, after Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash insisted on recognition and an end to negotiations for
Cyprus' accession to the European Union.
	   ``I'm not happy we have not made progress in the past year, but
we must persevere,'' Holbrooke said during the Istanbul gathering.
	   But it was apparent at the meeting that Holbrooke may also have
had other problems on his mind. Sources said he was preparing for a
trip to the Yugoslav capital Belgrade for talks on the Kosovo
province.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ On the first visit of a U.S.
president to Palestinian territory, Bill Clinton told Palestinians
Monday they are now free to ``determine their own destiny on their
own land.''
	   After a warm welcome from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat that
included a giant American flag draping the new Gaza airport's
control tower, Clinton pledged that the United States would help
Palestinians create a society of tolerance, freedom and prosperity.
	   He urged reconciliation with Israel as the only path to a
permanent peace.
	   ``For the first time in the history of the Palestinian movement,
the Palestinian people and their elected representatives now have a
chance to determine their own destiny on their own land,'' Clinton
said in an exchange of remarks with Arafat at a luncheon in his
honor at a Gaza City beach resort.
	   Clinton was in Gaza City to witness a landmark vote by the
Palestinian National Council to renounce passages of the
Palestinian Liberation Organization's charter that call for the
destruction of Israel.

German talks on nuclear power shutdown set for January
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Talks between the government and power
companies on shutting down Germany's 19 nuclear plants will begin
next month, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Monday.
	   He made the announcement after holding preliminary talks with
four leading nuclear energy operators on an strategy for scrapping
nuclear power. ``All participants are prepared to reach an
agreement,'' Schroeder said. No exact date was set yet.
	   The Social Democrats and the environmentalist Greens took power
in October calling for an end to nuclear power in Germany, a major
policy reversal for the country.
	   If the talks do not produce a deal after one year, the
government says it intends to pass legislation setting a timetable
on its own.
	   Schroeder, who will chair the talks, said he was confident a
``sensible solution'' would be found.
	   Utilities have warned the government of huge compensation
lawsuits if nuclear plants are shut down prematurely. Schroeder
said the power executives reiterated in Monday's talks that the
compensation issue ``must be considered.''
	   Economics Minister Werner Mueller, a former utility company
executive who is taking part in the energy talks, has ruled out
government compensation for shuttered plants.

Thai investigators will send downed plane's black box abroad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTs for AMs, UPDATES with Thai officials seeking foreign
country to analyze flight data, CORREX which of two Australian
women were injured and who saved whom in grafs 19,20
 &UR; By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SURAT THANI, Thailand (AP) _ While soldiers dragged the wreckage
of a Thai Airways jet from a muddy rubber plantation on Monday,
investigators said they will ask another country to analyze the
plane's black box in order to stop the mudslinging over who caused
the crash that killed 101 people.
	   ``We're seeking help from third countries. We want one to
analyze the data,'' said Sawat Sitiwon, director-general of the
Department of Aviation.
	   France has been ruled out because Airbus, the French
manufacturer of the A310-200 that crashed, is participating in the
Thai investigation.
	   Both aviation authorities and the plane's pilot have been blamed
for the crash of FlTG261, which plunged to the ground during a
heavy rainstorm on Friday in Surat Thani, 530 kilometers (330
miles) southwest of Bangkok.
	   Searchers recovered remains of the last victim on Sunday, and
military helicopters and troops continued hauling out sections and
shards of the plane from the flooded rubber plantation where it
crashed, about 700 meters (760 yards) from the airport runway.
	   Several of the 45 survivors said the pilot, who died of his
injuries after the crash, should never have attempted a third
landing after failing the first two times.
	   In its editorial on Monday, The Nation newspaper derided a
``macho mentality'' it said existed among some of Thai Airways'
pilots and urged people not to fly the carrier.
	   It also said the air traffic controllers and Surat Thani airport
officials were culpable for not advising the pilot to divert to
another airport because of the weather.
	   Sawat insisted today that the airport's lack of state-of-the-art
landing equipment did not cause the crash.
	   ``The systems we have in place are capable of guiding the plane
in a similar manner,'' he said.
	   Blame fell on aviation authorities after they admitted that
Surat Thani airport's instrument landing system had been removed
several months ago during renovation work. ILS equipment enables
airliners to land when visibility is poor.
	   The removal of the ILS equipment meant the pilot would have had
to land using only his eyes to see the runway, or possibly with
radio navigation aids that are less precise than an instrument
landing system.
	   Chamnong Sanarksorn, director of air navigation facilities at
Surat Thani airport, said all airlines had been informed about the
removal of the airport's ILS system.
	   But he refused to answer questions about reports that the air
traffic controller on duty during the crash has been ordered to
take a leave from work. Airport officials have not brought the
controller forward to answer reporters' questions.
	   ``Because of the investigation, no one is supposed to tell you
anything,'' he said.
	   Chamnong said it was the pilot's responsibility to decide
whether to try to land or to fly to another airport where
conditions were better. Aviation experts agreed that the pilot is
in charge in such a situation.
	   Although survivors faulted the pilot, they praised Thai rescue
workers and volunteers who came to their aid after the plane
slammed into the rubber plantation.
	   ``The rescue workers were just great,'' said Melanie McNamee of
Australia.
	   She was pulled from the wreckage to safety by her friend,
Lucinda Rhodes, moments before the jetliner caught fire.
	   Thai volunteers quickly arrived with stretchers to carry them
out of the swamp. McNamee had suffered broken ribs and broken
vertebrae.
	   Seven-year-old Apichart Petcharat, who is suffering from
leukemia, also proved himself a hero during the ordeal.
	   Apichart crawled through a crack in the plane's fuselage and
stumbled through darkness to guide rescue workers toward his
family, said his aunt, Sawaporn Kongyongyuen, who spoke to the
independent television station ITV.
	   Sawaporn was caught in the twisted metal together with the boy's
mother.
	   ``I saw flashlights and ran to the rescue men, and they said
`Where's your Mom?''' Apichart said.
	   Thai Airways President Thamnoon Wanglee also lauded the rescue
workers, noting that there had been no reports of looting of
passengers' valuables. Such thefts occurred after several other air
crashes in Southeast Asia.

	   Clinton had met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
in Jerusalem on Sunday.
	   In remarks preceding Clinton, Arafat heaped praise on the
American president for helping pull together the Wye River
land-for-security agreement two months ago.
	   And he thanked him for inaugurating the new Gaza International
Airport, which he called a ``window on the world'' for
Palestinians.
	   ``You are also inaugurating another window for our people
towards freedom, peace and prosperity,'' Arafat said. ``This is a
window, a window for the peace of the brave, peace with our
neighbors.''
	   Clinton applauded Arafat for showing the ``strength, courage and
wisdom'' to make peace with Israel.
	   Despite Clinton's glowing words and hopeful tone, the Wye River
accords have been unraveling in recent weeks, and violence in the
Palestinian-controlled West Bank has been the worst in months.
	   `The way ahead may be hard and uncertain, but the way you left
behind is full of self-defeating violence and soul-withering
hate,'' Clinton said. ``So we have no choice but the way ahead.''
He said there is ``reason for hope,'' despite the frequent
obstacles to fashioning a permanent peace with the Jewish state.

Japan agrees to give Tanzania aid package
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi met with
Tanzanian President Benjamin William Mkapa Monday and agreed to
provide the African nation with 2.3 billion yen (dlrs 19.8 million)
in aid.
	   After the meeting, the aid agreement was signed between Foreign
Minister Masahiko Komura and Zakia Meghji, Tanzanian minister of
Natural Resources and Tourism.
	   The grant consisted of 1.5 million yen (dlrs 12.9 million) for
flood relief and to aid refugees and 800 million yen (dlrs 6.9
million) to increase food production, the official said.
	   In the meeting, Mkapa asked for Japan's help in developing
Tanzania's tourism industry and in building bridges and water works
in southern Tanzania, the official said.
	   Mkapa also asked Japan to increase its investment in Tanzania,
the official said.
	   The official quoted Obuchi as saying the Japan International
Cooperation agency will help develop Tanzania tourism. Obuchi said
he hopes the African nation will join a seminar by the agency on
tourism next year in Japan.
	   Japan will study how it can help develop southern Tanzania, the
official quoted Obuchi as saying to Mkapa.
	   Mkapa will attend investment seminars Tuesday in Tokyo and on
Wednesday in Osaka before leaving Thursday for a visit to South
Korea.
	   Earlier, Mkapa and his wife Anna met with Japanese Emperor
Akihito and Empress Michiko at the Imperial Palace.

Jayasinghe pulls out of games; Ito misses mark
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; ADDS details on Jayasinghe going home &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Susantika Jayasinghe's controversial
year finished with another twist Monday when she left Bangkok and
the Asian Games after missing the 100-meter final because of
injury.
	   Jayasinghe, hurt in the semifinals Sunday, was allowed to leave
by Sri Lankan team officials, ruling her out of the 200 event, in
which she is the world championship silver medalist.
	   ``In yesterday's heats she pulled her hamstring,'' Sri Lankan
team chief Maya Gunasekhara told The Associated Press. ``This
morning we took her to the clinic and it was apparent that she
cannot run. She wanted to go back home as soon as possible.''
	   While Jayasinghe missed her final, Japan's Koji Ito muffed the
start of the men's 100 and blew his chances of joining the
exclusive club of sub-10-second sprinters.
	   Ito's reaction time at the gun was the worst of the eight
runners but he recovered to win the gold. His bid to become the
first non-black athlete under 10 seconds disappeared as he crossed
in 10.05.
	   Only 26 men, all black, have broken the 10-second barrier.
Poland's Marian Woronin just missed out, having the best time of a
white athlete with 10.00 in Warsaw in 1984. Ito also had an Asian
record 10.00 in Sunday's semifinals, raising the prospect of a
better run Monday.
	   His chances looked to have been blown away by strong gusts of
wind Monday, before it dropped to a rare lull. He got a legal
tailwind reading of 1.6, but was unable to make up for lost time.
	   ``Maybe I failed to live up to everyone's expectations to be
under 10 seconds,'' Ito said. ``But at least I excited everyone.''
	   Thailand's Seeharwong Reanchai edged Japan's Yasukatsu Otsuki
for the silver medal in a photo finish after both clocked 10.31.
	   Sri Lankan fans had not heard their national anthem at an Asian
Games for five editions and 24 years but despite Jayasinghe's
decision to miss the sprint because of injury, the country got two
anthems in succession. Its 400-meter sprinters Damayanthi Darsha
and Sugath Tillekeratne delivered a double blast.
	   Jayasinghe, competing here under a drug cloud, complained of a
hamstring injury and headache after qualifying in Sunday's
semifinals. She tested positive for a steroid in March but is
allowed to compete while the International Amateur Athletic
Federation awaits an arbitration hearing.
	   Jayasinghe has been cleared by Sri Lankan officials after saying
she used the steroid to control her menstrual cycle. She has also
leveled accusations of sexual harassment against Sri Lankan
officials this year.
	   With the world 200 silver medalist missing, China's Asian record
holder Li Xuemei won in a wind-aided 11.05 seconds. China's Yali Li
was second and India's Rachita Mistry got a photo decision to take
bronze. Li Xuemei said she had suffered diarrhea and a fever.
	   Darsha's win in the 400 gave Sri Lanka its first gold since her
coach Sunil Gumawardeme was a member of the 1974 4x100-meter relay
team.
	   Darsha had the field under her control after the opening 100 and
cruised down the final straight, crossing the line in 51.57.
China's Chen Yuxiang battled home with a face covered in pain to
get silver in 52.50. Bronze went to Svetlana Bodritskaya (53.00) of
Kazakstan while veteran Indian P.T. Usha was sixth in 54.37.
	   Tillekeratne had to work harder to win the men's 400 in 44.99,
overcoming a strong challenge by Ibrahim Faraj of Qatar, who
clocked 45.32 after easing up near the line. India's Paramjit Singh
got the bronze.
	   Eleven of the 43 track and field gold medals were on offer in
Monday's packed program, but the late afternoon session was largely
ignored by the public, with only about 5,000 people in the
20,000-capacity main stadium.
	   Tiny Indian Jyotirmoy Sikdhar continued a great session for
subcontinent athletes when she outsprinted China's Wang Qingfen to
win the women's 1,500 in 4:12.82. Wang finished in 4:13.19, with
India's Sunita Rani adding a bronze.
	   Organizers angered jeering Indian fans by playing the wrong
anthem at Sikdhar's medal ceremony, so 10 minutes later they
brought the medalists out and played the right tune.
	   Qatar's Mohamad Taib won the men's 1,500 for the third
successive games in a bizarre finish. He slowed right down near the
end, waving his rivals closer, then turned around and made a rude
gesture down the track.
	   Japan and China finished the second day of track with six golds
each of the 17 decided. Other winners Monday were Shen Shengfei of
China in the heptathlon, Japan's Yuko Kawakami in the women's
10,000-meter event, Liu Hao of China in the men's shot put and
China's Liu Hongyu in the women's 10-kilometer walk.

	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ A helicopter hit tree branches and crashed
Monday in northern Italy, killing a general in the Carabinieri
military police agency and three other officers.
	   Police said thick fog apparently obscured the pilot's vision.
The A-109 helicopter hit the tree and fell minutes after taking off
from the military airport at Volpiano, about 20 kilometers (12
miles) north of Turin.
	   The victims included Gen. Franco Romano, chief of the unit in
Piedmont, the northern Italian region which borders with France.
The helicopter's pilot, co-pilot and a Swiss-born officer also
died.

Hodler repeats allegations, cites `worst three days' of life
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Monday news conference
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Marc Hodler, the Swiss Olympic
official who set off the biggest corruption scandal in IOC history,
said Monday he had experienced ``the worst three days'' of his life
since making his bribery allegations.
	   Hodler, a senior IOC executive board member, repeated his
principal vote-buying charges and said Salt Lake City had been
``blackmailed'' during its successful bid for the 2002 Winter
Games.
	   In an emotional news conference, the 80-year-old Hodler said he
hadn't slept in three days since going public with his accusations
of payoffs in the bidding and selection process for Olympic host
cities.
	   ``These have been the three worst days I have spent in my long
career in sport,'' he said. ``In times of crisis you get to know
who your friends and who your enemies are.''
	   Asked who his enemies were, he said, ``Certainly not in the
(IOC) executive board, certainly not in (IOC) headquarters, but
sitting here'' _ an apparent reference to certain members of the
media.
	   Hodler rocked the Olympic movement Saturday when he alleged that
four ``agents'' _ including one IOC member _ had been involved in
vote-buying over the past 10 years. He cited supposed
irregularities in the elections of at least four Olympic cities _
Atlanta; Nagano, Japan; Sydney, Australia, and Salt Lake.
	   Hodler said he thought 5 to 7 percent of the IOC members _
currently numbering 115 _ were open to bribery.
	   On Monday, he repeated his defense of the Salt Lake City
scholarship program which is being investigated by a high-level IOC
panel.
	   The Salt Lake bid committee operated a fund which provided
nearly dlrs 400,000 in aid to 13 people, including six relatives of
IOC members.
	   Hodler, who has previously described the program as a ``bribe''
to say the votes of IOC members, said Salt Lake was not to blame.
	   ``For us, Salt Lake City was a victim of blackmail and not a
villain,'' he said. ``The real villains are the agents who put the
cities in awkward positions using blackmail. ... Salt Lake City had
been forced by blackmail to give financial favors.''
	   Hodler said the ``most detestable agent'' has approached bid
cities claiming that ``never in the past 15 years has a city won
the games without his help.''
	   He said the other agents promise to secure IOC votes for free,
while demanding dlrs 3 million if the city wins the bid.
	   Hodler said he decided to go public after a senior Swiss
government official asked him about ``rumors'' of misconduct and
wondered whether Hodler had been bribed to keep quiet.
	   Until now, there has only been ``hearsay'' of bribery that would
not stand up as evidence in court, Hodler said. He said he had
heard complaints from previous unsuccessful Olympic bidders,
including Manchester, England, and Stockholm and Ostersund, Sweden.
	   But now there is written proof of corruption practices in the
case of the Salt Lake fund, Hodler said.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, appearing at the same news
conference with Hodler, said the current investigation centered
only on Salt Lake because it's the only case with documented
evidence.
	   ``If there is other proof, we will open other cases,'' he said.
	   Samaranch said he was confident the IOC would survive the
scandal and promised to act quickly against any corrupt members.
	   ``We have been through crises before in the Olympic movement,''
he said. ``Now we are going through another crisis. ... If there
are cases of corruption, we can't permit it in the Olympic
family.''
	   On Sunday, Samaranch said the scandal could help the IOC clean
up its act.
	   ``After the black day, the sun will come again,'' he said.
	   He said the allegations could be the catalyst for needed reform,
promising to kick out any crooked IOC members and consider changing
the way Olympic host cities are selected in order to remove the
risks of bribery.
	   ``If we have to clean (things up), we will,'' Samaranch said.
``If it is necessary, we will expel members. ... After, the IOC
will be even stronger than before.''
	   Samaranch, who has headed the IOC since 1980, compared the
current crisis to the political boycotts of the 1980s and Ben
Johnson's drug scandal at the 1988 Seoul Games.
	   ``They were difficult moments, and now we are facing another
difficult moment,'' he said. ``I am sure that we will solve this
problem.''
	   IOC vice president Dick Pound, who is heading a top-level
investigation into alleged misconduct, said the inquiry could
provide the impetus for the IOC to wipe out any corruption once and
for all.
	   ``I don't like this to be out there, but I'm glad it is because
it gives us the opportunity to deal with it _ to put a chapter that
appears to be somewhat disagreeable behind us,'' he said.

Iran, Thailand into semifinals; China, Kuwait also win

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Down to nine men in extra time against
South Korea, underdog Thailand pulled one of the biggest upsets of
the Asian Games Monday when Thawatchai Damrong-Ongtrakul took a
short pass from a free kick and fired 40 meters to win 2-1.
	   Iran cruised into the semifinals with an easy 4-0 victory over
Uzbekistan, with Bayern Munich star Ali Daei scoring three goals
within seven minutes in the second half.
	   China and Kuwait joined them in the semifinals. China easily
beat Turkmenistan 3-0 and Kuwait beat Qatar in a penalty shootout
3-1 after 150 minutes of scoreless play.
	   In the semifinals Wednesday, China meets Iran and Thailand takes
on Kuwait.
	   The capacity crowd at Rajamangala National Stadium erupted into
cheers and flag-waving when Thawatchai's low shot cleared the South
Korean defensive wall and blew past keeper Kim Byung-ji to
unexpectedly put the host nation into the semifinals.
	   Now South Korea and Japan, co-hosts of the 2002 World Cup and
both finalists in this year's World Cup, are both out of the Asian
Games tournament, although neither sent its top team to Bangkok.
	   The Thais played with grit and persistence in the largely
scoreless match, refusing to give up a goal even when top striker
Worrawoot Srimaka was sent off early in the second half for a
retaliatory elbow into the face of Korean defender Park Jin-sup.
	   When a goal finally came, it was Thai striker Kiatisuk
Senamuang, 10 minutes before the end of regulation time, collecting
a pass and shipping it in from seven meters.
	   Six minutes later, a second Thai defender was sent off for
bringing down Yoo Sang-chul at the top of the penalty area.
	   Yoo fired the free kick cleanly into the goal to make it 1-1.
	   Peter Withe, the British coach who put confidence into the Thai
side, told reporters later that after regulation time ended, he
told Thawatchai that if he had any chances on a free kick to take
them.
	   Thawatchai got his chance six minutes into sudden death extra
time and knocked the stunned Koreans out of the Asian Games.
	   ``I went on to the pitch when we were down to nine players and I
told them we could still win the game,'' Withe said. ``When it was
sudden death I told them, `Look at Korea, they're sitting down.' ''
	   Korean coach Huh Jung-moo said the Thais had fouled his players
every time they neared the goal mouth and that the referees
consistently failed to catch it.
	   Star striker Choi Yong-soo, who had seven goals going into the
match, was completely shut down.
	   Huh said that his side, heavily favored to finish with a medal,
had come to Bangkok mainly looking for experience to take to the
2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
	   Daei went on a scoring spree in the second half to power Iran
into the Asian games semifinals.
	   Iran went ahead 1-0 in the first half on Ali Reza
Mosavi-Hasanzadeh's goal in the 28th minute.
	   Then Iran turned up its game and dominated the second half.
	   Daei chipped in a shot just inside the penalty area to make it
2-0 in the 37th minute. Then he made a brilliant individual effort
for 3-0, scampering past two defenders to score from just outside
the penalty area in front of the goal.
	   Barely two minutes later, he added another. On a corner kick, he
was in front of the goal with one defender trying to mark him and
Karim Bagheri. The ball sailed over Bagheri's head and Daei headed
a bouncer that Uzbek goalie Pavel Bugaio got a hand on it but
couldn't stop from going into the net.
	   China had three goals in the second half, two by Li Jin Yu.
	   Li opened the scoring in the first minute of the second half.
Hao Haidong made it 2-0 eight minutes later and Li scored an
insurance goal three minutes before the end of regulation time
despite China being down to 10 men after a red card was given to
Hao.
	   In the final quarterfinal of the day, Kuwait and Qatar played a
lackluster game, scoreless in regulation and extra time.
	   In the penalty shootout, Moustapha Mubarek was the only one of
four Qatari takers to get the ball past Kuwait keeper Khalid
al-Fadhli. He opened up the shootout but then al-Fadhli stopped the
next three.
	   Three Kuwaitis scored past Qatar goalie Ahmed al-Dosari, who was
unbeatable during the game, stopping a high-powered Kuwait offense
that has been shut down for the last three matches although it is
now in the last four.

Algerian Prime Minister resigns, new government expected soon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia resigned
Monday after failing to resolve Algeria's political and economic
crisis during his three years in power.
	   President Liamine Zeroual immediately accepted Ouyahia's
resignation, which had been expected.
	   Senator Smail Hamdani is expected to form the new government,
but there had not yet been an official announcement of who would
succeed Ouyahia. The new government is expected to be a
non-partisan caretaker government whose main task would be to
prepare early presidential elections, set for April.
	   Ouyahia has been rumored as a potential candidate, but his
popularity is at a low point.
	   The struggling Algerian economy further foundered under Ouyahia.
Sinking oil prices sharply reduced the country's foreign currency
earnings, 95 percent of which come from the sale of oil and gas.
	   Ouyahia also was unable to quell an Islamic insurgency that
erupted in 1992 when the government canceled parliamentary
elections that the now banned Islamic Salvation Front was expected
to win.
	   At least 75,000 people have died in violence in the past six
years.
	   Hamdani, 68, who began his career in the diplomatic service, has
a reputation as a pragmatic politician. A former ambassador to
Paris, he has been one of the architects of Algeria's foreign
policy.

Clinton asserts right of Palestinians to 'their own land'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines previous, restores Arafat comment in 2nd graf, edits
throughout to tighten. PNC meeting at 1345 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ On the first visit of a U.S.
president to Palestinian territory, Bill Clinton told Palestinians
Monday they are now free to ``determine their own destiny on their
own land.''
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat declared that through Clinton
``peace will prevail in the Middle East.''
	   After a warm welcome from Arafat that included a giant American
flag draping the new Gaza airport's control tower, Clinton pledged
to help Palestinians create a society of tolerance, freedom and
prosperity.
	   He urged reconciliation with Israel as the only path to a
permanent peace.
	   ``For the first time in the history of the Palestinian movement,
the Palestinian people and their elected representatives now have a
chance to determine their own destiny on their own land,'' Clinton
said in an exchange of remarks with Arafat at a luncheon in his
honor at a Gaza City beach resort.
	   Clinton, who met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
in Jerusalem on Sunday, was in Gaza City to witness a landmark vote
by the Palestinian National Council to renounce passages of the
Palestinian Liberation Organization's charter that call for the
destruction of Israel.
	   The main dividend for Israel in Clinton's trip to Gaza was the
expected action by the PNC.
	   ``That will be a welcomed development,'' Netanyahu said Sunday.
	   In remarks preceding Clinton's, Arafat heaped praise on the
American president for helping pull together the Wye River
land-for-security agreement two months ago. And he thanked him for
inaugurating the new Gaza International Airport, which he called a
``window on the world'' for Palestinians.
	   ``You are also inaugurating another window for our people
towards freedom, peace and prosperity,'' Arafat said. ``This is a
window, a window for the peace of the brave, peace with our
neighbors.''
	   Clinton applauded Arafat for showing the ``strength, courage and
wisdom'' to make peace with Israel.
	   Despite Clinton's glowing words and hopeful tone, the accords
negotiated between Arafat and Netanyahu at Wye River have been
unraveling in recent weeks, and violence in the
Palestinian-controlled West Bank has been the worst in months.
	   `The way ahead may be hard and uncertain, but the way you left
behind is full of self-defeating violence and soul-withering
hate,'' Clinton said. ``So we have no choice but the way ahead.''
He said there is ``reason for hope,'' despite the frequent
obstacles to fashioning a permanent peace with the Jewish state.
	   Before their luncheon, Clinton and Arafat held talks at Arafat's
headquarters, appearing briefly before reporters and photographers
as they sat in overstuffed armchairs under a huge picture of
Jerusalem.
	   Clinton said of the Wye River accord, ``I'm committed to this
agreement. I'm hoping it will be implemented by both sides.
	   At the airport, in addition to the U.S. flag covering the entire
length of the control tower, smaller American and Palestinian
fluttered from lamp posts and buildings. Seemingly everywhere were
posters reading, ``We have a dream. Free Palestine.''
	   Banners strung along the airport access road read ``Welcome to
Palestine, Mr. Clinton'' and posters on walls in Gaza City
proclaimed: ``We have a dream. Free Palestine.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, accompanying
Clinton, called the trip to Gaza historic. ``It's a very important
sign of progress here in the peace process,'' she said. ``It's a
visible sign of what we accomplished in the Wye talks.''
	   For the nearly 3 million Palestinians who live on the West Bank
and in Gaza, the president's visit has symbolic significance,
beginning with his arrival by helicopter at their own international
airport at Rafah.
	   Arafat, other top officials of the Palestinian Authority and an
honor guard welcomed Clinton, while on the eastern edge of the
strip, U.S. Commerce Secretary William M. Daley was opening an
industrial zone.
	   Still, Clinton and his senior aides say their intention was not
to encourage Palestinian statehood aspirations, and the issue
remains to be considered in negotiations with Israel.
	   Clinton appealed to Palestinians Sunday in Jerusalem to prove
their peaceful intentions ``in word and deed.'' He also urged
Israel to acknowledge the ``legitimate expectations'' of their
longtime foes.
	   ``The violent past and the difficult present do not have to be
repeated forever,'' Clinton said,
	   In Jerusalem, Netanyahu assured Clinton that Israel was
``prepared to do our part,'' but he linked any further Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank to Arafat renouncing his plans to
declare statehood and taking steps to squelch violence.

	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ An overcrowded bus climbing a steep
mountain road in northern India fell into a deep gorge Monday,
killing 21 people and injuring 47 others, officials said.
	   The accident occurred when the driver of the bus tried to avoid
an approaching vehicle on a sharp bend and lost control. The bus
plunged 45 meters (144 feet) near Bageshwar town in Uttar Pradesh
state. The area, in the Himalayan mountains, is 300 kilometers (190
miles) northeast of the Indian capital New Delhi.
	   A total of 68 people were traveling in the bus, well over its
45-passenger official limit, officials said. Of the 47 injured, 21
were reported in serious condition.
	   The driver of the bus died in the accident, a state government
spokesman said.

China to put two democracy campaigners on trial Thursday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead and UPDATES with authorities to put another
dissident on trial Thursday; EDITS to conform throughout; no
pickup.
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Authorities gave the family of one of China's
most prominent dissidents three days notice Monday that he will be
put on trial for subversion, in the second prosecution of a leading
member of a planned opposition party.
	   Qin Yongmin's trial in Wuhan city will take place on Thursday,
the same day another principal organizer of the China Democracy
Party, Wang Youcai, will face the same charge 500 kilometers (300
miles) to the east in Hangzhou city.
	   The two cases are the most high-profile prosecutions of
dissidents in China in two years. Having arrested Qin and charged
Wang just two weeks ago, the speed of prosecution underscores the
ruling Communist Party's determination to crush challenges to its
monopoly on political power.
	   Both Qin and Wang are being tried for ``inciting the subversion
of state power'' _ one of the crimes under a state security statute
drafted to deal with political dissent.
	   Their impending trials also pointed to the likelihood that a
third leading member of the party, Xu Wenli, will also be
prosecuted soon. He too has been accused of endangering state
security, but his wife said she has had no word of his condition
since his arrest Nov. 30 at the start of the crackdown.
	   Foreign reporters will be barred from Wang Youcai's trial and
may not be allowed into Qin's either. Qin's father, Qin Qingguo,
said police gave him three passes for family members, but told him
no other relatives or friends would be allowed to attend the trial.
Wuhan court officials could not be reached for comment Monday
night.
	   Court officials in Hangzhou have not decided if any public
observers will be allowed to attend Wang's trial, said a Zhejiang
provincial government spokesman, who only gave his surname, Bao.
	   Qin and Wang span two generations of democracy campaigners and
have been among the most active members of China's heavily
persecuted dissident community in recent years.
	   Wang was a student leader of the democracy demonstrations in
Tiananmen Square in 1989. He announced the formation of the China
Democracy Party in June.
	   Qin, 44, edited an underground journal in the seminal Democracy
Wall movement in the late 1970s. He has spent about 10 years in
prison, but after his latest stint ended in 1995, Qin resumed his
activism. He has tried to set up a human rights monitoring group.
	   Qin's and Wang's families are struggling to put together defense
teams. One lawyer who planned to take Wang's case, Wang Wenjiang,
has been detained three times in the past two days and was believed
to be in custody on Monday, the Hong Kong-based Information Center
of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported Monday.
	   A lawyer contacted by Qin's family was thinking over a request
to mount a defense based on international law, including two U.N.
human rights treaties China has signed over the past 15 months,
Qin's father said.
	   At least 15 other dissidents have been detained in connection
with the latest crackdown, although many have been released.
	   A long-exiled dissident who sneaked into China to help boost the
democracy party's organization, Wang Ce, has also been charged with
endangering state security, the Hong Kong-based Information Center
reported Monday.
	   Wang Ce, who left China in 1984, earned a Ph.D. in Hawaii and
then settled in Spain, slipped into China via Macau in October.
Authorities in Hangzhou city detained him on Nov. 2 immediately
after he met with Wang Youcai, the Information Center said.
	   The charge against Wang Ce probably stems from his plans to give
dlrs 1,000 to Wang Youcai to buy a computer, the group said.
	   Despite the intensity of the crackdown, small but bold groups in
China have called on the government to release the democracy
advocates.
	   A friend of Wang Youcai in his hometown in Zhejiang province
gathered signatures from 180 farmers, private businessmen and
others appealing for his immediate release, but Xu Guang too was
detained later Monday, the Information Center reported.
	   Twenty-two exiled dissidents released a statement calling on
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and governments and human rights
groups to pressure China for the release of Xu, Qin, Wang Youcai
and Wang Ce.
	   The statement from the Washington-based Free China Movement said
the crackdown showed China was violating rights protected under two
key U.N. human rights treaties Beijing signed in the past 14
months.

Taiwan's Chou, Hong Kong's Hui win bowling masters titles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELAINE CHEW &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Taiwan's Chou Miao-lin beat Singapore's
Ho Yen-wah 382-336 in the two-game women's masters bowling showdown
Monday and collected her third gold medal of the Asian Games.
	   Hong Kong's Hui Cheung-kwok defeated Taiwan's Wu Fu-lung, the
singles champion, 459-386 in the men's masters final, denying Wu a
third gold.
	   China's Lu Hengchuan bowled a perfect game in the 16-game men's
semifinal round, but his 300 didn't get him into the medals. His
semifinal total, including bonuses for games won, was 3,441 _
behind the 3,577 for Wu, 3,478 and Hui and 3,476 for bronze
medalist Lin Han-chen of Taiwan.
	   In the medal playoff, Hui beat Lin 212-166, leaving Lin with the
bronze.
	   Receiving his gold, Hui raised his hands repeatedly on the
victory podium and even danced to the music.
	   Wu had earlier golds from singles and five-man team competition,
and a silver from the trios. Taiwan collected a total of six of the
10 golds in Asian Games bowling.
	   Chou reached the medal playoff with a 3,624 total from the
semifinals, ahead of 3,556 for Singapore's Ho and 3,464 for
teammate Huang Chiung-yao.
	   Huang ended with bronze after losing the first playoff 183-180
to Ho, the silver medalist.
	   Winner Chou had earlier golds from the women's teams and trios,
and a bronze from the doubles.
	   ``I hope that all these victories will help bowling's popularity
grown in my country,'' said Taiwan coach Chen Sui-Min.
	   The bowling tournament was far from most of the other Asian
Games venues, tucked away on the top floor of a Bangkok shopping
mall, but drew a small but loyal crowd of supporters.

Cambodia, economic issues loom for ASEAN leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout with Cambodia issue to be deliberated again
Tuesday, quote that bold measures are ``negligible''
 &UR; AP Photos ASEAN101-109
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Association of Southeast Asian Nations
leaders sat down to a pre-summit dinner Monday, apparently
determined to have a congenial meal before tackling a variety of
thorny issues, including how to revive their ailing economies.
	   Aides said the leaders had decided not to decide until their
formal talks start Tuesday whether to admit Cambodia now. It
appeared it would be impossible to achieve the necessary unanimous
consensus, but Cambodia's biggest backers weren't giving up.
	   ``It has to be deliberated tomorrow,'' said Ong Keng Yong, a
government spokesman from Singapore, one of the countries that say
Cambodia needs more time to fully establish the credibility of a
newly installed coalition government.
	   Asked why the leaders didn't just accept their foreign
ministers' agreement that no consensus was possible now, he said:
``That's the Singapore position. (But) Lots of countries want to
deliberate further.''
	   The leaders also are expected to endorse a package of four
documents, including a batch of ``bold measures'' that some
officials were admitting aren't really so bold.
	   ``They may be run-of-the-mill, may be completely negligible, but
it's important that we take a common approach,'' Ong said. ``We
don't want to leave Hanoi giving the impression that we don't know
where we want to go. We want to hold together.''
	   A draft of the measures includes tariff cuts, investor
incentives, duty-free status for capital equipment, relaxed rules
on foreign ownership of land on a ``best-effort'' basis, and
speeded-up implementation of an ASEAN Free Trade Area and ASEAN
Investment Area.
	   Some are to take effect almost immediately in an effort to shore
up investor confidence and show the world the region is willing to
take tough action instead of just talking about it.
	   ``I feel it will put us back on the investment map again,''
Philippine Trade Secretary Jose Pardo said. ``It will be too
difficult for investors in the West to refuse to take a hard look
at the opportunities that are here.''
	   But analysts said there was really little new. And some of the
measures would be put on a dual-track scenario that would allow
developing countries more time and leeway.
	   ``The measures may not be as bold as some expected,'' Thai
government spokesman Akatol Sorasuchart said. ``But they will
include liberalization, open markets, tariff cuts with deadlines
that will be met. It's a step forward.''
	   The Cambodia issue dominated pre-summit meetings by foreign and
economic ministers of the nine-member ASEAN.
	   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen began lobbying as soon as his
plane touched down Sunday for a two-day state visit. But it
appeared unlikely that his efforts would be successful.
	   Hun Sen, who had hoped admission would add further legitimacy to
his new coalition government, sounded almost resigned to being
relegated to observer status again, saying that if Cambodia is not
admitted this time, next year would be acceptable.
	   ``We can wait,'' he said. ``Late or soon, we must join.''
	   Cambodia had been scheduled to join ASEAN in July 1997, but
political turmoil led to its admission being put on hold.
	   The leaders arrived in quick succession Monday at Hanoi's Noibai
Airport, where an honor guard stood shivering on the tarmac on a
cool overcast day.
	   The state dinner, hosted by Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van
Khai, was to be followed by two days of formal talks and bilateral
meetings, along with discussions with three ``dialogue partners'' _
Japan, China and South Korea.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ With the simple tug of a tie, a
Dutch prince has touched off a revolution in the Netherlands.
	   In a speech opening a show of African fashion, Prince Claus
ceremoniously wriggled free of his Windsor knot, yanked off his
navy blue necktie and tossed it rather inelegantly at the feet of
his wife, Queen Beatrix.
	   ``A snake around my neck,'' the 73-year-old prince snarled to a
standing ovation.
	   Reporting the story that evening, one TV anchorman peeled off
his tie. In solidarity, so did the sportscaster who gave the soccer
scores. Now, a week later, Claus is a folk hero _ and an open
collar has never been more in vogue.
	   It's a guy thing, a phenomenon with a funny name:
``Claustrophilia.''
	   ``I also suffer from Claus's tie phobia, so I'm shouting for joy
at the prince's call for a ban on neckties,'' Wouter van Winden, a
businessman in the central city of Delft, told the daily De
Volkskrant for Monday's editions.
	   ``No piece of clothing combines so little function with so much
potential to show bad taste. I wear a tie only when etiquette
absolutely requires one,'' he fumed. ``For me, a necktie is like a
dog leash _ both symbolize a limit on freedom. Why else does Nelson
Mandela never wear one?''
	   Amen, says Claus, who proclaimed the South African president
``the best-dressed man I know'' at last Wednesday's fashion show at
the royal palace in Amsterdam.
	   That even a prince could find a tie a royal pain has resonated
across Holland, where neckwear remains de rigeur in business.
	   The necktie as nemesis has Internet chat rooms all abuzz over
Claus and his fashion statement, which the German-born prince
dubbed ``the Declaration of Amsterdam.''
	   ``I have never worn a necktie in my life,'' said Coen van den
Heuvel of Eindhoven. ``On my wedding day 17 years ago, my mother
ran out and bought a tie. It's still in the box.''
	   With the necktie a popular _ if dreaded _ Christmas gift for
millions of Dutch uncles and dads, all this contempt for cravates
has the fashion industry rushing to do some damage control.
	   A suit without a tie, a buyer for Amsterdam's tony Society Shop
sniffed, ``is like a car without hub caps.''
	   ``This isn't the end of the necktie,'' insisted Dutch fashion
designer Alexander van Slobbe. ``It's still a must for men. It's a
form of security.''

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Association of Southeast Asian Nations
leaders sat down to a pre-summit dinner Monday, apparently
determined to have a congenial meal before tackling a variety of
thorny issues, including how to revive their ailing economies.
	   Aides said the leaders had decided not to decide until their
formal talks start Tuesday whether to admit Cambodia now. It
appeared it would be impossible to achieve the necessary unanimous
consensus, but Cambodia's biggest backers weren't giving up.
	   ``It has to be deliberated tomorrow,'' said Ong Keng Yong, a
government spokesman from Singapore, one of the countries that say
Cambodia needs more time to fully establish the credibility of a
newly installed coalition government.
	   Asked why the leaders didn't just accept their foreign
ministers' agreement that no consensus was possible now, he said:
``That's the Singapore position. (But) Lots of countries want to
deliberate further.''
	   The leaders also are expected to endorse a package of four
documents, including a batch of ``bold measures'' that some
officials were admitting aren't really so bold.
	   ``They may be run-of-the-mill, may be completely negligible, but
it's important that we take a common approach,'' Ong said. ``We
don't want to leave Hanoi giving the impression that we don't know
where we want to go. We want to hold together.''
	   A draft of the measures includes tariff cuts, investor
incentives, duty-free status for capital equipment, relaxed rules
on foreign ownership of land on a ``best-effort'' basis, and
speeded-up implementation of an ASEAN Free Trade Area and ASEAN
Investment Area.
	   Some are to take effect almost immediately in an effort to shore
up investor confidence and show the world the region is willing to
take tough action instead of just talking about it.
	   ``I feel it will put us back on the investment map again,''
Philippine Trade Secretary Jose Pardo said. ``It will be too
difficult for investors in the West to refuse to take a hard look
at the opportunities that are here.''
	   But analysts said there was really little new. And some of the
measures would be put on a dual-track scenario that would allow
developing countries more time and leeway.
	   ``The measures may not be as bold as some expected,'' Thai
government spokesman Akatol Sorasuchart said. ``But they will
include liberalization, open markets, tariff cuts with deadlines
that will be met. It's a step forward.''
	   The Cambodia issue dominated pre-summit meetings by foreign and
economic ministers of the nine-member ASEAN.
	   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen began lobbying as soon as his
plane touched down Sunday for a two-day state visit. But it
appeared unlikely that his efforts would be successful.
	   Hun Sen, who had hoped admission would add further legitimacy to
his new coalition government, sounded almost resigned to being
relegated to observer status again, saying that if Cambodia is not

	   ``We can wait,'' he said. ``Late or soon, we must join.''
	   Cambodia had been scheduled to join ASEAN in July 1997, but
political turmoil led to its admission being put on hold.
	   The leaders arrived in quick succession Monday at Hanoi's Noibai

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea won three of four gold
medals decided in Greco-Roman wrestling competition at the Asian
Games on Monday.
	   Kim In-Sun started the medal romp by beating Uzbekistan's
Asliddin Hudyberdiev in the final. Hudyberdiev earned his place in
the final with a victory over China's Olympic bronze medal-winner
Sheng Zetian, who beat Iran's Sardar Pashaei for bronze.
	   Son Sang-Phil beat Mkkhitar Manukyan of Kazakstan in the gold
medal game of the 69-kilogram division. Grigori Pulyaev of
Uzbekistan took the bronze when opponent Jong Kon of North Korea
was injured.
	   Park Myung-Suk outclassed Raatbek Sanatbaev of Kyrgyzstan in the
85-kilogram class final. Japan's Hidekazu Yokoyama won bronze with
a close fought victory against Iran's Behrouz Jamshidi.
	   South Korea missed a medal in the 130-kilogram division, won by
Mehdi Sabzali of Iran, who beat Shermakhmad Quziyev of Uzbekistan
in a close match. Zhao Hailin won the bronze for China.

UConn stays No. 1, four newcomers in Top 25

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Connecticut survived two road scares last week
and extended its margin at the top of the AP college basketball
poll Monday.
	   The Huskies (8-0) were No. 1 for the third straight week after
beating Massachusetts 59-54 and then escaping from Pittsburgh with
a 70-69 victory. Combined with then-No. 2 Maryland's loss at
Kentucky, Connecticut's margin in first-place votes went from 53-17
over the Terrapins last week to 66-4 over Duke this week.
	   Kentucky jumped from fifth to third, while Cincinnati held
fourth and Maryland dropped to fifth in the voting of the national
media panel.
	   There were big changes at the bottom of the Top 25 with four
teams _ Auburn, Wisconsin, Oklahoma and Iowa _ making their season
debut in the rankings.
	   Connecticut had 1,768 points, 99 more than the Blue Devils
(9-1), who crushed Florida and Michigan this week by an average of
37 points.
	   Kentucky (9-1), the defending national champion, beat Maryland
(10-1) 103-91 in the much-awaited matchup at Rupp Arena. Cincinnati
(6-0), the team which handed Duke its only loss, had the only other
first-place vote.
	   Stanford and North Carolina stayed sixth and seventh. Arizona,
which was eighth, and Purdue, which was ninth, were tied for No. 8,
while Indiana moved up one place to No. 10.
	   New Mexico started the second 10 and was followed by UCLA,
Kansas, Michigan State, St. John's, Clemson, Minnesota, Oklahoma
State, Auburn and Arkansas.
	   The last five teams in the Top 25 were Syracuse, Pittsburgh,
Wisconsin, Oklahoma and Iowa.
	   Falling from the rankings were Temple, Tennessee, Washington and
Utah.
	   Auburn (9-0) moved in at No. 19, its first appearance in the Top
25 since a three-week run in 1995-96. The Tigers' biggest wins were
their last two, at Florida State and Alabama Birmingham.
	   The longest absence of the four newcomers belongs to Wisconsin
(9-1), which was last in the poll during Christmas week in 1994.
The Badgers have won seven straight since losing to New Mexico
State, and the biggest wins were on the road against Rhode Island
and Temple.
	   Oklahoma (5-1) followed its loss to Murray State with a 30-point
win over Arkansas and a 20-pointer over Nicholls State. The Sooners
were ranked for the first two polls of last season.
	   Iowa (7-1), playing its final season under Dr. Tom Davis, has
won five in a row since losing to Creighton. The last two wins in
the streak were over Kansas, snapping the Jayhawks' 62-game home
winning streak, and Iowa State. The Hawkeyes were ranked all last
season, getting as high as No. 10, until falling out in early
February.
	   The four teams that fell out this week were all in the top 14 in
the preseason poll.
	   Temple (4-4), which was No. 7 in the preseason poll, fell out
from No. 16 after losing its fourth straight game, 63-56 to
Wisconsin.
	   Tennessee (6-3), the preseason No. 9 which had already fallen
out of the poll once this season, was 21st when it lost 55-53 at
St. Joseph's.
	   Washington (4-3) had dropped from its preseason No. 14 spot and
fell out from 22nd after losing its third straight, 82-71 to
Gonzaga.
	   With its 73-69 loss to Texas on Saturday, Utah (5-4) matched its
loss total from last season when it went 30-4 and reached the NCAA
championship game. The Utes were 10th in the preseason poll and are
out of the Top 25 for the first time since late February 1995.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Four of Canada's biggest banks suffered a
stinging defeat Monday when the finance minister rejected merger
proposals that would have created two mega-banks controlling 70
percent of the nation's banking assets.
	   The mergers would have joined Royal Bank of Canada, the
country's largest bank, with third-ranked Bank of Montreal, and
second-ranked Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce with No. 5
Toronto-Dominion Bank.
	   The two merged banks would have controlled banking assets of
roughly 960 billion Canadian dlrs (dlrs 623 billion U.S.) _ 70
percent of the national total.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South African Breweries, the
world's sixth-largest beer maker, said Monday it expects to move
its primary liston to the London Stock Exchange on March 8.
	   SAB said in a statement that it will mail a circular to its
shareholders Monday asking for approval of the shift of its primary
listing to London, where the company is expected to qualify for the
FTSE-100 index of top market capitalizations.
	   Earlier this month, SAB said after three months of deliberation
it would move its domicile to London to improve its capital raising
prospects and to generate a larger international shareholder base.
It will continue to list in Johannesburg.
	   The brewer has a growing beer-making asset base in Africa,
eastern Europe and China.
	   Its decision to move to London follows similar announcements by
South African mining and investment conglomerate Anglo American
Corp. - which is also to list on the LSE in March - and Billiton
PLC, a base metals group, which relocated to London in 1997.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Zanzibar has asked China for help in
combating drug abuse stemming from the islands' increasing
importance as a drug transit point, the weekly East African said
Monday.
	   The independent newspaper said when Deputy Chief Minister
Abdulghani Msoma returned from China last week, he said a team of
Chinese experts would arrive in January to set up a drug
rehabilitation center outside Zanzibar town.
	   The Indian Ocean archipelago of Zanzibar, made up of Unguja,
Pemba and Mafia islands, is a semi-autonomous region within
Tanzania.
	   Police say Zanzibar's small airport has become a major transit
point for Southeast Asian heroin via India to South Africa and
Europe and that a growing number of local youths are now consuming
heroin.

	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Committees formed to determine how to
end five years of violence in Burundi began week-long meetings
Monday in a lead-up to the fourth round of peace talks for the tiny
Central African nation.
	   Former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, the mediator of the
talks, told participants that the talks were at a crucial stage and
``everybody expects a tangible outcome.''
	   During the last round of talks in October in this northern
Tanzanian town, representatives of 18 parties, movements and armed
factions discussed issues of democracy and good governance as well
as peace and security.
	   The next round of full-scale talks is scheduled to begin Jan.
18.
	   The current cycle of violence in Burundi broke out in October
1993 when Tutsi paratroopers killed the country's first
democratically elected president _ Hutu Melchior Ndadaye _ in a
failed coup attempt.
	   Since then at least 200,000 people have been killed, most of
them civilians caught in crossfire between the Tutsi-dominated army
and Hutu rebels.
	   Hutus account for 65 percent of Burundi's population of 6.2
million. Tutsis make up 14 percent.
	   --
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ National police chief George
Fivaz on Monday signed a United Nations-sponsored agreement to
train South African police officers in fighting the drug trade.
	   Fivaz signed the 2 million rand (dlrs 330,00) accord at a
ceremony in Cape Town with Frank Albert of the United Nations
International Drug Control Program.
	   Italy is providing the cash for the plan, which will provide up
to six months training for an initial batch of 300 police officers.
Customs staff will be included later.
	   Albert said the U.N. program had opened an office in South
Africa last year and that combating the flow of illegal drugs
needed international cooperation.
	   ``No police service in the world has the capacity to deal with
these things on its own,'' he said.
	   --
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ De Beers Consolidated Mines,
the South African-based international diamond group, on Monday
reported a 28 percent slump in its rough diamond sales to dlrs 3.35
billion for 1998.
	   The sales figures were the lowest for De Beers since 1987, when
proceeds totaled dlrs 3.08 billion.
	   Sales in the second-half of 1998 fell 6.5 percent to dlrs 1.65
billion compared with dlrs 1.76 billion in the corresponding period
a year ago.
	   ``Expectations that second half sales would be higher than first
half sales failed to materialize as a result of the global economic
uncertainties in August and September and increasing problems of
liquidity in the cutting centers,'' De Beers said.
	   The diamond cartel blamed weak demand in Japanese and East Asian
markets, which have traditionally contributed more than 40 percent
of De Beers' retail sales.

Palestinians demonstrate against Clinton visit, charter change

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Palestinian refugees trampled on the
American flag and burning effigies of Bill Clinton to protest U.S.
president's visit to Gaza Monday.
	   In contrast to the warm welcome Clinton received in the
Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip, the mood was militant among
Palestinians of the Diaspora in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.
	   They are the refugees who have not seen the fruit of any of the
peace deals signed between Israel and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat since negotiations began in 1993.
	   ``Clinton get out, Palestine will remain free,'' demonstrators
shouted as they marched through the Palestinian refugee camp of
Yarmouk, eight kilometers (five miles) south of the Syrian capital
of Damascus.
	   Many of the 1,500 demonstrators carried banners denouncing
Arafat's peace deals with Israel and his plan to revoke clauses
from the Palestine National Charter that calls for Israel's
destruction. Clinton is to attend the PNC meeting Monday during
which delegates plan to amend the charter.
	   ``They came to scrap Palestine from history after they scrapped
it from geography,'' said Ramadan Abdullah Shallah, leader of
Islamic Jihad, a radical Palestinian group which has staged attacks
against Israelis in attempts to thwart the U.S.-sponsored peace
process.
	   ``It is a sad day. They want Palestinians outside the self-rule
areas not to have a say in anything. But ours is the voice of
justice, it is stronger than all voices,'' said Nour Hamed, a
19-year-old student demonstrator at Yarmouk.
	   Hamed's words echoed the anger and bitterness among the hundreds
of thousands of Diaspora Palestinians who are scattered in refugee
camps _ in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan _ and have little hope of ever
returning home under the current peace accords.
	   In Lebanon, refugees at the Shatilla camp in Beirut kicked and
burned effigies of Clinton, Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, then trampled on it in a frenzy.
	   In Ein El-Hilweh, Lebanon's largest Palestinian camp and home to
60,000 refugees, demonstrators set tires afire at the entrance to
the camp on the edge of the southern city of Sidon. About 40
guerrillas carrying AK-47 assault rifles trampled on the U.S. and
Israeli flags as they marched in camouflage fatigues.
	   In Jordan's largest refugee camp at Baqaa northwest of the
capital Amman, about 400 mostly school children marched through the
squalid streets of the camp, home to 120,000 refugees.

China hit by fever, flu at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Li Xuemei, Asia's fastest woman, is one
of about a dozen athletes hit by a fever and flu that seems to be
making the rounds in China's camp at the Asian Games.
	   Li said Monday after winning the 100 meters in a wind-assisted
11.05 seconds that she had spent the night awake, suffering from
diarrhea and a 39 Centigrade (102 F) fever. Sports officials said
11 Chinese were stricken with flu and fever Sunday.
	   ``It was very hard to run,'' said Li, the Asian record holder.
``Usually when you get a fever you should be at home resting.''
	   He Huixian, a spokeswoman for China's delegation, said their
athletes might be getting sick because they're not used to
Thailand's balmy weather or because of air conditioning.
	   China's Li Yali, the 100 silver medalist, said strong breezes
that have blown over Bangkok in recent days might be to blame.
	   ``When you sweat, the wind dries you off immediately and it is
easy to get sick,'' she said. ``We're not used to it.''

	   Finance Minister Paul Martin said the proposed mergers would
give the two new banks ``unacceptable'' powers that would not be in
the public interest.
	   He said Canada needed time to create a new financial services
framework that would accommodate restructuring and possible mergers
in the future.
	   The banks never managed to win substantial public support after
Royal Bank and Bank of Montreal unveiled their merger plan last
January, followed by CIBC and Toronto-Dominion in April.
	   Polls indicated a large majority of Canadians were opposed to
mergers and thought bank executives, not customers, stood to gain
the most from such deals.
	   The banks said the mergers were necessary to beef up to fight
foreign competition, make the huge technology investments needed to
compete and expand in the future.
	   Opponents, including the country's biggest association of small
businesses, worried the mergers would lead to job cuts, reduced
banking services in small communities, and an overall reduction of
services.
	   The merger plans also were undercut by Canada's No. 4 bank, the
Bank of Nova Scotia, the only one of the so-called Big Five not
part of the plans. It argued that the mergers would ``create a
level of concentration that wouldn't be tolerated anywhere else in
the world.''

Spanish premier wraps up official visit

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar supported Czech efforts to join the European Union, wrapping
up his two-day official visit here Monday, CTK news agency
reported.
	   On Monday, Aznar met with Premier Milos Zeman as well as
Parliament speaker and opposition leader Vaclav Klaus, but his
meeting with president Vaclav Havel was canceled due to Havel's
illness.
	   ``There is enough space for us all to work together,''Aznar said
about the propects of EU expansion after his meeing with Zeman.
	   According to the CTK report, both leaders also agreed on a need
to boost economic cooperation including such vast markets as Latin
America.
	   ``Premier Aznar also said that Czech Republic should speed up
its preparations for EU expansion,'' Klaus said after meeting with
Aznar.
	   The Czech economy is in relatively good shape, but the country
has been criticized for lack of legislative reform making Czech
laws compatible with the EU.

	   RIEHEN, Switzerland (AP) _ More or less unscathed after four
weeks under gray polyester, the first of 178 trees wrapped by the
husband-and-wife artist team Christo and Jeanne-Claude emerged from
their covers at a Swiss museum park Monday.
	   The artists, who grabbed the global imagination by wrapping
cloth around Berlin's Reichstag building in a 1995 artistic
statement, originally planned to keep the trees wrapped through
January but decided to unveil them early for unspecified
``aesthetic'' reasons.
	   The unwrapping operation, supervised by the couple's field
manager and open to the public, was expected to last a week.
	   Local officials said the trees had suffered only minimal damage
under their woven polyester fabric covering.
	   The exhibit attracted some 300,000 visitors since it opened last
month, transforming this quiet suburb of the city of Basel. Some
65,000 people visited the exhibit on its final weekend, after the
artists announced it was being dismantled ahead of schedule.
	   ``With all our previous temporary works of art, the 14-day
duration of the project's exhibition had been an aesthetic
choice,'' they said.
	   Christo and Jeanne-Claude devised the concept after studying
gardeners who draped fabric on trees against winter snow and frost
in Japan, but the artists were rejected in previous attempts to
wrap trees.
	   The Saint Louis Museum of Art in Missouri and the Museum of
Modern Art in New York turned them down in the 1960s. Paris nixed a
1969 bid to wrap the 330 trees along the Champs Elysees.
	   The artists, both born June 13, 1935, have worked as an
inseparable team for 40 years. He came from a family of wealthy
Bulgarian industrialists, and Jeanne-Claude was born into a French
military family. Both are now U.S. citizens.

	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ An experienced parachutist dressed as
Santa Claus broke both his legs after crashing to the ground in
front of 40,000 soccer fans.
	   Flight Sergeant Nigel Rogoff was listed in serious but stable
condition Monday after falling 40 yards (36 meters) during a
half-time show at Sunday's match between Aston Villa and Arsenal in
Birmingham.
	   Rogoff, 39, a veteran of more than 6,000 parachute jumps, also
suffered a fractured pelvis and broken ribs.
	   The West Midlands police said the accident occurred when the
parachutist caught the parapet of the soccer stand as he attempted
to land.
	   ``He banged on the stand and then fell to the ground,'' said
witness Peter Hargraves, who attended the soccer match. ``No one
could belive it.''
	   Paramedics immediately rushed onto the field, and the second
half of the game was delayed by 15 minutes.
	   Rogoff is a member of the Royal Air Force Sport Parachute
Association.

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS yen amount of flood-relief grant to 12.9 billion sted
million

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi met with
Tanzanian President Benjamin William Mkapa Monday and agreed to
provide the African nation with 2.3 billion yen (dlrs 19.8 million)
in aid.
	   After the meeting, the aid agreement was signed between Foreign
Minister Masahiko Komura and Zakia Meghji, Tanzanian minister of
Natural Resources and Tourism.
	   The grant consisted of 1.5 billion yen (dlrs 12.9 million) for
flood relief and to aid refugees and 800 million yen (dlrs 6.9
million) to increase food production, the official said.
	   In the meeting, Mkapa asked for Japan's help in developing
Tanzania's tourism industry and in building bridges and water works
in southern Tanzania, the official said.
	   Mkapa also asked Japan to increase its investment in Tanzania,
the official said.
	   The official quoted Obuchi as saying the Japan International
Cooperation agency will help develop Tanzania tourism. Obuchi said
he hopes the African nation will join a seminar by the agency on
tourism next year in Japan.
	   Japan will study how it can help develop southern Tanzania, the
official quoted Obuchi as saying to Mkapa.
	   Mkapa will attend investment seminars Tuesday in Tokyo and on
Wednesday in Osaka before leaving Thursday for a visit to South
Korea.
	   Earlier, Mkapa and his wife Anna met with Japanese Emperor
Akihito and Empress Michiko at the Imperial Palace.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The second-ranking official at the
French embassy in Belgrade and two other embassy employees were
killed Monday in a car accident in Kosovo, a French official said.
	   Gerard Fauveau, the embassy's first counselor, was among those
killed when the black Renault he was riding in collided with a
passenger bus in Besinje, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of
the capital Pristina.
	   Police at the scene said there were no injuries among those on
the bus, which was tipped on its side in a ditch. The cause of the
crash was not immediately clear.
	   Reporters at the scene witnessed the three bodies and a French
official confirmed the deaths.
	   The names of the other victims were not immediately available.
	   The car was apparently en route to Pristina from Belgrade.
	   The French Embassy declined immediate comment.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The second-ranking official at the
French embassy in Belgrade and two other embassy employees were
killed Monday in a car accident in Kosovo, a French official said.
	   Gerard Fauveau, the embassy's first counselor, was among those
killed when the black Renault he was riding in collided with a
passenger bus in Besinje, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of
the capital Pristina.
	   Police at the scene said there were no injuries among those on
the bus, which was tipped on its side in a ditch. The cause of the
crash was not immediately clear.
	   Reporters at the scene witnessed the three bodies and a French
official confirmed the deaths.
	   The names of the other victims were not immediately available.
	   The car was apparently en route to Pristina from Belgrade.
	   The French Embassy declined immediate comment.

Palestinians demonstrate against Clinton visit, charter change

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Palestinian refugees trampled on the
American flag and burning effigies of Bill Clinton to protest U.S.
president's visit to Gaza on Monday.
	   In contrast to the warm welcome Clinton received in the
Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip, the mood was militant among
Palestinians of the Diaspora in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.
	   They are the refugees who have not seen the fruit of any of the
peace deals signed between Israel and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat since negotiations began in 1993.
	   ``Clinton get out, Palestine will remain free,'' demonstrators
shouted as they marched through the Palestinian refugee camp of
Yarmouk, eight kilometers (five miles) south of the Syrian capital
of Damascus.
	   Many of the 1,500 demonstrators carried banners denouncing
Arafat's peace deals with Israel and his plan to revoke clauses
from the Palestine National Charter that call for Israel's
destruction. Clinton is to attend the PNC meeting Monday during
which delegates plan to amend the charter.
	   ``They came to scrap Palestine from history after they scrapped
it from geography,'' said Ramadan Abdullah Shallah, leader of
Islamic Jihad, a radical Palestinian group which has staged attacks
against Israelis in attempts to thwart the U.S.-sponsored peace
process.
	   ``It is a sad day. They want Palestinians outside the self-rule
areas not to have a say in anything. But ours is the voice of
justice, it is stronger than all voices,'' said Nour Hamed, a
19-year-old student demonstrator at Yarmouk.
	   Hamed's words echoed the anger and bitterness among the hundreds
of thousands of Diaspora Palestinians who are scattered in refugee
camps _ in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan _ and have little hope of ever
returning home under the current peace accords.
	   In Lebanon, refugees at the Shatilla camp in Beirut kicked and
burned effigies of Clinton, Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, then trampled on it in a frenzy.
	   In Ein El-Hilweh, Lebanon's largest Palestinian camp and home to
60,000 refugees, demonstrators set tires afire at the entrance to
the camp on the edge of the southern city of Sidon. About 40
guerrillas carrying AK-47 assault rifles trampled on the U.S. and
Israeli flags as they marched in camouflage fatigues.
	   In Jordan's largest refugee camp at Baqaa northwest of the
capital Amman, about 400 mostly school children marched through the
squalid streets of the camp, home to 120,000 refugees.

Portugal's Macau governor blames local gangs for prison guard
</HEADLINE>
slaying

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The governor of the Portuguese enclave
of Macau said Monday he believed that local gangs were behind the
slaying of a Portuguese prison guard in the Southeast Asian
territory.
	   ``We are led to believe that it was retaliation, a means of
intimidation,'' after the recent arrests of alleged gangland bosses
in Macau, Vasco Rocha Vieira told reporters during a visit to
Lisbon.
	   An unknown gunman shot and killed the prison guard and injured
another in Macau on Sunday, in what apparently was the fifth
slaying of a government worker by gang members this year.
	   The two victims belonged to a prison guard team that Portugal
sent to the territory three months ago following a surge of attacks
by gangs, or triads.
	   Rocha Vieira was in the Portuguese capital for a Council of
State meeting, where the governor was to speak about the status of
the negotiations with China over Macau's administrative handover to
Beijing.
	   The popular gambling and tourist spot of 450,000 people 64
kilometers (40 miles) west of Hong Kong is to revert to Chinese
rule in December 1999.

Tiny Scottish island loses young men boat accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FIONNPHORT, Mull (AP) _ The people of Iona, a tiny, windswept
Hebridean island with fewer than 100 residents, searched their
shores Monday in diminishing hope of finding survivors of a weekend
boat accident that claimed the life of one young man and left three
others missing.
	   ``It's been a desperate tragedy for the families and really a
shattering blow for the island as a whole,'' said Ray Michie, the
island's member of Parliament.
	   The lone body was found Sunday, hours after a dinghy carrying
five men from a dance on the neighboring island of Mull went down
in rough water.
	   Gordon Grant, 33, swam ashore and was reported in stable
condition in a hospital at Oban, on the northwest coast of mainland
Scotland.
	   Robert Hay, 23, was found dead on the shore, but by midday
Monday no trace had been found of Logie MacFadyen, 24, Alisdair
Dougal, 19, and David Kirkpatrick, 23.
	   ``They are really looking to retrieve the bodies for the
families,'' said Rose Ann Bowes, watch officer at the Scottish
coast guard.
	   Apart from ``the immediate heartbreak,'' Mrs. Michie said,
``Iona has a small community of less than 100 and to have lost four
of their fine young men who chose to live and work on the island,
it is a huge blow. But islanders are resilient folk and I know they
will recover over time.''
	   Linda Kirkwood, head teacher at Oban High School, which all five
men had attended, said, ``We are very concerned for the community
and we realize the devastation that's befallen them.
	   ``Usually, island communities lose their young people who go off
to the cities, but these lads decided to stay and live and work on
the island so this is a terrible blow for Iona,'' she said.
	   ``Only one of our pupils from Iona has come to school today. The
rest have elected to stay at home with their families. Like them,
we in the school are all really quite devastated by this,'' she
said.
	   Just 3 miles (5 km) long and 1.5 miles (2.5 km) wide, Iona lies
about a half-mile ( less than 1 km) west of Mull, which in turn is
8 miles (13 km) west of the mainland.
	   For all its tiny size, Iona has a large place in history as the
birthplace of Christianity in Scotland and reputed burial place of
the first Scottish kings.
	   Irish missionary St. Columba landed on the island in the 6th
century and established an abbey from which missionaries were sent
far and wide.

Report: Obuchi to unveil aid package at ASEAN summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi will announce
a 600 billion yen (dlrs 5.20 billion) loan package for struggling
Asian economies this week at the summit of the Association of
Southeast Asian States, a news report said Monday.
	   Obuchi is scheduled to leave for the ASEAN gathering in the
Vietnamese capital of Hanoi on Tuesday.
	   After delivering a speech on Japan's relations with ASEAN on
Wednesday, Obuchi will unveil the plan to extend the low-interest
loans over a three-year period, Kyodo News reported.
	   Japan had initially intended to provide one trillion yen (dlrs
8.65 billion) to cash-strapped Asian countries over five years, but
the government decided to limit its aid promises at the summit to a
three-year framework, Kyodo said.
	   Foreign Ministry officials declined to comment on the report,
saying that details of the aid initiative were still being worked
out.
	   In addition to ASEAN officials, Obuchi was also scheduled to to
meet with leaders from China, South Korea, and Cambodia during his
four-day trip. He will hold talks with Vietnam's Prime Minister
Phan Van Khai.
	   Obuchi will travel to Ho Chi Minh City on Thursday, where he
will visit a hospital built using Japanese aid, before returning to
Japan on Friday.

Ukraine's striking teachers keep 17,000 children out of school
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ More than 17,000 children in Ukraine have
not gone to school for a month due to strikes at 28 schools
throughout the country, the Education Ministry said Monday.
	   More than 1,000 teachers in two Ukrainian regions have been on
strike since early November demanding payment of back wages, the
ministry said.
	   Scattered strikes involving thousands of the country's 500,000
teachers began at the start of the school year in September.
	   But wage debts have increased since then, reaching 422 million
hryvna (dlrs 123 million) as of last week, the ministry said.
	   Education officials said the wage debt could further increase
after the New Year because extra money would have to be allocated
to provide heating for schools in many rural areas.
	   Ukraine's government has chronic problems in collecting taxes,
which leaves it without money to pay huge debts.

Canada's finance minister rejects two proposed bank mergers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series; adds quotes, background. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Four of Canada's biggest banks suffered a
stinging defeat Monday when the finance minister rejected merger
proposals that would have created two mega-banks controlling 70
percent of the nation's banking assets.
	   The mergers would have joined Royal Bank of Canada, the
country's largest bank, with third-ranked Bank of Montreal, and
second-ranked Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce with No. 5
Toronto-Dominion Bank.
	   Finance Minister Paul Martin said the banks' proposals ``are not
in the best interests of Canadians.''
	   ``The mergers would lead to an unacceptable concentration of
economic power in the hands of fewer, very large banks,'' he said.
``They would result in a a significant reduction of competition.''
	   The two merged banks would have controlled about 70 percent
Canada's banking assets _ roughly 960 billion Canadian dollars
(dlrs 623 billion U.S.).
	   Martin said Canada needed at least a year, possibly longer, to
create a new financial services framework that would accommodate
restructuring and possible mergers in the future.
	   ``Our immediate priority must now be to focus on establishing an
appropriate policy framework for the financial sector for the 21st
century,'' he said.
	   ``Whereas the merger proponents wanted the mergers to be allowed
in order to change the status quo, we believe the status quo must
be changed before any merger can be considered.''
	   Even when the new policy framework is in place, he said, new
merger proposals will have to demonstrate that they don't
excessively concentrate economic power or reduce competition.
	   The banks never managed to win substantial public support after
Royal Bank and Bank of Montreal unveiled their merger plan last
January, followed by CIBC and Toronto-Dominion in April.
	   Polls indicated a large majority of Canadians were opposed to
mergers and thought bank executives, not customers, stood to gain
the most from such deals.
	   The banks said mergers were necessary to beef up to fight
foreign competition, make the huge technology investments needed to
compete and expand in the future.
	   Opponents, including the country's biggest association of small
businesses, worried the mergers would lead to job cuts, reduced
banking services in small communities and an overall reduction of
services.
	   The merger plans also were undercut by Canada's No. 4 bank, the
Bank of Nova Scotia, the only one of the so-called Big Five not
part of the plans. It argued that the mergers would ``create a
level of concentration that wouldn't be tolerated anywhere else in
the world.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is seeking foreign investment in its
factories and other parts of its `real economy' as a way to emerge
from its financial turmoil, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Monday.
	   At a conference that included visiting executives from many
large Western firms, Primakov urged them to invest in Russia
despite its sharp economic downturn in recent months.
	   ``There will be no isolation from the rest of the world,''
Primakov told the Consultative Council on Foreign Investments.
``Russia is interested in investments. The Cabinet will do its best
to improve the investment climate.
	   However, Russian leaders have complained that many foreign
investors have focused on liquid investments, such as stocks, that
quickly evaporated after the country's economic crisis hit in
August.
	   Primakov said his government would like to see foreign money
directed more toward major industries that are ailing.
	   ``We are seeking the development of the real economy,'' Primakov
said.
	   Many investors see Soviet-era industrial firms as too
inefficient and outdated to merit the large-scale investments that
would be required.
	   Also, Russian law has often frustrated foreign investors, such
as oil companies, which have established major projects only to see
them founder due to repeated bureaucratic delays.
	   ``Many production facilities are now idle in our country,'' said
First Vice Premier Yuri Maslyukov. ``We must give the green light
to large strategic investors into the economy of Russia.''
	   Russia's financial markets collapsed in August, part of the
larger meltdown that hit emerging markets worldwide. The Russian
economy is expected to contract about 5 percent this year, and to
shrink next year as well.
	   Russia's economic collapse in the 1990s is one of the worst
depressions ever suffered by an industrialized nation.

French Finance Minister says Aerospatiale could be sold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn on
Monday said the government was prepared to sell its entire holding
in Aerospatiale to help create a pan-European aerospace company.
	   Strauss-Kahn told an industry conference at the French Foreign
Ministry in Paris that ``the state my pull out either partially or
totally'' from Aerospatiale's capital.
	   France's slow pace in privatizing Aerospatiale is believed to be
one of the main motives behind accelerating movement to merge
British Aerospace PLC and DaimlerChrysler Aerospace.
	   British Aerospace and Daimler Chrysler have made it clear they
don't want to merge with Aerospatiale unless it is a completely
private company.
	   The expected merger would be the first step in creating a
unified European defense and aerospace industry, and Aerospatiale's
failure to reduce its government stake has held up the process.
	   The French government has said it would privatize Aerospatiale
by merging it with Matra Hautes Technologies, but would still
retain a stake.
	   That's not enough for British Aerospace and DaimlerChrysler, who
are already in the advanced stage of merger talks.
	   Aerospatiale, British Aerospace, DaimlerChrysler and Spain's
Construcciones Aeronauticas make up the European aviation
consortium, Airbus Industrie.
	   Aerospatiale's reluctance to go private has held up Airbus
Industrie's efforts to become a company in its own right.

Ukraine ponders restructuring of its 1999 foreign debt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with central bank chief predicting no currency
devaluation, more Mitiukov comments in new grafs 8-12, ADDS
byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Unless it receives more international aid,
Ukraine might have to ask foreign lenders if it can delay next
year's debt payments, the finance minister was quoted as saying
Monday.
	   The government is already working out proposals for
restructuring its 1999 foreign debt obligations, but still hopes
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank will resume
their aid to Ukraine, Ihor Mitiukov told the independent Ukrainian
News agency.
	   The IMF postponed the latest disbursement of a dlrs 2.2 billion
loan to Ukraine last month over the government's poor tax
collection and sluggish reforms. It said it would resume aid only
when Ukraine approves a realistic 1999 budget and introduces more
reforms.
	   The delay also halted further disbursement of the World Bank's
dlrs 950 million aid package, which depends on the IMF's positive
assessment of Ukraine's reform policies.
	   Mitiukov said the failure to receive foreign aid in 1999 would
mean further destabilization of Ukraine's declining economy and
devaluation of the national currency, the hryvna.
	   ``We would have to impose additional controls on the currency
market to raise the hard currency, and that could lead to a
significant devaluation of the hryvna,'' Mitiukov told Ukrainian
News.
	   Ukraine badly needs foreign loans to replenish its hard currency
reserves, now at around dlrs 1 billion, because its debt
obligations in 1999 far exceed that amount.
	   Meanwhile, Central Bank chief Viktor Yushchenko said Monday that
his agency was capable of keeping the hryvna stable until the end
of the year. But after that, the currency's stability would depend
on the government's ability to push a budget with a small deficit.
	   The currency was devalued sharply following the economic crisis
in neighboring Russia this summer, and has remained stable at 3.4
to the U.S. dollar in recent weeks.
	   Mitiukov, the finance minister, said the government would insist
that parliament approve the 1999 budget with the deficit of no more
than 1 percent of gross domestic product, when lawmakers debate the
document next week.
	   Deputies have already approved an initial version of the 1999
budget with zero deficit, but the Cabinet wants to increase the
deficit to allow more spending on its huge debts, Mitiukov said.
	   Ukraine's economy has been steadily declining since the country
gained independence in 1991. Government officials have acknowledged
that Ukraine cannot count on foreign assistance in 1999 because
foreign investors have largely fled the region following Russia's
crisis, which struck in August.

Seven killed in dispute over land in northern India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PATNA, India (AP) _ Relatives of a farm owner in northern India
mutilated and killed six tribespeople who lived on the farm after
members of the tribe killed the owner in a land dispute, police
said Monday.
	   The violence Sunday at Kamalpurkaani in Bihar state began when
the Santhal tribespeople used bows and arrows to kill landlord
Mohammad Firoz after he tried to force them off his fields, where
they have squatted illegally in huts from more than 15 years,
police said.
	   Hours later, relatives of Firoz set fire to the 59 huts of the
Santhals. The attackers then used machetes to chop off the arms and
legs of the victims, including three children less than five years
of age, before shooting them, police said.
	   Police were searching for the landlord's relatives, all of whom
fled after the massacre.
	   Tribespeople in the region often claim squatters rights, saying
many of the land owners duped poor people to acquire vast
properties. The region has been the site of frequent clashes
between land owners and farm hands.

Tudjman critic's play canceled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ In another setback to Slobodan Snajder, a
playwrite who is also an outspoken critic of President Franjo
Tudjman, the Rijeka theater decided not to stage his play, media
reported Monday.
	   The acting manager of the theater, Bojan Sober, said Snajder's
``Bride of the Wind,'' that recently was performed with success in
Germany, would be too expensive for the cash-limited theater.
	   Earlier this month, the Minister of Culture, a member of
Tudjman's party, rejected Snajder's candidacy for the Rijeka
theater manager, saying his program did not satisfy the needs of
one of the four national theaters.
	   But Tudjman's critics, who regularly accuse him of controlling
all walks of life in Croatia, charged that politics played a
crucial role.
	   ``The money was just an alibi for not playing Snajder,'' Nina
Violic, a young actress who was to play the main role, told
Jutarnji List newspaper.
	   Snajder, who has worked in Austria and Germany in recent years,
often criticizes Tudjman's government as nationalistic and
conservative in his commentaries published in the independent daily
Novi List.
	   He also spoke against Pope John Paul II's beatification of the
controversial World War II Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac.
	   Croats were delighted with the pontiff's move and state-run
media treated it as one of the biggest events in recent history of
Croatia. But Snajder said Stepinac's wartime collaboration with
Nazis should not have been ignored.
	   While his plays thrilled some European countries' audiences in
the last few years, they have not been performed in Croatia.

Two moderate quakes cause panic in central Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAYSERI, Turkey (AP) _ Two successive moderate earthquakes shook
this central Turkish city Monday, causing cracks in buildings and
panic among residents.
	   But no injuries or serious damage were reported.
	   The first quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 4.4, struck the
nearby town of Bunyan at 1244 GMT, the Kandilli observatory in
Istanbul said. The second, measuring 4.5, hit 16 minutes later.
	   The Anatolia news agency said the walls of some old buildings in
Bunyan cracked.
	   A magnitude-4 quake can cause moderate damage in populated
areas.
	   Turkey's Aegean and Mediterranean coastal areas and the entire
eastern region sit atop the Anatolian fault.
	   In June, a southern town was leveled by a 6.3-magnitude quake,
killing 144 people.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Sri Lankan swim team manager Rizvi
Fulile Zain died of heart failure at the Asian Games Monday, the
organizing committee said.
	   Fulile Zain, who the committee said was in his early 50s, went
shopping Monday, the day after the swim meet ended, and experienced
chest pains. He saw a doctor at the athletes' village and was
transferred to Thammasat Hospital, where he died.
	   Maj. Gen. Charouck Arirachakaran, secretary-general of the
organizing committee, extended his sympathy to the Sri Lankan team.
	   ``I am very sorry to hear of the passing of Rizvi Fulile Zain. I
knew him personally and his death is a great loss not only for Sri
Lanka but for the whole Olympic movement,'' Charouck said in the
statement.
	   ``He has played an important role and has been a major driving
force for the sport in Sri Lanka,'' Charouck added.
	   The committee said arrangements were being made to fly Fulile
Zain's body home Monday night.

Rebels continue their push through Angola's central highlands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Rebel troops are driving a wedge through
two central highland provinces, pushing the government out of eight
towns and advancing on the strategic city of Kuito, according to
reports Monday.
	   UNITA rebel forces have taken four towns in Huambo province and
four others in neighboring Bie province since Dec. 4, when fighting
restarted in the area about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of
the capital Luanda, state radio RNA reported.
	   The renewed fighting ending a four-year peace pact between the
government and UNITA, has displaced thousands of people who have
converged on Kuito, according to the World Food Program.
	   UNITA and the army were engaged in heavy combat on two fronts to
the north and east of Kuito, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from
the city, according to RNA.
	   Some rebel artillery shells lobbed into Kuito on Monday hit the
airport, the radio said, and the WFP suspended aid flights into the
city because of security concerns.
	   However, the army was resisting a rebel advance on Huambo,
another major city 110 kilometers (68 miles) to the west of Kuito,
RNA said, and the WFP said it was maintaining its regular flights
into Huambo.
	   A UNITA spokesman in Lisbon, Portugal, claimed Monday that rebel
units had slipped into the suburbs of Kuito where they were
fighting the army.
	   Carlos Morgado claimed rebel forces had decimated five army
regiments of 10,000 men.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the reports, and the
government has refused to allow foreign reporters into the region.
	   Neither side has acknowledged the collapse of the United
Nations-brokered 1994 peace agreement which ended a two-decade
civil war that first broke out after the southwest African nation's
1975 independence from Portugal.
	   The fighting was halted by a 1991 peace deal, but the agreement
collapsed a year later after UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ rejected its
defeat in the country's first elections.

Ukrainian miner sets self on fire to protest non-payment of wages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mykhalevych's condition in 3rd graf, wage debt in
5th graf, reduced number of striking miners in 10th graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A 35-year-old miner doused himself with
gasoline and set himself on fire Monday to protest unpaid wages.
Police and fellow miners put out the flames and rushed him to a
hospital.
	   Oleksandr Mykhalevych was hospitalized in the eastern city of
Luhansk with burns covering nearly half his body, the independent
UNIAN and Interfax news agencies said.
	   Doctors were treating Mykhalevych, who remained in critical
condition and on a respirator.
	   Mykhalevych, a father to three children, set himself ablaze in
front of a government building to protest the chronic non-payment
of miners' wages. He and his colleagues from a mine in the nearby
town of Alchevsk have not been paid in six months to a year.
	   Mykhalevych, who alone is owed more than 5,000 hryvna (dlrs
1,460), was among 200 miners from Alchevsk who have picketed the
regional administration building since the summer to demand overdue
salaries. An average miner's salary is below 400 hryvna (dlrs 117).
	   But despite living for months in tents in a city park in front
of Luhansk government headquarters, the miners have failed to get
their money.
	   Before setting himself on fire, Mykhalevych wrote a note saying
he was acting because he had lost hope of receiving the money due
him.
	   ``I'm tired of being scorned by mine directors and the regional
administration. My (self-immolation) is hardly a way out, but it
might help resolve the matter more quickly,'' read the note,
according to UNIAN.
	   Coal miners have been protesting throughout Ukraine, but to
little avail.
	   More than 20,000 coal workers are currently on strike at various
mines, part of a series of protests that have kept dozens of
Ukraine's 275 mines idled for months, the Independent Miners' Union
said.
	   Despite the protests, the government has so far failed to pay
back wages in the mining industry. Miners are currently owed more
than 2 billion hryvna (dlrs 584 million) in overdue salaries, and
the debt has been increasing.
	   Many of the mines are unprofitable and the cash-strapped
government lacks money for wages and subsidies.

EU clears dlrs 11.6 million for humanitarian aid to Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission said Monday it
cleared 10 million European currency units (dlrs 11.6 million) in
humanitarian aid to the victims of the conflict in Kosovo.
	   A further 1.56 million ECU (dlrs 1.85 million) was set aside for
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Commission said in a statement.
	   The aid to Kosovo will go towards people who have stayed in the
Serbian province in spite of the conflict.
	   Many are homeless or living in overcrowded towns and villages
and the aid will help them face the coming winter with extra food,
healthcare, winter survival kits and shelter.
	   The Bosnian aid will go towards fuel, winter clothes and repairs
to electricity and water supply systems. It will be directed at
those who are still particularly vulnerable to the harsh winter in
Bosnia, where temperatures can plunge to -20 Celsius (-4
Fahrenheit), including the sick, elderly and the homeless.

Prosecution to bring semen-stained mattress to court
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with another corruption case against Anwar postponed
in final grafs
 &UR; By R. MAGESWARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The sex and corruption trial of
former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim took a sensational turn
Monday when the prosecution said it would exhibit a semen-stained
mattress to prove Anwar had indulged in illegal sex.
	   Deputy Public Prosecutor Azahar Mohamed told the court that the
mattress, seized by police in July from an apartment here, had
already been examined by the police laboratory.
	   He did not disclose the findings, but said the mattress would be
shown to the court Tuesday.
	   Anwar, the Southeast Asian country's deputy premier before being
sacked in September, currently faces abuse of power charges and
will be tried separately for allegedly having engaged in illegal
sex acts.
	   The prosecutor made the statement after Assistant Commissioner
of Police Musa Hassan, the 13th witness in the trial, said he had
ordered the mattress and pillow to be taken when he was
investigating whether Anwar had an affair with his former
secretary's wife.
	   ``I saw a few patches of seminal fluid on the mattress,'' Musa
told the court.
	   Earlier, Musa said Anwar could have been prosecuted for sexual
misconduct as early as last year had he not forced police to coerce
retractions from two people who made accusations against him.
	   Musa testified police detectives were unaware last year that the
retractions had been drafted and obtained by colleagues in the
police department's special branch _ allegedly on Anwar's orders.
	   Otherwise, charges would have been brought against the former
deputy prime minister on the basis of initial allegations made by
Ummi Hafilda Ali and Azizan Abu Bakar, the prosecution witness
said.
	   ``I suggested no further action because I was influenced by the
retraction letters,'' Musa told the court on Monday.
	   Azizan, the former driver of the jailed politician's wife, has
testified that Anwar repeatedly sodomized him in 1992, while Ummi
has accused Anwar of sleeping with her brother's wife, Shamsidar
Taharin.
	   The original allegations were contained in a letter Ummi, the
sister of Anwar's former secretary, sent to Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Defense attorney, Christopher Fernando accused Musa of trying to
malign Anwar and the prosecutors of fabricating evidence.
	   ``There seems to be a systematic campaign. One witness after the
other,'' Fernando said. ``It fortifies our earlier statement that
there is a conspiracy to bring down Anwar and to destroy him.''
	   Judge Augustine Paul warned Fernando that he could be punished
for contempt of court if he failed to prove his allegations against
prosecution lawyers. ``These are serious allegations.''
	   Last week, Musa said regular police officers were prevented from
interrogating Ummi and Azizan. Musa, who belongs to the criminal
investigation department, conducted a probe against Anwar this year
after the accusations resurfaced in a book.
	   Azizan's sodomy claims and Ummi's letter form the core of the 10
charges against Anwar, who was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 on
grounds of immorality.
	   His sacking and subsequent arrest and beating while in police
custody have led to demands for political reforms and
anti-government protests.
	   Anwar is being tried for four counts of allegedly using his
influence with the police to force the two accusers to sign
retractions. He also faces trial on five illegal sex charges and
one more count of corruption. He denies the charges.
	   Also on Monday, High Court judge Paul allowed prosecutors to
postpone another case against Anwar until June next year.
	   In that case, which had been scheduled to begin Monday, Anwar is
charged with interfering in an investigation of his private
secretary, Mohd Azmin bin Ali, who was suspected of receiving
bribes.

Thousands begin rotating hunger strike in Turkish prisons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Showing their support for a Kurdish rebel
leader detained in Rome last month, 8,000 Kurdish prisoners began a
rotating hunger strike Monday, a human rights activist said.
	   Since the detention of Abdullah Ocalan, who has led a
14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in southeast Turkey, Kurdish
prisoners have staged protests against Turkey's demand that he be
extradited. Five died after setting themselves ablaze.
	   ``They are striking because of the pressure on the Kurdish
people, to support Ocalan's attempt to find a political position
(for himself) and for a peaceful solution of the Kurdish
question,'' said Nazmi Gur of Turkey's Human Rights Association.
	   The Kurdish inmates, held in various Turkish prisons, are taking
five-day turns in rejecting food.
	   Italy refuses to return Ocalan to Turkey for trial on grounds
that it is against Italian law to extradite a suspect to a country
where he could face the death penalty.
	   Turkey holds Ocalan responsible for the deaths of thousands of
people during the Kurdish insurgency.

German talks on nuclear power shutdown set for January
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government spokesman on compensation, possible
timetables for shutdown. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Talks between the government and power
companies on shutting down Germany's 19 nuclear plants will begin
next month, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Monday.
	   He made the announcement after holding preliminary talks with
four leading nuclear energy operators on a strategy for scrapping
nuclear power. ``All participants are prepared to reach an
agreement,'' Schroeder said. No exact date was set yet.
	   The Social Democrats and the environmentalist Greens took power
in October calling for an end to nuclear energy in Germany, a major
policy reversal for the country.
	   If the talks do not produce a deal after one year, the
government says it intends to pass legislation setting a timetable
on its own.
	   Schroeder, who will chair the talks, said he was confident a
``sensible solution'' would be found.
	   One aim of the talks will be to avert the threat of huge
compensation lawsuits by utilities against the government if
nuclear plants are shut down prematurely, government spokesman
Uwe-Karsten Heye said.
	   The government hasn't revealed its strategy for the talks yet.
Many Greens favor a speedy exit over five or 10 years, but
Schroeder has said about 20 years would be needed.
	   Schroeder said the power executives reiterated in Monday's talks
that the compensation issue ``must be considered.''
	   Economics Minister Werner Mueller, a former utility company
executive who is taking part in the energy talks, has ruled out
government compensation for shuttered plants.

Bizarre murder-suicide shakes Wyoming coal town

<TEXT>
	   GILLETTE, Wyoming (AP) _ Cheryl and John Trover returned home
from a Friday night out with friends. John got ready for bed.
Cheryl had other plans.
	   Mrs. Trover, a high school math teacher, wife and 37-year-old
mother of two, had murder on her mind. She had plotted her moves
for months, and this was the night. It was to be John's last.
	   Pulling on a ski mask, she disguised her voice and bound her son
and daughter with rope. She shot her husband twice, then slit his
throat and stabbed him in the heart with his own hunting knife.
	   Mrs. Trover later told police how she had fled from a
dark-skinned intruder, how she had run naked and terrified into the
cold night.
	   But Cheryl Trover's plans had gone wrong. She'd be dead herself
within 48 hours, unable to live with the mistakes she had made.
	   Police say the children, ages 13 and 11, recognized the person
who tied them up as their mother and thought at the time she ``was
playing a game with them.'' And police quickly found the murder
weapon in the house across the street, the house that held the
secrets she had tried to protect. It was the house of Cheryl
Trover's principal _ and her lover for the past four years.
	   ``It's as close to a murder mystery and probably better written
than any I've read in a long time,'' said Sgt. Steve Rozier, the
lead investigator in the case.
	   ``Not that it's a good thing, but it certainly had a lot of
twists and turns.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   Gillette is a coal mining town of about 17,000 people, defiant
in its isolation on the barren, rolling prairie where antelope roam
free.
	   It depends on ranching and rich, low-sulfur coal deposits. Vast
trains export the product of immense open-pit mines such as Eagle
B, where Trover, 43, worked as an accountant.
	   Gillette has seen steady growth along with Wyoming's coal
industry over the past 25 years, drawing blue-collar residents of
eastern states whose coal industries have lagged.
	   The Trovers seemed so happy. There seemed to be no trouble _ not
in the 14 years they were married, not even when they socialized at
a neighborhood sports bar on Dec. 4, the night Trover was killed.
	   Leslie Flocchini knew the Trovers for 11 years. Less than two
weeks before the murder, she saw them at a junior high girls
basketball game.
	   ``Cheri and John sat right beside us and we talked the entire
time and made jokes and laughed. And I can still remember John
rubbing Cheri's shoulder,'' Flocchini said.
	   ``They were very affectionate to one another in public,'' she
said.
	   Like her children, Mrs. Trover was athletic. Lean and muscular
with long, dark hair, she lifted weights religiously at a stylish,
warehouse-sized gym where she and her husband often played
racquetball.
	   Speakers at a memorial service on Thursday described her as a
favorite of many students at Campbell County High School.
	   John Trover's co-workers remembered a kind, family-loving man
who could take a joke.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   Police had a theory within hours. They heard whispers that Mrs.
Trover was involved with principal John Riley.
	   The Trovers had a key to Riley's house. Riley, who was divorced,
often had Christmas dinner with the Trovers, either at his house or
theirs.
	   Police believe Mrs. Trover feared a divorce would cost her
custody of Torrey, 13, and Jackson, 11. Trover had gained custody
of his daughter Brooklin, 18, when he divorced his first wife.
	   Riley admitted to the affair and resigned his job on Tuesday. He
apparently was unaware of her scheme, police said.
	   The plot began up to six months ago, when Mrs. Trover learned
Riley would be out of town the weekend of Dec. 4.
	   In recent weeks, Eagle Butte Mine officials had received vague
threats from a caller with a low, possibly female voice. Layoffs
were rumored at the mine.
	   ``We believe that Cheri Trover made some phone calls that
someone from the coal company might end up paying for the layoffs
in some way,'' Rozier said.
	   Mrs. Trover also told neighbors she had seen a man wearing
coveralls, cowboy boots and wire-rim glasses near their house. It
was the same description she later gave of the intruder.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   Police believe Mrs. Trover shot her husband in the back as he
stood in his underwear.
	   But Cheryl was no better at handling a gun than John. She had
mistakenly loaded the handgun she had taken from Riley's house with
.22-caliber rifle bullets, which misfired. John's wounds were only
superficial.
	   Then she found John's hunting knife and killed him in the
kitchen. She faked signs of a struggle, dragging her husband's body
down to the basement.
	   She wiped the blood off the gun and returned it to Riley's
house, then drove off in the couple's pickup.
	   In the southern outskirts of town, she stripped naked and set
fire to her clothes, the cowboy boots and coveralls in the truck,
police said.
	   As the truck burned, she fled into a field and hid in a drainage
culvert. A passing motorist quickly put out the blaze with a fire
extinguisher, preserving the evidence. She emerged when police
arrived at about 5:30 a.m., and authorities launched a search for
the intruder.
	   A sexual assault test at the hospital was inconclusive. Police
noticed that cigar burns on Mrs. Trover's back appeared to be
self-inflicted. The details she offered were confusing.
	   Mrs. Trover went to a friend's ranch west of town. When Riley
called Sunday afternoon to tell her police had found the gun, she
asked for a half hour to herself.
	   She went upstairs, found a rifle in a master bedroom, locked
herself in an adjoining bathroom, and shot herself.
	   ``Something happened,'' the Rev. Tom Ogg said at the memorial
service for the couple. ``Most everybody who knew them said, `This
is not the person we knew.'''

Meeting of top Palestinian body shrouded in confusion

CORRECTS name to Palestine Naitonal Council, not Palestinian &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Hundreds of top Palestinian
officials, including former guerrilla fighters, came together
Monday in the presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton to reassure
Israel that they are no longer seeking its destruction.
	   ``We will go to the Israelis and tell them, `we recognize
you,''' said the chief Palestinian peace negotiator, Saeb Erekat,
one of the delegates of the Palestine National Council.
	   The PNC meeting is one of the requirements of the Wye River
peace accord Clinton helped negotiate. The accord says the
delegates are to ``reaffirm'' a letter by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to Clinton in which he lists the clauses of the PLO founding
charter that are considered null and void.
	   Clinton and Arafat were given a standing ovation by the
delegates when they entered the Shawa Center in Gaza City.
	   However, confusion overshadowed the gathering.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted on a vote by
a show of hands. The Palestinians said they were not required to
vote, but left it open how they would show their support for
abrogating the charter clauses.
	   Most delegates said procedure was irrelevant and complained that
Netanyahu was looking for excuses to hold up an Israeli troop
withdrawal in the West Bank that is to follow the PNC session.
	   Israel has already said it would not pull back troops on Friday,
as required under the Wye accord, even if the PNC session meets its
expectations. Netanyahu says the Palestinians need to crush West
Bank riots and publicly withdraw from plans to declare a state in
May 1999.
	   One of the delegates, former guerrilla fighter Bassam Abu
Sharif, said the Palestinians were committed to peace.
	   ``We are serious and willing to go ahead and achieve peace for
both Israel and the Palestinians,'' said Abu Sharif, who plotted
airplane hijackings in the 1970s and recruited the terrorist
``Carlos the Jackal.'' Abu Sharif's face is scarred from a 1972
Israeli letter bomb that tore three fingers off his left hand.
	   Others in the audience included Mohammed Oudeh, implicated by
Israeli and American intelligence experts in planning the botched
hostage-taking at the 1972 Munich Olympics that left 11 Israeli
athletes dead.
	   Most of the delegates were middle-aged men in dark suits, many
of them graying and balding. Some wore gold-embroidered caps of the
Palestinian security forces, others traditional white head dresses.
	   In an effort to get the message across, the Palestinian
Authority permitted both Israeli TV stations to broadcast live from
the Shawa Center and Israeli reporters to move freely to interview
delegates.
	   In Jerusalem, legislators were crowded around a TV set in the
cafeteria of Israel's parliament, the Knesset, to watch the
proceedings.
	   The PNC has 727 members, but it was not clear Monday how many
were present. Estimates ranged between 400 and 500. The PLO charter
says a two-thirds majority needs to be present to vote on changes.
While some Israeli hardliners demanded a quorum for Monday's
session, Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said ``a respectable
majority, a decisive majority'' was sufficient.
	   The Palestinians have considered clauses in their charter
calling for the destruction of Israel irrelevant for the past five
years, since their first peace treaty with Israel in 1993.
	   The PNC voted formally in April 1996 to revoke those clauses.
But when Netanyahu took office a month later, he said the
Palestinians had not completed their task.

Hero or killer? Roles mixed in Berlin Wall shooting trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling to Mueller sted Muller in 10th, 12th grafs
pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ In 1962, with the Cold War at its frostiest, a
young baker risked his life to get his family out of communist East
Germany by tunneling under the newly built Berlin Wall.
	   In the West, he was hailed as a hero. On the other side of the
wall, however, Rudolf Mueller was called a killer because he made
his getaway by shooting point-blank at a startled young border
guard.
	   The Wall is gone now, as is East Germany, but the case has been
revived. Mueller, now 67, faces a murder charge at a trial that
began Monday in Berlin.
	   Proceedings were suspended after only 90 minutes, however, after
the defense challenged the neutrality of the judges. Another court
was expected to rule on the motion by Friday.
	   Mueller's case is believed to be the first to reverse the
pattern since German unification in 1990: hundreds of convictions
of former East German border guards and officials on charges
related to shooting those trying to flee to the West.
	   The apparent one-sidedness has prompted many in eastern Germany
to complain of ``victor's justice.'' Berlin officials hope the
Mueller trial will help them refute that charge.
	   ``Whatever is there to be pursued, prosecutors have to pursue it
and they do so, no matter which political side the perpetrator and
victim were on,'' Justice Ministry spokesman Matthias Rebentisch
said. ``It's solely about clearing up crimes.''
	   Rebentisch denied prosecutors had dragged their feet in bringing
charges against Mueller, blaming the heavy workload borne by the
agency responsible for sorting through the miles (kilometers) of
secret files kept by East Germany's security apparatus.
	   Mueller was held briefly after being charged in June 1997, then
released on 100,000 marks (dlrs 60,000) bail. He no longer lives in
Berlin, and he and his lawyer declined to comment before the trial.
	   Mueller had made it out of East Germany before the Wall went up,
then spent weeks digging a 22-meter (72-foot) tunnel with plans to
rescue his family.
	   On June 18, 1962, he crossed to the East to bring his family to
the building near the Wall where his tunnel led. As they
approached, they were stopped by the guard, 20-year-old Reinhold
Huhn, who was armed with a machine gun.
	   Mueller later told West Berlin police Huhn asked to see their
papers. Huhn was looking through a bag when Mueller said he punched
him, knocking him down. Before Huhn could get up, another border
guard opened fire, hitting the guard, Mueller claimed.
	   The family fled and made it to the West.
	   The East Germans told a different story _ one that prosecutors
now believe.
	   Citing witnesses, they say Mueller was stopped, pretended to
reach into his breast pocket for his identification card and pulled
out a gun, shooting Huhn point-blank before the guard had time to
react.
	   Mueller himself muddied the case during a celebratory
post-escape news conference at one of West Germany's biggest
publishing houses, Axel Springer, which had allowed him to dig the
tunnel from its basement.
	   With whiskey flowing, Mueller was asked about how many times he
had to ``pull the trigger.'' He was quoted as saying: ``Once. The
man fell down immediately.'' He seemed to contradict his earlier
statement, though in the jovial atmosphere it was not clear if he
was being serious.
	   East Germany demanded Mueller be handed over. West Germany
refused, insisting, with Cold War dogmatism, that the guard was
shot by one of his own comrades during the frenzied escape.
	   Mueller soon left Berlin and eventually became a union official
and businessman. His case slipped from memory in the West.
	   But the border guard, Huhn, became a martyr for the East German
propaganda machine, a symbol of the threat from the West for a
regime seeking to justify its erection of the Wall less than a year
earlier and to draw attention away from its own citizens being
killed on the border _ nearly 1,000 in all by last official count.
	   Huhn, who earned his living milking cows, had helped build the
Wall while doing his military service. East Berlin named a street
after him near the Checkpoint Charlie border crossing and hung a
plaque pledging to bring his killer to justice.
	   The tablet is gone today, but the street name remains.
	   Mueller's trial is scheduled to last until Feb. 26.

<TEXT>
	   MUSCAT, Oman (AP) _ Oman Air has signed a dlrs 25 million deal
to lease two Airbus A310s from the U.S. International Lease Finance
Corporation, the official Oman newspaper reported Monday.
	   The two new planes will join the Oman Air fleet by March, the
paper said quoting deputy communications minister Majed Saeed
al-Rowahi.
	   The new aircraft will replace two of the three Airbus 320s
currently on lease by Oman Air.
	   Oman Air is 35 percent owned by the Omani government, 40 percent
by private firms, and the rest belongs to individual shareholders.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The Iranian Parliament will lower projected
oil prices in the government budget for the year beginning next
March to between dlrs 10 and dlrs 11 a barrel from the proposed
dlrs 12 per barrel, a senior legislator was quoted as saying.
	   This was disclosed by Morteza Zarringoal, head of the
Parliament's oil committee, in an interview with the state-run
Islamic Republic News Agency. It did not elaborate.
	   The Majlis has until the end of the Iranian calendar year on
March 21 to decide on the budget. A draft was presented by
President Mohammad Khatami earlier this month.
	   Oil prices, at a record low, have hit hard at the economies of
oil exporting countries like Iran.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Hilal Cement Co. announced Monday it has been
listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange, becoming the market's 78th
firm.
	   The company said in an advertisement published in Al-Watan daily
that its stocks will be on the market from Dec. 22. According to
the ad, Hilal's total assets were 7.78 million dinars (dlrs 25.76
million), and its capital 3 million dinars (dlrs 9.93 million).
	   Hilal was established in 1984.
 &UR; ___
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Hunt Oil Co. in Yemen said Monday that
repairs on its oil pipeline over the past six months have cost it
an estimated dlrs 2.16 million.
	   The pipeline had been blown up 18 times since July and cost the
company an estimated dlrs 120,000 for repairs each time, said the
official speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   He said the damage from the last explosion was repaired Monday.
	   Yemeni tribesmen blew up the pipeline Thursday, apparently to
try to force the government to pay for development projects in
their region.
	   The government hiked fuel prices by about 40 percent in June in
line with demands by the International Monetary Fund. Tribesmen
have retaliated by attacking the pipeline by blowing holes in it
and then lighting the fuel on fire with a tracer round or a blow
torch.
	   The pipeline carries oil from the Safer field in Marib province
to a port on the Red Sea. Hunt officials estimated each leak at
about 1,500 barrels per day.
	   Hunt's oil field in Marib produces 165,000 barrels per day. The
company employs 1,300 Yemeni staff in addition to 30 foreign
workers.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A Syrian trade and industrial delegation
arrived Sunday in the northern city of Mosul to explore business
opportunities, the official Iraqi News agency reported.
	   The delegation, representing businessmen of the province of
al-Hasaka in Syria, was invited by the Mosul Chamber of Commerce
	   Mosul is 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of Baghdad.
	   The Syrian delegation headed by Anton Ibrahim Alias, the head of
the Hasaks Chamber of Commerce and Industry, will be meeting with
businessmen of Mosul during its three-day visit.

China's armed forces hand over businesses on time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's armed forces completed the hand over of
their vast commercial holdings to civilian control Monday, in a
reform meant to curb corruption and help modernize the military,
state media reported.
	   From Tuesday, the military's and the armed police's businesses
will be handled by multi-agency task forces, a special office
overseeing the transfer said in a report carried by the state news
agency, Xinhua, and read aloud on nationwide television.
	   Although the announcement came a day ahead of the deadline set
by the Communist Party and was expected, it left unanswered the
crucial question of compensation.
	   While the government is expected to boost the defense budget,
senior officers in the People's Liberation Army want military
spending to match a fixed percentage of China's gross domestic
product from here on in, according to Western and Chinese scholars.
	   The 2.9-million member PLA runs an estimated 15,000 businesses
that as of a few years ago covered a third of the military's
operating expenses. While many are money losing, the enterprises
include profitable operators of mobile phone services and
pharmaceutical makers.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin's July order to get the
politically powerful military and the People's Armed Police out of
business was later expanded. Judiciary and most government
departments were given until year's end to sever their commercial
ties.
	   The move was seen as necessary to stop corrosive corruption,
help rid the economy of bureaucratic interference and speed the
professionalization of the military.
	   This policy ``will have extremely great significance in
preserving the order of the socialist market economy, strengthening
the party and government and protecting the long-term peace of the
nation,'' said the Xinhua report.
	   While the announcement by the Takeover Office for Military,
Armed Police, Government and Judiciary Businesses noted that
Jiang's orders had been carried out smoothly, the report provided
no figures on the number enterprises or amount of assets handed
over.
	   The report encouraged businesses to maintain production, improve
management and comply with further orders from the office and its
local task forces.
	   Under the next phase of the reform, some businesses will be
closed and others merged while the better performing ones will
remain untouched.

Presidents of Ukraine, Turkmenistan to meet next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma will
travel to Turkmenistan next week for two days of talks with
President Saparmurat Niyazov that are likely to focus on gas
supplies.
	   The leaders of the two former Soviet republics agreed during a
telephone conversation that they would meet in the Turkmen capital
Ashgabat on Dec. 23-24, Kuchma's press service said Monday.
	   The press service did not elaborate on what Kuchma and Niyazov
are to discuss. But analysts said the two presidents are expected
to focus on supplies of Turkmen gas to Ukraine, the most vital
topic in their relations for years.
	   Ukraine wants to buy up to 20 billion cubic meters (700 billion
cubic feet) of gas, or a quarter of its annual gas needs, from
Turkmenistan next year. Ukraine has proposed paying for the gas
with commodities, but Turkmenistan demands cash.
	   The two countries also have to negotiate with Russia's gas giant
Gazprom over transporting Turkmen gas to Ukraine through Russia,
the only available route.
	   Ukraine, the world's sixth largest gas consumer, has long looked
for new sources of gas imports to lessen its dependence on Russia,
which now covers about 70 percent of Ukraine's gas needs.

Sri Lanka wins first Asian Games golds in 24 years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with later medals, Jayasinghe leaving &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's Koji Ito rebounded from a slow
start to claim honors Monday as Asia's fastest man, and looked on
the bright side of not joining the exclusive club of sprinters
faster than 10 seconds.
	   ``At least I excited everyone,'' he said after winning the 100
meters in 10.05. He had raised hopes by setting an Asian record of
10.00 in Sunday's semifinals.
	   Sri Lanka's Susantika Jayasinghe, favored in the women's 100,
didn't start at all. After pulling a hamstring in Sunday's
semifinals, she went home Monday.
	   ``This morning we took her to the clinic and it was apparent
that she cannot run. She wanted to go back home as soon as
possible,'' said Sri Lankan team chief Maya Gunasekhara.
	   Other runners gave Sri Lanka its first two Asian Games gold
medals in 24 years _ within less than an hour.
	   But Asia's co-hosts for the 2002 World Cup soccer finals _ South
Korea and Japan _ suffered the embarrassment of not reaching the
Asian Games semifinals. Japan went out in the second round, and
Thailand upset South Korea in the quarterfinals Monday, 2-1, on
Thatwachai Damrong-Ongtrakul's 40-meter goal six minutes into extra
time, when the Thais were down to nine men.
	   Iran joined the Thais in the semifinals with an easy 4-0 victory
over Uzbekistan. Bayern Munich star Ali Daei scored three goals
within seven minutes in the second half.
	   In other quarterfinals, China beat Turkmenistan 3-0 and Kuwait
defeated Qatar in a penalty shootout 3-1 after 150 minutes of
scoreless play. In the semifinals Wednesday, China meets Iran and
Thailand takes on Kuwait.
	   On the track, Ito was the slowest of the eight finalists out of
the blocks, costing him any chance of becoming the first non-black
athlete to crack 10 seconds for the 100.
	   Thailand's Seeharwong Reanchai edged Japan's Yasukatsu Otsuki
for the silver medal in a photo finish after both clocked 10.31.
	   With Jayasinghe gone in the women's 100, China's Asian record
holder Li Xuemei won in a wind-aided 11.05 seconds, ahead of
teammate Li Yali. Li Xuemei said she hardly slept overnight because
of diarrhea and a fever.
	   Sri Lankans won both the men's and women's 400 meters.
	   Damayanthi Darsha won the women's in 51.57 seconds, comfortably
ahead of China's Chen Yuxiang, who struggled to a 52.50 finish.
P.T. Usha, India's star before retiring eight years ago, finished
sixth in 54.37 in a return to the track.
	   In the next race, Sugath Tillekeratne held off Qatar's Ibrahim
Faraj in the men's 400, winning 44.99 to 45.32.
	   ``This is the first time that Sri Lanka has won a gold medal in
24 years,'' Darsha said. ``I am extremely happy, not only because I
have won the gold but it was my coach who had won the last gold in
1974.''
	   Coach Sunil Gumawardeme was a member of the 1974 winning
4x100-meter relay team.
	   Aside from Li's victory in the women's 100, China had golds in
the women's 10-kilometer walk, by Liu Hongyu; the men's shot put,
by Liu Hao, and the heptathlon, where Shen Shengfei amassed 5,817
points for the seven events. Kazakstan's Svetlana Kazanina was
second at 5,775.
	   That and a victory in mixed doubles table tennis boosted its
total for the games to 84 golds.
	   For the second consecutive day, South Korea was the biggest
winner, piling up seven golds and lifting its total to 43. The
Koreans won three in Greco-Roman wrestling, one in women's team
foil fencing and one in weightlifting. In addition, Lee Yong-sun
won the women's javelin event and cyclist Ji Sung-hwan beat Olympic
bronze medalist Takanobu Jumonji of Japan in the men's 1-kilometer
time trial.
	   Japan had 34, gaining gold Monday from Ito, women's 10,000-meter
winner Yuko Kawakami, and Miya Tachibana, who won the solo
synchronized swimming.
	   India and Qatar won their first golds of these games, in the
women's and men's 1,500-meter races.
	   India's Jyotirmoy Sikdhar outsprinted China's Wang Qingfen to
win the women's 1,500.
	   Organizers angered jeering Indian fans by playing the wrong
anthem at Sikdhar's medal ceremony, so 10 minutes later they
brought the medalists out and played the right anthem.
	   Qatar's Mohamad Taib won the men's 1,500 for the third
successive games. He slowed down near the end, waving his rivals
closer, then turned around and made a rude gesture down the track.
	   Hong Kong won its second gold of the games when Hui Cheung-kwok
emerged the winner in men's masters bowling competition. Taiwan's
Chou Miao-lin was the women's winner, boosting her nation's total
to 15 golds.
	   Even before their soccer upset, the Thais, who take numbers
seriously were celebrating winning their 13th gold medal of the
13th Asian Games on Sunday _ Dec. 13.
	   Their original target had been 10 golds at their home games.
Their best previous was 12 at the 1966 games in Bangkok.

U.S. mediator renews Kosovo talks; border clash reported

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S. envoy for Kosovo renewed
talks with the province's ethnic Albanian negotiators Monday amid
reports of a fresh border clash between rebels and Yugoslav army
guards.
	   Christopher Hill, whose proposals for a political settlement for
Kosovo have been rejected by both sides, met with negotiators in
Pristina and planned to travel to Belgrade on Tuesday for more
talks with Serbian government authorities.
	   The political process appears stalled despite weeks of shuttle
diplomacy by Hill, who is trying to head off a feared resumption of
fighting between ethnic Albanian rebels and Serb forces.
	   Hill's visit came amid Serbian reports that Kosovo Albanian
rebels and Yugoslav border guards clashed early Monday. An
unspecified number of ethnic Albanians were reported killed and
injured in the shooting, which was said to have lasted for five
hours.
	   The clash occurred near the southwestern town of Prizren, when a
large group of armed Albanians tried to illegally cross the border
from Albania, the pro-government Serb Media Center in Kosovo said.
It said there no casualties among government troops.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels, who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence, have frequently used illegal border routes to arm
themselves in neighboring Albania.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and an estimated 300,000 left
homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown against separatist rebels last February. Despite an
October truce, there have been dozens of deaths reported in the
past two months.
	   Meanwhile, a delegation of Kosovo's Serbs from the southwestern
region of Orahovac arrived in Pristina to plead with international
peace verifiers for their relatives and family members who went
missing five months ago.
	   About 50 Serbs met with Gabriel Keller, deputy head of the
2,000-strong peace mission led by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   Keller received a list of the missing people whom the Serbs
believe were kidnapped by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and
promised that the OSCE would ``try its best to find traces of the
missing.''
	   ``We condemn violations of human rights on whatever side they
happen and we will support the efforts to find your relatives,''
Keller said.

English star suggests Europe vs. International team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ There's the Ryder Cup and the
President's Cup. Why not complete the triangle and have Europe
playing against Greg Norman, Ernie Els and their International
team?
	   Lee Westwood, England's rising star and a Ryder Cup player,
believes it wouldn't devalue either of the other two competitions.
	   Collecting his award as the PGA European Tour's player of the
year Monday, the 25-year-old Englishman was speaking the day after
the Americans were crushed 20 1/2 to 11 1/2 by the International
team in Melbourne.
	   He said he'd like to see the European Ryder Cup team play
against Norman, Els, Price, Vijay Singh, Steve Elkington and the
others, using the same format.
	   ``I think there's room for it and I don't think it would devalue
the Ryder Cup,'' he said. ``It's always nice to test yourself
against the best and we don't have much match play.''
	   Westwood said he couldn't wait to take on the Americans in next
September's Ryder Cup at Brookline, Massachusetts, where he expects
a lot of support from Boston's Irish community especially with
Europe defending the title.
	   ``I'm already looking forward to it immensely,'' he said. ``They
are going to be keen to stick it to us. They got a bit of a
trouncing (at Valderrama last year).
	   ``There's nothing to compare with the Ryder Cup and I can't
imagine what it will be like in Boston.''

Response good to tender to manage Kenyan sugar company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Reponse to a tender to manage the South
Nyanza Sugar Co. has been good, a spokeswoman for the Kenya Sugar
Authority said Monday.
	   ``The response is good. We have received five bids, all from
international companies,'' said the spokeswoman, who asked not to
be further identified.
	   The government invited bids last week for a technical manager
agreement of the company in which it holds 98.8 percent of the
shares. Bidding closes Dec. 21.
	   The government is the major shareholder in five of Kenya's seven
sugar factories and holds a minority share in the sixth.
	   Western sugar, the seventh refinery, is privately owned.
	   At the weekend KSA Chief Executive Officer Francis Chahonyo said
the local industry is unable to attain self-sufficiency in sugar
production despite huge investments in the sector by the government
due to inefficiency.
	   South Nyanza Sugar has an installed capacity to crush 3,000 tons
of cane per day, a nucleus estate of 2,500 hectares and 16,200
hectares of contracted outgrowers cane.
	   The company has available land to support the expansion of the
factory to crush 6,200 tons cane per day capacity.
	   Sugar consumption in Kenya has been estimated at 716,455 tons
this year.
	   Local production is projected at 485,000 tons.

Fan tries to attack referee over Thai boxer's loss

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A spectator tried to attack the referee
with sticks Monday to protest Thai fighter Sonthaya Wongprathes'
semifinal loss to India's Ng-Pingko Singh in Asian Games
bantamweight boxing.
	   The fan was stopped by a Thai trainer, already in the ring to
protest Sonthaya's 18-14 loss, which sent Singh into the final.
	   Police rushed to the ring to escort the fan out of the arena,
while other Thai spectators berated the judges with shouts of
``Cheat, cheat,'' and ``Go home.''
	   ``I was certain that I was ahead by at least two punches by the
end of the third round,'' said the Thai fighter, and his team filed
a protest.
	   In Thursday's finals, Singh will meet Uzbekistan's Timur
Tulyakov, who scored an easy 18-4 victory over Kazakistan's Marat
Mazimbayev.
	   In the early rounds, Singh troubled Sonthaya with superior
footwork and quick jab, but the Thai fighter appeared in complete
control in the later stages.
	   In a middleweight semifinal, Uzbekistan's Dilshod Yarbekov
defeated Syria's Mohammad Kadour when referee stopped the match at
1:52 of the fourth round. Yarbekov had dropped Kadour at the end of
the third round and forced him to take a standing eight count at
the beginning of the fourth.
	   For the gold, he will meet Kazakistan's Vyacheslav Burba, who
defeated South Korea's Kim Ho-chul in a tough fight, 14-12.
	   Thais reached three other finals.
	   Light-flyweight Suban Punnon scored a 15-2 decision over North
Korean Pak Chun. He next meets China's Yang Xiangzhong, an 8-3
winner over South Korea's Kim Sung-soo.
	   Lightweight Pongsit Wiangwesas won 14-6 against South Korea's
Shin Eun-chul, advancing to a final against Uzbekistan's Temur
Suleymanov.
	   Suleymanov won 6-3 over Mongolia's Tumentsetseg Uitumen in a
fight where the two went toe-to-toe for most of the five rounds,
exchanging hooks and uppercuts.
	   In welterweight, Parkpoom Jangphonak shook off some shark hooks
in the second round by Uzbekistan's Nariman Ataeu and won 15-5.
	   He will meet Kazakistan's Nurzhan Smanov, who defeated South
Korea's Bae Ho-jo 15-11.

New Cabinet promises economic and administrative reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HUSSEIN DAKROUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Prime Minister-designate Salim Hoss on
Monday pledged wide-ranging political, economic and administrative
reforms to rid Lebanon of past ``mistakes and sins.''
	   The promise of accountability marked the first serious attempt
in decades to stamp out deep-rooted corruption that has long been
considered a hallmark of Lebanese politics.
	   Hoss, a U.S.-educated economist who formed a Cabinet on Dec. 4,
is expected to easily win a vote of confidence later this week
since most of the 128 lawmakers backed Hoss' nomination for the
job.
	   presented his team's policy statement to Parliament on Monday. A
vote of confidence, expected later this week, is virtually assured
since
	   In a policy statement presented to Parliament, Hoss set economic
reform, monetary stability and cleaning up the corruption-riddled
administration as priorities of his new government.
	   He also vowed to introduce austerity measures on government
spending in order to reduce budget deficit.
	   Hoss criticized former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's economic
policies and his multibillion dollar program to rebuild the country
from the devastation of the 1975-90 civil war.
	   A major challenge facing his government was to halt ``the
financial drain caused by past policies, the reconstruction policy
and the faltering administrative reform process,'' the statement
said.
	   Hariri's opponents had accused his Cabinet of corruption and
squandering public funds.
	   Hariri is, however, credited with restoring economic confidence
and attracting investment in postwar Lebanon. He also tamed
inflation and stabilized the national currency.
	   But during six years in office, Hariri's government had failed
to improve living standards and had to borrow heavily to finance
huge infrastructure projects, resulting in a public debt of an
estimated dlrs 18 billion and an annual budget deficit of more than
40 percent.
	   Hariri bowed out in an apparent power struggle with new
President Emile Lahoud, the army commander elected president in
October with a promise to reform government.
	   ``The outgoing regime ended with a lot of mistakes and
frustration amid tragic absence of accountability,'' Hoss said. In
contrast, Lahoud's election was unanimously received with ``a
slogan of change against a gloomy background of mistakes and
sins,'' he added.
	   The prime minister-designate said the government ``will
strengthen and reactivate monitoring agencies with a view to
placing public departments and institutions in a climate of a
continuous and systematic administrative reform and declaring war
on corruption and squandering (of state funds).''

Toulouse bus drivers go on strike after bus is burned

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES in 5th graf with police officer suspended, two

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Bus drivers in Toulouse went on strike
Monday after youths burned one of their buses during a night of
rioting to avenge the shooting death of one of their friends.
	   The buses drivers justified their walkout by saying it wasn't
safe to work. Striking drivers also picketed the local bus depot in
Toulouse, a city of 350,000 people in south-central France.
	   The strikers also said the driver of the bus that was set on
fire was attacked by rioters. However, management said the driver
was stuck by glass after the windshield was shattered by a baseball
bat.
	   Youths in Toulouse rioted Sunday to avenge the shooting death of
a youth who was killed earlier in the morning by a stray police
bullet.
	   The Interior Minister on Monday suspended the officer in charge
of the police unit involved in the killing, and two policemen were
detained for questioning.
	   At least 150 police faced off up to 200 youths in a working
class district with an unemployment rate of 35 percent. The angry
youths threw stones and Molotov cocktails at security forces.
	   Six policemen were injured. No youths were reported hurt.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S. envoy for Kosovo renewed
talks with the province's ethnic Albanian negotiators Monday while
Serbian media reported a fresh border clash between Kosovo Albanian
rebels and Yugoslav army guards.
	   Christopher Hill, whose proposals for a political settlement for
Kosovo have been rejected by both sides, met with negotiators in
Pristina and planned to travel to Belgrade on Tuesday for more
talks with Serbian government authorities.
	   The political process appears stalled despite weeks of shuttle
diplomacy by Hill, who is trying to head off a feared resumption of
fighting between separatist, ethnic Albanian rebels and Serb
forces.
	   Serbian reports said Kosovo Albanian rebels and Yugoslav border
guards clashed early Monday. An unspecified number of ethnic
Albanians were reported killed and injured in the gunfire, which
was said to have lasted for five hours.
	   The clash occurred near the southwestern town of Prizren, when a
large group of armed Albanians tried to illegally cross the border
from Albania, the pro-government Serb Media Center in Kosovo said.
It said there were no casualties among government troops.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels, who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence, have frequently used illegal border routes to arm
themselves in neighboring Albania.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and an estimated 300,000 left
homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown against separatist rebels last February. Despite an
October truce, there have been dozens of deaths reported in the
past two months.
	   Meanwhile, a delegation of Kosovo's Serbs from the southwestern
region of Orahovac arrived in Pristina to plead with international
peace verifiers for their relatives and family members who went
missing five months ago.
	   About 50 Serbs met with Gabriel Keller, deputy head of the
2,000-strong peace mission led by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   Keller received a list of the missing people whom the Serbs
believe were kidnapped by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and
promised that the OSCE would ``try its best to find traces of the
missing.''
	   ``We condemn violations of human rights on whatever side they
happen and we will support the efforts to find your relatives,''
Keller said.

Russia plans 11 commercial space launches in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is planning 11 commercial space launches
next year, though officials warned Monday that several may be
postponed, as was the case this year.
	   Only six of the 12 planned launches lifted off this year, and a
number of those delayed will take place in 1999, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   The first commercial lift off, on Jan. 30, will take the U.S.
communications satellite Telestar-6 into space. The original plan
called for it to go up this past October.
	   Russia's space program is plagued by a lack of funds and the
commercial satellite launches are a way to generate income.

Congolese rebels say they shot down two Zimbabwean aircraft

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Congolese rebels on Monday said they had
shot down a Zimbabwean jet fighter and a helicopter gunship during
a government counteroffensive on a southeastern, rebel-held town.
	   Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, leader of the rebels fighting to oust
President Laurent Kabila, said his forces had repulsed attacks by
government forces and allied Zimbabwean and Namibian soldiers at
Kabalo, some 1,500 kilometers (935 miles) southeast of the capital,
Kinshasa, and shot down a MiG-21 fighter jet and a helicopter
gunship.
	   In Zimbabwe, military authorities admitted to loosing one
helicopter gunship and an unspecified number of troops in
continuing fighting for Kabalo, the Congo River port and an
important railway junction in mineral-rich Katanga Province,
Kabila's home.
	   The state-own Daily Herald quoted the headquarters of the
Zimbabwean, Angolan and Namibian troops fighting in support of
Kabila as saying that 80 rebels had been killed and that fighting
was continuing.
	   Zimbabwe is using both war planes and helicopters _ French-made
Pumas and Russian built Mi-24 transport helicopters _ to attack
rebels and ferry soldiers behind rebel lines.
	   The rebels are a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disaffected
Congolese soldiers and opposition politicians who took up arms Aug.
2 accusing Kabila of misrule, corruption and ethnic warmongering.
They are supported by troops and arms from neighboring Rwanda and
Uganda, who accuse Kabila of massacring ethnic Congolese Tutsis and
enlisting Ugandan and Rwandan rebels to attack them from bases in
eastern Congo.
	   So far, efforts to broker a cease-fire have failed over Kabila's
persistant refusal to negotiate directly with the rebels whom he
accuses of being the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda.
	   Wamba offered no other details. The rebels appear to have
repulsed attempts by the government and its allies to retake
Kabalo.
	   Last week, they claimed to have crossed the Nzofu Bridge, 14
kilometers (8 miles) from the town and to have pushed the enemy one
kilometer (mile) back on the opposite bank.

Zimbabwe says Kabila allies hold strategic town after clash
</HEADLINE>

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The Defense Ministry said Zimbabwe
troops and their allies engaged in heavy fighting with rebels in
eastern Congo and lost one helicopter gun ship after it developed a
technical fault, state radio reported Monday.
	   The radio said allied casualties were ``minimal'' in fighting
during the weekend that stopped rebel advances toward the
mineral-rich southeastern centers of Mbuji-Mayi and Lubumbashi, a
key allied garrison town.
	   The state-owned Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corp. said fighting Sunday
centered on the government held town of Kabalo, where rebel
casualties were heavy and rebel vehicles and artillery were
destroyed, halting a rebel attempt to capture the town.
	   The Defense Ministry gave no details of allied casualties but
admitted some casualties were reported by the allied forces
headquarters in the Congo.
	   It said, however, the helicopter gun ship, believed to have been
a French-built Alouette ``command car'' supporting ground troops,
crashed after a mechanical failure.
	   Officials gave no information of the fate of the crew. The
Alouette usually carried a crew of two and can be used to drop
four-man commando units on battle lines.
	   Repeated calls to the Defense Ministry in Harare for details of
allied casualties were unanswered Monday.
	   Earlier, the state-controlled Herald newspaper, quoting
unidentified sources, said at least 80 rebels were killed in
fighting for Kabalo and fighting was also reported around nearby
towns of Kalemie and Moba.
	   Angolan and Namibian troops are fighting alongside Zimbabweans
and Congolese forces of embattled President Laurent Kabila in the
dense jungles of eastern Congo.
	   Kabalo, about 250 kilometers (160 miles) west of the Congolese
border on Lake Tanganyika, is considered an important strategic
position that would provide the rebels with a ``springboard'' if
captured for attacks on Mbuji-Mayi and Lubumbashi, Kabila's home
stronghold and the Congo's second largest city, The Herald said.
	   Zimbabwe dispatched 8,000 troops, backed by warplanes and armor,
to support Kabila after the rebellion erupted Aug. 2.
	   Kabila's refusal to meet with the rebels has doomed a series of
peace initiatives seeking an end to the four-month Congolese war.
	   Kabila alleges the rebels are merely pawns of Rwanda and Uganda
and insists on negotiating only with those two countries.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel is
suffering from a viral infection of the lungs and will take a short
rest from work, his spokesman said Monday.
	   Havel became ill over the weekend but was not hospitalized,
spokesman Ladislav Spacek said. The president will stay at home
until Wednesday, when doctors will decide on any future treatment,
Spacek said.
	   Havel, 62, fought off a life-threatening case of pneumonia in
August and had emergency surgery for a ruptured colon in April.
	   A former chain smoker, Havel has been hospitalized five times
since December 1996, when a third of his lung and a cancerous tumor
were removed.

Reality jolts dreams of early entry for EU candidate states
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland _ Poland and other EU candidate nations went to
last weekend's European Union summit in Vienna to find out when
they could join up.
	   They came back with a simple, stark political truth _ no one is
quite ready to cough up the money needed to expand Europe across
former ideological and battle lines.
	   The 15-member EU decided to put off until March any decisions on
accepting a handful of new members that would broaden its territory
from the Atlantic to the Ukraine.
	   That sparked frustration among some leaders who wanted a set
timetable for the wide-ranging reforms and negotiations required.
	   ``On one side, the EU demands that we adjust our legislation to
the European urgently, while on the other side, there are
tendencies to slow down the enlargement process,'' complained
Slovenian Premier Janez Drnovsek.
	   Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said overhauling the economy
and other sectors must have a tangible, realistic deadline for
those undergoing the changes.
	   ``To keep dynamics of these changes, we need specific dates,''
he said.
	   Some newspapers in central and eastern Europe portrayed the EU
as stingy, with headlines such as ``Viennese `Summit of Misers'
causes disappointment'' in Hungary's center-left Nepszabadsag daily
newspaper.
	   But Buzek and others noted that nobody at the EU summit tried to
rule out expansion. The problem involved when to do it, rather than
why, they said.
	   Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, all planning to join
NATO next year, are the top EU candidates along with Cyprus, the
former Yugoslav republic Slovenia and the former Soviet republic
Estonia. Others lining up include Romania, Slovakia, Latvia,
Lithuania and Bulgaria.
	   Before any enlargement, the EU must overhaul its annual dlrs 100
billion budget, more than 80 percent of which is spent on subsidies
for farmers and aid for poorer EU regions.
	   If left unchanged, those costs will skyrocket when the
easterners join. Poland alone has 4 million farmers, more than half
the number in the whole of the current EU. All the central and
eastern European candidates are poorer than the poorest EU member _
Greece.
	   The EU summit decided it would adopt its reform plan _ called
Agenda 2000 _ at its March meeting in Brussels. After that, it
could start working out specific dates for expansion.
	   But fears remain that the shifting landscape of European
politics, such as Germany's move to the center-left this year,
could mean a new anti-expansion policy in the EU.
	   Germany was a main supporter of expansion under former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Its new chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, made
clear in Vienna he opposed raising Germany's already substantial
contribution to the EU budget.
	   Meanwhile, smaller, poorer members who believe the newcomers
will reduce their share of the pot, proposed increasing the EU
budget by dlrs 24 billion in the next seven years.
	   ``A generational change has occurred in German politics after
the last elections and it has its consequences,'' Polish Foreign
Minister Bronislaw Geremek said in an interview published Monday in
Gazeta Wyborcza, Poland's largest-circulation daily. ``I hope it
does not mean by any chance a change in Germany's foreign policy
but only practice will show that.''
	   Some candidates speak of formal membership by 2002, while EU
members tack on a couple of years. Poland and the other leading
contenders already have submitted detailed proposals on reforming
key segments of society and the economy to meet EU standards.
	   Buzek, the Polish prime minister, suggested putting off the
money issue while settling on who would join when.
	   ``We are of course interested in funds which would facilitate
Poland's adjustment to the European rules of the game,'' he said.
``But we would not like it if prolonging discussions of donations
to the EU's budget postpones our membership.''

EU farm ministers clear last major hurdle to approve Russian food

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union farm ministers on Monday
cleared the last major political obstacle before a dlrs 460 million
food aid program for Russia will be adopted, raising hopes the
first aid might reach the needy by the end of next month, officials
said.
	   ``The ministers have unanimously endorsed the program,'' said EU
Commission spokesman Gerry Kiely, after the EU executive hammered
home the need for strict monitoring to make sure the aid does not
end up in the hands of profiteers.
	   ``We have a high risk there,'' EU Farm Commissioner Franz
Fischler told the regular monthly meeting of farm ministers.
	   Under the current program, the 15 EU member nations, the
Commission and the European Parliament will share responsibility to
make sure the food reaches the needy.
	   There will be monthly reports from Russia, the EU's Court of
Auditors will be allowed to inspect the distribution of the aid in
Russia itself and the local governors will be handed detailed lists
of what should be coming their way, Kiely said.
	   The aid package includes hundreds of millions of tons of grain,
beef, milk powder and other foodstuffs for a total of about 400
million European currency units.
	   Up to last week, some EU member, including Germany, had
questions about the controls on distribution, which will be sent
gradually and immediately stopped if fraud is discovered.
	   The program will now be sent to the European parliament for an
assessment. The legislature though cannot not stop the deal and it
is expected to be finally approved at a meeting of EU fisheries
ministers on Thursday or Friday.
	   It would allow for the first distribution of food near the end
of January in Russia itself, Kiely said.
	   The food aid will be sold in Russia at market prices, and
profits used to fund social projects.
	   The EU had been debating the aid package since Nov. 9, four days
after the United States announced it would provide Russia with a
dlrs 600 million food aid package.

11-year-old Qatari table tennis player is games' youngest athlete
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An 11-year-old Qatar table tennis
player is the Asian Games' youngest athlete, the organizing
committee said Monday.
	   While some sports federations would consider him underage, the
table tennis and swimming governing bodies have no restrictions, it
added.
	   Aside from 11-year-old A-Rahman Al-Hammadi, the Qatar table
tennis team also includes 12-year-olds Nasser Al-Muhannadi and
jassim Al-Sullaiti, the committee said.
	   Other 12-year-olds include Qatar's Ammar Al-Ejji, a 100- and
200-meter freestyle swimmer; Kuwait table tennis player Ibrahem Al
Hasan and Macau swimmer Cheong Weng-lom, who competed in the 100-
and 200-meter women's breaststroke.
	   The gymnastics federation sets a minimum age of 16. Organizers
checked the passports of North Korea's women gymnasts after some
rival coaches, as well as doctors, suggested they looked younger
than that.
	   For judo, the minimum age is 18.

China, Philippines stay on course
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China and the Philippines stayed on
course to battle out the Asian Games men's basketball gold medal
after both scored convincing victories to start quarterfinal play
Monday.
	   Wang Zhizhi nailed 23 points and was one of five Chinese players
to score double figures in a 106-86 win over Iran.
	   China has won the past three Asian Games titles and is trying to
match the Philippines, which won a record four in a row and brought
a fully professional side to this tournament to preserve its
record.
	   Zandro Limpot had 19 points as the Philippines beat United Arab
Emirates 93-57. The team had a 22-day tour of the United States
before arriving for the Games.
	   ``Most of our confidence level was improved and the camaraderie
improved, and it helps when you get to play against top teams like
Arkansas and Iowa State University,'' Limpot said.
	   In previous years, the Philippines has sent young amateur
players to the Asian Games but this time players were taken out of
the national pro league.
	   China's height advantage proved decisive in its match against an
Iran team missing center and captain, A. Al Zaabi.
	   ``We weren't able to run our tactics because two of our tallest
players had travel sickness and one had a bad eye,'' said Iran
player Manthir Hashil.
	   The Philippines was pooled with UAE, South Korea and Thailand in
Group B of the quarterfinal round. China has Iran, Kazakstan and
Taiwan in Group A.
	   South Korea jumped to a 20-point lead after five minutes of its
match against host Thailand and ran away with a 98-71 victory. Moon
Kyung-Euen and Hyun Joo-Yup scored 28 points apiece for the
Koreans.

13 Egypt policemen to be probed in landmark abuse of power case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The police found a girl's body. Soon they
found a suspect. Then they got a confession, and the man was sent
to trial _ on the charge of murdering his missing 9-year-old
daughter.
	   As it turned out, the confession was beaten out of the man, his
daughter was found alive and the body that the police had
discovered was another young girl's, a judge ruled Sunday. A copy
of his written decision was released Monday.
	   Judge Mohammed Ezzat Agwah threw out the murder charge and
ordered an investigation into the conduct of 13 police officers
accused of using force to extract false confession, framing a
suspect and detaining other people illegally.
	   ``The court sees that the punishment of these officers should be
severe so that such an incident is not repeated,'' Agwah, head of
the Criminal Court in the northern city of Alexandria, said.
	   The case is another blow to the human rights record of Egyptian
police. It comes after civil rights groups accused police of
arresting and torturing hundreds of Coptic Christians in the
southern village of el-Kusheh to extract a murder confession in
August. The government denies any widespread abuse in el-Kusheh.
	   The ruling by Agwah is a landmark in Egypt where police misdeeds
are largely ignored and rarely brought to trial, let alone
punished. Agwah rebuked the police officers for not heeding ``God
or their conscience.''
	   The case revolves around Mohammed Badreddin, 34, who was
arrested in Alexandria in September 1996 following the discovery of
the body of a girl about nine years of age.
	   Police had received a complaint from Badreddin's ex-wife that
their daughter, Jehad, was missing and that she suspected
Badreddin, according to court records.
	   Neither parent was asked by the police to identify the body.
Instead, investigators assumed the body was that of Jehad, who used
to live alternately with the two parents, and arrested Badreddin.
	   Meanwhile, Jehad turned up at her mother's house, saying she got
lost after running away from her father's home because of
ill-treatment by Badreddin's new wife.
	   The mother, Intissar Gad, 34, failed to tell police that Jehad
had returned. Badreddin languished in custody where he was beaten
until he confessed to the murder, according to evidence submitted
in Agwah's court. Badreddin's trial began in November 1996.
	   Earlier this year, Badreddin's lawyers discovered that Jehad was
with her mother. So did the police, and in a bid to cover up their
bungling, they bundled the two to the police station and detained
them illegally, hoping that Badreddin's trial in Agwah' court would
soon be over, court officials said quoting documents.
	   However, Badreddin's lawyers traced mother and daughter to the
police station. Agwah ordered a raid on the police station in June
and the two were rescued after 13 days in the lockup.
	   Sometime earlier, police had also charged Badreddin with
murdering the second girl. A different court found him guilty and
and sentenced him in August to 15 years in prison.
	   On Sunday, Agwah declared Badreddin innocent of murdering his
daughter as well as the other girl, saying the man's innocence was
``screaming'' to be recognized.
	   The investigation ordered by Agwah will cover all policemen
involved in the case, including those who arrested, interrogated
and wrote the reports.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Members of the Palestine National
Council stood with raised hands before U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Monday to revoke clauses in the Palestinian charter calling for
the destruction of Israel.
	   ``I hope this will close this chapter forever,'' said
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   The vote was not counted, but officials called it ``almost
unanimous.''
	   At Arafat's call to reaffirm action taken in 1996, members of
the council voted by standing with their right hands raised,
something Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wanted.

French World Cup star fined for gesture, cleared of assaulting

policeman &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Arsenal World Cup star Patrick Vieira
was fined 20,000 pounds (dlrs 33,400) by a disciplinary panel
Monday for making an obscene gesture at rival Sheffield Wednesday
fans.
	   But the French midfielder was found not guilty of assaulting a
policeman as the players left the field after Arsenal's 1-0 loss at
Hillsborough.
	   Vieira appeared before the panel at Birmingham City's St.
Andrews stadium as a result of his conduct at the incident-packed
game in September.
	   Wednesday's Italian international forward Paolo Di Canio is
already serving a 11-match ban for pushing over the referee after
he was expelled.
	   As the players left the field at the end of the game Vieira made
a two-finger gesture to Wednesday fans who were jeering him.
	   ``It is also said an officer who tried to usher Vieira down the
players' tunnel was pushed in the chest, causing him to stumble
across the tunnel,'' FA spokesman man Steve Double said.
	   ``As he went down the tunnel he felt himself grabbed from behind
by an unknown assailant. He said he had broken free without
realizing it was a police officer.
	   ``The commission heard supporting evidence from club officials,
including Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger,'' Double said. ``The
commission ruled that Vieira was guilty of misconduct in relation
to the gestures to the crowd but not guilty in relation to any
alleged assault against a police officer.
	   ``Patrick has apologized to the commission over his conduct.''

Fan tries to attack referee over Thai boxer's loss
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with heavyweight matches &QL; 
 &UR; By DON PATHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A spectator tried to attack the referee
with sticks Monday to protest Thai fighter Sonthaya Wongprathes'
semifinal loss to India's Ng-Pingko Singh in Asian Games
bantamweight boxing.
	   The fan was stopped by a Thai trainer, already in the ring to
protest Sonthaya's 18-14 loss, which sent Singh into the final.
	   Police rushed to the ring to escort the fan out of the arena,
while other Thai spectators berated the judges with shouts of
``Cheat, cheat,'' and ``Go home.''
	   ``I was certain that I was ahead by at least two punches by the
end of the third round,'' said the Thai fighter, and his team filed
a protest.
	   In Thursday's finals, Singh will meet Uzbekistan's Timur
Tulyakov, who scored an easy 18-4 victory over Kazakistan's Marat
Mazimbayev.
	   In the early rounds, Singh troubled Sonthaya with superior
footwork and quick jab, but the Thai fighter appeared in complete
control in the later stages.
	   In a middleweight semifinal, Uzbekistan's Dilshod Yarbekov
defeated Syria's Mohammad Kadour when referee stopped the match at
1:52 of the fourth round. Yarbekov had dropped Kadour at the end of
the third round and forced him to take a standing eight count at
the beginning of the fourth.
	   For the gold, he will meet Kazakistan's Vyacheslav Burba, who
defeated South Korea's Kim Ho-chul in a tough fight, 14-12.
	   Thais reached three other finals.
	   Light-flyweight Suban Punnon scored a 15-2 decision over North
Korean Pak Chun. He next meets China's Yang Xiangzhong, an 8-3
winner over South Korea's Kim Sung-soo.
	   Lightweight Pongsit Wiangwesas won 14-6 against South Korea's
Shin Eun-chul, advancing to a final against Uzbekistan's Temur
Suleymanov.
	   Suleymanov won 6-3 over Mongolia's Tumentsetseg Uitumen in a
fight where the two went toe-to-toe for most of the five rounds,
exchanging hooks and uppercuts.
	   In welterweight, Parkpoom Jangphonak shook off some shark hooks
in the second round by Uzbekistan's Nariman Ataeu and won 15-5.
	   He will meet Kazakistan's Nurzhan Smanov, who defeated South
Korea's Bae Ho-jo 15-11.
	   In the heavyweight division, Pakistan's Muzaffar Mirza defeated
Jordan's Mohd Abukhadijeh 23-8 in a slugfest.
	   Not intimidated by the height and reach of his opponent, the
Syrian fighter took the fight to the Pakistani. His determination
drew the support of the home crowd, which had been quiet for the
three bouts since the last Thai fighter fought.
	   One Thai spectator yelled: ``Bite his ear,'' although it wasn't
certain to whom the suggestion was directed.
	   For the gold, he will meet Uzbekistan's Ruslan Chagaev, a 17-2
winner over Iran's Rohollah Hosseini.

 &UR; Former Lillehammer head says gifts part of the Olympic game &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ IOC member Gerhard Heiberg, who led the
successful 1994 Lillehammer Winter Games, told a Norwegian
newspaper that offers of gifts and services by cities seeking the
games have become common.
	   The International Olympic Committee has been rocked by
allegations of vote-buying, payoffs and blackmail in connection
with cities bidding to host the games.
	   In an interview published Monday, Heiberg told the Oslo
newspaper Verdens Gang that he has been offered gifts and services
by cities bidding for the games.
	   ``It has happened several times, and each time I have reported
it directly to IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch, Heiberg was
quoted as telling the newspaper. ``This is about gifts and
services, not money directly.''
	   According to Verdens Gang, Heiberg, former president of the
Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee, refused to say which
cities were involved, or give any other details.
	   ``This, unfortunately, has become a part of the game. Everyone
on the IOC has experienced this,'' Heiberg was quoted as saying. He
also said he fully supported efforts to expose and exclude IOC
members who may have accepted bribes or sold votes.
	   Heiberg and former LOOC managing director Petter Roenningen both
said they never suspected any members of attempting to sell votes
to Lillehammer when it was bidding for the 1994 Winter Games, the
report said.
	   ``We never got that feeling. Nor were we ever contacted by
agents acting on behalf of IOC members,'' Roenningen was quoted as
saying.

Kyrgyz police arrest deputy ministers in corruption crackdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three deputy ministers and several other senior
government officials in Kyrgyzstan have been arrested in a
crackdown on corruption, the central Asian nation's interior
minister said Monday.
	   Deputy ministers from the Finance Ministry, Environment Ministry
and Industry Ministry were charged with misappropriating about dlrs
30,000 each in government funds and taking bribes, Interior
Minister Omurbek Kutuyev was quoted by the ITAR-Tass news agency as
saying.
	   Department heads at the Agriculture Ministry and Finance
Ministry were also arrested in the weekend sweep.
	   Police in the former Soviet republic are also investigating the
heads of the ministries, Kutuyev said.
	   Also Monday, Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev signed a decree
stepping up the fight against corruption and smuggling, his
spokesman said. The decree establishes a council of representatives
of the police, army and intelligence service to curb such economic
crimes, ITAR-Tass said.

U.S. mediator renews Kosovo talks; border clash reported

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S. envoy for Kosovo renewed
talks with the province's ethnic Albanian negotiators today amid
reports of a new clash between rebels and Yugoslav army guards.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, whose proposals for a political
settlement for Kosovo have been rejected by both sides, met with
negotiators in Pristina and planned to travel to Belgrade on
Tuesday for more talks with Serbian government authorities.
	   The political process appears stalled despite weeks of shuttle
diplomacy by Hill, who is trying to head off a feared resumption of
fighting between ethnic Albanian rebels and Serb forces in the
spring.
	   Hill's visit came amid Serbian reports that Kosovo Albanian
rebels and Yugoslav border guards clashed early today. An
unspecified number of rebels were reported killed and injured in
the five-hour clash near the southwestern town of Prizren.
	   The fighting began when a large group of armed Albanians tried
to illegally cross the border from Albania, the pro-government Serb
Media Center in Kosovo said. It said there no casualties among
government troops.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels, who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence, have frequently armed themselves in neighboring
Albania.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and an estimated 300,000 left
homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown against separatist rebels last February. Despite an
October truce, there have been dozens of deaths reported in the
past two months.
	   Meanwhile, a delegation of Kosovo's Serbs arrived in Pristina to
plead with international peace monitors to find their relatives who
went missing five months ago.
	   About 50 Serbs met with Gabriel Keller, deputy head of the
2,000-strong peace mission led by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   Keller received a list of the missing people whom the Serbs
believe were kidnapped by the KLA rebels, and promised that the
OSCE would ``try its best to find traces of the missing.''
	   ``We condemn violations of human rights on whatever side they
happen and we will support the efforts to find your relatives,''
Keller said.

 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Throwing open a decade-long debate about a
Holocaust memorial in Berlin, the German government Monday proposed
scrapping plans for a giant sculpture and building a Holocaust
museum, research center and park instead.
	   Culture minister Michael Naumann told Berlin's Tagesspiegel
newspaper that the new concept he is working on would be aimed
chiefly at educating young people about the Holocaust rather than
erecting a ``landscape of stone.''
	   In contrast, a memorial lacking in educational value would
signal ``a symbolic ending'' to German efforts to keep alive the
memory of a ``historically unique crime,'' Naumann told reporters
in Bonn.
	   He said Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder backs the initiative, which
would require a new design competition.
	   Naumann said he wants to cooperate with Holocaust museums in
Washington and Jerusalem and with the Leo Baeck Institute in New
York in setting up a Holocaust library and genocide research center
in Berlin as well as an educational museum.
	   He said the project could be financed by selling a third of the
two-hectare (five-acre) site that was donated for the memorial by
the federal government under former chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Naumann called the empty plot, near the Brandenburg Gate in the
heart of Berlin, ``oversized anyway.'' The Tagesspiegel said it was
worth at least 150 million marks (dlrs 90 million).
	   The Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington and the Yad Vashem
memorial in Jerusalem already have offered to help with the museum,
Naumann said.
	   He indicated that Steven Spielberg's archive of filmed
interviews of Holocaust survivors is not part of the project,
despite an offer by the film director to contribute it.
	   Germany has been debating plans for a national Holocaust
memorial for 10 years, with politicians and intellectuals arguing
over whether a single, giant sculpture could adequately represent
an atrocity so sweeping and horrific. Six million Jews were killed
in the Holocaust.
	   The leading design had been a cemetery-like field of 2,700
concrete pillars designed by U.S. architect Peter Eisenman.
	   Kohl was the project's biggest backer. But Schroeder, a Social
Democrat who defeated Kohl in September elections, has expressed
doubts about the monument and plans to have parliament decide how
to proceed next year.
	   Naumann said he plans to meet Eisenman in Berlin on Saturday to
try to enlist him for the museum project.

Sion bid leader invites IOC to examine books
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Olympics-IOC Bribes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The chairman of Sion's 2006 Winter
Olympics bid on Monday invited the International Olympic Committee
to examine the accounts of both the current Sion bid and its
unsuccessful attempt for the 2002 Games.
	   The Sion 2006 candidacy ``strives for full transparency and fair
play,'' said a statement from the Swiss defense ministry, headed by
Sion chairman Adolf Ogi.
	   Ogi's move follows bribery allegations which set off the biggest
corruption scandal in IOC history, prompting the IOC to set up a
top-level investigation into alleged misconduct.
	   Swiss IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said Salt Lake
City, which beat Sion for the 2002 Winter Games in a landslide vote
in 1995 balloting, had been ``blackmailed'' during its successful
bid.
	   Hodler on Saturday alleged that four ``agents'' _ including one
IOC member _ had been involved in vote-buying over the past 10
years.
	   He cited supposed irregularities in the elections of at least
four Olympic cities _ Atlanta; Nagano, Japan; Sydney, Australia,
and Salt Lake.
	   The decision on a venue for 2006 will be taken in Seoul, South
Korea, in June.
	   The books for both Sion bids have been checked by an independent
Valais canton (state) inspectorate, the Swiss statement said.
	   Ogi ``takes note with satisfaction'' of the setting up of a
panel of inquiry and hopes it will quickly lead to an improvement
in the procedure for awarding future Games, it added.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ India scored twice in four minutes to
upset South Korea 2-1 and finish the preliminary rounds of the
Asian Games men's field hockey tournament as the only unbeaten team
Monday.
	   The win meant India avoided a semifinal match-up against fierce
rival Pakistan.
	   India led 2-0 at the break through Baljit Singh Dhillon and
Mukesh Kumar and held on after Keon Wook-Kang got a goal back on 50
minutes.
	   The victory left India with perfect record after four games in
Pool B and put it in a semifinal against Japan, which came second
in Pool A.
	   Pakistan had three wins and a 1-1 tie against Japan Monday to
lead Pool A and will meet South Korea, the defending champion, in
the semis.

Royal Dutch-Shell to sell off 40 percent of chemicals 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Royal Dutch-Shell Group announced Monday that
it will sell off 40 percent of its chemical business as part of a
sweeping restructuring.
	   Shell said it expected earnings to be reduced by dlrs 4.5
billion after taxes in the fourth quarter, but that its
cost-cutting strategy would bring savings of dlrs 2.5 billion a
year by 2001.
	   The company warned of a ``testing'' environment for oil, and
estimated that the long-term average for Brent crude would be dlrs
14 a barrel compared with last year's forecast of dlrs 18.
	   It said the earnings reduction was due to reduced assets,
reorganization costs and redundancy provisions. Regional closures
announced in the last few months have seen 6,000 Shell jobs
earmarked for the ax.
	   Reaction was muted on the stock exchange, with shares dipping
slightly immediately after the announcement.
	   ``We have had to make tough choices,'' Shell chairman Mark
Moody-Stuart said. ``But although we have made some very big cuts,
with an dlrs 11 billion global spending program, we still have
plenty of room for growth ... and remain ahead of the
competition.''
	   Like other oil groups, Shell has been hit by a double blow of
12-year lows in the price of oil and falling demand in crisis-hit
Asia.
	   The group said Thursday that it has restructured its management
ranks, giving more responsibility to the heads of the company's
five business divisions in an effort to ensure it suffers less in
the troubled oil market.
	   Moody-Stuart said the restructuring should result in a much
greater degree of executive accountability at all levels. Executive
structures will be streamlined to ensure decisions are reached more
rapidly and effectively, he said.
	   ``Shell has been somewhat behind its rivals in cutting costs. It
has a famously bureaucratic management structure,'' said Jim
Wood-Smith, head of research at stockbrokers Greig Middleton,
before Shell's announcement. ``This means there is plenty of room
for efficiencies and job cuts are inevitable.''
	   The group already has announced the likely closure of its Shell
Haven refinery in Britain, which producers 92,000 barrels a day.
	   Industry experts have said 15 percent of the production capacity
in Europe's refineries needs to be cut to bring stability to the
market.

Saudi king urges balance in oil market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's King Fahd said Monday
his country wants to bring balance to the world oil markets through
cooperation by members and non-members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
	   In remarks made at the weekly Cabinet meeting and carried by the
official Saudi Press Agency, Fahd underscored the ``frank''
comments made at last week's Gulf Cooperation Council summit by his
heir apparent, Crown Prince Abdullah.
	   Fahd's brief statement Monday didn't elaborate beyond backing
his half-brother's statements at the GCC meeting.
	   Abdullah said at that meeting last week that oil producers
shouldn't hesitate to act again to restore balance to the crude
markets.
	   The GCC responded by extending recent production cuts by six
months through the end of 1999. The GCC consists of Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.
	   OPEC and non-OPEC producers earlier this year jointly pledged to
remove more than 3.1 million barrels a day from world markets. But
oil prices are below dlrs 10 a barrel, after running at about dlrs
18 a barrel a year ago.
	   Abdullah also had warned that the oil ``boom days are gone and
will never come back to the region.
	   ``We should not stand idle while watching the main source of our
revenues subjected to this big shake-up,'' he said.
	   OPEC's basket of seven crude oils, which it uses to gauge the
market, was priced at dlrs 9.26 a barrel Friday, up from dlrs 9.13
per barrel on Thursday.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrea has set no time limit on finding
a peaceful solution to its border dispute with Ethiopia, a senior
government official said Monday.
	   Presidential adviser Yemane Gebremeskel said Eritrea has a
serious commitment to talks later this week in Burkina Faso aimed
at reaching a brokered solution to the seven-month conflict.
	   The two formerly close allies came to blows in May over
undemarcated colonial boundaries. Although no heavy fighting has
taken place since June, both sides continue to reinforce their
1,000-kilometer (620-mile) common border.
	   The central organ of the Organization of African Unity is
scheduled to discuss the Ethio-Eritrean conflict on Thursday and
Friday in the Burkinabe capital, Ouagadougou.
	   President Isaias Afwerki, Foreign Minister Haile Weldensae and
other senior Eritrean officials are expected to attend.
	   OAU Secretary General Salim A. Salim visited Asmara Saturday for
consultations and clarification of Eritrea's view on an OAU peace
plan put forward in November at the last meeting in Ouagadougu.
	   Ethiopia has accepted the proposals, but Eritrea rejects the
points calling for withdrawal of Eritrean forces from territory
occupied after May and the return of an Ethiopian administration to
the contested Badime area.
	   U.S. special envoy Anthony Lake is also expected to return to
the region for the fourth time in an ongoing attempt to reach a
settlement agreeable to both sides. Gebremeskel said he didn't know
the date of Lake's next visit.
	   The OAU central organ is a 16-nation committee charged with
conflict prevention and resolution. Other issues on the agenda are
the four-month civil war in Congo, sanctions against Burundi and
political violence in the Comoros.

REPEATING TO RESTORE AP DESIGNATOR

 &UR; Reality jolts dreams of early entry for EU candidate states &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland and other EU candidate nations went
to last weekend's European Union summit in Vienna to find out when
they could join up.
	   They came back with a simple, stark political truth _ no one is
quite ready to cough up the money needed to expand Europe across
former ideological and battle lines.
	   The 15-member EU decided to put off until March any decisions on
accepting a handful of new members that would broaden its territory
from the Atlantic to the Ukraine.
	   That sparked frustration among some leaders who wanted a set
timetable for the wide-ranging reforms and negotiations required.
	   ``On one side, the EU demands that we adjust our legislation to
the European urgently, while on the other side, there are
tendencies to slow down the enlargement process,'' complained
Slovenian Premier Janez Drnovsek.
	   Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said overhauling the economy
and other sectors must have a tangible, realistic deadline for
those undergoing the changes.
	   ``To keep dynamics of these changes, we need specific dates,''
he said.
	   Some newspapers in central and eastern Europe portrayed the EU
as stingy, with headlines such as ``Viennese `Summit of Misers'
causes disappointment'' in Hungary's center-left Nepszabadsag daily
newspaper.
	   But Buzek and others noted that nobody at the EU summit tried to
rule out expansion. The problem involved when to do it, rather than
why, they said.
	   Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, all planning to join
NATO next year, are the top EU candidates along with Cyprus, the
former Yugoslav republic Slovenia and the former Soviet republic
Estonia. Others lining up include Romania, Slovakia, Latvia,
Lithuania and Bulgaria.
	   Before any enlargement, the EU must overhaul its annual dlrs 100
billion budget, more than 80 percent of which is spent on subsidies
for farmers and aid for poorer EU regions.
	   If left unchanged, those costs will skyrocket when the
easterners join. Poland alone has 4 million farmers, more than half
the number in the whole of the current EU. All the central and
eastern European candidates are poorer than the poorest EU member _
Greece.
	   The EU summit decided it would adopt its reform plan _ called
Agenda 2000 _ at its March meeting in Brussels. After that, it
could start working out specific dates for expansion.
	   But fears remain that the shifting landscape of European
politics, such as Germany's move to the center-left this year,
could mean a new anti-expansion policy in the EU.
	   Germany was a main supporter of expansion under former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Its new chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, made
clear in Vienna he opposed raising Germany's already substantial
contribution to the EU budget.
	   Meanwhile, smaller, poorer members who believe the newcomers
will reduce their share of the pot, proposed increasing the EU
budget by dlrs 24 billion in the next seven years.
	   ``A generational change has occurred in German politics after
the last elections and it has its consequences,'' Polish Foreign
Minister Bronislaw Geremek said in an interview published Monday in
Gazeta Wyborcza, Poland's largest-circulation daily. ``I hope it
does not mean by any chance a change in Germany's foreign policy
but only practice will show that.''
	   Some candidates speak of formal membership by 2002, while EU
members tack on a couple of years. Poland and the other leading
contenders already have submitted detailed proposals on reforming
key segments of society and the economy to meet EU standards.
	   Buzek, the Polish prime minister, suggested putting off the
money issue while settling on who would join when.
	   ``We are of course interested in funds which would facilitate
Poland's adjustment to the European rules of the game,'' he said.
``But we would not like it if prolonging discussions of donations
to the EU's budget postpones our membership.''

Sri Lanka wins first Asian Games golds in 24 years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hong Kong late gold &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's Koji Ito rebounded from a slow
start to claim honors Monday as Asia's fastest man, and looked on
the bright side of not joining the exclusive club of sprinters
faster than 10 seconds.
	   ``At least I excited everyone,'' he said after winning the 100
meters in 10.05. He had raised hopes by setting an Asian record of
10.00 in Sunday's semifinals.
	   Sri Lanka's Susantika Jayasinghe, favored in the women's 100,
didn't start at all. After pulling a hamstring in Sunday's
semifinals, she went home Monday.
	   ``This morning we took her to the clinic and it was apparent
that she cannot run. She wanted to go back home as soon as
possible,'' said Sri Lankan team chief Maya Gunasekhara.
	   Other runners gave Sri Lanka its first two Asian Games gold
medals in 24 years _ within less than an hour.
	   But Asia's co-hosts for the 2002 World Cup soccer finals _ South
Korea and Japan _ suffered the embarrassment of not reaching the
Asian Games semifinals. Japan went out in the second round, and
Thailand upset South Korea in the quarterfinals Monday, 2-1, on
Thatwachai Damrong-Ongtrakul's 40-meter goal six minutes into extra
time, when the Thais were down to nine men.
	   Iran joined the Thais in the semifinals with an easy 4-0 victory
over Uzbekistan. Bayern Munich star Ali Daei scored three goals
within seven minutes in the second half.
	   In other quarterfinals, China beat Turkmenistan 3-0 and Kuwait
defeated Qatar in a penalty shootout 3-1 after 150 minutes of
scoreless play. In the semifinals Wednesday, China meets Iran and
Thailand takes on Kuwait.
	   On the track, Ito was the slowest of the eight finalists out of
the blocks, costing him any chance of becoming the first non-black
athlete to crack 10 seconds for the 100.
	   Thailand's Seeharwong Reanchai edged Japan's Yasukatsu Otsuki
for the silver medal in a photo finish after both clocked 10.31.
	   With Jayasinghe gone in the women's 100, China's Asian record
holder Li Xuemei won in a wind-aided 11.05 seconds, ahead of
teammate Li Yali. Li Xuemei said she hardly slept overnight because
of diarrhea and a fever.
	   Sri Lankans won both the men's and women's 400 meters.
	   Damayanthi Darsha won the women's in 51.57 seconds, comfortably
ahead of China's Chen Yuxiang, who struggled to a 52.50 finish.
P.T. Usha, India's star before retiring eight years ago, finished
sixth in 54.37 in a return to the track.
	   In the next race, Sugath Tillekeratne held off Qatar's Ibrahim
Faraj in the men's 400, winning 44.99 to 45.32.
	   ``This is the first time that Sri Lanka has won a gold medal in
24 years,'' Darsha said. ``I am extremely happy, not only because I
have won the gold but it was my coach who had won the last gold in
1974.''
	   Coach Sunil Gumawardeme was a member of the 1974 winning
4x100-meter relay team.
	   Aside from Li's victory in the women's 100, China had golds in
the women's 10-kilometer walk, by Liu Hongyu; the men's shot put,
by Liu Hao, and the heptathlon, where Shen Shengfei amassed 5,817
points for the seven events. Kazakstan's Svetlana Kazanina was
second at 5,775.
	   That and a victory in mixed doubles table tennis boosted its
total for the games to 84 golds.
	   For the second consecutive day, South Korea was the biggest
winner, piling up seven golds and lifting its total to 43. The
Koreans won three in Greco-Roman wrestling, one in women's team
foil fencing and one in weightlifting. In addition, Lee Yong-sun
won the women's javelin event and cyclist Ji Sung-hwan beat Olympic
bronze medalist Takanobu Jumonji of Japan in the men's 1-kilometer
time trial.
	   Japan had 34, gaining gold Monday from Ito, women's 10,000-meter
winner Yuko Kawakami, and Miya Tachibana, who won the solo
synchronized swimming.
	   India and Qatar won their first golds of these games, in the
women's and men's 1,500-meter races.
	   India's Jyotirmoy Sikdhar outsprinted China's Wang Qingfen to
win the women's 1,500.
	   Organizers angered jeering Indian fans by playing the wrong
anthem at Sikdhar's medal ceremony, so 10 minutes later they
brought the medalists out and played the right anthem.
	   Qatar's Mohamad Taib won the men's 1,500 for the third
successive games. He slowed down near the end, waving his rivals
closer, then turned around and made a rude gesture down the track.
	   Hong Kong won two golds Monday, lifting its total to three. Its
snooker team beat Thailand for one, and it gained another when Hui
Cheung-kwok emerged the winner in men's masters bowling
competition. Taiwan's Chou Miao-lin was the women's winner,
boosting her nation's total to 15 golds.
	   Even before their soccer upset, the Thais, who take numbers
seriously were celebrating winning their 13th gold medal of the
13th Asian Games on Sunday _ Dec. 13.
	   Their original target had been 10 golds at their home games.
Their best previous was 12 at the 1966 games in Bangkok.

Ukrainian court sentences four teen-age girls for extortion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian court on Monday sentenced four
15-year-old girls to prison after accusing them of extorting
jewelry from other girls by intimidating them.
	   Kiev's Leningradsky district court sentenced Olga Arzamastseva
and Kateryna Glibova to four and a half years in a juvenile prison,
while Tetiana Orikhova and Yulia Torshenko were given three and a
half years.
	   The court convicted the four girls of robbing four other
teen-age girls of their earrings and rings on one day in June. The
girls then sold the jewelry to buy tickets for a merry-go-round.
	   The girls stopped each of their victims on the street, took her
to a remote place, and then produced a knife and demanded the
jewelry, threatening to unleash a bull terrier they were walking
with.
	   The girls' lawyers said they would appeal, arguing that such a
long term in prison should be reserved for more severe crimes.
	   Although the four girls' parents immediately compensated the
victims for the losses, police decided to launch an investigation.

EU farm ministers clear last major hurdle to approve Russian food
</HEADLINE>
aid &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union farm ministers on Monday
cleared the last major political obstacle before a dlrs 460 million
food aid program for Russia can be adopted, raising hopes the first
aid might reach the needy by the end of next month, officials said.
	   ``The ministers have unanimously endorsed the program,'' said EU
Commission spokesman Gerry Kiely, after the EU executive hammered
home the need for strict monitoring to make sure the aid does not
end up in the hands of profiteers.
	   ``We have a high risk there,'' EU Farm Commissioner Franz
Fischler told the regular monthly meeting of farm ministers.
	   Under the current program, the 15 EU member nations, the
Commission and the European Parliament will share responsibility to
make sure the food reaches the needy.
	   There will be monthly reports from Russia, the EU's Court of
Auditors will be allowed to inspect the distribution of the aid in
Russia itself and the local governors will be handed detailed lists
of what should be coming their way, Kiely said.
	   The aid package includes hundreds of millions of tons of grain,
beef, milk powder and other foodstuffs for a total of about 400
million European currency units.

Council stood with raised hands before U.S. President Bill Clinton

the destruction of Israel.

13 Egyptian policemen to be probed in landmark abuse-of-power case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The police found a girl's body. Soon they
found a suspect. Then they got a confession, and the man was sent
to trial _ on the charge of murdering his missing 9-year-old
daughter.
	   As it turned out, the confession was beaten out of the man, his
daughter was found alive and the body that the police had
discovered was another young girl's, a judge ruled Sunday. A copy
of his written decision was released Monday.
	   Judge Mohammed Ezzat Agwah threw out the murder charge and
ordered an investigation into the conduct of 13 police officers
accused of using force to extract false confession, framing a
suspect and detaining other people illegally.
	   ``The court sees that the punishment of these officers should be
severe so that such an incident is not repeated,'' Agwah, head of
the Criminal Court in the northern city of Alexandria, said.
	   The case is another blow to the human rights record of Egyptian
police. It comes after civil rights groups accused police of
arresting and torturing hundreds of Coptic Christians in the
southern village of el-Kusheh to extract a murder confession in
August. The government denies any widespread abuse in el-Kusheh.
	   The ruling by Agwah is a landmark in Egypt where police misdeeds
are largely ignored and rarely brought to trial, let alone
punished. Agwah rebuked the police officers for not heeding ``God
or their conscience.''
	   The case revolves around Mohammed Badreddin, 34, who was
arrested in Alexandria in September 1996 following the discovery of
the body of a girl about nine years of age.
	   Police had received a complaint from Badreddin's ex-wife that
their daughter, Jehad, was missing and that she suspected
Badreddin, according to court records.
	   Neither parent was asked by the police to identify the body.
Instead, investigators assumed the body was that of Jehad, who used
to live alternately with the two parents, and arrested Badreddin.
	   Meanwhile, Jehad turned up at her mother's house, saying she got
lost after running away from her father's home because of
ill-treatment by Badreddin's new wife.
	   The mother, Intissar Gad, 34, failed to tell police that Jehad
had returned. Badreddin languished in custody where he was beaten
until he confessed to the murder, according to evidence submitted
in Agwah's court. Badreddin's trial began in November 1996.
	   Earlier this year, Badreddin's lawyers discovered that Jehad was
with her mother. So did the police, and in a bid to cover up their
bungling, they bundled the two to the police station and detained
them illegally, hoping that Badreddin's trial in Agwah' court would
soon be over, court officials said quoting documents.
	   However, Badreddin's lawyers traced mother and daughter to the
police station. Agwah ordered a raid on the police station in June
and the two were rescued after 13 days in the lockup.
	   Sometime earlier, police had also charged Badreddin with
murdering the second girl. A different court found him guilty and
and sentenced him in August to 15 years in prison.
	   On Sunday, Agwah declared Badreddin innocent of murdering his
daughter as well as the other girl, saying the man's innocence was
``screaming'' to be recognized.
	   The investigation ordered by Agwah will cover all policemen
involved in the case, including those who arrested, interrogated
and wrote the reports.

Congo minister: African summit last chance for peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ This week's summit of African leaders in
Burkina Faso is the ``last chance'' Congo has to end its four-month
civil war, the Congolese foreign minister was quoted as saying
Monday.
	   If the summit fails to reach a settlement, the Congolese
government will use force to restore democracy in the vast central
African country, the minister, Jean-Charles Okoto Lolakombe, said
in an interview with Egypt's Middle East News Agency. He did not
elaborate.
	   The Congolese government is willing to negotiate with ``all
parties,'' said Lolakombe. He did not say if that included rebel
leaders.
	   Lolakombe was accompanying Congolese President Laurent Kabila on
a three-day trip visit to Egypt. They returned home Monday.
	   Kabila has so far refused to negotiate peace with the rebel
leaders, insisting on meeting only with their backers, Rwanda and
Uganda.
	   Sixteen of the 52 members of the Organization of African Unity
are meeting in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso Thursday and Friday to
discuss ways of ending the four-month civil war between the
Congolese government and rebel forces.
	   The rebels accuse Kabila, who forces are supported by Zimbabwe,
Angola, Chad and Namibia, of corruption and ethnic favoritism.
	   The Southern African Development Community had dominated a
series of negotiations since August to resolve the conflict but its
efforts have been criticized by both the rebels and the government.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The second-ranking diplomat at the
French embassy in Belgrade and two other embassy employees were
killed Monday in a car accident in Kosovo, a French official said.
	   Gerard Fauveau, the embassy's first counselor, was among those
killed when the black Renault he was riding in collided with a
passenger bus in Besinje, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of
the capital Pristina.
	   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry confirmed Fauveau's death
and identified one of the other victims as diplomat Richard
Berthaux. The third victim was not identified.
	   Police at the scene said there were no injuries among those on
the bus, which was tipped on its side in a ditch. The cause of the
crash was not immediately clear.
	   The car was apparently en route to Pristina from Belgrade.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Hillary Rodham Clinton got a
tumultuous welcome Monday in a Palestinian refugee camp, sitting in
on a class of young women learning their rights under Islamic law
and praising women who start their own small businesses to help
lift their families out of poverty.
	   ``Women's rights are human rights, and are as important here in
Gaza as anywhere else in the world,'' she told a group of aid
workers and refugees at the Shati camp in Gaza City.
	   In her speech, Mrs. Clinton skirted the sensitive subject of
Palestinian statehood by hailing Palestinians' ``hope and
determination'' and wishing them peace and prosperity in the 21st
century.
	   Hundreds of Palestinians, many of them schoolchildren clutching
small plastic American flags, lined the first lady's route to the
seaside camp, cheering as her motorcade passed by to a blare of
sirens. Security was extremely heavy, with Palestinian police,
intelligence agents and soldiers every few steps.
	   Under gray, foggy skies, veiled women and small children perched
on the rooftops of the camp's rows of cement-block hovels, waving
and hopping up and down in excitement as Mrs. Clinton and her
entourage passed by.
	   At a U.N.-funded women's job-training center on the edge of the
Shati camp, the first lady listened attentively as a law professor
lectured a group of two dozen young women on their legal rights
under sharia, or Islamic law.
	   The discussion turned to marriage-contract provisions, with the
young women learning they could include clauses to prohibit their
husbands from taking other wives, or giving them the option of
continuing to work after marriage.
	   ``Who enforces the contract?'' Mrs. Clinton inquired. An Islamic
court, she was told.
	   The students, all in headscarves and long robes, were demure but
clearly thrilled by her presence. ``We are proud of you,'' the
teacher told the first lady.
	   ``I congratulate you for learning ...and for teaching me about
rights,'' Mrs. Clinton responded, to a wave of giggles.
	   Women at the center gave her a black-and-gold embroidered cape
woven by a refugee seamstress using elaborate traditional designs.
She wore it for the rest of the visit.
	   Later, speaking to recipients of U.S.-funded loans used to start
businesses in Gaza's refugee camps, Mrs. Clinton praised women with
``small loans and big dreams'' for transforming the lives of their
families and communities, and announced the awarding of 10 such
loans for businesses like vegetable vending and dressmaking.
	   Flanked by Yasser Arafat's wife, Soha, the first lady alluded to
their husbands' efforts to implement the Wye River
land-for-security accord, pledging they would continue ``hard work
to achieve peace.''
	   ``We have the chance to pass down to our children a world of
peace,'' she said.
	   Craning her neck to catch a glimpse of the first lady as she
arrived, Rawia Abdel Wahad, 25, said she considered Mrs. Clinton an
important friend to Palestinians.
	   ``Visiting us here in our refugee camp, she gives us importance
_ and hope that our lives will get better after years of
suffering,'' she said.
	   Nearly three-quarters of the Gaza Strip's 1 million-plus people
are registered with the United Nations as refugees after losing
family homes in 1948 with the creation of Israel, and about half of
those live in the coastal strip's eight refugee camps.
	   Earlier in the day, Mrs. Clinton visited a center for
handicapped children founded by Mrs. Arafat, decorated with
American and Palestinian flags and a banner describing her as an
angel of mercy.
	   Accompanied by daughter Chelsea, Mrs. Clinton was welcomed by a
drum-and-bagpipes band of Palestinian boy and girl scouts in
sailor-style uniforms. ``When our headmaster told us we were going
to play for the first ladies, I didn't sleep. I'm still dreaming,''
said a 13-year-old girl named Falami. ``This might be the most
important day of my life.''
	   Mrs. Clinton later was headed to Shati, also called the beach
camp, a crumbling, crowded and poor refugee camp. Most of the
camp's roadways are dirt and sand.
	   The Beach Women's Program Center, which provides job training
and counseling for Palestinian women, also is a break from the
camp's otherwise grim environs, with cheerful murals and
whitewashed walls.
	   ``We are very happy that she is coming here to see with her own
eyes how people live in Gaza,'' said Lillian Tarazi, a social
service officer at the center. ``We want her to know about our
lives, that we need peace and our own state.''

Saudi king urges balance in oil market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's King Fahd said Monday
his country wants to bring balance to the world oil markets through
cooperation by members and non-members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
	   In remarks made at the weekly Cabinet meeting and carried by the
official Saudi Press Agency, Fahd underscored the ``frank''
comments made at last week's Gulf Cooperation Council summit by his
heir apparent, Crown Prince Abdullah.
	   Fahd's brief statement Monday didn't elaborate beyond backing
his half-brother's statements at the GCC meeting.
	   Abdullah said at that meeting last week that oil producers
shouldn't hesitate to act again to restore balance to the crude
markets.
	   The GCC responded by extending recent production cuts by six
months through the end of 1999. The GCC consists of Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.
	   OPEC and non-OPEC producers earlier this year jointly pledged to
remove more than 3.1 million barrels a day from world markets. But
oil prices are below dlrs 10 a barrel, after running at about dlrs
18 a barrel a year ago.
	   Abdullah also had warned that the oil ``boom days are gone and
will never come back to the region.
	   ``We should not stand idle while watching the main source of our
revenues subjected to this big shake-up,'' he said.
	   OPEC's basket of seven crude oils, which it uses to gauge the
market, was priced at dlrs 9.26 a barrel Friday, up from dlrs 9.13
per barrel on Thursday.

Clinton asserts right of Palestinians to 'their own land'

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian vote, Israeli reaction, new quotes
from Clinton, Arafat. &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ On the first visit of a U.S.
president to Palestinian territory, President Bill Clinton told
Palestinians Monday they are free to ``determine their own destiny
on their own land.''
	   He then witnessed a Palestine National Council vote annulling
parts of the Palestinian charter that deny Israel's right to exist.
Israel immediately accepted the vote as sufficient to end the
issue.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat declared that through Clinton
``peace will prevail in the Middle East.''
	   Clinton applauded Arafat for making bold moves toward peace with
Israel and said it was time to think harder about ways to cement
the peace and ensure a more prosperous future for all Palestinians.
	   ``For too many Palestinians, lives are hard, jobs are scarce,''
Clinton said in an address to the Palestine National Council after
its members voted nearly unanimously on the charter issue.
	   ``I know the way is often difficult and frustrating, but you
have come to this point through a commitment to peace and
negotiations,'' Clinton said. ``You reaffirmed that commitment
today. I believe it is the only way to fulfill the aspiration of
your people.''
	   Palestinians look to Clinton's visit for a morale boost in their
quest for an independent state.
	   ``Sometimes it takes more courage and more strength to make
peace than it does to continue war,'' Clinton said earlier in an
exchange of remarks with Arafat at a luncheon in his honor at a
Gaza City beach resort.
	   After a warm welcome from Arafat that included a giant American
flag draping the new Gaza airport's control tower, Clinton pledged
to help Palestinians create a society of tolerance, freedom and
prosperity.
	   He urged reconciliation with Israel as the only path to a
permanent peace.
	   ``For the first time in the history of the Palestinian movement,
the Palestinian people and their elected representatives now have a
chance to determine their own destiny on their own land,'' Clinton
said in an exchange of remarks with Arafat at a luncheon in his
honor at a Gaza City beach resort.
	   Clinton, who met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
in Jerusalem on Sunday, was in Gaza City to witness the landmark
vote and meet with Arafat.

Sestriere official denies bribes for 1997 Championships
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SESTRIERE, Italy (AP) _ The managing director of Sestriere Spa
on Monday assailed as ``false and unbelieveable'' allegations that
the Italian Alpine resort got votes to hold the 1997 World Ski
Championships following bribes offered by the Fiat group.
	   ``We neither traded nor purchased votes to host the
championships,'' said Giuseppe Alberto Zunino, who heads the
company which runs most tourist, real estate and sport activities
in the winter resort, which was founded by the Agnelli family of
auto tycoons.
	   The Agnellis are the owners of Fiat and hold interests in
Sestriere SpA.
	   Marc Hodler, an executive board member of the International
Olympic Committee and former head of the International Ski
Federation, charged Saturday that Fiat had influenced votes for
Sestriere by offering vans.
	   Holder's comments were part of a series of explosive accusations
in which he charged the Olympics selection process is riddled with
corruption, with agents demanding up to dlrs 1 million to deliver
votes.
	   Hodler's claims were corroborated by a former president of the
U.S. ski team.
	   Howard Peterson alleged he had been offered two Fiat cars before
the vote for the 1997 championships.
	   ``We are going to take legal action against those circulating
false reports about Sestriere,'' said Zunino, who was also managing
director of the Sestriere organizing committee in 1997.
	   Italian media suggested that the allegations about Sestriere
were intended to derail Turin's candidacy for the 2006 Winter
Olympics.
	   The Italian candidacy includes Sestriere as site for the Alpine
ski races during the Winter Games.
	   Meanwhile Didier Bonvin, head coach of the French ski team, said
he had no evidence to support claims against Sestriere but insisted
that ``gifts for influencing votes for the major sports events are
a common practice.''
	   Bonvin was in Sestriere with the team for a men's World Cup
night slalom.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Throwing open a decade-long debate about a
Holocaust memorial in Berlin, the German government Monday proposed
scrapping plans for a giant sculpture and building a Holocaust
museum, research center and park instead.
	   Culture minister Michael Naumann told Berlin's Tagesspiegel
newspaper that the new concept he is working on would be aimed
chiefly at educating young people about the Holocaust rather than
erecting a ``landscape of stone.''
	   In contrast, a memorial lacking in educational value would
signal ``a symbolic ending'' to German efforts to keep alive the
memory of a ``historically unique crime,'' Naumann told reporters
in Bonn.
	   He said Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder backs the initiative, which
would require a new design competition.
	   Naumann said he wants to cooperate with Holocaust museums in
Washington and Jerusalem and with the Leo Baeck Institute in New
York in setting up a Holocaust library and genocide research center
in Berlin as well as an educational museum.
	   He said the project could be financed by selling a third of the
two-hectare (five-acre) site that was donated for the memorial by
the federal government under former chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Naumann called the empty plot, near the Brandenburg Gate in the
heart of Berlin, ``oversized anyway.'' The Tagesspiegel said it was
worth at least 150 million marks (dlrs 90 million).
	   The Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington and the Yad Vashem
memorial in Jerusalem already have offered to help with the museum,
Naumann said.
	   He indicated that Steven Spielberg's archive of filmed
interviews of Holocaust survivors is not part of the project,
despite an offer by the film director to contribute it.
	   Germany has been debating plans for a national Holocaust
memorial for 10 years, with politicians and intellectuals arguing
over whether a single, giant sculpture could adequately represent
an atrocity so sweeping and horrific. Six million Jews were killed
in the Holocaust.
	   The leading design had been a cemetery-like field of 2,700
concrete pillars designed by U.S. architect Peter Eisenman.
	   Kohl was the project's biggest backer. But Schroeder, a Social
Democrat who defeated Kohl in September elections, has expressed
doubts about the monument and plans to have parliament decide how
to proceed next year.
	   Naumann said hopes to enlist Eisenman for the museum project
when the two meet Saturday in Berlin. Speaking from his office in
New York, Eisenman said he had too little information to comment on
the possible demise of his memorial design or whether he would
participate in a new competition for a museum.

Britain's National Grid to take over New England Electric System
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from morning news conference
in England; FIXES dateline; No Pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WESTBORO, Massachusetts (AP) _ In a deal valued at approximately
dlrs 3.2 billion, New England Electric System announced on Monday
that it has agreed to be taken over by National Grid, the English
and Welsh electricity operation.
	   In a news conference in London, National Grid chief executive
David Jones said NEES has a strong track record and provides an
excellent entry point into the American market, given the good
economic climate in New England and deregulation of utilities in
Massachusetts.
	   Jones said the merger gives NEES the necessary experience to
navigate deregulation, since National Grid had been through a
similar situation when utilities were privatized in United Kingdom
in the early 1990s.
	   ``We can transport the skills we have learned over the last
decade here in the U.K. into the U.S. environment,'' Jones said.
``This is about cutting costs (and) improving performances to
satisfy the regulator and customer ...''
	   The company officials said it was too early to elaborate on how
costs will be cut at NEES, which employs about 3,200.
	   NEES, Massachusetts' largest electricity provider, will become a
wholly owned subsidiary of National Grid, and it will retain its
name, as well its subsidiaries. Headquarters will remain in
Massachusetts.
	   National Grid, which operates a monopoly in England and Wales
with more than 3,100 miles of high voltage transmission lines, had
been looking to expand outside of Britain. Shareholders were told
last month that the company expected to complete a U.S. purchase by
March and it planned to generate at least 20 percent of its sales
from outside the highly regulated British industry within three
years.
	   Through its four utilities _ Massachusetts Electric,
Narragansett Electric, Granite State Electric and Nantucket
Electric _ New England Electric System provides electricity to more
than 1.3 million customers in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and
Rhode Island.
	   Rick Sergel, president and chief executive officer of NEES, said
the company was ``delighted'' by the transaction.
	   ``The market environment in the U.S. is clearly changing,'' he
said. ``Merging with National Grid will enable us to exploit the
opportunity.''
	   In a written statement, Sergel said customers will receive the
same service and same competitive rates.
	   ``The only difference is that we will have the resources of an
international leader behind us,'' he said.
	   On March 1, Massachusetts passed an electricity deregulation
law, which has created strong incentives for electric companies to
sell off their generating plants and related assets. Separating the
generation of electricity from its delivery is supposed to create
greater competition among utilities and lower rates for customers.
	   So far, the legislation has resulted in dlrs 3.9 billion worth
of New England utility acquisitions.
	   Massachusetts and California are the only two states with
comprehensive electricity deregulation plans.
	   The deal is still subject to regulator and shareholder approval.
	   The deal between National Grid and New England Electric follows
the announcement last week of ScottishPower's dlrs 7.9 billion
takeover of the U.S.' PacifiCorp, which serves seven Western
states.
	   If that acquisition goes ahead, it will be the first ever
purchase of a U.S. electric utility by a foreign company. The
combined company would have 7 million customers in Britain and the
United States with 23,500 employees worldwide.

Three farmers killed in cross-border SAfrican incident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOUNT FLETCHER, South Africa (AP) _ Three South African farmers
were killed and another two injured in a cross-border raid into
Lesotho that appeared to involve cattle rustling, police said
Monday.
	   The three bodies were retrieved from Lesotho, where it appeared
they clashed with the Lesotho army, said spokesman Capt. Bertie van
Litsenborgh in a telephone interview.
	   Police were investigating the incident in rough mountain
terrain, where they were out of communication range, van
Litsenborgh said.
	   He did not know why the South African farmers went into Lesotho,
but said the area has been plagued by cross border cattle rustling
for many years. He said several farmers were killed earlier this
year in similar incidents.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ One policeman was killed and another one
wounded Monday when a man accused of murder resisted arrest and
opened fire on the officers, state news agency ATA reported.
	   The incident happened in a small village near the northern town
of Kukes, when police were trying to arrest a man accused of a
killing a year ago.
	   When surrounded by police, the suspect started shooting, killing
one policeman and badly wounding another.
	   Police later arrested the assailant, identified as Din Katica,
50.
	   The victim was identified as Selim Halili, 35, while Ismail
Kovaci, 37 is in serious condition, treated at a local hospital,
ATA said.
	   This last victim brings to ninety the number of policemen killed
in Albania since January.
	   Despite the efforts of a newly appointed Socialist led coalition
government, public order remains far from established.

Srebrenica widows protest against Bosnian Serb court ruling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Some 100 Muslim widows from
Srebrenica on Monday protested the harsh sentences a Bosnian Serb
court imposed on three Srebrenica survivors convicted of murder.
	   The women, members of an association called ``The Mothers of
Srebrenica'' read a statement blaming their own government for
betraying the three men by recognizing the Bosnian Serb republic as
a legitimate government and by not doing enough to help the men.
	   They also accused the international agencies in Bosnia of
ignorance.
	   Protesting in front of the office of Carlos Westendorp, the top
international official in the country, the women urged Bosnians to
disregard the government and the international community until the
men are released.
	   ``Even if the Srebrenica men are released, the international
community has lost all credibility for even allowing these innocent
people to be where they are,'' the statement said.
	   The court Saturday sentenced three Muslims to a total of 51
years in prison for murder. Two were found guilty of three counts
of murder and sentenced to 20 years in prison each. The third was
given an 11-year sentence on one count of murder.
	   In a press conference Monday, the families of the three men,
Nedzad Hasic, Ahmo Harbas and Behudin Husic, announced they were
starting a hunger strike. The men began a hunger strike after they
were sentenced Saturday.
	   International officials in Bosnia condemned the court's
decision, and said the sentences were handed down despite lack of
evidence. They said they were unable to do anything else for the
three men.
	   The defendants had signed confessions that they had committed
the crimes, but said they were forced to do so.
	   Last year, the court sentenced each man to 20 years
imprisonment. But international officials overseeing the 1995
Dayton peace agreement demanded a retrial, calling the first
proceedings a sham.
	   The three men were part of a group of seven who escaped a
massacre thought to have killed thousands of Muslim men after
Bosnian Serbs captured the town of Srebrenica in July 1995.
	   They said they survived for months in the wild, and surrendered
when they spotted U.S. soldiers patrolling the former front line in
May 1996. The troops noted some of the men were wearing military
uniforms, carrying weapons and had recent haircuts, and handed them
over to Bosnian Serb police. They were held for a year before the
first trial opened.
	   The four other men, who were found guilty of illegal possession
of weapons at the 1997 trial, were not retried.
	   The Muslim-led government said it was ``shocked'' by the
sentences and said it will raise the issue at an international
conference on Bosnia currently meeting in Madrid.
	   Some of the protesters _ mainly women whose family members
disappeared after Srebrenica fell _ came with bags of stones,
intending to throw them at police if they tried to prevent the
demonstration.

Palestinians revoke anti-Israel clauses from charter

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In the presence of President Bill
Clinton, hundreds of top Palestinian officials, including former
guerrilla fighters, on Monday stood and raised hands to revoke
Palestinian charter calls for the destruction of Israel.
	   ``I hope this will close this chapter forever,'' Palistinian
leader Yasser Arafat said.
	   A senior adviser to Netanyahu said the show of hands was
acceptable.
	   ``The issue, as far as we are concerned, is now off the table,''
said David Bar-Illan said.
	   At Arafat's call, members of the Palestine National Council
voted by standing with their hands raised. The vote, which
Netanyahu had insisted on, was not counted, but officials called it
nearly unanimous.
	   Addressing the delegates, which also included members of other
Palestinian organizations, Arafat recited a litany of differences
with Israel, and renewed his call for a cessation of Israeli
settlements on the West Bank and the release of Palestinians from
Israeli jails.
	   ``We would like our sons and our boys to come back home,''
Arafat said. ``They are the ones who struggled for the peace
process since its inception.''
	   Israel has released 250 prisoners, but Netanyahu has said he
will not release killers or members of militant Islamic
organizations. Palestinians say all prisoners should be eligible
for release.
	   Arafat also declared that Palestinians ``will not go back to the
ways before peace,'' and would not ``allow or tolerate any
violence'' that threatens the security of either Israelis or
Palestinians.
	   The meeting of the 727-member council was one of the
requirements of the Wye River peace accord Clinton helped
negotiate. The accord says the delegates are to ``reaffirm'' a
letter that Arafat sent Clinton listing the clauses of the charter
that are considered null and void.
	   The delegates did just that.
	   ``This moment would have been inconceivable a decade ago,''
Clinton told the delegates after the vote. ``You have come to this
point through a commitment to peace and negotiations. You
reaffirmed that commitment today.''
	   Clinton and Arafat were given a standing ovation by the
delegates when they entered the Shawa Center in Gaza City.
	   However, it was not clear whether the PNC vote would pave the
way for an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank later this week.
Israel has demanded a delay of two or three weeks to review
Palestinian compliance on other issues.
	   Arafat renewed his call for a Palestinian state with a capital
in Jerusalem, a comment sure to invite a strong Israeli reaction.
	   In his remarks, Clinton said he would ask Congress next year for
``another several hundred million dollars'' to support development
for Palestinians.
	   ``All of this was made possible because of what you did, because
five years ago you made a choice for peace, because in all the
tough times since, when you had 100 good reasons to walk away, you
didn't,'' Clinton said.
	   Initially, confusion overshadowed the gathering. The
Palestinians left it open as to how they would vote, and many
delegates were uncertain of whether they were expected to raise
their hand, applaud or stand up.
	   In the end, they did all three.
	   In order to distinguish them from others in the audience, PNC
members were seated in a special section; Many of those opposed to
the charter change stayed away.
	   Others said the vote itself is secondary to the fact that they
are willing to make peace with Israel.
	   ``We are serious and willing to go ahead and achieve peace for
both Israel and the Palestinians,'' said Bassam Abu Sharif, who
trained Palestinian guerillas in the 1970s.
	   Faraj Siyam, an Arab-American who flew in from Leonia, New
Jersey for the session, said the vote would show the world ``that
we are committed to the agreement and that it is Israel that is
undermining the peace process.''
	   Arafat asked the delegates whether they support the peace
process and his letter to Clinton declaring that 28 of the 33
clauses written in 1964 either void or amended.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said despite the show of
hands, this should not be considered a formal vote.
	   Nabil Shaath, a minister in Arafat's Cabinet, said any vote
``will be based on a guarantee that we won't deal with this issue
any longer, that it will be gone and done with.''

Salt Lake City was victim of blackmail, Olympic official says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: longer version moving on sports wires &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Organizers of the Olympic Games in
Salt Lake City are not to blame for a bribery scandal that has
embarrassed the Olympic movement, but were victims of blackmail,
the Swiss official who made the allegations said Monday.
	   Marc Hodler, a senior International Olympic Committee official,
has accused Salt Lake City of funding a scholarship program to give
athletic training and academic aid to youngsters from developing
countries in order to win votes during its successful bid to host
the 2002 Winter Games.
	   At an emotional news conference Monday, Hodler said Salt Lake
City was not to blame for the alleged corruption.
	   ``For us, Salt Lake City was a victim of blackmail and not a
villain,'' he said. ``The real villains are the agents who put the
cities in awkward positions using blackmail. ... Salt Lake City had
been forced by blackmail to give financial favors.''
	   On Saturday, Hodler accused four ``agents'' _ including one IOC
member _ of involvement in vote-buying over the past 10 years. He
cited alleged irregularities in the selections of at least three
other Olympic cities _ Atlanta; Nagano, Japan, and Sydney,
Australia.
	   Hodler accused the Salt Lake bid committee of operating a fund
that provided nearly dlrs 400,000 in aid to 13 people, including
six relatives of IOC members.
	   Hodler said he decided to go public after a senior Swiss
government official asked him about ``rumors'' of misconduct and
wondered whether Hodler had been bribed to keep quiet.
	   Until now, there had only been rumors of bribery that could not
be documented, Hodler said, including complaints from previous
unsuccessful Olympic bidders like Manchester, England, and
Stockholm and Ostersund in Sweden.
	   But now there was written proof of corruption in the case of the
Salt Lake fund, Hodler said.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, appearing at the same news
conference, said the Olympic committee was investigating only the
Salt Lake City case because it was the only one with documented
evidence.
	   ``If there is other proof, we will open other cases,'' he said.
	   Samaranch said he was confident the IOC would survive the
scandal and promised to act quickly against any corrupt members.
	   On Sunday, Samaranch said the scandal could be the catalyst for
needed reform and changes in the way Olympic host cities are
selected to remove the risks of bribery.
	   ``If we have to clean (things up), we will,'' Samaranch said.
``If it is necessary, we will expel members. ... After, the IOC
will be even stronger than before.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav army troops killed at least
30 armed ethnic Albanians and wounded another 12 in border clashes
that lasted at least five hours Monday in the Serbian province, the
Serb-run Media Center reported.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center also reported
casualties from the clash but did not immediately say how many were
killed or injured. It said heavy detonations were heard from three
villages and police sealed them off.
	   The report of 30 deaths was the greatest single number of
casualties in two months since an informal truce halted combat in
the separatist province.

Poland wants to lease U.S. jet fighters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland is considering leasing as many as
36 U.S. jet fighters to bring its air force up to NATO standards,
the deputy defense minister said Monday.
	   Romuald Szeremietiew announced after meeting with U.S. Defense
Department officials he would ask the government to approve a
five-year lease of the F-16 or F-18 fighter aircraft at a cost of
dlrs 100 million.
	   The alternative, he said, was to buy planes that would cost dlrs
1.2 billion.
	   Capt. Andrzej Adamczyk, Szeremietiew's spokesman, said the cost
from the leasing option would involve training the pilots and
servicing the aircraft. He said U.S. officials guaranteed the
planes would be used by the U.S. military for at least 30 years.
	   Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary plan to join NATO next
year and must bring their militaries into conformance with NATO
standards before then.
	   They will be the first former Soviet bloc countries to join the
Western alliance.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav army troops killed at least
30 armed ethnic Albanians and wounded another 12 in border clashes
that lasted at least five hours Monday in the Serbian province, the
Serb-run Media Center reported.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center also reported
casualties from the clash but did not immediately say how many were
killed or injured. It said heavy detonations were heard from three
villages and that police sealed them off.
	   The report of 30 deaths was the greatest single number of
casualties in two months since an informal truce halted combat in
the separatist province.

<TEXT>
	   RIEHEN, Switzerland (AP) _ Almost unscathed after four weeks
under gray polyester, most of 178 trees wrapped by Christo and
Jeanne-Claude emerged from their covers Monday.
	   The public unwrapping operation in a Swiss museum park,
supervised by the husband-and-wife team's field manager, was
expected to last a week.
	   But by nightfall Monday, the unwrappers had dealt with
two-thirds of the exhibit, the Beyeler museum said in a statement.
Weather permitting, the operation will be finished Tuesday, it
added.
	   Local officials said the trees had suffered only minimal damage
under their woven polyester fabric covering.
	   The 55,000 square meters (461,000 square feet) of fabric and 23
kilometers (14 miles) of rope are to be recycled.
	   The exhibit has attracted some 300,000 visitors since it opened
last month, transforming this quiet suburb of the city of Basel.
	   Some 65,000 people visited the exhibit, which had been expected
to stay in place until late January, on its final weekend. The
artists last week announced it was being dismantled early for
artistic reasons.
	   ``With all our previous temporary works of art, the 14-day
duration of the project's exhibition had been an aesthetic
choice,'' they said.
	   Christo and Jeanne-Claude devised the concept after studying
gardeners draping fabric on trees against winter snow and frost in
Japan, but were rejected in previous attempts to realize it.
	   The Saint Louis Museum of Art in Missouri and the Museum of
Modern Art in New York turned them down in the 1960s. Paris nixed a
1969 bid to wrap the 330 trees along the Champs Elysees.
	   In 1995 they grabbed the global imagination with the sensational
wrapping of the Reichstag in Berlin.

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The young daughters of Palestinians
in Israeli jails pleaded tearfully Monday for U.S. President Bill
Clinton to pressure Israel to release their fathers.
	   The emotional appeal moved U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright to tears.
	   Clinton met with the four girls at the Gaza City headquarters of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The girls are hoping their
fathers can be released before the start of the Ramadan holiday
later this month.
	   ``Just like you like to spend the holidays with your kids, our
fathers would want to spend the holidays with their children,''
Sahar al-Jamala, 10, told Clinton.
	   Nihad Zakout, 11, handed Clinton a letter and asked: ``Would you
forget your own daughter?'' She then burst into tears.
	   ``No, not for one second,'' Clinton said, as Albright's eyes
welled up. He told the weeping girl, ``Your father will be very
proud of you.''
	   Nihad's father is serving a life sentence for killing an
Israeli. Sahar's father is serving a life sentence for killing a
Palestinian collaborator with Israel.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel would
fulfill its obligations under the Wye River accord by releasing 250
prisoners, mostly common criminals, but would not release killers
or members of militant Islamic organizations.
	   Palestinians say up to 900 of the 2,000 ``security prisoners''
are neither, and all prisoners should be eligible for release.
	   Sufian Abu Zayde, an Arafat advisor who helped arrange the
meeting, said the girls reminded him of the children he left behind
when he was imprisoned by Israel from 1981 to 1993 for shooting and
wounding a collaborator.
	   ``I sat for 12 years, and I also left such a kid behind,'' he
said.

Boating accident `rips heart out' of Tiny Scottish island
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new grafs 6-8 with quotes from survivor's mother,
changes overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FIONNPHORT, Mull (AP) _ The people of Iona, a tiny, windswept
Hebridean island with fewer than 100 residents, searched their
shores Monday in diminishing hope of finding survivors of a weekend
boat accident that claimed the life of one young man and left three
others missing.
	   ``It's been a desperate tragedy for the families and really a
shattering blow for the island as a whole,'' said Ray Michie, the
island's member of Parliament.
	   One body was found Sunday, hours after a dinghy carrying five
men from a dance on the neighboring island of Mull went down in
rough water.
	   Gordon Grant, 33, swam ashore and was reported in stable
condition in a hospital at Oban, on the northwest coast of mainland
Scotland.
	   Robert Hay, 23, was found dead on the shore, but by midday
Monday no trace had been found of Logie MacFadyen, 24, Alisdair
Dougal, 19, and David Kirkpatrick, 23.
	   ``I am the lucky one _ my son is the one who survived,'' said
Helen Grant. ``But you have to understand that I felt like a mother
to these other boys as well.''
	   ``These boys were the future for this island, and we have now
lost that,'' she said, holding back her tears. ``Those boys used to
run around these roads and have a good laugh together. They were
great friends and good people and this has ripped the heart out of
our already fragile community.''
	   Apart from ``the immediate heartbreak,'' Mrs. Michie said,
``Iona has a small community of less than 100 and to have lost four
of their fine young men who chose to live and work on the island,
it is a huge blow. But islanders are resilient folk and I know they
will recover over time.''
	   Linda Kirkwood, head teacher at Oban High School, which all five
men had attended, said, ``We are very concerned for the community
and we realize the devastation that's befallen them.
	   ``Usually, island communities lose their young people who go off
to the cities, but these lads decided to stay and live and work on
the island so this is a terrible blow for Iona,'' she said.
	   Just 3 miles (5 km) long and 1.5 miles (2.5 km) wide, Iona lies
about a half-mile ( less than 1 km) west of Mull, which in turn is
8 miles (13 km) west of the mainland.
	   For all its tiny size, Iona has a large place in history as the
birthplace of Christianity in Scotland and reputed burial place of
the first Scottish kings.
	   Irish missionary St. Columba landed on the island in the 6th
century and established an abbey from which missionaries were sent
far and wide.

Russia's Primakov calls for investments in `real economy'

possible loans, background. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The European Bank of Reconstruction and
Development could lend Russia dlrs 1 billion next year _ but not
until the country's forbidding business climate improves, the
bank's president said Monday.
	   Speaking at a Moscow conference that included visiting
executives from many large Western firms, Horst Koehler singled out
Russian banks as a looming problem, and said several should be
closed or more tightly controlled by the government.
	   The EBRD has been a big lender to Russia's beleaguered banks,
many of which were crushed by the August devaluation of the ruble
and default on treasury debt, two events that sparked the country's
economic crisis.
	   Koehler said the EBRD could lend Russia another dlrs 1 billion,
``but this is dependent on an improvement in business climate.'' He
did not say what sectors the money would target.
	   ``I am first of all interested in the banking sector,'' he said.
``Our concern is that there are too many insolvent banks that have
been allowed to continue operating.''
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who also spoke at
Monday's conference, said the Cabinet would ``do its best to
improve the investment climate'' _ but said the country needs
investment in factories and industry, not stock markets.
	   Russian leaders have complained that many foreign investors have
focused on liquid investments, such as stocks, that quickly
evaporated after Russia's financial markets collapsed in August.
	   ``There will be no isolation from the rest of the world,''
Primakov told the Consultative Council on Foreign Investments.
``Russia is interested in investments.''
	   Primakov said his government would like to see foreign money
directed more toward major industries that are ailing.
	   Many investors see Soviet-era industrial firms as too
inefficient and outdated to merit the large-scale investments that
would be required.
	   Also, Russian law has often frustrated foreign investors, such
as oil companies, which have established major projects only to see
them founder because of repeated bureaucratic delays.
	   ``Many production facilities are now idle in our country,'' said
First Vice Premier Yuri Maslyukov. ``We must give the green light
to large strategic investors into the economy of Russia.''
	   The EBRD has repeatedly cited Russian banks as a major problem
for the country's economy. Earlier this year, it released a report
saying that most of Russia's insolvent banks should be allowed to
fail.
	   Nevertheless, the EBRD has been an unusually forthcoming lender
to Russia. In November, despite Russia's latest economic crisis,
the bank agree to release the second tranche of a dlrs 100 million
loan to the city of St. Petersburg.
	   Russia's market collapse in August was part of the larger
meltdown that hit emerging markets worldwide. The Russian economy
is expected to contract about 5 percent this year, and to shrink
next year as well.
	   Russia's economic decline in the 1990s is one of the worst
depressions ever suffered by an industrialized nation.

New German Greens leader seeks liberal course
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Greens will seek to increase
their influence as the junior coalition partner with the Social
Democrats, the party's newly elected co-chairwoman said Monday.
	   A proposed law to make it easier for foreigners to become
Germans, seen as a way to promote integration, should be a priority
in the Greens' legislative agenda, Antje Radcke said on ZDF
television.
	   Radcke was elected at a weekend party convention in Leipzig,
making the Greens the first German party to be co-chaired by two
women. She replaced Juergen Trittin, who became environment
minister after the left's September election victory.
	   Delegates also launched a new council to give party leaders more
powers to direct the once loosely organized group. The policy
coordination body is designed to strengthen the Greens' role as
junior governing partner.
	   Some party left-wingers said the Greens needed to do still more
to set themselves apart from the dominant Social Democrats.
	   Delegates missed a chance to set a signal for higher energy
taxes beyond a first, relatively modest round of increases planned
for next year, lawmaker Christian Stroebele said in a newspaper
interview.
	   ``Such self-restraint can't go on forever,'' he told the Freie
Presse newspaper of Chemnitz.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ International Olympic Committee member
Gerhard Heiberg, who led the successful 1994 Lillehammer Winter
Games, told a Norwegian newspaper that offers of gifts and services
by cities seeking the games have become common.

newspaper Verdens Gang that he has been offered gifts and services
by cities bidding for the games.
	   ``It has happened several times, and each time I have reported
it directly to IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch, Heiberg was
quoted as telling the newspaper. ``This is about gifts and
services, not money directly.''
	   According to Verdens Gang, Heiberg, former president of the
Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee, refused to say which
cities were involved, or give any other details.
	   ``This, unfortunately, has become a part of the game. Everyone
on the IOC has experienced this,'' Heiberg was quoted as saying. He
also said he fully supported efforts to expose and exclude IOC
members who may have accepted bribes or sold votes.
	   Heiberg and former LOOC managing director Petter Roenningen both
said they never suspected any members of attempting to sell votes
to Lillehammer when it was bidding for the 1994 Winter Games, the
report said.
	   ``We never got that feeling. Nor were we ever contacted by
agents acting on behalf of IOC members,'' Roenningen was quoted as
saying.

	   Ethnic Albanian rebels, who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence, have frequently used illegal border routes to arm
themselves in neighboring Albania.
	   The Serb Media Center report said a group of armed Albanians was
trying to enter Kosovo illegally from Albania when the shootout
erupted at 2 a.m. (0100 GMT) near the border outposts of Gorozup
and Liken _ just west of Prizren and 75 kilometers (45 miles)
southwest of Pristina.
	   Yugoslav army guards confiscated a large quantity of arms and
equipment which the Albanians were trying to smuggle in, according
to the report, which could not be independently confirmed.
Municipal authorities in Prizren were quoted as saying all the
killed and wounded were wearing camouflage uniforms with the
insignia of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Eight Albanains were killed in a border clash near the same area
on Dec. 3.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said only that the
Albanian side suffered casualties.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and an estimated 300,000 left
homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown against separatist rebels last February. Despite an
October truce, there have been dozens of deaths reported in the
past two months.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ This week's summit of African leaders in
Burkina Faso is the ``last chance'' Congo has to end its four-month
civil war, the Congolese foreign minister was quoted as saying
Monday.
	   A failure of the summit would force the government to continue
fighting the rebels in the vast central African country, the
minister, Jean-Charles Okoto Lolakombe, said in an interview with
Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
	   ``If the summit fails, this will mean the continuation of the
war, and force will speak to enable the legitimate government to
restore democracy in the country,'' he said without elaborating.

Hong Kong takes team snooker gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Chan Wai Tat defeated Thailand's
Noppadon Noppachorn six games to five in the deciding match Monday,
giving Hong Kong the Asian Games gold medal in team snooker.
	   The seesaw 6 1/2-hour match came with the two teams tied at one
match each. Hong Kong ace Marco Fu had struggled to beat Thailand's
Phaithoon Phonbun 6-5, and Thailand's Chuchart Tirattanapradit beat
Chan Kwok Ming 6-0.
	   The final few minutes of the decider, a long match full of
safeties, saw both men make some misplays, but Chan Wai Tat kept
his cool despite a hometown crowd rooting against him.
	   In the battle for the bronze, Pakistan's team overcame Malaysia
by two matches to one.
	   The semifinals played earlier Monday saw Thai star James Wattana
falter yet again, losing to Malaysia's Sam Chong 5-2. Chuchart
replaced him in the Thai lineup for the final, and scored the day's
only shutout.
	   Chong, who scored Malaysia's only victory as it lost to Pakistan
for bronze, was sympathetic to Wattana's situation.
	   ``They give him too much pressure,'' said Chong, at 36 Monday's
oldest player. ``All the Thai people want him to get the gold
medal.''
	   Chong said the losses by Wattana and Fu, two heralded stars,
early in the singles competition gave more confidence to the
Malaysian players. Chong won the silver in the singles, and shared
the doubles gold with teammate Ooi Chin Kay.
	   Pakistan's bronze was clinched by Shokat Ali's 5-1 defeat of
Malaysian Ooi and Farhan Mirza's 5-3 win over Lean Kam-Beng-Ewin,
which made up for Chong's quick 5-2 victory over Mohammad Saleh.
	   Ali was the sole player to get a medal in singles, doubles and
the team event, snaring the singles gold, and taking the doubles
bronze in addition to the team bronze.

Rebel Kurdish leader calls on fighters to abandon armed struggle
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Seeking political credibility for his
guerrilla group, rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan has called on
his fighters to renounce their armed struggle and help him search
for a political solution to the Kurdish conflict.
	   Speaking to the London-based Kurdish television MED TV by
telephone late Sunday, Ocalan said a ``new era'' had begun for his
Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the PKK.
	   ``The Kurdish guerrillas have been fighting for 15 years but
this cannot continue like this anymore,'' Ocalan said. ``They
should give up their arms and they should go back to their homes.''
	   In another interview with Arabic daily Al Hayat, Ocalan also
appealed for joint action by Arab, Muslim and European countries to
find a peaceful solution.
	   Turkey considers Ocalan a terrorist and wants him extradited to
face trial at home. He was detained in Rome on Nov. 12, when he
flew in from Moscow.
	   Italy has refused to extradite him to Turkey where he could face
the death penalty and is considering the possibility of a trial in
Italy. There appeared to be little concrete European support for a
trial before an international tribunal.
	   In his interview with Al Hayat, Ocalan said he would welcome an
international court trial, saying it would be ``the proper place to
challenge the Turkish military regime's accusations.''
	   Nearly 37,000 people have been killed since the PKK launched an
armed campaign for autonomy in southeastern Turkey in 1984.
	   Ocalan, who has asked for political asylum in Italy, made clear
the PKK could revert to violence if political solutions fail.
	   ``If there is no way for a political solution, I say that the
solution only lies with the army, the guerrilla army,'' said
Ocalan.
	   Ocalan also said he was prepared to give up his position as
president of the rebel group.
	   ``He is giving up the daily running of the organization and
intends to be its spiritual and political leader,'' said Hikmet
Tabak, managing director of MED TV, which can be viewed in
southeast Turkey via satellite.
	   In a show of support for the leader, some 8,000 Kurdish
prisoners began a nationwide rotating hunger strike in Turkey
Monday, taking five-day turns in rejecting food.
	   But most Turks are angered at Italy's refusal to return Ocalan,
and thousands of companies and business groups have announced a
boycott of Italian products.
	   The government insists that the boycott is part of the Turkish
public's reaction, which it can't control.
	   But reports said Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, fearing
international reprisal, told state companies they could
discriminate against Italian firms but should avoid giving the
impression it was part of an official boycott.

Clinton asserts right of Palestinians to 'their own land'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, combines previous, edits throughout to tighten.
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ On the first visit of a U.S.
president to Palestinian territory, President Bill Clinton told
Palestinians Monday they are free to ``determine their own destiny
on their own land.''
	   He then witnessed a dramatic show of hands by Palestine National
Council members affirming revocation of Palestinian charter
provisions that deny Israel's right to exist. Israel immediately
accepted the unusual action as sufficient to end the issue.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat declared that through Clinton
``peace will prevail in the Middle East.''
	   Clinton applauded Arafat for making bold moves toward peace with
Israel and said it was time to think harder about ways to cement
the peace and ensure a more prosperous future for all Palestinians.
	   ``For too many Palestinians, lives are hard, jobs are scarce,''
Clinton said in an address to the Palestine National Council after
its members voted nearly unanimously on the charter issue.
	   ``I know the way is often difficult and frustrating, but you
have come to this point through a commitment to peace and
negotiations,'' Clinton said. ``You reaffirmed that commitment
today. I believe it is the only way to fulfill the aspiration of
your people.''
	   Palestinians look to Clinton's visit for a morale boost in their
quest for an independent state.
	   ``Sometimes it takes more courage and more strength to make
peace than it does to continue war,'' Clinton said earlier in an
exchange of remarks with Arafat at a luncheon in his honor at a
Gaza City beach resort.
	   After a warm welcome from Arafat that included a giant American
flag draping the new Gaza airport's control tower, Clinton pledged
to help Palestinians create a society of tolerance, freedom and
prosperity.
	   He urged reconciliation with Israel as the only path to a
permanent peace.
	   ``For the first time in the history of the Palestinian movement,
the Palestinian people and their elected representatives now have a
chance to determine their own destiny on their own land,'' Clinton
said in an exchange of remarks with Arafat at a luncheon in his
honor at a Gaza City beach resort.
	   Clinton, who met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
in Jerusalem on Sunday, was in Gaza City to witness the landmark
charter action and meet with Arafat.
	   Arafat heaped praise on the American president for helping pull
together the Wye River land-for-security agreement two months ago.
And he thanked him for inaugurating the new Gaza International
Airport, which he called a ``window on the world'' for
Palestinians.
	   ``You are also inaugurating another window for our people
towards freedom, peace and prosperity,'' Arafat said. ``This is a
window, a window for the peace of the brave, peace with our
neighbors.''
	   Clinton applauded Arafat for showing the ``strength, courage and
wisdom'' to make peace with Israel.
	   Despite Clinton's glowing words and hopeful tone, the accords
negotiated between Arafat and Netanyahu at Wye River have been
unraveling in recent weeks, and violence in the
Palestinian-controlled West Bank has been the worst in months.
	   `The way ahead may be hard and uncertain, but the way you left
behind is full of self-defeating violence and soul-withering
hate,'' Clinton said. ``So we have no choice but the way ahead.''
He said there is ``reason for hope,'' despite the frequent
obstacles to fashioning a permanent peace with the Jewish state.
	   Before their luncheon, Clinton and Arafat held talks at Arafat's
headquarters, appearing briefly before reporters and photographers
as they sat in overstuffed armchairs under a huge picture of
Jerusalem.
	   Clinton said of the Wye River accord, ``I'm committed to this
agreement. I'm hoping it will be implemented by both sides.
	   At the airport, in addition to the U.S. flag covering the entire
length of the control tower, smaller American and Palestinian
fluttered from lamp posts and buildings. Seemingly everywhere were
posters reading, ``We have a dream. Free Palestine.''
	   Banners strung along the airport access road read ``Welcome to
Palestine, Mr. Clinton'' and posters on walls in Gaza City
proclaimed: ``We have a dream. Free Palestine.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, accompanying
Clinton, called the trip to Gaza historic. ``It's a very important
sign of progress here in the peace process,'' she said. ``It's a
visible sign of what we accomplished in the Wye talks.''
	   For the nearly 3 million Palestinians who live on the West Bank
and in Gaza, the president's visit has symbolic significance,
beginning with his arrival by helicopter at their own international
airport at Rafah.
	   Arafat, other top officials of the Palestinian Authority and an
honor guard welcomed Clinton, while on the eastern edge of the
strip, U.S. Commerce Secretary William M. Daley was opening an
industrial zone.
	   Still, Clinton and his senior aides say their intention was not
to encourage Palestinian statehood aspirations, and the issue
remains to be considered in negotiations with Israel.
	   Clinton appealed to Palestinians Sunday in Jerusalem to prove
their peaceful intentions ``in word and deed.'' He also urged
Israel to acknowledge the ``legitimate expectations'' of their
longtime foes.
	   ``The violent past and the difficult present do not have to be
repeated forever,'' Clinton said,
	   In Jerusalem, Netanyahu assured Clinton that Israel was
``prepared to do our part,'' but he linked any further Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank to Arafat renouncing his plans to
declare statehood and taking steps to squelch violence.

Presidents of Ukraine, Turkmenistan to discuss gas supplies next
</HEADLINE>
week &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Kuchma and Niyazov to sign gas
agreement in 3rd graf, adds detail, edits to conform. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma will
travel to Turkmenistan next week for two days of talks with
President Saparmurat Niyazov focusing on gas supplies.
	   The leaders of the two former Soviet republics agreed during a
telephone conversation that they would meet in the Turkmen capital
Ashgabat on Dec. 23-24, Kuchma's press service said Monday.
	   Niyazov's press service told the Interfax news agency that the
two presidents are expected to sign an agreement on supplies of 15
billion cubic meters (525 billion cubic feet) of Turkmen gas to
Ukraine in 1999.
	   Ukrainian and Turkmen gas officials have been negotiating over
the past week on resuming gas supplies to Ukraine.
	   Supplies were suspended in March 1997 over Ukraine's mounting
gas debt, which Turkmen officials have estimated at between dlrs
600 million and dlrs 1 billion.
	   Ukraine wants to pay for the gas with commodities, while
Turkmenistan demands cash.
	   Ukraine, the world's sixth largest gas consumer, has since
pressed to resume gas supplies from Turkmenistan to lessen its
dependence on neighboring Russia, which covers about 70 percent of
Ukraine's gas needs.
	   Ukraine and Turkmenistan also have to negotiate with Russia's
gas giant Gazprom over transporting Turkmen gas to Ukraine through
Russia, the only available route.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Kuchma and Niyazov to sign gas
agreement in 3rd graf, adds detail, edits to conform. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma will
travel to Turkmenistan next week for two days of talks with
President Saparmurat Niyazov focusing on gas supplies.
	   The leaders of the two former Soviet republics agreed during a
telephone conversation that they would meet in the Turkmen capital
Ashgabat on Dec. 23-24, Kuchma's press service said Monday.
	   Niyazov's press service told the Interfax news agency that the
two presidents are expected to sign an agreement on supplies of 15
billion cubic meters (525 billion cubic feet) of Turkmen gas to
Ukraine in 1999.
	   Ukrainian and Turkmen gas officials have been negotiating over
the past week on resuming gas supplies to Ukraine.
	   Supplies were suspended in March 1997 over Ukraine's mounting
gas debt, which Turkmen officials have estimated at between dlrs
600 million and dlrs 1 billion.
	   Ukraine wants to pay for the gas with commodities, while
Turkmenistan demands cash.
	   Ukraine, the world's sixth largest gas consumer, has since
pressed to resume gas supplies from Turkmenistan to lessen its
dependence on neighboring Russia, which covers about 70 percent of
Ukraine's gas needs.
	   Ukraine and Turkmenistan also have to negotiate with Russia's
gas giant Gazprom over transporting Turkmen gas to Ukraine through
Russia, the only available route.

National Front leader Le Pen locks rival out of headquarters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-CLOUD, France (AP) _ Circling the wagons against an
attempted political coup, National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen
on Monday locked his archrival Bruno Megret and other party members
out of his headquarters.
	   Le Pen, besieged by calls within his own party to resign, was
holding a meeting of his political bureau in this western Paris
suburb when Megret, the party's No. 2 leader, arrived with his
supporters and a lawyer.
	   ``They forbade us to enter, and as it is out of the question for
us to practice violence, we decided to retreat,'' said Megret
supporter Serge Martinez, a former leading party official.
	   Megret avoided trying to force his way in ``so not to throw oil
on the fire,'' his aides said.
	   Jean-Yves Le Gallou, leader of the Front's caucus in the Paris
area Regional Council, said he and the other renegades were like
the late U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur: ``If they don't let us in, we
shall return!''
	   The Front mayor of the southern city of Marignane, Daniel
Simonpieri, said Le Pen, the party's charismatic founder, was
``listening to a court that is giving him some very bad advice.''
	   Simonpieri predicted Megret would assemble the required number
of signatures to force a special party congress, and he predicted
the meeting would take place Jan. 17 or 24.
	   The National Front, with its hard-line and anti-immigrant
policies, made strong gains in regional elections in spring and has
maintained about 15 percent support nationwide.
	   But a power struggle between Le Pen and Megret, ahead of next
spring's Europarliament elections, threatens to split the Front
apart.

PRISTINA: two months.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   There was no immediate comment from the Organization of Security
and Cooperation in Europe, which is assembling a force of 2,000
unarmed peace monitors in Kosovo.
	   OSCE verifiers were allowed access to the site later Monday, the
media center report said.
	   After the earlier border clash, the OSCE condemned all violence
and reiterated that both sides are to blame for the continuing
shooting incidents in Kosovo.
	   Efforts to forge a political settlement that would bring a
lasting peace to the province of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia, are stalled.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, whose proposals for a settlement on
Kosovo's future political status have been rejected by both sides,
resumed talks with ethnic Albanian negotiators Monday in Pristina.
He planned to travel to Belgrade on Tuesday for more talks with
Serbian government authorities.
	   Dozens of people have been killed since the Oct. 12 peace
agreement brokered by U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke. Many fear
full-scale fighting will resume in the next few weeks or months
unless there is a breakthrough in negotiations.
	   Ethnic Albanians insist on a political plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule, while Serbia refuses to give up
the predominantly ethnic Albanian province.
	   Meanwhile, a delegation of Kosovo's Serbs from the southwestern
region of Orahovac arrived in Pristina to plead with international
peace verifiers for their relatives and family members who went
missing five months ago.
	   About 50 Serbs met with Gabriel Keller, deputy head of the
2,000-strong peace mission led by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   Keller received a list of the missing people whom the Serbs
believe were kidnapped by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and
promised that the OSCE would ``try its best to find traces of the
missing.''
	   ``We condemn violations of human rights on whatever side they
happen and we will support the efforts to find your relatives,''
Keller said.
	   Separately Monday, the second-ranking diplomat at the French
embassy in Belgrade and two other embassy employees were killed
Monday in a car accident in Kosovo, French officials said.
	   Gerard Fauveau, the embassy's first counselor, was among those
killed when the black Renault he was riding in collided with a
passenger bus in Besinje, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of
Pristina.

Dugarry attracted to Juventus move
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Christophe Dugarry, the Marseille
striker linked with a move to Juventus of Turin, said Monday that
playing for the Italian giant ``would be a fascinating challenge.''
	   Juventus coach Marcello Lippi, who watched Dugarry score the
winning goal in a recent match against Lens, is looking for a
replacement for long-term injury victim Alessandro Del Piero.
	   Press reports have linked the Italian champion, languishing in
ninth place in Serie A, with the 26-year-old French international.
	   ``My experiences at AC Milan and Barcelona didn't go as I
wanted. Why not try a third experience abroad?'' Dugarry told
reporters. Playing for Juventus ``would be a fascinating
challenge,'' he said.
	   Marseille coach Rolland Courbis said that Juventus has not made
a bid for the player.

Sophie Marceau to star in new James Bond movie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French actress Sophie Marceau, who rose to stardom
as a lovesick teenager in ``La Boum,'' (The Party) has been chosen
to play the vixen in the next James Bond blockbuster starring
Pierce Brosnan, French media reported Monday.
	   According to the daily Le Parisien, Marceau, 32, edged out
Sharon Stone to become the fourth French actress to star in a James
Bond movie. She will play the role of the evil Electra.
	   Marceau, whose girlish face promotes the latest Guerlain
fragrance Champs-Elysees, has starred in a host of movies including
``Braveheart,'' ``Anna Karenina'' and most recently, ``Firelight.''
	   Le Parisien reported that Marceau signed her contract with MGM
studios last week, and filming is scheduled to begin next month.
	   Claudine Auger (``Thunderball''), Carole Bouquet (``For Your
Eyes Only'') and Corinne Clery (``Moonraker'') are the other three
French stars to make names for themselves in the arms 007.

	   Yugoslav army guards confiscated arms and other equipment that
the Albanians were trying to smuggle in, according to the Serb
Media Center report, which could not be independently confirmed.
	   Municipal authorities in nearby Prizren were quoted as saying
that all the killed and wounded were wearing camouflage uniforms
with the insignia of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. Eight
Albanians were killed in a border clash near the same area on Dec.
3.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said only that the
Albanian side suffered casualties.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and an estimated 300,000 left
homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown against separatist rebels last February. Despite an
October truce, there have been dozens of deaths in the past two
months.
	   Meanwhile, a delegation of Kosovo's Serbs arrived in Pristina to
plead with international peace monitors to find their relatives who
disappeared five months ago.
	   About 50 Serbs met with Gabriel Keller, deputy head of the
2,000-strong peace mission led by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   Keller received a list of the missing people whom the Serbs
believe were kidnapped by the KLA rebels, and promised that the
OSCE would ``try its best to find traces of the missing.''

Finns send winter clothes for 10,000 Russians in Murmansk area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ The Finnish Red Cross on Monday
dispatched winter clothes for some 10,000 people in the
northwestern Russian province of Murmansk, the organization said.
	   The 13-ton (14.3 short tons) shipment of clothes is for
pensioners, the unemployed, single-parent families and families
caring for their sick at home.
	   The Finnish Red Cross is also providing medicine, food and other
aid to hospitals, nurseries, schools and pensioners homes in the
Murmansk area and further south in Karelia near the Finnish border.
	   Later this month, the organization will send 6 tons (6.6 short
tons) of clothes to Karelia.
	   This year, Finland has pledged 8 million markkaa (dlrs 1.6
million) in emergency aid to help the needy across its eastern
border, channeled mostly through the Red Cross.
	   The government's decision to provide aid was prompted by
requests for food and medical supplies from officials in Vyborg and
Svetogorsk, towns in northwest Russia near the 1,270-kilometer
(790-mile) Finnish-Russian border.
	   In September, Murmansk provincial governor Yuri Yevdokimov also
appealed to Finland, Sweden and Norway for food supplies.
	   Last year, Finland gave 4 million markkaa (dlrs 770,000) in
humanitarian aid to Russians in Karelia and Murmansk.

Once counted out, Chirac is back on the offensive
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Less than two years ago, French President Jacques
Chirac looked like the ultimate loser.
	   Deprived of his parliamentary majority after a decision to call
early elections went horribly awry, he faced the prospect of five
years of ribbon-cuttings and ceremonial summits.
	   But almost as suddenly as he faded from public life, Chirac
appears to be back _ waving triumphantly beside German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, hobnobbing with Britain's Tony Blair at a
seaside summit, appearing engaged and energetic in a recent
televised speech.
	   ``Chirac has staged a remarkable recovery,'' said Florence
Haegel, a researcher at the Center for the Study of French
Political Life. ``His image hit rock bottom in 1997, but political
memory is very short.''
	   Chirac's Rally for the Republic party is also seen benefiting
from the bitter leadership struggle afflicting the far right.
	   Things are going so well for the president, in fact, that
commentators say he may call early presidential elections in 2000,
two years ahead of schedule.
	   The left-leaning daily Liberation on Monday trumpeted the
possibility : ``Chirac's Plan,'' read the front-page headline.
	   Chirac's spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, said the president had
no comment on the reports. ``For the moment, the president is doing
his job as president,'' Colonna said.
	   Chirac's last surprise call for early elections proved
disastrous.
	   In a giant miscalculation, Chirac called snap legislative
elections in 1997 in a bid to strengthen his position, only to see
his center-right majority swept away by a Socialist-led coalition.
	   It was two years into his seven-year term, and Chirac faded
quickly from the national scene, blamed by fellow rightists for
their downfall.
	   But opinion polls published last week show Chirac's popularity
soaring, boosted by squabbling and missteps in Jospin's coalition.
	   One survey, conducted by the IFOP agency, showed Chirac beating
Jospin in a presidential election with 53 percent of the vote.
	   Chirac's ratings started to rise noticeably over the summer _ as
did Jospin's _ after France's dramatic World Cup victory boosted
national morale.
	   But his more recent popularity surge may have more to do with
Jospin's misfortunes than with Chirac's own deeds.
	   Jospin has suffered from discord within his coalition over his
refusal to grant residency rights to some 64,000 illegal
immigrants. Most recently, he has faced opposition over a
controversial plan to broaden rights for same-sex couples as well
as a botched attempt to reform broadcast laws.
	   Chirac has seized the moment, appealing to public sentiment by
calling for a minimum service during train strikes, brokering a
truce between African leaders at a recent summit he hosted in
Paris, and enthusiastically welcoming human rights advocates last
week for a U.N. celebration.
	   Chirac may be successfully taking advantage of his so-called
``cohabitation'' with Jospin because he was once in a similar spot.
	   The late President Francois Mitterrand was forced to share power
with Chirac, then prime minister, when the Socialists lost
parliamentary elections in 1986. Despite that setback, Mitterrand
came back to defeat Chirac in presidential elections two years
later.
	   ``Presidents benefit when they can step away from the fray,''
said Romain Pache, of Louis Harris polls in Paris. ``They can let
the government take the blame for everything that goes wrong.''

UEFA medical committee backs joint effort with FIFA on doping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ UEFA's medical committee agreed Monday to propose
a joint meeting with FIFA in March to coordinate a ``determined
effort to keep drugs out of football.''
	   The proposal by chairman Michel D'Hooghe, who also chairs the
world governing body's committee for sports medicine, was approved
unanimously, UEFA said in a statement.
	   ``Although the 256 drug tests carried out during the 1998 World
Cup finals were all negative,'' UEFA said its committee ``has taken
note of recent developments and has agreed to take whatever
measures are necessary in the crusade to keep football clean.''
	   Italian soccer, in particular, has been rocked by doping
controversies this year. Magistrates launched an investigation into
alleged widespread doping in Serie A after allegations by Roma
coach Zdenek Zeman.
	   Admitting a growing doping problem in soccer, FIFA earlier this
month agreed in principle to introduce random out-of-competition
drug tests for players, but didn't decide when and how the controls
would take place.
	   However, FIFA's executive committee continued to defy attempts
by the International Olympic Committee to harmonize doping
sanctions.
	   FIFA has expressed reservations about the IOC's proposal for
minimum two-year suspensions for athletes found guilty of using
steroids or other serious drugs, with a life ban for a second
offense. It argues for flexibility on sanctions.

Media watchdog group warns: press freedom threatened
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEX BANDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Hungarian prime minister's hopes
for getting a government-friendly daily suffered a setback Monday,
when Swiss media baron Juerg Marquard announced he was not
interested in selling his paper.
	   The statement put to rest days of media speculation after Prime
Minister Viktor Orban told state-run radio Thursday that moves were
afoot to merge Magyar Hirlap (Hungarian Gazette) with Napi
Magyarorszag (Hungary Today). Napi Magyarorszag is owned by Mahir,
a company close to the government.
	   ``I do not intend to sell Magyar Hirlap,'' Marquard told
reporters after meeting with Mayor Gabor Demszky.
	   ``We are greatly relieved not having to become government
property; our greatest asset is our independence,'' Chief Editor
Ilona Kocsi told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
	   But no one expects this to be the end of such efforts.
	   Hungary's Glasnost Club, a media watchdog group, sounded an
alarm in a statement carried Monday in the daily Nepszabadsag.
	   ``Government statements of recent days are grounds for serious
concern regarding freedom of the press,'' the statement said,
adding that Orban and his chief of staff, Istvan Stumpf, have
indicated they ``want to interfere in the Hungarian media market,
using taxpayers' money.''
	   Marquard's Hungarian holdings include Magyar Hirlap, which was
the government mouthpiece during the communist era, and the tabloid
Mai Nap (Today).
	   Orban, who has a penchant for controversial announcements
without prior consultation, shocked the staff of Magyar Hirlap.
	   ``This was the first I had heard of it,'' Ilona Kocsi had told
journalists Thursday, adding she simply could not see how her paper
could be merged with the ultra-conservative Napi Magyarorszag.
	   ``It would mean the death of Magyar Hirlap,'' Kocsi said.
	   Orban has repeatedly said the ``imbalance in the media'' must be
rectified.
	   ``In the media there is an overbearance of one viewpoint,'' said
Stumpf, elaborating on the prime minister's words. ``We are aiming
at rectifying this.''
	   The government is displeased that the big dailies are
center-left and liberal and draw the most advertising revenue.
	   ``We want to create a chance for better competition,'' said
Stumpf. One idea he floated was giving the conservative papers
better access to government officials.
	   ``Positive discrimination is permissible,'' Stumpf argued,
adding it would last one or two years.

Palestinians revoke anti-Israel clauses from charter

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In the presence of President Bill
Clinton, hundreds of top Palestinian officials, including former
guerrilla fighters, on Monday stood and raised hands to affirm
revocation of Palestinian charter calls for the destruction of
Israel.
	   ``I hope this will close this chapter forever,'' Palistinian
leader Yasser Arafat said.
	   A senior adviser to Netanyahu said the show of hands was
acceptable.
	   ``The issue, as far as we are concerned, is now off the table,''
said David Bar-Illan said.
	   Clinton thanked delegates for rejecting the charter passages
``fully, finally and forever.''
	   ``By revoking them once and for all, you have sent, I say again,
a powerful message not to the government but to the people of
Israel,'' Clinton said.
	   At Arafat's call, members of the Palestine National Council
voted by standing with their hands raised. The vote, which
Netanyahu had insisted on, was not counted, but officials called it
nearly unanimous.
	   Addressing the delegates, which also included members of other
Palestinian organizations, Arafat recited a litany of differences
with Israel, and renewed his call for a cessation of Israeli
settlements on the West Bank and the release of Palestinians from
Israeli jails.
	   ``We would like our sons and our boys to come back home,''
Arafat said. ``They are the ones who struggled for the peace
process since its inception.''
	   Israel has released 250 prisoners, but Netanyahu has said he
will not release killers or members of militant Islamic
organizations. Palestinians say all prisoners should be eligible
for release.
	   Arafat also declared that Palestinians ``will not go back to the
ways before peace,'' and would not ``allow or tolerate any
violence'' that threatens the security of either Israelis or
Palestinians.
	   The meeting of the 727-member council was one of the
requirements of the Wye River peace accord Clinton helped
negotiate. The accord says the delegates are to ``reaffirm'' a
letter that Arafat sent Clinton listing the clauses of the charter
that are considered null and void.
	   The delegates did just that.
	   ``This moment would have been inconceivable a decade ago,''
Clinton told the delegates after the vote. ``You have come to this
point through a commitment to peace and negotiations. You
reaffirmed that commitment today.''
	   Clinton and Arafat were given a standing ovation by the
delegates when they entered the Shawa Center in Gaza City.
	   However, it was not clear whether the PNC vote would pave the
way for an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank later this week.
Israel has demanded a delay of two or three weeks to review
Palestinian compliance on other issues.
	   Arafat renewed his call for a Palestinian state with a capital
in Jerusalem, a comment sure to invite a strong Israeli reaction.
	   In his remarks, Clinton said he would ask Congress next year for
``another several hundred million dollars'' to support development
for Palestinians.
	   ``All of this was made possible because of what you did, because
five years ago you made a choice for peace, because in all the
tough times since, when you had 100 good reasons to walk away, you
didn't,'' Clinton said.
	   Initially, confusion overshadowed the gathering. The
Palestinians left it open as to how they would vote, and many
delegates were uncertain of whether they were expected to raise
their hand, applaud or stand up.
	   In the end, they did all three.
	   In order to distinguish them from others in the audience, PNC
members were seated in a special section; Many of those opposed to
the charter change stayed away.
	   Others said the vote itself is secondary to the fact that they
are willing to make peace with Israel.
	   ``We are serious and willing to go ahead and achieve peace for
both Israel and the Palestinians,'' said Bassam Abu Sharif, who
trained Palestinian guerillas in the 1970s.
	   Faraj Siyam, an Arab-American who flew in from Leonia, New
Jersey for the session, said the vote would show the world ``that
we are committed to the agreement and that it is Israel that is
undermining the peace process.''
	   Arafat asked the delegates whether they support the peace
process and his letter to Clinton declaring that 28 of the 33
clauses written in 1964 either void or amended.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said despite the show of
hands, this should not be considered a formal vote.
	   Nabil Shaath, a minister in Arafat's Cabinet, said any vote
``will be based on a guarantee that we won't deal with this issue
any longer, that it will be gone and done with.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav army troops killed at least
30 armed ethnic Albanians and wounded 12 others in border clashes
Monday in Kosovo, the Serb-run Media Center reported.
	   The report of 30 deaths in the five-hour clash was the greatest
single number of casualties since an informal truce in October
halted the fighting in the separatist province in southern Serbia.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center also reported
casualties from the clash but did not immediately say how many were
killed or injured. It said heavy detonations were heard from three
villages that had been sealed off by police.
	   The Serb Media Center report said a group of armed Albanians was
trying to enter Kosovo illegally from Albania when the shootout
erupted at 2 a.m. (0100 GMT) near the border outposts of Gorozup
and Liken, 70 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels, who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence, have frequently used illegal border routes to arm
themselves in neighboring Albania.
	   The clashes came as a U.S. envoy for Kosovo renewed talks Monday
with the province's ethnic Albanian negotiators.
	   Christopher Hill, whose proposals for a political settlement for
Kosovo have been rejected by both sides, met with negotiators in
Pristina on Monday and planned to travel to Belgrade on Tuesday for
more talks with Serbian government authorities.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Organization of Security
and Cooperation in Europe, which is assembling a force of 2,000
unarmed peace monitors in Kosovo.
	   OSCE verifiers were allowed access to the site later Monday, the
Serbian media center said.
	   The OSCE has condemned all violence and reiterated that both
sides are to blame for the continuing shooting incidents in Kosovo.
	   Dozens of people have been killed since the Oct. 12 peace
agreement brokered by U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke. Many fear
full-scale fighting will resume in the next few weeks or months
unless there is a breakthrough in negotiations.
	   Ethnic Albanians insist on a political plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule, while Serbia refuses to give up
the predominantly ethnic Albanian province.
	   Meanwhile, a delegation of Kosovo's Serbs from the southwestern
region of Orahovac arrived in Pristina to plead with international
peace verifiers for their relatives and family members who went
missing five months ago.
	   About 50 Serbs met with Gabriel Keller, deputy head of the
2,000-strong peace verification mission.
	   Keller received a list of the missing people whom the Serbs
believe were kidnapped by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and
promised that the OSCE would ``try its best to find traces of the
missing.''
	   ``We condemn violations of human rights on whatever side they
happen and we will support the efforts to find your relatives,''
Keller said.
	   Separately Monday, the second-ranking diplomat at the French
embassy in Belgrade and two other embassy employees were killed
Monday in a car accident in Kosovo, French officials said.
	   Gerard Fauveau, the embassy's first counselor, was among those
killed when the black Renault he was riding in collided with a
passenger bus in Besinje, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of
Pristina.

Leaders say Cambodia is in, but not at this summit

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Association of Southeast Asian Nations
leaders decided late Monday not to admit Cambodia as their 10th
member in time for this week's annual summit here.
	   But they tried to allow Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who
lobbied hard for membership, to save face by saying his country
will be admitted in the future and by telling their foreign
ministers to arrange an admission ceremony at an unspecified date.
	   Vietnam, Hun Sen's biggest backer, also scored a small coup in
being designated host for the eventual ceremony.
	   ``We have decided to admit Cambodia as the 10th member of ASEAN
and for the foreign ministers to organize a special ceremony in
Hanoi,'' Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Can told
reporters.
	   While all ASEAN members have said Cambodia eventually will be
admitted into the regional grouping, at least three countries were
hesitant to act now. They said the long-troubled nation needs more
time to fully establish the credibility of a newly installed
coalition government.
	   Hun Sen, who had hoped admission would add further legitimacy to
his government, sounded resigned to again being relegated to
observer status for this year's summit, but was upbeat about coming
summits.
	   ``It's just a question of the ceremony that needs to be done,''
he said after meeting with Indonesian President B.J. Habibie.
	   Cambodia originally was scheduled to join ASEAN in July 1997,
but the admission was put on hold due to Cambodia's political
turmoil at the time.
	   The leaders' decision, made at a state dinner that dragged on
for four hours, appeared designed to get the issue, which hijacked
the spotlight at pre-summit meetings, out of the way so the focus
would return to the economic issues that head their agenda.
	   At the two-day summit that opens Tuesday, the leaders are
expected to endorse a package of four documents, including one on a
batch of ``bold measures'' that some officials suggested weren't
really so bold.
	   ``They may be run-of-the-mill, may be completely negligible, but
it's important that we take a common approach,'' Singapore
government spokesman Ong Keng Yong said.
	   A draft of the measures includes tariff cuts, investor
incentives, duty-free status for capital equipment, relaxed rules
on foreign ownership of land, and speeded-up implementation of an
ASEAN Free Trade Area and ASEAN Investment Area.
	   Some are to take effect almost immediately in an effort to shore
up investor confidence and show the world the region is willing to
take tough action instead of just talking about it.
	   ``I feel it will put us back on the investment map again,''
Philippine Trade Secretary Jose Pardo said. ``It will be too
difficult for investors in the West to refuse to take a hard look
at the opportunities that are here.''
	   But analysts said there was really little new. And some of the
measures would be put on a dual-track to allow developing countries
more time and leeway to implement them.
	   ``The measures may not be as bold as some expected,'' Thai
government spokesman Akatol Sorasuchart said. ``But they will
include liberalization, open markets, tariff cuts with deadlines
that will be met. It's a step forward.''
	   After the summit, ASEAN leaders will hold talks with three
``dialogue partners'' _ Japan, China and South Korea.

Iranian dissidents terrified after recent spate of killings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Leaders and newspapers on
both sides of Iran's political divide on Monday condemned a spate
of mysterious deaths of dissidents that have terrified Iranian
intellectuals.
	   Meanwhile, the official daily, Iran, said two others still are
missing: Pirouz Davani, who led a small political group called the
United Left, and Rostami Hamedani, a little known activist allied
with Davani. Iran gave no other details.
	   In a speech to a group of clerics, Iran's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said ``the killing of citizens, whatever
their beliefs may be, was a crime.''
	   Khamenei leans towards hard-line clergymen who have been the
target of criticism of Iranian liberals, including the three
writers and two opposition activists who died over the past month.
	   The conservative clergymen are opposed to moderate President
Mohammad Khatami's attempts at social and political reforms.
	   Hard-line activists and vigilantes have often resorted to
violence against Khatami's supporters, but nobody has accused the
hard-line camp of being behind the killings.
	   Sadegh Zibakalam, a Tehran University professor, said it would
be wrong to blame any one group for the killings that ``serve none
of the political wings ... either the extreme right or the
conservative.''
	   The conservative clergymen have, however, blamed unnamed foreign
agencies and even an exiled Iranian opposition group. Khamenei
repeated that line Monday, and called on the intelligence and
security networks to catch the perpetrators.
	   The killings are ``the work of the enemies and a plot against
the Islamic system,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency
quoted him as saying.
	   One opposition writer told The Associated Press that the
killings have spread panic among dissidents.
	   ``Some of our intellectual friends have been trying to keep a
low profile by moving out of their homes into the homes of friends
or relatives,'' the writer, Houshang Golshiri, said in a telephone
interview.
	   Golshiri was collaborating with seven others, including two of
the dead writers _ Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh and Mohammad Mokhtari _
to establish a writers' association.
	   Pouyandeh and Mokhtari were summoned by a court about two months
ago to answer questions about their activities. Their bodies were
found dumped on the outskirts of Tehran. They were apparently
strangled.
	   Another writer, Majid Sharif, was also found dead after
disappearing from home. The head of an Iranian opposition group,
Dariush Foruhar, and his wife, Parvaneh, were found stabbed to
death in their home on Nov. 22.
	   President Khatami said in a statement Monday that the government
was determined to bring the killers to justice.
	   He said there was ``high hope'' that a special investigative
team he set up would ``soon have something to report to the
nation.''
	   The moderate Zan daily published a telling cartoon this week on
the plight of dissident writers in Iran: A magician tries but fails
to make his subject vanish. Then a hand offers the magician a pen.
``Give him this and he's finished,'' says the unidentified owner of
the hand.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav army troops killed at least
30 armed ethnic Albanians and wounded 12 others in border clashes
Monday in Kosovo, the Serb-run Media Center reported.
	   The report of 30 deaths in the five-hour clash was the greatest
single number of casualties since an informal truce in October
halted the fighting in the separatist province in southern Serbia.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center also reported
casualties from the clash but did not immediately say how many were
killed or injured. It said heavy detonations were heard from three
villages that had been sealed off by police.
	   The Serb Media Center report said a group of armed Albanians was
trying to enter Kosovo illegally from Albania when the shootout
erupted at 2 a.m. (0100 GMT) near the border outposts of Gorozup
and Liken, 70 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels, who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence, have frequently used illegal border routes to arm
themselves in neighboring Albania.
	   Since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown
against separatist rebels in Kosovo last February, hundreds of have
been killed and an estimated 300,000 left homeless
	   The clashes came as a U.S. envoy for Kosovo renewed talks Monday
with the province's ethnic Albanian negotiators.
	   Christopher Hill, whose proposals for a political settlement for
Kosovo have been rejected by both sides, met with negotiators in
Pristina on Monday and planned to travel to Belgrade on Tuesday for
more talks with Serbian government authorities.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is assembling a force of
2,000 unarmed peace monitors in Kosovo.
	   OSCE verifiers were allowed access to the site later Monday, the
Serbian media center said.
	   The OSCE has condemned all violence and reiterated that both
sides are to blame for the continuing shooting incidents in Kosovo.
	   Dozens of people have been killed since the Oct. 12 peace

embassy in Belgrade and two other embassy employees were killed
Monday in a car accident in Kosovo, French officials said.
	   Gerard Fauveau, the embassy's first counselor, was among those
killed when the black Renault he was riding in collided with a
passenger bus in Besinje, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of
Pristina.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav army troops killed at least

today in Kosovo, the Serb-run Media Center reported.

	   Christopher Hill, whose proposals for a political settlement for
Kosovo have been rejected by both sides, met with negotiators in
the provincial capital of Pristina today. Hill planned to travel to
Belgrade on Tuesday for other talks with Serbian government
authorities.
	   Efforts to forge a political settlement that would bring a
lasting peace to the province in Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia, are stalled.
	   Additionally, many fear full-scale fighting will resume in the
next few weeks or months unless there is a breakthrough in
negotiations.
	   Ethnic Albanians insist on a political plan that would enable

	   Yugoslav army guards confiscated arms and other material that
the Albanians were trying to smuggle in, according to the Serb
Media Center report, which could not be independently confirmed.
	   Municipal authorities in nearby Prizren were quoted as saying
that all those killed and wounded were wearing camouflage uniforms
with the insignia of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. Eight
Albanians were killed in a border clash near the same area on Dec.
3.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
were left homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
launched a crackdown against separatist rebels in February.
	   Meanwhile, a delegation of Kosovo's Serbs arrived in Pristina
today to plead with international peace monitors to find their
relatives who disappeared five months ago.
	   About 50 Serbs met with Gabriel Keller, deputy head of the

OSCE would ``try its best to find traces of the missing.''
	   In another development, the second-ranking diplomat at the

	   French officials said Gerard Fauveau, the embassy's first

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Having the league championship in
hand two weeks before the season's end, Argentina's Boca Juniors
was left playing for the record books.
	   It was already a remarkable season. Taking the title after
losing many key players last season and doing it under the
direction of a new coach was impressive enough.
	   But the icing on the cake came on Sunday with a 3-1 victory over
Union as Boca became only the fifth Argentine team in history to
win the championship undefeated, garnering 45 points on 13 wins and
6 ties.
	   The team finished one point shy of the league record for points
in a season registered by River Plate in 1997.
	   Boca's flamboyant striker Martin Palermo also played himself
into the league's annals, scoring an unprecedented 20 goals in 19
games. Two of them, one a left-footed rebound the other a
second-half penalty shot, came on Sunday.
	   Diego Maradona, who closed out his playing days at Boca, was on
hand Sunday to lead the celebrations at the season finale.
Gesturing from his private box, the bare-chested Maradona led the
40,000 plus fans in a number of cheers.
	   Thousands of chanting fans poured into the Plaza Italia in
downtown Santiago, Chile to celebrate Colo Colo winning its second
consecutive league title.
	   Colo Colo's 2-1 win over Iquique gave them a one point advantage
in the standings over rival Universidad de Chile, and helped them
to their 22nd league championship.
	   Colo's Paraguayan coach Gustavo Benitez won widespread acclaim
for bringing a mostly young and inexperienced team back to the top
of the standings.
	   Strapped with a dlrs 2 million debt, Colo has sold off many of
the team's top players, with midfielder Jose Luis Sierra being the
latest to go. Sierra was transferred to the Mexican league for dlrs
1.4 million.
	   In the first game of the Brazilian soccer championship,
Corinthians reserve forward Dinei, came off the bench in the second
half to score a goal and pass for another in his team's 2-2 tie on
Sunday against Cruzeiro.
	   Playing at home before 87,000 fans, Cruzeiro moved into the lead
with goals by Muller and Valdo _ starters from the 1990 Brazilian
World Cup team in Italy.
	   But Corinthians weathered the storm, striking back with two
quick goals in 10 minutes as Corinthians coach Wanderley
Luxemburgo, directed his team by radio from the stands. He's
serving a 60 day ban for verbally abusing league referees.
	   The series now moves back to Sao Paulo for games two and three.

Poland considering leasing U.S. jet fighters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland is considering leasing as many as
36 U.S. jet fighters to bring its air force up to NATO standards,
the deputy defense minister said Monday.
	   Romuald Szeremietiew said after meeting with U.S. officials that
he would ask the government to approve a five-year lease of F-16 or
F-18 fighter aircraft at a cost of $100 million.
	   He said buying the planes would cost $1.2 billion.
	   Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary plan to join NATO next
year and must bring their militaries into conformance with NATO
standards before then.
	   They will be the first former Soviet bloc countries to join the
Western alliance.

Chechen parliament declares anti-crime campaign unconstitutional
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's parliament on Monday declared
unconstitutional efforts by the breakaway republic's president to
recruit army reservists to combat crime sweeping the southern
Russian region.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov issued a decree Saturday
calling up reservists, and thousands of veterans turned out Sunday
for the first roll call.
	   On Monday, the Chechen parliament held an extraordinary session
and declared that the decree contradicts Chechnya's constitution,
which says reservists can only be mobilized in the face of an
outside threat, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Maskhadov supporters maintain many criminal groups in Chechnya
are financed by outside sources, and therefore constitute an
outside threat, Interfax said.
	   It was unclear what effect the parliament's decision would have
on Maskhadov's crackdown on crime.
	   Officials said the reservists would be divided up into teams
which, along with police, would take over strategic sites
throughout Chechnya.
	   Since Chechnya's 1994-96 independence war with Russia, the
Caucasus Mountains region has been awash in violence as feuding
gangs wage bloody turf wars. Hundreds of people, including many
foreigners, have been kidnapped, mostly for ransom.

<TEXT>
	   RIEHEN, Switzerland (AP) _ After spending four weeks under gray
polyester, most of 178 trees wrapped by the husband-and-wife team
of Christo and Jeanne-Claude emerged from their covers Monday.
	   The public unwrapping in a Swiss museum park, supervised by the
artists' field manager, had been expected to last a week. But by
nightfall Monday, workers had uncovered two-thirds of the exhibit,
the Beyeler museum said. Weather permitting, the operation was to
be finished Tuesday.
	   Local officials said the trees had suffered only minimal damage
under their woven polyester fabric covering. The 55,000 square
meters (461,000 square feet) of fabric and 23 kilometers (14 miles)
of rope are to be recycled.
	   The artists, who grabbed global attention by wrapping cloth
around Berlin's Reichstag building in 1995, originally planned to
keep the trees wrapped through January but decided to unveil them
early for unspecified ``aesthetic'' reasons.
	   The exhibit attracted some 300,000 visitors since it opened last
month, transforming this quiet suburb in Basel.
	   Christo and Jeanne-Claude devised the concept after studying
gardeners who draped fabric on trees against winter snow and frost
in Japan, but the artists were rejected in previous attempts to
wrap trees.
	   The Saint Louis Museum of Art in Missouri and the Museum of
Modern Art in New York turned them down in the 1960s. Paris nixed a
1969 bid to wrap the 330 trees along the Champs Elysees.
	   The artists, both born June 13, 1935, have worked as an
inseparable team for 40 years. He came from a family of wealthy
Bulgarian industrialists, and she was born into a French military
family. Both are now U.S. citizens.

Sion bid leader invites IOC to examine books
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Olympics-IOC Bribes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The chairman of Sion's 2006 Winter
Olympics bid on Monday invited the International Olympic Committee
to examine the accounts of both the current Sion bid and its
unsuccessful attempt for the 2002 Games.
	   The Sion 2006 candidacy ``strives for full transparency and fair
play,'' said a statement from the Swiss defense ministry, headed by
Sion chairman Adolf Ogi.
	   Ogi's move follows bribery allegations which set off the biggest
corruption scandal in IOC history, prompting the IOC to set up a
top-level investigation into alleged misconduct.
	   Swiss IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said Salt Lake
City, which beat Sion for the 2002 Winter Games in a landslide vote
in 1995 balloting, had been ``blackmailed'' during its successful
bid.
	   Hodler on Saturday alleged that four ``agents,'' including one
IOC member, had been involved in vote-buying over the past 10
years.
	   He cited supposed irregularities in the elections of at least
four Olympic cities _ Atlanta; Nagano, Japan; Sydney, Australia,
and Salt Lake.
	   The decision on a venue for 2006 will be taken in Seoul, South
Korea, in June.
	   The books for both Sion bids have been checked by an independent
Valais canton (state) inspectorate, the Swiss statement said.
	   Ogi ``takes note with satisfaction'' of the setting up of a
panel of inquiry and hopes it will quickly lead to an improvement
in the procedure for awarding future Games, it added.

New Cabinet promises economic and administrative reforms

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Prime Minister-designate Salim Hoss on
Monday pledged wide-ranging political, economic and administrative
reforms to rid Lebanon of past ``mistakes and sins.''
	   The promise of accountability marked the first serious attempt
in decades to stamp out deep-rooted corruption that has long been
considered a hallmark of Lebanese politics.
	   Hoss, a U.S.-educated economist who formed a Cabinet on Dec. 4,
is expected to easily win a vote of confidence later this week
since most of the 128 lawmakers backed Hoss' nomination for the
job.
	   In a policy statement presented to Parliament, Hoss set economic
reform, monetary stability and cleaning up the corruption-riddled
administration as priorities of his new government.
	   He also vowed to introduce austerity measures on government
spending in order to reduce budget deficit.
	   Hoss criticized former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's economic
policies and his multibillion dollar program to rebuild the country
from the devastation of the 1975-90 civil war.
	   A major challenge facing his government was to halt ``the
financial drain caused by past policies, the reconstruction policy
and the faltering administrative reform process,'' the statement
said.
	   Hariri's opponents had accused his Cabinet of corruption and
squandering public funds.
	   Hariri is, however, credited with restoring economic confidence
and attracting investment in postwar Lebanon. He also tamed
inflation and stabilized the national currency.
	   But during six years in office, Hariri's government had failed
to improve living standards and had to borrow heavily to finance
huge infrastructure projects, resulting in a public debt of an
estimated dlrs 18 billion and an annual budget deficit of more than
40 percent.
	   Hariri bowed out in an apparent power struggle with new
President Emile Lahoud, the army commander elected president in
October with a promise to reform government.
	   ``The outgoing regime ended with a lot of mistakes and
frustration amid tragic absence of accountability,'' Hoss said. In
contrast, Lahoud's election was unanimously received with ``a
slogan of change against a gloomy background of mistakes and
sins,'' he added.
	   The prime minister-designate said the government ``will
strengthen and reactivate monitoring agencies with a view to
placing public departments and institutions in a climate of a
continuous and systematic administrative reform and declaring war
on corruption and squandering (of state funds).''

Plans to cut about 3,900 more tobacco jobs worldwide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout with additional 2,900 job cuts overseas, stock
price, more changes at Nabisco. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By SKIP WOLLENBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ RJR Nabisco Inc. is cutting an additional 3,900
tobacco jobs worldwide as it adjusts to changing competitive
conditions in the United States and Russia, its two biggest
markets.
	   About 1,000 of the planned cuts disclosed today will come from
its domestic R.J. Reynolds Tobacco business while the remaining
2,900 will be in Russia and other nations that were formerly part
of the Soviet Union.
	   The cuts represent 15.7 percent of its global tobacco work force
of 8,800 domestic and 16,000 international employees. Reynolds'
cigarette brands include Winston, Camel and Salem.
	   The domestic job cuts by the nation's second biggest cigarette
company reflect RJR's expectation that it may sell fewer cigarettes
in the United States because of a 45 cent a pack price hike imposed
after last month's mammoth legal settlement with the states.
	   The international cuts reflect the depressed conditions in
Russia, RJR's single biggest foreign market for cigarettes, and
other former Soviet nations. RJR's tobacco sales volume is
approaching what it was before an economic collpase there in
August, but it is selling fewer high-profit premium smokes and more
of the cheaper brands.
	   Meanwhile, Nabisco Holdings Corp, which is 80.6 percent owned by
RJR, announced it will also close more plants and eliminate jobs
worldwide in a bid to be more competitive. It declined to offer
specific numbers.
	   As a result of the moves in the tobacco and food businesses, RJR
expects to charge a total of $348 million, or $1.07 a share,
against earnings in the fourth quarter. It said the savings could
reach $175 million a year.
	   In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, RJR shares
were up 25 cents at $28.56.
	   The charge covers costs associated with eliminating about 1,300
domestic tobacco jobs including 315 cuts announced last month.
	   R.J. Reynolds and four other tobacco companies agreed last month
to pay $206 billion over 25 years to settle claims by 46 states for
health costs for treating sick smokers. Following that agreement,
Reynolds and other cigarette makers raised prices by 45 cents a
pack.
	   ``We knew when we agreed to resolve the state tobacco litigation
that the domestic tobacco company would have to make enormous
sacrifices financially and operationally,'' said Steven F.
Goldstone, RJR's chairman and chief executive.
	   Andrew J. Schindler, RJR's president and chief executive, said
it ``is imperative that RJR realign its business, given the
potential for cigarette volume declines and financial payments
associated with the settlement. We are taking the steps necessary
to ensure that RJR is competitive in the domestic market.''
	   The U.S. job cuts are expected to occur next year and affect
various departments in the company, the statement said.
	   Goldstone said tobacco job cuts and unspecificed plant closings
in Russia and other former Soviet Union nations should help that
business ``get these problems behind them, stabilize earnings and
resume growth next year.''
	   The cuts at Nabisco are expected to affect mainly overseas
operations, and are the second phase of a restructuring at that
business which makes Ritz crackers and Snackwell's low-fat snack
line.
	   Nabisco will take a $124 million pretax charge, or 35 cents a
share, in the fourth quarter and spend $16 million on restructuring
over the next year.
	   In the first phase of the restructuring, Nabsico announced in
June it would take a $406 million charge and spend $118 million in
restructuring.
	   Nabisco said the latest restructuring is expected to save the
company $18 million in 1999 and $45 million a year after that.

EU Farm Ministers ban four antibiotics in animal feed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union Farm Minister on Monday
approved a ban on four widely used antibiotics in animal feed
additives because of fears it would make consumers more vulnerable
to disease, a move that will cost the pharmaceutical industry
several hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
	   The 15 farm ministers unanimously approved the move to phase out
the four antibiotics, with Spain, Portugal and Belgium the only
nations to abstain. The minister called on the EU's executive
Commission to come with proposals by next June to also ban imports
containing the animal feed additives.
	   ``They weaken the human resistance to medicine,'' said British
Agriculture Minister Nick Brown said of the four products. ``It is
right and it is necessary,'' said German Farm Minister Karl Heinz
Funke.
	   The four antibiotics are widely used as growth promoters in
animal feed but they are also used or closely related to human
medicines. It is feared that once it gets into the human food chain
it diminishes the human resistance to the medical product, forcing
patients to use stronger medicine.
	   The four products concerned are Spiramycin, Virginiamycin,
Tysolin phosphate and Batritracin Zinc.
	   Virginiamycin is manufactured by Pfizer Inc. of the United
States; Spiramycin is manufactured by Rhone-Poulenc SA of France;
Bacitracin Zinc is made by Alpharma AS of Norway; and Tylosin
phosphate is made by Elanco of the United States, a unit of Eli
Lilly &AMP; Co.
	   Finland, Denmark and Sweden already banned the use of these
products. The phaseout of the products in the other 12 EU nations
should be completed in the first 6 months of next year.
	   Monday's ban brought to 15 antibiotics that have already been
outlawed in the European Union. The feed additives are primarily
used in pig and poultry production.
	   France especially insisted that the ban should also apply to
meat imports of animals which have used the same antibiotics.
	   ``It also has to apply to third countries. How could we accept
imports if we ban it ourselves,'' asked French Farm Minister Jean
Glavany. ``Public opinion just would not understand,'' he said.
	   Spain said it abstained because there was not sufficient
evidence yet to impose the ban. The major pharmaceutical companies
producing the additives claim likewise and said they will lose an
overall annual market of up to dlrs 300 million.
	   The use of Virginiamycin, Spiramycin, Bacitracin Zinc and
Tylosin phosphate in animal feed accounts for 15% of the total use
of antibiotics in the 15-member E.U.
	   Brown agreed scientific evidence was not fully conclusive yet.
``But the direction in which (scientific research) goes is clear
enough,'' he said.

Creatine, considered food, left off IOC bsubstance listeERICA

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ International Olympic Committee
officials said Monday that the controversial dietary supplement
creatine would not be added to the IOC's banned-substance list.
	   Head of the IOCj% 1commission, Prince Alexandre de Merode said
that creatine was considered ``food.''
	   ``You cannot compare it to testosterone or anabolic steriods,''
said de Merode, following an IOC executive board meeting at IOC
headquWM ``CreatiJMfood.
	   ``You can't prevent people from eating food.''
	   Creatine, an amino acid protein that is produced naturally in
animals and humans, is marketed as a legal alternative to anabolic
steroids.
	   But linked with shorter term problems such as muscle cramping
and dehydration, many National Olympic Committees have been trying
to get creatine added to the IOC's banned substance list.
	   ``You can get ill if you take too much creatine, but if a person
stuffs himself with 30 eggs or a kilo of ``foie gras,'' he'll
damage his liver, too,'' was de Merode's argument.
	   The Italian Olympic Committee's anti-doping investigator, Ugo
Longo, recommended in October that creatine should be banned or
restricted.
	   As for the Z+publicized dietary supplement Androstenedione, de
Merode said the IOC was still trying to persude the major league
baseball and the players' union to ban the substance.
	   Androstenedione, which converts quickly in the body to the male
sex steroid testosterone, can produce a wide array of side effects
when taken in large doses over a prolonged period.
	   In men, increased testosterone has been associated with acne,
breast enlargement, premature balding, abnormal cholesterol levels,
blood clotting disorders, liver tumors, abnormal veins in the liver
that can rupture and cause death, enlarged prostates, shrinking
testicles andY,Msperm counts.
	   The most publicized case of androstenedione use is baseball
slugger Mark McGwire, who set a single season home-run record with
70 homers.
	   McGwire admitted using the muscle-building supplement, which is
legal in major league baseball but is listed as a banned steroid by
the IOC.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with new clashes

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Youths angered by the police shooting of
a friend showered rocks and chunks of concrete on officers Monday
evening, while bus drivers were on strike to protest a previous
night of violence.
	   Small groups of youths stood atop buildings in a working-class
neighborhood in this southwestern city as they pelted the riot
police, who responded with tear gas grenades. There were no
immediate reports of injuries.
	   Meanwhile, commuters in this southwestern French city faced a
day without public transit after bus drivers walked off the job to
protest violence against them.
	   The buses drivers justified their walkout by saying it wasn't
safe to work. Striking drivers also picketed the local bus depot in
Toulouse, a city of 350,000 people in south-central France.
	   The strikers also said the driver of the bus that was set on
fire was attacked by rioters. However, management said the driver
was stuck by glass after the windshield was shattered by a baseball
bat.
	   Youths in Toulouse rioted Sunday to avenge the shooting death of
a youth who was killed earlier in the morning by a stray police
bullet.
	   The Interior Minister on Monday suspended the officer in charge
of the police unit involved in the killing, and two policemen were
detained for questioning.
	   At least 150 police faced off up to 200 youths in a working
class district with an unemployment rate of 35 percent. The angry
youths threw stones and Molotov cocktails at security forces.
	   Six policemen were injured. No youths were reported hurt.

Iranian dissidents terrified after recent spate of killings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Leaders and newspapers on
both sides of Iran's political divide on Monday condemned a spate
of mysterious deaths of dissidents that have terrified Iranian
intellectuals.
	   Meanwhile, the official daily, Iran, said two dissidents still
are missing: Pirouz Davani, who led a small political group called
the United Left, and Rostami Hamedani, a little known activist
allied with Davani. Iran gave no other details.
	   In a speech to a group of clerics, Iran's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said ``the killing of citizens, whatever
their beliefs may be, was a crime.''
	   Khamenei leans towards hard-line clergymen who have been the
target of criticism of Iranian liberals, including the three
writers and two opposition activists who died over the past month.
	   The conservative clergymen are opposed to moderate President
Mohammad Khatami's attempts at social and political reforms.
	   Hard-line activists and vigilantes have often resorted to
violence against Khatami's supporters, but nobody has accused the
hard-line camp of being behind the killings.
	   Sadegh Zibakalam, a Tehran University professor, said it would
be wrong to blame any one group for the killings that ``serve none
of the political wings ... either the extreme right or the
conservative.''
	   The conservative clergymen have, however, blamed unnamed foreign
agencies and even an exiled Iranian opposition group. Khamenei
repeated that line Monday, and called on the intelligence and
security networks to catch the perpetrators.
	   The killings are ``the work of the enemies and a plot against
the Islamic system,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency
quoted him as saying.
	   One opposition writer told The Associated Press that the
killings have spread panic among dissidents.
	   ``Some of our intellectual friends have been trying to keep a
low profile by moving out of their homes into the homes of friends
or relatives,'' the writer, Houshang Golshiri, said in a telephone
interview.
	   Golshiri had been collaborating with seven others, including two
of the dead writers _ Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh and Mohammad
Mokhtari _ to establish a writers' association.
	   Pouyandeh and Mokhtari were summoned by a court about two months
ago to answer questions about their activities. Their bodies were
found dumped on the outskirts of Tehran. They were apparently
strangled.
	   Another writer, Majid Sharif, was also found dead after
disappearing from home. The head of an Iranian opposition group,
Dariush Foruhar, and his wife, Parvaneh, were found stabbed to
death in their home on Nov. 22.
	   President Khatami said in a statement Monday that the government
was determined to bring the killers to justice.
	   He said there was ``high hope'' that a special investigative
team he set up would ``soon have something to report to the
nation.''
	   The moderate Zan daily published a telling cartoon this week on
the plight of dissident writers in Iran: A magician tries but fails
to make his subject vanish. Then a hand offers the magician a pen.
``Give him this and he's finished,'' says the unidentified owner of
the hand.

New Cabinet promises economic and administrative reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HUSSEIN DAKROUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Prime Minister-designate Salim Hoss on
Monday pledged wide-ranging political, economic and administrative
reforms to rid Lebanon of past ``mistakes and sins.''
	   The promise of accountability marked what appeared to be the
first serious attempt in decades to stamp out deep-rooted
corruption that has long been considered a hallmark of Lebanese
politics.
	   Hoss, a U.S.-educated economist who formed a Cabinet on Dec. 4,
is expected to easily win a vote of confidence later this week
since most of the 128 lawmakers backed Hoss' nomination for the
job.
	   In a policy statement presented to Parliament, Hoss set economic
reform, monetary stability and cleaning up the corruption-riddled
administration as priorities of his new government.
	   He also vowed to introduce austerity measures on government
spending in order to reduce budget deficit.
	   Hoss criticized former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's economic
policies and his multibillion dollar program to rebuild the country
from the devastation of the 1975-90 civil war.
	   A major challenge facing his government was to halt ``the
financial drain caused by past policies, the reconstruction policy
and the faltering administrative reform process,'' the statement
said.
	   Hariri's opponents had accused his Cabinet of corruption and
squandering public funds.
	   Hariri is, however, credited with restoring economic confidence
and attracting investment in postwar Lebanon. He also tamed
inflation and stabilized the national currency.
	   But during six years in office, Hariri's government had failed
to improve living standards and had to borrow heavily to finance
huge infrastructure projects, resulting in a public debt of an
estimated dlrs 18 billion and an annual budget deficit of more than
40 percent.
	   Hariri bowed out in an apparent power struggle with new
President Emile Lahoud, the army commander elected president in
October with a promise to reform government.
	   ``The outgoing regime ended with a lot of mistakes and
frustration amid tragic absence of accountability,'' Hoss said. In
contrast, Lahoud's election was unanimously received with ``a
slogan of change against a gloomy background of mistakes and
sins,'' he added.
	   The prime minister-designate said the government ``will
strengthen and reactivate monitoring agencies with a view to
placing public departments and institutions in a climate of a
continuous and systematic administrative reform and declaring war
on corruption and squandering (of state funds).''

quarter of an inch. All of the showers had dissipated by late
morning.
	   As the trough moves away from the area this afternoon, dry air
will return to the middle levels of the atmosphere. This will
combine with a strong upper-level high pressure ridge over the

Ukraine's population decreasing steadily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's population has shrunk by 2
million people since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, and the
rate of decline is growing, the health minister said Monday.
	   The country's population, currently at about 50 million people,
is expected to contract by another 2 million by as early as 2002,
Andriy Serdiuk said, according to the independent UNIAN news
agency.
	   People over 60 years old constitute 20 percent of the country's
population.
	   Demographers blame rising mortality rates, low birth rates and
falling life expectancy in Ukraine and some other former Soviet
republics on declining health care in recent years and protracted
economic turmoil that has left millions impoverished.
	   Serdiuk said more than 6 million Ukrainians suffer from heart
disease, 1.2 million have mental illnesses, and 800,000 are
alcoholics.
	   He said these factors ``significantly influence'' the average
life expectancy in Ukraine and will continue to push it lower.
	   Ukrainian demographers say life expectancy is 62.3 years for men
and 73.2 for women _ nine years behind Western nations and 12 years
behind Japan.

Festina's French cyclists suspended till the end of April
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French Cycling Federation has handed down bans
of 4 1/2 months to three cyclists from the Festina team that was
expelled from the scandal-rocked Tour de France, French television
reported Monday.
	   Laurent Brochard, Christophe Moreau and Didier Roux, who have
all admitted to taking banned drugs, will be prevented from
competing until April 30, LCI television said.
	   None of the three has raced since the Tour.
	   The FFC is still examining the cases of Richard Virenque and
Pascal Herve, two cyclists who deny that they knowingly took banned
substances.
	   Its ban is similar to that given to other members of the Festina
team.
	   In September, the Swiss Cycling Federation handed out eight
month bans to Festina's Swiss riders - Alex Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux
and Armin Meier - keeping them out of action until the end of May.
	   But cycling federations have dealt with team officials more
severely.
	   On Friday, the FFC banned Festina's former sporting director
Bruno Roussel and ex-physiotherapist Willy Voet for five and three
years respectively for their part in the Festina doping affair.
	   Festina was expelled from the Tour de France after Roussel
admitted to systematic use of banned drugs.

Kuwaiti daily to be prosecuted for `indecent' article
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The government will prosecute an independent
Kuwaiti newspaper for publishing an interview with a man who said
he visited a local brothel, officials said.
	   Al-Rai Al-Amm newspaper's chief editor, Jassim Budai, said he
and his deputy, Yousef al-Jalahma, were questioned by prosecutors
Sunday.
	   Al-Jalahma said the Information Ministry referred the newspaper
to the prosecutor-general for publishing what officials considered
an ``indecent'' interview.
	   ``We were taken aback when we were subpoenaed,'' al-Jalahma told
The Associated Press. He denied that vulgar or sexually suggestive
language were used in the Oct. 22 article.
	   Abdullah al-Hammad, who heads the press department at the
Information Ministry, confirmed that Al-Rai Al-Amm was being
prosecuted for the interview. He did not say when the case will go
to court or what offense the newspaper committed.
	   Public discussion of sex-related issues is not encouraged in
this conservative Muslim country.
	   The unidentified man told the newspaper that he was lured to a
brothel by a woman who turned out to be a prostitute. He said he
stopped going to the brothel when the woman asked him to work as a
pimp.
	   The report appeared in the paper's religion section with a
cartoon showing a group of men anxiously waiting at the door of a
brothel.
	   ``It was an interview with someone who had given up sin,''
al-Jalahma said.
	   If convicted, the editors could face up to six months in jail.

Zimbabwe says Kabila allies in heavy fighting for strategic town

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The Defense Ministry said Zimbabwe
troops and their allies engaged in heavy fighting with rebels in
eastern Congo and lost one helicopter gun ship after it developed a
technical fault, state radio reported Monday.
	   The radio said allied casualties were ``minimal'' in fighting
during the weekend that stopped rebel advances toward the
mineral-rich southeastern centers of Mbuji-Mayi and Lubumbashi, a
key allied garrison town, from the strategic town of Kabalo.
	   The state-owned Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corp. said fighting Sunday
centered on Kabalo, where rebel casualties were heavy and rebel
vehicles and artillery were destroyed.
	   Later Monday, Congolese rebels said they shot down a Zimbabwean
jet fighter and helicopter gun ship during fighting at Kabalo, some
1,500 kilometers (935 miles) southeast of the capital, Kinshasa.
	   It was not clear who was in control of Kabalo, a Congo River
port and an important railway junction in mineral-rich Katanga
Province, home of embattled President Laurent Kabila.
	   The rebels said they repulsed attacks by Kabila's allies on the
town but Zimbabwe radio said the allies fended off rebel advances
there.
	   The Defense Ministry gave no details of allied casualties in the
latest fighting but admitted some casualties were reported by the
allied forces headquarters in the Congo.
	   It said, however, the helicopter gun ship, believed to have been
a French-built Alouette ``command car'' supporting ground troops,
crashed after a mechanical failure.
	   Officials gave no information of the fate of the crew. The
Alouette usually carried a crew of two and can be used to drop
four-man commando units on battle lines.
	   Repeated calls to the Defense Ministry in Harare for details of
allied casualties were unanswered Monday.
	   Earlier, the state-controlled Herald newspaper, quoting
unidentified sources, said at least 80 rebels were killed in
fighting for Kabalo and fighting was also reported around nearby
towns of Kalemie and Moba.
	   Angolan and Namibian troops are fighting alongside Zimbabweans
and Kabila's forces in the dense jungles of eastern Congo.
	   The Herald described Kabalo as an important strategic position
that would provide the rebels with a ``springboard'' for attacks on
Mbuji-Mayi and Lubumbashi, second largest city.
	   Zimbabwe dispatched 8,000 troops, backed by warplanes and armor,
to support Kabila after the rebellion erupted Aug. 2.
	   Kabila's refusal to meet with the rebels has doomed a series of
peace initiatives seeking an end to the four-month Congolese war.
	   Kabila alleges the rebels are merely pawns of Rwanda and Uganda
and insists on negotiating only with those two countries.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The Indian government on Monday put a
bill before parliament that would amend the constitution to set
aside a third of the chamber's seats for women, despite angry
shouts from opponents.
	   Speaker G.M.C. Balayogi had to temporarily adjourn the body
twice because parties representing low-caste Indians opposed to the
bill were so vocal.
	   Minority parties had until Monday succeeded in keeping the bill
from being formally proposed, and two attempts in July to introduce
the bill failed amid similar scuffling and shouting.
	   But now that it has been put on the agenda, the bill is almost
sure to pass since it has the support of the Bharatiya Janata
Party, which leads India's governing coalition, and the main
opposition Congress party.
	   ``We are absolutely thrilled,'' said Mohini Giri of the National
Commission for Women. ``Introduction was the main thing. I am
confident about its passage.''
	   The bill, meant to increase women's participation in India's
democracy, was first introduced in 1996 by a previous government,
but met with similar opposition and never came to a vote in a
country where religion and tradition have limited women's public
role.
	   The bill would also set aside a third of the seats in state
assemblies for women.
	   A similar measure was passed in 1995 for municipal and village
councils. Results have been mixed at the local level. Some female
politicians are used as fronts for their husbands or fathers and
others have been ousted in no-confidence votes.

England coach won't select South African star
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England rugby union coach Clive Woodward has no
interest in selecting former South African star Joel Stransky when
the fly half becomes eligible next year.
	   Stransky, whose drop kick clinched the 1995 World Cup for South
Africa, has English grandparents and is available to play for
England after a three-year eligibility period has elapsed since his
last appearance for the Springboks in 1996.
	   He plans to stay in England and continue his career with
Leicester.
	   Woodward, whose England team beat the Springboks 13-7 10 days
ago to stop South Africa completing a world record 18 wins in a
row, said Stransky would not enter into his thoughts.
	   ``If I was asked whether I would choose him for World Cup 1999,
the answer is basically no,'' the England coach said.
	   ``I would have to be very desperate to do so and I would chose
him only with the greatest reluctance and with huge reservations.
If I had to it would be a very sad day for English rugby.
	   ``I prefer to pick only English-qualified players who have not
appeared for another country,'' Woodward said.
	   ``You can't compare Joel's case with (South African-born) Mike
Catt. Mike was not a pro rugby player when he came here. He
qualified through parents and above all had not been capped by
South Africa.
	   ``We have more rugby players than any other country in the world
and, if we can't find stand-offs _ or any other positions _ with
our own qualified players in the normal way, then it will be a bad
day for our game,'' Woodward said.
	   ``Once we started going down the Stransky road we would easily
find the English national team filled with older players who have
finished Test careers in their own country and served the necessary
qualification.''

Plans to cut about 3,900 more tobacco jobs worldwide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout with additional 2,900 job cuts overseas, stock
price, more changes at Nabisco. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By SKIP WOLLENBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ RJR Nabisco Inc. is cutting an additional 3,900
tobacco jobs worldwide as it adjusts to changing competitive
conditions in the United States and Russia, its two biggest
markets.
	   About 1,000 of the planned cuts disclosed today will come from
its domestic R.J. Reynolds Tobacco business while the remaining
2,900 will be in Russia and other nations that were formerly part
of the Soviet Union.
	   The cuts represent 15.7 percent of its global tobacco work force
of 8,800 domestic and 16,000 international employees of the
Winston-Salem, N.C.-based company. Reynolds' cigarette brands
include Winston, Camel and Salem.
	   The domestic job cuts by the nation's second biggest cigarette
company reflect RJR's expectation that it may sell fewer cigarettes
in the United States because of a 45 cent a pack price hike imposed
after last month's mammoth legal settlement with the states.
	   The international cuts reflect the depressed conditions in
Russia, RJR's single biggest foreign market for cigarettes, and
other former Soviet nations. RJR's tobacco sales volume is
approaching what it was before an economic collpase there in
August, but it is selling fewer high-profit premium smokes and more
of the cheaper brands.
	   Meanwhile, Nabisco Holdings Corp, which is 80.6 percent owned by
RJR, announced it will also close more plants and eliminate jobs
worldwide in a bid to be more competitive. It declined to offer
specific numbers.
	   As a result of the moves in the tobacco and food businesses, RJR
expects to charge a total of $348 million, or $1.07 a share,
against earnings in the fourth quarter. It said the savings could
reach $175 million a year.
	   In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, RJR shares
were up 25 cents at $28.56.
	   The charge covers costs associated with eliminating about 1,300
domestic tobacco jobs including 315 cuts announced last month.
	   R.J. Reynolds and four other tobacco companies agreed last month
to pay $206 billion over 25 years to settle claims by 46 states for
health costs for treating sick smokers. Following that agreement,
Reynolds and other cigarette makers raised prices by 45 cents a
pack.
	   ``We knew when we agreed to resolve the state tobacco litigation
that the domestic tobacco company would have to make enormous
sacrifices financially and operationally,'' said Steven F.
Goldstone, RJR's chairman and chief executive.
	   Andrew J. Schindler, RJR's president and chief executive, said
it ``is imperative that RJR realign its business, given the
potential for cigarette volume declines and financial payments
associated with the settlement. We are taking the steps necessary
to ensure that RJR is competitive in the domestic market.''
	   The U.S. job cuts are expected to occur next year and affect
various departments in the company, the statement said.
	   Goldstone said tobacco job cuts and unspecificed plant closings
in Russia and other former Soviet Union nations should help that
business ``get these problems behind them, stabilize earnings and
resume growth next year.''
	   The cuts at Nabisco are expected to affect mainly overseas
operations, and are the second phase of a restructuring at that
business which makes Ritz crackers and Snackwell's low-fat snack
line.
	   Nabisco will take a $124 million pretax charge, or 35 cents a
share, in the fourth quarter and spend $16 million on restructuring
over the next year.
	   In the first phase of the restructuring, Nabsico announced in
June it would take a $406 million charge and spend $118 million in
restructuring.
	   Nabisco said the latest restructuring is expected to save the
company $18 million in 1999 and $45 million a year after that.

Creatine, considered food, left off IOC banned substance list
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix computer garble &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ International Olympic Committee
officials said Monday that the controversial dietary supplement
creatine would not be added to the IOC's banned-substance list.
	   Head of the IOC medical commission, Prince Alexandre de Merode
said that creatine was considered ``food.''
	   ``You cannot compare it to testosterone or anabolic steroids,''
said de Merode, following an IOC executive board meeting at IOC
headquarters. ``Creatine is food.''
	   ``You can't prevent people from eating food.''
	   Creatine, an amino acid protein that is produced naturally in
animals and humans, is marketed as a legal alternative to anabolic
steroids.
	   But linked with shorter term problems such as muscle cramping
and dehydration, many National Olympic Committees have been trying
to get creatine added to the IOC's banned substance list.
	   ``You can get ill if you take too much creatine, but if a person
stuffs himself with 30 eggs or a kilo of ``foie gras,'' he'll
damage his liver, too,'' was de Merode's argument.
	   The Italian Olympic Committee's anti-doping investigator, Ugo
Longo, recommended in October that creatine should be banned or
restricted.
	   As for the highly publicized dietary supplement Androstenedione,
de Merode said the IOC was still trying to persuade the major
league baseball and the players' union to ban the substance.
	   Androstenedione, which converts quickly in the body to the male
sex steroid testosterone, can produce a wide array of side effects
when taken in large doses over a prolonged period.
	   In men, increased testosterone has been associated with acne,
breast enlargement, premature balding, abnormal cholesterol levels,
blood clotting disorders, liver tumors, abnormal veins in the liver
that can rupture and cause death, enlarged prostates, shrinking
testicles and decreased sperm counts.
	   The most publicized case of androstenedione use is baseball
slugger Mark McGwire, who set a single season home-run record with
70 homers.
	   McGwire admitted using the muscle-building supplement, which is
legal in major league baseball but is listed as a banned steroid by
the IOC.

UEFA medical committee backs joint effort with FIFA on doping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ UEFA's medical committee agreed Monday to propose
a joint meeting with FIFA in March to coordinate a ``determined
effort to keep drugs out of football.''
	   The proposal by chairman Michel D'Hooghe, who also chairs the
world governing body's committee for sports medicine, was approved
unanimously, UEFA said in a statement.
	   ``Although the 256 drug tests carried out during the 1998 World
Cup finals were all negative,'' UEFA said its committee ``has taken
note of recent developments and has agreed to take whatever
measures are necessary in the crusade to keep football clean.''
	   Italian soccer, in particular, has been rocked by doping
controversies this year. Magistrates launched an investigation into
alleged widespread doping in Serie A after allegations by Roma
coach Zdenek Zeman.
	   Admitting a growing doping problem in soccer, FIFA earlier this
month agreed in principle to introduce random out-of-competition
drug tests for players, but didn't decide when and how the controls
would take place.
	   However, FIFA's executive committee continued to defy attempts
by the International Olympic Committee to harmonize doping
sanctions.
	   FIFA has expressed reservations about the IOC's proposal for
minimum two-year suspensions for athletes found guilty of using
steroids or other serious drugs, with a life ban for a second
offense. It argues for flexibility on sanctions.

Finns send winter clothes for 10,000 Russians in Murmansk area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Helping their neighbors fend off the
bitter chill, Finland sent winter clothes for 10,000 people Monday
to the northwestern Russian province of Murmansk.
	   The 14 tons of clothes from the Red Cross are for retirees, the
unemployed, single-parent families and families caring for the
sick.
	   The Finnish Red Cross is also providing medicine, food and other
aid to hospitals, nurseries, schools and nursing homes in the
Murmansk area and further south in Karelia near the Finnish border.
	   Later this month, it plans to send 6{ tons of clothes to
Karelia.
	   This year, Finland has pledged $1.6 million in emergency aid to
help the needy across its 790-mile border with Russia, channeled
mostly through the Red Cross.
	   In September, Murmansk provincial governor Yuri Yevdokimov
appealed to Finland, Sweden and Norway for food supplies.

U.S. diplomat warns Milosevic to cooperate with tribunal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A U.S. State Department human
rights expert on Monday warned Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to cooperate with the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal ``or
pay the price.''
	   Yugoslav authorities have repeatedly obstructed the U.N. court's
work by refusing to hand over three army officers indicted by the
tribunal for allegedly ordering a 1991 massacre and barring
investigators from probing war crimes claims in Kosovo.
	   Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Labor Harold
Koh is scheduled to meet Milosevic in Belgrade on Thursday. He said
he would lay down the law to the Yugoslav leader.
	   ``It is clear that Milosevic is the problem,'' Koh said. ``He is
not just part of the problem, he is the problem, and until steps
are taken to address these issues there will continue to be
instability in the region.''
	   Koh was speaking in The Hague after meeting with officials from
the tribunal to discuss the problem.
	   Koh said the U.S. government's message for Milosevic was clear:
``If you do not (cooperate), there will be a price to pay.''
	   He said that measures to enforce cooperation could include
strengthening sanctions against Yugoslavia and reporting the matter
to the U.N. Security Council.
	   Koh's visit to the Yugoslav capital coincides with hearings by a
Belgrade military court into the massacre of 260 non-Serbs driven
out of a hospital in the eastern Croatian city of Vukovar in
November 1991 and summarily executed.
	   Three Serb officers, Veselin Sljivancanin, Miroslav Radic and
Milan Mrksic, have been charged by the tribunal with ordering the
massacre. Belgrade officials refuse to extradite them to The Hague
to stand trial.
	   The Belgrade military judge investigating the killings plans to
call the three officers as witnesses _ not defendants _ in his
investigation. He rejected tribunal charges against the men as
unfounded.
	   Officials at the U.N. tribunal see the hearings as a sham,
designed to shield the three indicted suspects from trial in The
Hague. U.N. judges have ordered Belgrade to stop investigating the
case and turn over any evidence it has gathered to the tribunal.
	   Yugoslav Federal Justice Minister Zoran Knezevic reportedly is
planning to visit the tribunal on Wednesday to discuss the
problems.

Germany vows to clear obstacles to EU's eastward expansion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BRU103-104 &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Germany's foreign minister Joschka
Fischer pledged Monday to use his nation's European Union
presidency to secure an sweeping reform package that will clear the
way for the EU's early expansion into eastern Europe.
	   Fischer warned the expansion could be ``stopped in its tracks''
if EU nations fail to meet a March deadline for ending months of
deadlock over a proposed overhaul of the EU's dlrs 100
billion-a-year budget.
	   ``We are fully committed to the enlargement. Not to do it, or
putting it on the back burner, would be a failure of historic
proportions,'' Fischer told a news conference at EU headquarters.
	   Germany takes over the EU's rotating presidency from Austria on
New Year's Day.
	   Fischer's appeal to all 15 EU governments to compromise over the
budget battle, comes on the heels of a two-day summit in Vienna,
Austria, which ended Saturday without progress toward resolving the
dispute between rich and poorer EU members.
	   Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland want to increase the EU
budget so they don't lose valuable aid when even the even-poorer
former-communist nations join the Union. Fearing budget increases
will force them to contribute more, Germany and other richer
members want to freeze EU spending.
	   Outlining the priorities of the Germany presidency, Fischer
indicated Bonn would be prepared to make concessions if other
nations also compromised. ``We are open to being flexible on both
the income and the expenditure side,'' he said. ``Everything is on
the table.''
	   However, doubts are growing about Germany's ability to secure a
deal on time.
	   Central to the dispute are plans to scale down the farm-subsidy
program which eats up almost half of total EU spending. The EU has
tried for decades to slash the dlrs 40 billion yearly agricultural
handouts, but always runs up against resistance from France and its
powerful farm lobby.
	   Fischer said farm-subsidy cuts were essential if the expansion
is to go ahead. ``I don't see how else we can absorb large
agricultural nations to the east,'' he said. Poland alone has 4
million farmers, over half the EU's total.
	   Pressure for agricultural cuts was also coming from the
impending start of world trade negotiations, where the United
States and other major trading partners will insist the EU stem the
flow of farm aid.
	   The EU opened membership talks this fall with Poland, Hungary,
the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia and Slovenia. It will consider
extending those talks next year to Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia,
Romania, Bulgaria and perhaps Malta.
	   ``Standing at the end of the Cold War, we will be taking a step
to move beyond western Europe to create a pan-European project,''
Fischer said. ``We have everything to gain from opening up to the
East.''
	   Fischer said Germany, which currently provides about a third of
the EU's budget, was prepared to continue paying more into EU
coffers than it gets back. But he stressed there were limits to how
much EU money could be taken from the rich to give to the poor.
``Germany is not Robin Hood and the EU is not Sherwood Forest,'' he
said.
	   Other priorities of the German presidency will include reducing
the EU's 16.6 million army of unemployed and taking forward
Franco-British proposals to develop a European defense capability
more independent of U.S. support.
	   ``We must move toward a common European foreign and security
policy, there is a new dynamic in that discussion now,'' Fischer
said.

Pavarotti cancels second German concert over tax investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Celebrity tenor Luciano Pavarotti has backed out
of an appearance with the Deutsche Oper, his second cancellation of
a Berlin concert because he is under investigation in a German tax
evasion case.
	   Pavarotti canceled a Jan. 25 concert with the Deutsche Oper,
orchestra officials said Monday, though he promised to make it up.
The tenor also canceled a New Year's Eve appearance with the Berlin
Philharmonic on advice from his lawyer, ZDF television reported
Sunday.
	   Pavarotti, Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo _ also known for
their joint performances as The Three Tenors _ were named as
suspects last month for helping German concert promoter Matthias
Hoffmann evade taxes. Star soprano Montserrat Caballe also was
named as a suspect.
	   Hoffmann went on trial on fraud and tax evasion charges in
October. He is accused of using unreported payments and shell
companies in Ireland, London and elsewhere to evade almost 24
million marks (dlrs 15 million) in German taxes.
	   Hoffmann, who has been in investigative custody since July 30,
1997, has organized concerts with the three tenors and with
Caballe.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In the presence of President Bill
Clinton, hundreds of top Palestinian officials, including former
guerrilla fighters, on Monday stood and raised hands to affirm
revocation of Palestinian charter calls for the destruction of
Israel.
	   ``I hope this will close this chapter forever,'' Palistinian
leader Yasser Arafat said.
	   A senior adviser to Netanyahu said the show of hands was
acceptable.
	   ``The issue, as far as we are concerned, is now off the table,''
said David Bar-Illan said.
	   Clinton thanked delegates for rejecting the charter passages
``fully, finally and forever.''
	   ``By revoking them once and for all, you have sent, I say again,
a powerful message not to the government but to the people of
Israel,'' Clinton said.
	   But the Islamic militant group Hamas denounced the vote as
illegitimate. ``Today's meeting in Gaza was an orchestrated
political parade,'' said Jordan-based spokesman Ibrahim Ghosheh.

Italy's Uffizi set to open new exhibition space
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ The Uffizi museum opens the first of a
series of new exhibition rooms Wednesday, just in time for the
Christmas holidays that draw thousands of tourists to Italy's
artistic cities.
	   Floor space will be increased from 7,000 square meters (8,400
square yards) to 9,000 square meters (10,800 square yards) to show
hundreds of works until now kept in the museum's warehouse.
	   Highlights include 144 pieces of the Contini-Bonacossi
collection, featuring sculptures by Bernini and paintings by
Cimabue and Bellini, as well as a library with some 60,000 volumes
on the history of art and ancient manuscripts.
	   The newly restored Niobe room, which houses ancient Roman
sculptures, will also be reopened, after being damaged in a 1993
Mafia bombing that killed five people.
	   The Uffizi, a U-shaped building in the center of Florence
designed by Giorgio Vasari in the 16th century, is expected to
quadruple its visiting space by 2000.
	   It can now accommodate 1 million visitors a year.
	   The museum's expansion has cost the Italian government some 30
billion lire (dlrs 18 million) so far. Another 40 billion (dlrs 24
million) will be necessary over the next two years to complete the
works.

Most of Canada's aboriginal languages at risk
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Only three of about 50 aboriginal languages in
Canada are spoken widely enough to ensure their survival over the
coming decades, a government study says.
	   The Statistics Canada study, released Monday, said about a dozen
aboriginal languages could disappear soon and others face an
uncertain future.
	   The agency found that of 800,000 aboriginals recorded in the
latest census, a quarter said their mother tongue was an aboriginal
language. The three largest language families account for 93
percent of those mother tongues.
	   About 147,000 people speak Algonquian, which includes Cree and
Ojibway. Another 28,000 speak Inuktitut, the language of the
far-north Inuit people, and 20,000 speak Athapaskan, the language
of the Dene Indians of northwestern Canada.
	   The endangered languages rarely have more than a few thousand
speakers, and often only a few hundred.

Ukraine shutting down Chernobyl's lone reactor for repairs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The only remaining reactor at the Chernobyl
nuclear plant was being shut down Monday for long-needed repairs,
officials said.
	   Output at Chernobyl's Reactor No. 3 was being reduced during the
day and would be completely halted at midnight, according to the
Nuclear Regulation Administration, Ukraine's nuclear safety agency.
	   The reactor is the only one still used at Chernobyl, the site of
the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986. It has had frequent
malfunctions, and has been stopped many times since major repairs
were completed in May.
	   It had been due to be shut down Dec. 1 to repair and upgrade
safety equipment, using $118 million provided by the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development.
	   But with Ukraine facing energy shortages this winter, the
government decided to delay repairs until Dec. 15, saying it would
shut down Chernobyl's reactor only after a different reactor was
restarted.
	   On Sunday, a reactor at the Zaporizhia plant that had been idle
for several months was restarted and was being brought up to full
capacity, said the state-owned nuclear energy company Energoatom.
	   Reactor No. 3 has been Chernobyl's only working reactor since
1996, and plans call for the plant to be shut down entirely by
2000.
	   The plant had four reactors. One was closed in 1996, another was
shut down after a 1991 fire, and the fourth was destroyed in the
explosion and fire in 1986.
	   Ukraine has five nuclear power plants that account for more than
40 percent of the country's electricity production.

Opposition places hurdles in privatization of India's insurance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The main opposition Congress party
Monday asked the government to refer a proposal allowing foreign
investment in Indian insurance companies to a parliamentary
committee for discussion, thereby making its passage in the current
session of parliament difficult.
	   The bill on the proposal is scheduled to be introduced in
parliament Tuesday. It allows foreigners to own up to 26 percent of
private Indian insurance companies and another 14 percent to be
owned by Indians based overseas.
	   The decision was made at a three-hour party meeting of the
Congress Monday evening. Shivraj Patil, a spokesman of the
Congress, said his party was in favor of the bill in principal, but
there were several changes that the Congress wanted.
	   To begin with, Patil said, the Congress wants part of the
foreign investment to be used in the social sector, that is for
health and education.
	   In addition, it wants the Insurance Authority overseeing foreign
participation, to be autonomous and outside the control of the
government. Under the proposed bill, the Authority can be fired by
the government, Patil said. He made his comments while speaking to
the private Star News television channel.
	   The insurance bill has had several teething problems since it
was proposed. At first, members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata
Party opposed the bill despite its clearance by the federal
cabinet. But last week, the BJP resolved its internal differences
and scheduled its introduction this week.
	   But objections by the Congress, which until now has said it
supports the bill, may make its passage rocky.
	   On Friday, workers throughout the country walked off their jobs
and held street protests in a one-day strike called by leftist
political parties opposed to the insurance bill. Two people were
killed and four injured in clashes between rival political
factions.

Kuwaiti daily to be prosecuted for `indecent' article
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The government will prosecute an independent
Kuwaiti newspaper for publishing an interview with a man who said
he visited a local brothel, officials said.
	   Al-Rai Al-Amm newspaper's chief editor, Jassim Budai, said he
and his deputy, Yousef al-Jalahma, were questioned by prosecutors
Sunday.
	   Al-Jalahma said the Information Ministry referred the newspaper
to the prosecutor-general for publishing what officials considered
an ``indecent'' interview.
	   ``We were taken aback when we were subpoenaed,'' al-Jalahma told
The Associated Press. He denied that vulgar or sexually suggestive
language were used in the Oct. 22 article.
	   Abdullah al-Hammad, who heads the press department at the
Information Ministry, confirmed that Al-Rai Al-Amm was being
prosecuted for the interview. He did not say when the case will go
to court or what offense the newspaper committed.
	   Public discussion of sex-related issues is not encouraged in
this conservative Muslim country.
	   The unidentified man told the newspaper that he was lured to a
brothel by a woman who turned out to be a prostitute. He said he
stopped going to the brothel when the woman asked him to work as a
pimp.
	   The report appeared in the paper's religion section with a
cartoon showing a group of men anxiously waiting at the door of a
brothel.
	   ``It was an interview with someone who had given up sin,''
al-Jalahma said.
	   If convicted, the editors could face up to six months in jail.

WTO: Supachai ahead in race, but leadership consensus no nearer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi
is leading the race to take the World Trade Organization into the
next century, but members are far from consensus, the officials
overseeing the succession said Monday.
	   The United States and the European Union have yet to back a
candidate, although some of the organization's 132 members are
pressing for a decision to be made by the end of the week.
	   In a report to the world trade body's general council, the
diplomats charged with building a consensus on a successor to the
outgoing director-general, Renato Ruggiero, measured the level of
support for the four candidates.
	   They said former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore had about 75 per
cent of the level of support afforded to Supachai, while Moroccan
trade ambassador Hassan Abouyoub stood at 50 per cent and former
Canadian Trade Minister Roy Maclaren at just less than 30 per cent.
	   The WTO had set a mid-December target for choosing a new leader.
	   In a joint statement to the meeting, developing countries in the
WTO said the process should be concluded at the council's meeting
on Friday, even if some countries had not expressed a preference by
then.
	   Ruggiero has announced his intention to step down by the end of
April.

 &UR; Croatian, Bosnian officials meet to discuss border dispute
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Tudjman's remarks on Martin Brod, Bosnia; further
talks planned. RECASTS.

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatian and Bosnian experts met Monday
to discuss a border dispute stemming from the Bosnian war that is
further burdening tense bilateral relations.
	   The meeting came on the eve of a talks in Madrid, Spain, between
	   Bosnian and international officials on how much progress has
been made in erasing the scars of the war that ended in 1995.
	   The delegations did not find an immediate solution to the
disputed border town of Martin Brod in northwestern Bosnia, but
agreed to continue negotiations.
	   Martin Brod was part of Bosnia before the 1991-95 war. But
during the 1995 battles that preceded the Dayton peace accord,
Croatian forces routed Serbs in the area and moved the border
deeper into Bosnian territory, deploying police on the Una River,
which runs through the city.
	   Croatia said some pre-war maps justified the move.
	   Bosnia rejects the claims and wants Croatian forces out of the
town.
	   Meanwhile, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman referred to last
week's tensions in Martin Brod between the NATO-led peace troops
deployed in Bosnia and Croatian border police.
	   He said when the international officials ``sent armored vehicles
to Martin Brod, I said: 'If they come, we should resist them, not
only with the border police and regular police, but also with the
army.'''
	   Tudjman, who was giving a speech to students of a newly opened
military academy, said that after the confrontation, international
officials accepted a proposal that experts from the two countries
work on finding a solution to the dispute.
	   Tudjman also made remarks that could further infuriate Muslims
and international officials, who are wary of Tudjman's intentions
toward Bosnia.
	   He praised the recently signed agreement on special relations
between Croatia and Bosnia's Muslim-Croat federation, which
controls half of Bosnia.
	   ``We should ... work on that cooperation and ties, because it
won't be easy,'' he said. ``It is a challenge that would last maybe
for decades.''
	   But he said his policy towards Bosnia, ``achieved the most we
could get in the given circumstances. We secured our southern
borders and we tied half of Bosnia to Croatia.''
	   Tudjman said he opposed Croat hard-liners who wish to enlarge
Croatia by controlling Bosnia to the Drina River, Bosnia's eastern
border with Yugoslavia.
	   ``But I said: If someone had given me Croatia to Drina, with 2
million Serbs and 2 million Muslims in it, I wouldn't want it
because Croats would then be imperiled,'' he said.

Iran signs Caspian oil exploration deal with Shell, Lasmo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran signed an agreement Monday with Royal
Dutch-Shell and Britain's Lasmo for oil exploration in the southern
Caspian Sea, off the Iranian coast, Tehran television reported.
	   The agreement was signed after months of talks between the
National Iranian Oil Co. and the two European companies, the report
said.
	   Under the agreement, exploration operations will be carried out
for 18 months, leading to production, the broadcast said.
	   In a statement issued in London, Lasmo said the agreement also
gives British Petroleum the option to join the consortium at a
later date, but only after obtaining full board approval.
	   It said the exploration cost of 19 million pounds sterling (dlrs
11 million) will be shared equally by Lasmo, Shell and, assuming
board approval is granted, BP.
	   The Iranian oil company will not contribute any capital.
	   Lasmo said that within the first six months, the consortium will
identify prospects where seismic data already exist. Having
selected two prospective areas, the consortium will have a year to
negotiate service agreements for the blocks.
	   It will also acquire seismic data and conduct geological and
geophysical studies over a large and previously unexplored area.
	   The consortium will have preferential rights to select up to
four blocks and a period of 12 months after the study has concluded
to negotiate service agreements, the statement said.

WTO: Supachai ahead in race, but leadership consensus no nearer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi
is leading the race to take the World Trade Organization into the
next century, but members are far from consensus, the officials
overseeing the succession said Monday.
	   The United States and the European Union have yet to back a
candidate, although some of the organization's 132 members are
pressing for a decision to be made by the end of the week.
	   In a report to the world trade body's general council, the
diplomats charged with building a consensus on a successor to the
outgoing director-general, Renato Ruggiero, measured the level of
support for the four candidates.
	   They said former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore had about 75
percent of the level of support afforded to Supachai, while
Moroccan trade ambassador Hassan Abouyoub stood at 50 percent and
former Canadian Trade Minister Roy Maclaren at just less than 30
percent.
	   The WTO had set a mid-December target for choosing a new leader.
	   In a joint statement to the meeting, developing countries in the
WTO said the process should be concluded at the council's meeting
on Friday, even if some countries had not expressed a preference by
then.
	   Ruggiero has announced his intention to step down by the end of
April.

Kazakstan needs millions for nuclear test site cleanup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kazakstan needs at least dlrs 43 million to clean
up lingering health, environmental and economic effects of 40 years
of Soviet nuclear tests at Semipalatinsk, a U.N. official said
Monday.
	   Kazak and international experts are preparing 38 proposed
projects to tackle the aftermath of the 1949-1989 nuclear tests, a
U.N. spokesman said in Almaty, Kazakstan, the Interfax news agency
reported. The report did not give his name.
	   The projects are aimed at improving health care, cleaning up the
environment and revitalizing the economy around Semipalatinsk,
Kazak Natural Resources Minister Serkbek Daukeyev said Monday,
according to Interfax.
	   About 1.6 million people were exposed to high radiation levels
during the 470 tests, more than 100 of which took place above
ground.
	   Kazakstan's cash-strapped government has done little to address
the resulting health problems, and Russia has ignored the issue.
	   Residents who lived in the area during the tests are entitled to
a one-time compensation from Kazakstan's government, but only
56,445 pensioners have received money, the equivalent of dlrs 215
each.
	   The total health and environmental damage from the tests are
unclear. All data collected during the Soviet era were sent to
Moscow and have not been made public.

DaimlerChrysler sets up council for newly merged group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ DaimlerChrysler took one of its first
steps Monday toward integrating its newly merged operations,
setting up a council to define profit and sales targets.
	   The new ``marketing integration council'' will manage the
group's six passenger car brands and its four commercial vehicle
brands, Juergen Schrempp and Bob Eaton, DaimlerChrysler's
co-chairmen, said in a press statement
	   One question the new council will have to resolve is how
DaimlerChrysler will measure profitability. While Daimler-Benz used
return on capital employed as a profitability indicator, Chrysler
looked at return on net assets.
	   Ted Cunningham and James Holden, formerly of Chrysler Corp., and
Kurt Lauk and Dieter Zetsche, formerly of Daimler-Benz, will sit on
the council, the group said.
	   The DaimlerChrysler merger, which took effect Nov. 17, created a
transportation conglomerate ranking fifth in worldwide car and
truck sales and third in total revenues.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The second-ranking diplomat at the
French embassy in Belgrade and two other embassy employees were
killed Monday in a car accident in Kosovo.
	   Gerard Fauveau, the embassy's first counselor, was among those
killed when the black Renault he was riding in collided with a
passenger bus in Besinje, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of
the capital Pristina.
	   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry identified the others as
diplomat Richard Berthaux and security guard Jean-Pierre Latour.
	   Police at the scene said there were no injuries among those on
the bus, which was tipped on its side in a ditch. The cause of the
crash was not immediately clear.
	   The car was apparently en route to Pristina from Belgrade.

EU farm ministers ban four antibiotics in animal feed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union farm ministers on Monday
approved a ban on four widely used antibiotics in animal feed
additives because of fears it would make consumers more vulnerable
to disease, a move that will cost the pharmaceutical industry
several hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
	   The 15 farm ministers unanimously approved the move to phase out
the four antibiotics, with Spain, Portugal and Belgium the only
nations to abstain. The ministers called on the EU's executive
Commission to come with proposals by next June to also ban imports
containing the animal feed additives.
	   ``They weaken the human resistance to medicine,'' said British
Agriculture Minister Nick Brown said of the four products. ``It is
right and it is necessary,'' said German Farm Minister Karl Heinz
Funke.
	   The four antibiotics are widely used as growth promoters in
animal feed but they are also used or closely related to human
medicines. It is feared that once it gets into the human food chain
it diminishes the human resistance to the medical product, forcing
patients to use stronger medicine.
	   The four products concerned are Spiramycin, Virginiamycin,
Tysolin phosphate and Batritracin Zinc.
	   Virginiamycin is manufactured by Pfizer Inc. of the United
States; Spiramycin is manufactured by Rhone-Poulenc SA of France;
Bacitracin Zinc is made by Alpharma AS of Norway; and Tylosin
phosphate is made by Elanco of the United States, a unit of Eli
Lilly and Co.
	   Finland, Denmark and Sweden already banned the use of these
products. The phaseout of the products in the other 12 EU nations
should be completed in the first 6 months of next year.
	   Monday's ban brought to 15 antibiotics that have already been
outlawed in the European Union. The feed additives are primarily
used in pig and poultry production.
	   France especially insisted that the ban should also apply to
meat imports of animals which have used the same antibiotics.
	   ``It also has to apply to third countries. How could we accept
imports if we ban it ourselves,'' asked French Farm Minister Jean
Glavany. ``Public opinion just would not understand,'' he said.
	   Spain said it abstained because there was not sufficient
evidence yet to impose the ban. The major pharmaceutical companies
producing the additives claim likewise and said they will lose an
overall annual market of up to dlrs 300 million.
	   The use of Virginiamycin, Spiramycin, Bacitracin Zinc and
Tylosin phosphate in animal feed accounts for 15 percent of the
total use of antibiotics in the 15-member EU.
	   Brown agreed scientific evidence was not fully conclusive yet.
``But the direction in which (scientific research) goes is clear
enough,'' he said.

Protestant parade banned from Catholic section of bitter Portadown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Fearing riots no matter what it
decided, a government-appointed commission on Monday banned
Northern Ireland's major Protestant organization from marching
through the hostile Catholic section of Portadown this weekend.
	   Up to 10,000 Orange Order members plan to march Saturday from
the center of the staunchly Protestant town to a rural Anglican
church, the same spot where British authorities blocked the
brotherhood's annual July march before it could pass Catholic homes
on Portadown's Garvaghy Road.
	   The seven-member Parades Commission, empowered this year to ban
or restrict traditional Protestant parades, said it must bar
Orangemen once again from ``that highly contentious area, because
no accommodation has been reached with local people.''
	   Orangemen have refused to negotiate with the Garvaghy Road's
protest leader, a former Irish Republican Army prisoner, who since
1995 has organized opposition to the annual parade.
	   The commission noted that the Orangemen were hoping to rally
four times as many people Saturday as marched in July. Since the
organizers then ``showed little capacity to discipline the
participants and their supporters,'' its ruling said, ``we must
conclude that there is a very real prospect of major disorder''
Saturday.
	   In July, Orangemen and their supporters massed round the clock
for a week in the fields surrounding the church, hoping to wear
down the police and British soldiers ranged against them.
	   The Protestants relented after rioting across Northern Ireland
resulted in the burning to death of three young Catholic boys in
another town. But sporadic protests in Portadown and at the church
have since caused many casualties, including the death of a
policeman in October.
	   Portadown's Orange Order spokesman, David Jones, said leaders
were detemined to prevent violence Saturday. He said Orangemen
didn't plan to stay there indefinitely, but would march back to the
church by different routes Dec. 23 and Jan. 2.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair has offered to broker indirect
talks between the two sides, but has yet to receive a response from
either side.

Fire destroys roof, top floor, of Earl Spencer's Cape Town house

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Fire destroyed the roof and top
floor of Earl Spencer's house on Monday after lightning struck its
thatched roof, firemen said.
	   About a dozen firemen and three fire engines were at the house
of Spencer, brother to the late Princess Diana, at 7 p.m. local
time (1700gmt).
	   They had quenched the fire that started about 3:30 p.m.
(1330gmt), said a fireman who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Spencer, a member of the British aristocracy, and his children
were not home when the fire started, but returned soon after. They
left the premises again, according to the fireman.
	   ``Half of the top of the house is gone. It looks pretty bad,''
the fireman said.
	   Reporters at the scene were kept outside a security gate, where
private security guards prevented access to the house. Large trees
blocked the view of the home, located in Constantia, one of Cape
Town's plushest residential areas.
	   It rained heavily in Cape Town most of the day and was still
raining in the evening. But firemen said lightning often strikes
through the wet thatching into dryer layers underneath.
	   Spencer, 34, moved to Cape Town four years ago after complaining
that media attention on his failing marriage and his then-wife's
problems with eating, drugs and alcohol drove him from Britain.
	   Spencer's four children live with their mother, the former
Victoria Lockwood. The couple were divorced in Cape Town last
December amid considerable publicity. She accused him of being a
serial adulterer.

U.S. envoy urges Turkey to meet concerns over Caspian pipeline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A U.S. envoy on Monday urged Turkey to
urgently address concerns of an international consortium over the
financing of a pipeline to carry oil from the Caspian Sea to
Turkey's Mediterranean coast.
	   Richard Morningstar, a U.S. envoy for Caspian energy
development, said he hoped progress would be made over the next few
weeks in offering incentives and credits for the pipeline that
would run from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Turkey's Mediterranean town of
Ceyhan.
	   The oil companies are reluctant to support the project because
of the high cost of the Turkish route and uncertainty over how much
oil the Caspian fields will produce.
	   ``We will make every to effort to see that it takes place,''
said Morningstar after meeting with Turkish Energy Minister Cumhur
Ersumer.
	   A decision from the consortium _ composed of 11 oil companies _
on whether to endorse the pipeline had been expected a month ago.
	   Ersumer said Morningstar was pushing Turkey to take steps that
would reduce the cost and the political and economic risk of such a
huge investment.
	   ``We agreed with them,'' said Ersumer reiterating that the
project would cost dlrs 2.3 billion, cheaper than what the
consortium has forecast.
	   The consortium estimates the cost of the 1,730-kilometer
(1,081-mile) pipeline at dlrs 3.7 billion.
	   The United States has also pledged financial support for
Baku-Ceyhan, including backing from the Export-Import Bank,
political risk insurance from the Overseas Private Investment
Corp., and government-sponsored feasibility studies.
	   The pipeline is a key to the Clinton administration's broader
strategic goals of developing east-west oil and gas transportation
corridors in central Asia, avoiding Russia and Iran.
	   Last week U.S. energy secretary Bill Richardson called the
Baku-Ceyhan the most sensible option to get oil from the
potentially rich Caspian fields to Western markets and said that
low oil prices shouldn't deter the construction.
	   But the companies were reportedly favoring a shorter and cheaper
route, an existing pipeline from Baku to the Georgian Black Sea
port of Supsa, from where the oil would be transferred in tankers
through the Bosporus.
	   Turkey has threatened to restrict such shipments through the
Bosporus on safety and environmental grounds. The waterway bisects
the ancient city of Istanbul.

Two more arrested in murder of Real Sociedad supporter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Two more supporters of Spain's soccer team
Atletico Madrid were arrested for questioning, bringing to five the
number of people detained in connection with the stabbing death of
a Real Sociedad soccer fan, police said Monday.
	   Aitor Zabaleta, 28, died Tuesday after being stabbed in the
chest outside Madrid's Vicente Calderon soccer stadium before a
UEFA Cup match.
	   News reports said that both detainees, whose names and ages have
not been released, belong to Bastion, a neo-fascist splinter group
of Atletico de Madrid's fan club, the Atletico Front.
	   Three Atletico fans, also members of the Bastion group, were
arrested on Friday and two of remain in custody pending further
investigation. The other was released while police continue its
probe to find out who stabbed Zabaleta.
	   Aitor's murder led to the decision by all of Spain's
first-division soccer teams to hold a moment of silence in his
memory before the 14th round games. Real Sociedad's players wore
jerseys with the victim's name on the back.
	   ``Finding the killer of Aitor Zabaleta would be a relief for the
Spanish society and the possibility to punish and apply the weight
of the law against him,'' said Spain's Interior Minister Jaime
Major Oreja on Monday.
	   Soccer clubs were criticized over the weekend for tolerating,
and sometime financing, groups of violent fans.

Report: Abacha gave out ``license to kill''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANK AIGBOGUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A top security official in the regime of
the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha has confessed to involvement in
the killings of several political opponents, including the wife of
Nigeria's most famous political prisoner, Moshood Abiola, news
reports said Monday.
	   Investigators who have been questioning Maj. Hamza Al-Mustapha
say that he has confessed to involvement in executions masterminded
by Abacha and his national security adviser Ismaila Gwarzo, Lagos'
Tell magazine said.
	   It was not clear, however, exactly what Al-Mustapha's role was
in the killings.
	   Mustapha _ once Abacha's chief security officer _ former
Director of Military Intelligence Brig. Gen. Sabo Mohammed and his
deputy, Col. Frank Omenka, were given a ``license to kill,''
Mustapha told investigators during questioning.
	   According to the investigators, Mustapha said Abacha gave him
orders to eliminate Kudirat Abiola, who was shot to death in 1996
when a group of gunmen ambushed her car in Lagos. Her assailants
were never found.
	   Her husband, the flamboyant, wealthy businessman Moshood Abiola,
spearheaded resistance to the military regime. He was jailed by
Abacha in 1994 after he declared himself president on the first
anniversary of presidential elections which he was on the verge of
winning when they were annulled by the military.
	   He died, apparently of heart disease, in detention just days
before his expected release by Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who took
over after Abacha's sudden death in June.
	   Mustapha also allegedly confessed to being involved in planting
a bomb at the Abuja airport, shortly before Abacha's former number
two man, Lt. Gen. Oladipo Diya, was scheduled to travel last
December.
	   The bomb killed a government security guard as he accompanied a
convoy carrying the deputy head of state.
	   Diya was later implicated in a coup plot that is widely believed
to have been trumped up by Abacha to neutralize potential
opponents. Diya remains in prison.
	   The magazine allegations are likely to increase public pressure
on the government to launch a more sweeping investigation into the
late dictator's five-year regime.
	   Scores of people were jailed, abducted, or simply disappeared
under Abacha's regime, which had an appalling human rights record
and which earned Nigeria international pariah status.
	   In recent weeks, Gwarzo has been in jail for his alleged role in
the massive looting of the public treasury while Abacha was head of
state. He was later released.
	   Gwarzo, according to Mustapha, also initiated the assassination
of wealthy Lagos businessman Alfred Rawane, who was gunned down by
unidentified gunmen in his Lagos home three years ago for allegedly
funding opposition activities.

British bumblebee extinct; others species likely to follow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British bumblebee is the latest species to
become extinct here, and a handful of others will follow soon if
the government does not act to save them, the World Wide Fund for
Nature said Monday.
	   Water voles, the high brown fritillary butterfly, pipistrelle
bats, skylarks, gray partridges and the song thrush will all vanish
during the next decade or so without new legislation to protect
them, the conservation group said.
	   Environment Minister Michael Meacher said all five creatures on
the fund's soon-to-be-extinct list are protected by established
action plans, and that he had not yet ``written off'' the bumble
bee.
	   He said it had recently been discovered that the bee was
dependent on red clover, and next year's government accounting of
species would concentrate on unsurveyed sites of the plant.
	   The World Wide Fund for Nature used government statistics to
produce the ``Doomsday list,'' plotting the decline of species and
projecting their extinction dates over the next 20 years.
	   The short-haired bumblebee, last seen near Dungeness, Kent, in
southeastern England, in the early '80s, has followed the
mouse-eared bat, peach-leaved bellflower, Essex emerald moth and
others that have died out in Britain, the wildlife fund said. A
total of 154 plant and animal species are known to have become
extinct in Britain.
	   The current rate of extinction is three species every two years
in Britain and is expected to rise over the next 20 years with the
effects of climate change, escalating development pressures and the
continued threat of insect killing pesticides, which break the food
chain.
	   ``The dramatic decline and extinction of our native species is a
sad reflection of the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act and its
inability to protect our natural heritage,'' said Carol Hatton,
planning officer for wildlife fund. ``We must have stronger legal
protection before its too late.''
	   Meacher insisted the government was acting to prevent the
destruction of habitats.
	   ``We are proposing a much stronger safeguard for sites of
special scientific interest,'' he said in a British Broadcasting
Corp. radio interview Monday.

May 2000 date announced for London's first mayoral election

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Londoners must wait until 2000 to cast their
ballots for their first directly elected mayor, the government said
Monday.
	   The city of London has no central authority, with its 32
sprawling boroughs run by local councils. There is a Lord Mayor of
London, but it is a ceremonial job.
	   The Greater London Authority, overseen by the new mayor, would
control a budget worth several billion pounds (dollars), have
strategic powers over transport and economic development, and also
oversee a revamped Metropolitan Police Authority.
	   Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott set the date for the
election of a mayor and a 25-member Assembly as May 4, 2000, as he
opened debate in the House of Commons on the second reading of the
Greater London Authority Bill.
	   ``Londoners want a world-class government for a world-class
city,'' Prescott said, noting that London is the only world capital
without a citywide administration.
	   Among those expected to run for mayor are Ken Livingstone, a
left-wing Labor Party legislator, and mega-selling novelist Jeffrey
Archer, who is seeking the Conservative Party nomination.

Creatine, considered food, left off IOC banned-substance list
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ International Olympic Committee
officials said Monday that the controversial dietary supplement
creatine would not be added to the IOC's banned-substance list.
	   Head of the IOC medical commission, Prince Alexandre de Merode
said that creatine was considered food and therefore should not be
prohibited.
	   ``You cannot compare it to testosterone or anabolic steroids,''
said de Merode, following an executive board meeting at IOC
headquarters.
	   ``Creatine is food,'' he said. ``You can't prevent people from
eating food.''
	   Creatine, an amino acid protein that is produced naturally in
animals and humans, is marketed as a legal alternative to anabolic
steroids.
	   But linked with short-term problems such as muscle cramping and
dehydration, many National Olympic Committees have been trying to
get creatine added to the IOC's banned substance list.
	   The Italian Olympic Committee's anti-doping investigator, Ugo
Longo, recommended in October that creatine should be banned or
restricted.
	   As for the highly publicized dietary supplement Androstenedione,
de Merode said the IOC was still trying to persuade U.S. Major
League Baseball and the baseball players' union to ban the
substance.
	   Androstenedione, which converts quickly in the body to the male
sex steroid testosterone, can produce a wide array of side effects
when taken in large doses over a prolonged period.
	   In men, increased testosterone has been associated with acne,
breast enlargement, premature balding, abnormal cholesterol levels,
blood clotting disorders, liver tumors, abnormal veins in the liver
that can rupture and cause death, enlarged prostates, shrinking
testicles and decreased sperm counts.
	   The most publicized case of androstenedione use is baseball
slugger Mark McGwire, who set a single season home-run record with
70 homers.
	   McGwire admitted using the muscle-building supplement, which is
legal in major league baseball but is listed as a banned steroid by
the IOC.

Chile confirm plans to suspend military purchases in Britain,
</HEADLINE>
Spain &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ The government said Monday it may suspend
some of Chile's multi-million dollar contracts to purchase military
equipment from Britain and Spain to protest the continued house
arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   Defense Minister Jose Florencio Guzman said the government
considers the move necessary because it feels that the Pinochet
arrest in London on a Spanish warrant left Chile ``without a
judicial protection'' in those countries.
	   ``Any bilateral contract requires a ... a guarantee that it will
be respected,'' Guzman said.
	   He said a commission of government officials and military
officers has been appointed to review Chile's contracts and decide
which ones should be suspended.
	   Chile insists Britain and Spain violated the immunity Pinochet
is entitled to as a member of the Chilean senate and argue he
should be tried at home.
	   Pinochet, wanted in Spain on genocide and torture charges, was
arrested in London on Oct. 16 while recovering from back surgery.
	   Britain's highest court later ruled that the former dictator
does not have immunity, and the British government agreed to allow
proceedings for his extradition to face prosecution in Spain.
	   Among the contracts that may be affected is the dlrs 400-million
purchase of two Scorpene submarines ordered from DCN-Bazan, a
French-Spanish consortium. The contract was signed one year ago.
	   Also, the Chilean army is developing a land-to-land rocket
launcher with Royal Ordance of Britain. Pinochet had been a big
supporter of the project and visited Britain several times to
supervise its progress.
	   While authorities have declined to comment, they have not denied
published reports that the air force already has canceled an order
by a British company.
	   The government has been under pressure from the right wing
opposition, and reportedly also from the military, to cancel all
military purchases in Britain and Spain.
	   Last week, the government announced a series of reprisals
against the two European nations, including pressure on private
airlines to suspend flights to the British Falkland Islands in the
southern Atlantic Ocean.
	   Chile's main airline, LAN Chile, has not said whether it will
accept the travel suspension, and has flown to the archipelago at
least once since the government's announcement.
	   TAP, a smaller regional company in southern Chile, said it will
continue flying medical evacuations and honor charters already
hired.

Guinean president expected to win in West African vote

	   CONAKRY, Guinea _ Watched over by platoons of soldiers and
police, thousands of Guineans walked to polling stations throughout
the country Monday for the second multi-party presidential
elections since independence in 1958.
	   Diplomats reported a heavy, peaceful turnout in the vote, which
was widely expected to be won by President Lansana Conte, who first
seized power in a 1984 coup.
	   The country's land borders, airport and seaports have been
closed to stave off any possible violence, and no traffic was
allowed Monday. Voters, others than those with special government
permits, had to walk to the more than 8,000 polling stations.
	   There were no reports of violence or disturbances by late in the
afternoon. On Saturday, six people are believed to have been killed
in Conakry street clashes after a ruling party rally.
	   Unofficial election monitors dispatched by the U.S. embassy said
there appeared to be heavy participation in the election, though
they had no percentage estimate on the turnout, a top embassy
official said.
	   The monitors spotted some electoral problems _ such as opaque
envelopes in some polling stations that allowed people to see the
color of voters' color-coded ballots _ but felt it had gone much
better than the 1993 election, which was widely criticized by the
opposition.
	   Even Conte's opponents were expecting that Conte would win the
vote, noting his government funding, military support, control of
the broadcast media and a political party that is tightly entwined
with the government.
	   Polls opened at 8 a.m. (0800 GMT) and most closed at 6 p.m.
(1800 GMT), though some, where election materials arrived late,
were expected to remain open for another couple hours. Preliminary
results were expected later this week, though the exact date
remained unclear.
	   Government officials promised free and transparent elections,
dismissing demands by the opposition that the elections be put off
for a month because only 40 percent of the electorate had received
voter cards.
	   Kader Sangari, an Interior Ministry official handling logistical
planning for Monday's vote, said between 95 percent and 98 percent
of voters had received their cards to vote.
	   The opposition also criticized the 1993 presidential elections,
the first multiparty presidential vote since the country gained
independence from France in 1958, saying they had been rigged in
Conte's favor.
	   Conte, who seized power in 1984 after the death of Guinea's
former dictator, Sekou Toure, faces four opponents in Monday's
vote.
	   Alpha Conde, one of two prominent opposition candidates, faced
Conte in the 1993 elections and recently returned from a
self-imposed exile in Senegal. He heads the Rally of the Guinean
People.
	   The other prominent candidate, Mamadou Ba, the leader of the
Union for Progress and Renewal, is believed to have widespread
support in part of the country's interior.
	   The other two candidates are not believed to have much support.
	   Guinea, which has an average per capita income of just a few
hundred dollars a year and an illiteracy rate of up to 80 percent,
is still recovering from Toure's brutal, 26-year regime. Thousands
of people died in Toure's prison camps, and 2 million people fled
the country.
	   While Conte has allowed greater political freedom than was the
case under Toure, his critics say Conte has turned more autocratic
since a military revolt in 1996 by soldiers angry over unpaid
wages.

China to put two democracy campaigners on trial Thursday
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ As part of a swift, determined crackdown, Chinese
authorities on Monday ordered a second leading organizer of a
would-be opposition party put on trial for subversion.
	   Qin Yongmin will go on trial Thursday in Wuhan, the same day his
China Democracy Party colleague, Wang Youcai, faces the same charge
in a courtroom 500 kilometers (300 miles) to the east in Hangzhou.
	   Their twin trials mark the highest-profile prosecutions of
dissidents in two years _ a period in which China improved
relations with the United States and other Western nations and won
praise for improving laws and signing U.N. human rights treaties.
	   Underscoring the ruling Communist Party's renewed determination
to keep its 49-year monopoly on political power, authorities have
detained or questioned nearly 30 members of the China Democracy
Party and ordered Wang and Qin put on trial _ all in the past two
weeks.
	   A third principal member of the opposition group taken into
custody, veteran dissident Xu Wenli, has been accused of
endangering state security, but no trial date has been announced.
	   ``I fear it's going to be soon,'' said Xu's wife, He Xintong.
	   After receiving notice of the trial Monday, Qin Yongmin's family
scrambled to put together a defense. His father, Qin Qingguo, said
he was trying to persuade a lawyer to defend Qin by asserting the
right to association under international treaties.
	   Authorities have frustrated the efforts of Wang's family to find
an attorney. One willing lawyer has been detained three times in
the past two days and was believed to be in custody Monday, the
Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China reported.
	   In China's politically malleable judicial system, high-profile
trials almost always end in guilty verdicts. Defense lawyers are
encouraged to offer their client's confession and remorse in return
for leniency.
	   Qin and Wang are being tried for ``inciting the subversion of
state power'' _ one of the crimes listed under a state security
statute drafted to deal with political dissent.
	   Observers at their trials will be limited. Court officials in
Hangzhou have barred foreign reporters but have not decided if
members of the public may attend, said a Zhejiang provincial
government spokesman who only gave his surname, Bao.
	   Police will allow three members of Qin's family to attend the
trial, his father said.
	   Wang and Qin are among the most respected and active members of
China's dissident community.
	   Wang, a student organizer during the democracy demonstrations
centered in Tiananmen Square in 1989, announced the China Democracy
Party's formation in June.
	   Qin, who edited an underground journal in the Democracy Wall
movement of the late 1970s, supported a party branch in central
Hubei province.
	   China Democracy Party branches were set up in more than a dozen
provinces and major cities, drawing dozens of dissidents and
support from exiles overseas.
	   One long-exiled dissident, Wang Ce, who sneaked into China to
help boost the party's organization, has been charged with
endangering state security, the Information Center reported Monday.
	   Petitioners for the party leaders' release also have been
harassed. A friend of Wang Youcai was believed to have been
detained Monday after gathering signatures from 180 people, the
Information Center said.
	   Twenty-two exiled dissidents released a statement calling on
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan as well as governments and human
rights groups to pressure China to release the dissidents.

Pinochet lawyers making two appeals against extradition decision

plans to cancel British and Spanish arms deals; trims pvs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet's lawyers said Monday they
will challenge a British Cabinet member's decision to allow Spain
to try to extradite him, in addition to seeking to set aside a
ruling by Britain's highest court that he has no immunity from
prosecution.
	   Earlier, a Chilean Boeing 707 took off from an English air base
after waiting for nearly two months to take the 83-year-old general
home.
	   Its departure Sunday from Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire, was
testimony to the long legal battle ahead as the former Chilean
dictator fights extradition on charges of murder and torture during
his 1973-90 rule.
	   In Chile, the government said it plans to suspend
multimillion-dollar arms deals with Britain and Spain to protest
Pinochet's Oct. 16 arrest.
	   He is now under police guard at a rented mansion at Wentworth,
an exclusive residential estate 20 miles (30 kms) west of London.
	   An official Chilean report says 3,197 people, including
Spaniards, were murdered or disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's
secret police after he overthrew an elected Marxist in a violent
coup. But Chile wants Pinochet freed, partly because he is a
senator-for-life in the new democratic government built on
compromise.
	   Pinochet's London attorneys, Kingsley Napley, said they would
ask England's High Court for leave to challenge Home Secretary Jack
Straw's approval of the Spanish extradition request.
	   The firm did not give grounds, but such applications normally
contend a decision was wrong in law or that Straw did not properly
exercise discretionary powers.
	   On Tuesday, a two-day hearing begins in the House of Lords in
which Pinochet's lawyers are seeking to overturn the Lords' earlier
3-2 decision that he had no immunity from prosecution as a former
foreign head of state.
	   Lawyers have complained that Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann, a
judge who ruled against Pinochet, is the unpaid director of the
fundraising arm of Amnesty International, which has campaigned to
have Pinochet brought to trial.
	   On arms deals, Chilean news reports said projects for possible
suspension include Rayo, a land-to-land rocket launcher, being
developed by a British company, Royal Ordnance, and an order for
two submarines from DCN-Bazan, a French-Spanish consortium.
	   Chilean Defense Minister Jose Florencio Guzman, complaining that
Chile is ``without a judicial protection'' in Britain and Spain,
said a commission will decide which contracts will be affected.
	   Britain's Vickers PLC denied Monday a weekend news report that
it had lost a big contract to supply bridge-layers for a Chilean
tank regiment. The company said it had received only a ``cursory
inquiry'' which Chile did not follow up before Pinochet's arrest.

Foe of former Vladivostok mayor named in his place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ex-mayor of Russia's eastern city of
Vladivostok was replaced Monday by a former deputy who he later
dismissed.
	   Viktor Cherepkov was ousted Friday by a decree by President
Boris Yeltsin. Regional governor Yevgeny Nazdratenko named Yuri
Kopylov acting mayor on Monday, Russian news reports said.
	   The developments were the latest in a long history of scandals
and petty squabbling between Cherepkov, Yeltsin and Nazdratenko
that have left Vladivostok's government in shambles.
	   Kopylov was dismissed as deputy mayor last year over differences
with Cherepkov. Kopylov then joined Nazdratenko's camp, and ran
unsuccessfully for mayor this summer, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Kopylov will serve as acting mayor until a new mayor is chosen
in an election Jan. 17.
	   A Cherepkov aide has charged that Kopylov misappropriated dlrs
1.7 million while in office. An investigation was launched.
	   In 1994, Nazdratenko kicked Cherepkov from office on corruption
charges. Cherepkov fought back, and Yeltsin reinstated him as mayor
in 1996 after the courts found him innocent of corruption.
	   Cherepkov's term ended in July, but subsequent mayoral elections
were declared void when voters rejected all candidates to protest a
court's last-minute decision to bar him from running. Cherepkov
remained in office.
	   On Friday, Yeltsin fired Cherepkov, saying he held office
illegally because his term had run out months before.
	   Cherepkov filed suit against Yeltsin for the ouster, and the
ex-mayor and dozens of his supporters protested his removal outside
city hall Monday. Cherepkov also registered Monday for next month's
mayoral election.
	   Vladivostok, a city of 800,000 people located 6,400 kilometers
(4,000 miles) east of Moscow, suffers from periodic cuts of water,
heat and electricity. City services like public transport,
emergency medical help and trash removal are sometimes put on hold
when neither mayor nor governor agrees to pay the bills.

Tudjman calls on unity against foreign pressure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said
Monday his country was eager to join the Western institutions but
not at the expense of the country's national interests. He accused
international officials of seeking to destabilize Croatia.
	   Calling for unity among the people and the army in facing
pressure from the West, Tudjman said: ``We must be ready for even a
long war so we should never, and at no costs, be forced to accept
capitulation.''
	   The United States and its allies have been insisting that
Croatia should improve its treatment of Serbs, fully respect
neighboring Bosnia's borders and improve its democracy record prior
to being admitted to Western institutions.
	   Tudjman's speech appeared to indicate that he was not willing to
make further concessions.
	   ``We are eager to join the Euro-Atlantic bodies, but that should
not be ... our first and only aim,'' he said. ``Our first and only
aim is to create such a military force which is in the interest of
the state.''
	   He said that ``international factors, who have intelligence
services here ... all those representatives of Europe, America, all
sorts of humanitarian and news agencies'' were working on
destabilizing Croatia.
	   Some of them gave up, but those who still are against Croatia's
independence, ``have not given up their policy. They just want to
achieve it by more subtle and long-term methods.''
	   Tudjman, who in 1991 led the country to independence from old
Yugoslavia, had often emphasized that Croatia has enemies abroad
and within, and that only his party's rule could secure its
independence.
	   His party is nevertheless losing popularity, ahead of the new
elections due next year, and his speech, most fiery to date, could
also be seen as an attempt to rally Croats behind him on the
pretext of national interests.
	   His emphasize on the importance of the army could also boost
fears that his party would not accept an election defeat.
	   ``The establishment and the strength of Croatian state had
depended on the army and it will be so in the future, no matter how
the situation will develop,'' he said.
	   Tudjman also further told the soldiers that the international
war crimes tribunal in The Hague, which has 12 Bosnian Croats in
custody, ``is preparing indictments for you too, for all of us.''
	   The tribunal already wants ``five or six generals'' from Croatia
and Bosnia, he said, suggesting that moves also are aimed at
harming Croatia.
	   Tudjman also referred to the country's Serbs, who made up 12
percent of the population and who in 1991 rebelled when Croatia
declared its independence from Yugoslavia. During the six-month
war, they seized the third of the country, but the government
re-took the lands back in two 1995 offensives. About 200,000 Serbs
fled the country, and only up to 50,000 have returned so far.
	   Although Croatia approved their return, ``there won't be 12
percent of them ... anymore,'' Tudjman said.
	   He said that if the Serbs will make ``three or five percent'' in
the future, ``that would not jeopardize Croatian state.''

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Youths angered by the police shooting
death of a teen-age car thief showered rocks and chunks of concrete
on officers Monday evening, while bus drivers were on strike to
protest a previous night of violence.
	   Small groups of youths stood atop buildings in a working-class
neighborhood in this southwestern city as they pelted riot police,
who responded with tear gas grenades.
	   A French radio journalist was stabbed in the stomach but in
stable condition, and six police officers were injured the day
before.
	   The violence was the latest outbreak resulting from tension
between French police and disaffected youth from poor immigrant
families in many cities in France. Transit drivers in dozens of
cities have gone on strike in recent months to protest the
violence.
	   The rioting in Toulouse began after police shot and killed
Habib, a 17-year-old youth from a poor neighborhood who was trying
to steal a BMW before dawn Sunday.
	   At least 150 police on Sunday faced off up to 200 youths in a
working class district with an unemployment rate of 35 percent. The
angry youths threw stones and firebombs at security forces.
	   Two police were being detained for questioning in the shooting,
and authorities were awaiting the results of an autopsy on the
youth planned Monday evening. The officers contended the shooting
was accidental.
	   Authorities were also searching for the youth's accomplice in
the attempted car theft.
	   Meanwhile, many Toulouse commuters faced a day without public
transit after bus drivers walked off the job to protest violence
against them.
	   The drivers justified their walkout by saying it wasn't safe to
work. Striking drivers also picketed the local bus depot in
Toulouse, a city of 350,000 people.
	   The strikers also said the driver of the bus that was set on
fire was attacked by rioters. However, management said the driver
was stuck by glass after the windshield was shattered by a baseball
bat.
	   Officials on Monday closed the subway stations in the
working-class neighborhoods of La Reynerie and Belle-Fontaine to
avoid vandalism.
	   Toulouse was one of the cities where violence broke out between
poor youths and soccer fans during the World Cup last summer.

Clinton asserts right of Palestinians to 'their own land'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reax from National Religious Party. &QL;

 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ On the first visit of a U.S.
president to Palestinian territory, President Bill Clinton told
Palestinians Monday they are free to ``determine their own destiny
on their own land.''
	   He then witnessed a dramatic show of hands by Palestine National
Council members affirming revocation of Palestinian charter
provisions that deny Israel's right to exist. Israel immediately
accepted the unusual action as sufficient to end the issue.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat declared that through Clinton
``peace will prevail in the Middle East.''
	   Clinton applauded Arafat for making bold moves toward peace with
Israel and said it was time to think harder about ways to cement
the peace and ensure a more prosperous future for all Palestinians.
	   ``For too many Palestinians, lives are hard, jobs are scarce,''
Clinton said in an address to the Palestine National Council after
its members voted nearly unanimously on the charter issue.
	   ``I know the way is often difficult and frustrating, but you
have come to this point through a commitment to peace and
negotiations,'' Clinton said. ``You reaffirmed that commitment
today. I believe it is the only way to fulfill the aspiration of
your people.''
	   Palestinians look to Clinton's visit for a morale boost in their
quest for an independent state.
	   ``Sometimes it takes more courage and more strength to make
peace than it does to continue war,'' Clinton said earlier in an
exchange of remarks with Arafat at a luncheon in his honor at a
Gaza City beach resort.
	   But Nissim Smoliansky, a member of the right-wing National
Religious Party, said Clinton seemed to deliberately phrase his
statements to sound as if he was supporting statehood.
	   ``For us it's not good, because there were times when the United
States would firmly say they were against Palestinian statehood and
now they don't say it,'' Smoliansky said. ``We lost a lot.''

Haiti's Duvalier says his conscience is clear and that he's not a
</HEADLINE>
fugitive &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Ousted dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier spoke out in a radio interview Monday, saying his
conscience is clear and denying he is a fugitive from justice.
	   ``I am not afraid,'' Duvalier said, speaking by telephone to a
reporter in New York City for the private Radio Galaxie in Haiti.
``My conscience is clear.''
	   Encouraged by the arrest in Britain of former Chilean military
ruler Augusto Pinochet, Haitian-born photographer Gerald Bloncourt
founded a committee Dec. 5 to bring Duvalier to trial for crimes
against humanity.
	   Duvalier, who lives in France, dismissed reports that he is a
fugitive from justice as rumors intended to discredit him.
	   ``I have not been convicted. No suit has been filed against
me,'' he said.
	   An interview with the French weekly VSD will appear this week
and clarify his situation, he said.
	   The Haitian government, which has encouraged Haitians to file
lawsuits in Haiti against the former dictator, has assigned an
investigatory judge to the Duvalier case. But until now no one has
filed a criminal suit.
	   Fearful of reprisal by Duvalier sympathizers, victims are not
likely to come forward in a rush.
	   Moreover, France and Haiti have never signed an extradition
treaty, a French diplomat told The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity.
	   Reports that French police are actively seeking Duvalier are
false, the diplomat said, but if French victims file suit, Duvalier
could be tried in France.
	   Named president for life at age 19 following the death of his
father in 1971, Duvalier, 47, has lived in France since February
1986, when a popular uprising forced him into exile.
	   ``I decided to leave Haiti in 1986 to avoid a blood bath,'' said
Duvalier, reasserting his innocence of human rights violations.
	   His father, Francois, known as ``Papa Doc,'' had ruled Haiti
with an iron hand since 1957 with the help of the Tontons Macoutes,
his private militia. Tens of thousands of people were massacred and
tortured to death during the 31-year father-and-son dynasty.

 &UR; Holbrooke to visit Belgrade amid rising tension in Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ United States envoy Richard Holbrooke is
to visit Belgrade Tuesday amid rising tension between Serbs and
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   When asked if he would travel to the Yugoalv capital, Holbrooke
nodded affirmatively after a meeting here with Greece's defense
minister.
	   Sources close to Holbrooke have for two days been saying that
the American envoy would travel to Belgrade after visiting Athens.
	   Holbrooke brokered a deal on Oct. 12 with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to end fighting in the Serb province without
threatened NATO airstrikes.
	   But the agreement is looking increasingly shaky, with frequent
clashes reported between the two sides.
	   On Monday, Yugoslav army troops killed at least 30 armed ethnic
Albanians and wounded 12 others in border clashes, the Serb-run
Media Center reported. It was the greatest single number of
casualties since the October agreement.
	   Hundreds have been killed and an estimated 300,000 left homeless
since February, when Milosevic launched a crackdown against
separatist rebels in Kosovo. Ethnic Albanians comprise about 90
percent of the province's population of 2 million.
	   Both sides have rejected proposals for a political settlement
made by U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who also planned to travel to
Belgrade Tuesday for talks with Serbian government authorities.
	   Although a de-facto cease-fire generated by the October accord
has reduced bloodshed, there are fears renewed fighting will
explode in Kosovo again unless a political solution is found by
spring.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's tense standoff between
Serbian forces and separatist rebels exploded Monday in the
deadliest reported clash since an October truce _ a five-hour
battle in which border guards were said to have killed dozens of
guerrillas.
	   The pre-dawn clash along Kosovo's southwestern border with
Albania resulted in Yugoslav army troops killing at least 30 armed
ethnic Albanians and wounding 12 trying to enter the country
illegally, the Serb-run Media Center reported.
	   Hours later, according to ethnic Albanian sources, heavy
detonations and shooting were heard from the area of three nearby
villages sealed off by Serb police.
	   Details of the fighting could not be independently confirmed.
International monitors confirmed the clash but said they were
uncertain about the death toll.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels, who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence, have frequently armed themselves in neighboring
Albania.
	   The worst reported violence in Kosovo in more than two months
casts further gloom on stalled diplomacy to bring lasting peace to
the Serbian province, where many believe a resumption of full-scale
fighting is inevitable.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since an Oct. 12
peace agreement brokered by U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke halted
months of fighting in the separatist province in southern Serbia.
	   Holbrooke is expected in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade on
Tuesday from Athens. But after two months of failed shuttle
diplomacy, chances of mediating an end to the continuing violence
seem unlikelier than ever.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule, while the rebels say they won't
accept anything short of outright independence. Serbia, meanwhile,
refuses to consider anything more than partial autonomy for the
predominantly ethnic Albanian province.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who met with ethnic Albanian
negotiators in Pristina on Monday and plans talks in Belgrade with
government officials on Tuesday, has seen his proposals for a
political settlement rejected by both sides.
	   The Serb Media Center report said armed ethnic Albanians were
trying to enter Kosovo from Albania when the shootout erupted at 2
a.m. Monday near Gorozup and Liken, 70 kilometers (45 miles)
southwest of Pristina.
	   Yugoslav soldiers confiscated arms and other material that the
Albanians were trying to smuggle in, according to the Serb Media
Center report, which could not be independently confirmed.
	   Municipal authorities in nearby Prizren were quoted as saying
that all those killed and wounded were wearing camouflage uniforms
with the insignia of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. Eight
Albanians were killed in a border clash near the same area on Dec.
3.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is assembling a force of 2,000 unarmed peace verifiers under the
terms of the Oct. 12 agreement, had no immediate details or comment
on Monday's violence. The OSCE has previously condemned the
continuing violence and blamed both sides.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
were left homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
launched a crackdown against separatist rebels in February.
	   Meanwhile, a delegation of Kosovo's Serbs arrived in Pristina to
plead with international peace monitors to find their relatives who
disappeared five months ago.
	   About 50 Serbs met with Gabriel Keller, deputy head of the
2,000-strong peace mission led by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   Keller received a list of the missing people whom the Serbs
believe were kidnapped by the KLA rebels, and promised that the
OSCE would ``try its best to find traces of the missing.''
	   In another development, the second-ranking diplomat at the
French embassy in Belgrade and two other embassy employees were
killed Monday in a car accident in Kosovo.
	   French officials said Gerard Fauveau, the embassy's first
counselor, fellow diplomat Richard Berthaux and embassy security
guard Jean-Pierre Latour were killed when their car collided with a
passenger bus in Besinje, just north of Pristina.

Plans to cut about 3,900 more tobacco jobs worldwide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout with additional 2,900 job cuts overseas, stock
price, more changes at Nabisco. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By SKIP WOLLENBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ RJR Nabisco Inc. is cutting an additional 3,900
tobacco jobs worldwide as it adjusts to changing competitive
conditions in the United States and Russia, its two biggest
markets.
	   About 1,000 of the planned cuts disclosed today will come from
its domestic R.J. Reynolds Tobacco business while the remaining
2,900 will be in Russia and other nations that were formerly part
of the Soviet Union.
	   The cuts represent 15.7 percent of its global tobacco work force
of 8,800 domestic and 16,000 international employees of the
Winston-Salem, N.C.-based company. Reynolds' cigarette brands
include Winston, Camel and Salem.
	   The domestic job cuts by the nation's second biggest cigarette
company reflect RJR's expectation that it may sell fewer cigarettes
in the United States because of a 45 cent a pack price hike imposed
after last month's mammoth legal settlement with the states.
	   The international cuts reflect the depressed conditions in
Russia, RJR's single biggest foreign market for cigarettes, and
other former Soviet nations. RJR's tobacco sales volume is
approaching what it was before an economic collpase there in
August, but it is selling fewer high-profit premium smokes and more
of the cheaper brands.
	   Meanwhile, Nabisco Holdings Corp, which is 80.6 percent owned by
RJR, announced it will also close more plants and eliminate jobs
worldwide in a bid to be more competitive. It declined to offer
specific numbers.
	   As a result of the moves in the tobacco and food businesses, RJR
expects to charge a total of $348 million, or $1.07 a share,
against earnings in the fourth quarter. It said the savings could
reach $175 million a year.
	   In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, RJR shares
were up 25 cents at $28.56.
	   The charge covers costs associated with eliminating about 1,300
domestic tobacco jobs including 315 cuts announced last month.
	   R.J. Reynolds and four other tobacco companies agreed last month
to pay $206 billion over 25 years to settle claims by 46 states for
health costs for treating sick smokers. Following that agreement,
Reynolds and other cigarette makers raised prices by 45 cents a
pack.
	   ``We knew when we agreed to resolve the state tobacco litigation
that the domestic tobacco company would have to make enormous
sacrifices financially and operationally,'' said Steven F.
Goldstone, RJR's chairman and chief executive.
	   Andrew J. Schindler, RJR's president and chief executive, said
it ``is imperative that RJR realign its business, given the
potential for cigarette volume declines and financial payments
associated with the settlement. We are taking the steps necessary
to ensure that RJR is competitive in the domestic market.''
	   The U.S. job cuts are expected to occur next year and affect
various departments in the company, the statement said.
	   Goldstone said tobacco job cuts and unspecificed plant closings
in Russia and other former Soviet Union nations should help that
business ``get these problems behind them, stabilize earnings and
resume growth next year.''
	   The cuts at Nabisco are expected to affect mainly overseas
operations, and are the second phase of a restructuring at that
business which makes Ritz crackers and Snackwell's low-fat snack
line.
	   Nabisco will take a $124 million pretax charge, or 35 cents a
share, in the fourth quarter and spend $16 million on restructuring
over the next year.
	   In the first phase of the restructuring, Nabsico announced in
June it would take a $406 million charge and spend $118 million in
restructuring.
	   Nabisco said the latest restructuring is expected to save the
company $18 million in 1999 and $45 million a year after that.

In Canada's frigid north, warming trend seen as foe, not friend
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Graphic CANADA WARMING &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Global warming might seem like a treat for
Canada's frigid far north, perhaps even opening the ice-blocked
Northwest Passage to east-west shipping. New research, however,
depicts the expected thaw as far more of a threat than a boon.
	   Displaced wildlife, increased pollution risks, a thaw of the
permafrost that could destabilize infrastructure across the
Canadian sub-Arctic _ these are among the many perils detailed in a
wide-ranging climate-change study released by Canada's environment
department.
	   The study expresses particular concern for the region's
indigenous people, the Inuit, who could find their hunting prey out
of reach, their water supplies contaminated and their coastal
communities subjected to erosion from seas no longer covered by
ice.
	   ``Northern indigenous people, already one of the more vulnerable
segments of Canadian society, would be affected by ecosystem shifts
that may be outside the limits of historical experience,'' says the
Canada Country Study, compiled by dozens of government, academic
and industry experts.
	   There is nothing hypothetical about temperature increases in the
far north. In the northwest corner of the Northwest Territories,
where the Mackenzie River flows into the Beaufort Sea, temperatures
this year have been 9 degrees above normal _ among the highest
jumps anywhere during an unusually warm year.
	   ``Northerners are obviously looking for ways to adapt,'' said
Helen Fast, a Manitoba-based expert who co-authored a chapter of
the study focusing on the far north.
	   ``They're probably ahead of us southerners because they see the
problem as a reality. It's an immediate concern.''
	   According to the study, the warming trend will reduce the size
and stability of ice fields where much of the Inuit community
hunts, and could push many species out of traditional habitats.
Eventually, forests could spread much farther north, taking range
land from some of the world's biggest caribou herds.
	   If less fresh meat is available, the Inuit would likely
compensate with less nutritious food, increasing the risk of
obesity, diabetes and vitamin deficiencies, the study warns.
	   The thaw has already affected animals. Fast said the fur of
mammals has dropped in quality as the temperature warms.
	   Canadian Wildlife Service scientist reported last week that
polar bears around Hudson Bay are 90 to 220 pounds lighter than 30
years ago, apparently because earlier ice-melting has meant less
chance to gorge on seal pups.
	   The thaw of the rock-hard permafrost under the tundra could
wreak widespread chaos _ destabilizing roads, bridges, buildings
and oil pipelines and disrupting transportation.
	   Fast said some coastal communities already are noticing effects
of erosion as the ocean _ covered by ice for shorter periods _
generates greater wave action. In Tuktoyaktuk, a town near the
mouth of the Mackenzie River, several buildings have been lost to
erosion, she said.

Ukraine's population decreasing steadily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's population has shrunk by 2
million people since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, and the
rate of decline is growing, the health minister said Monday.
	   The country's population, currently at about 50 million people,
is expected to contract by another 2 million by as early as 2002,
Andriy Serdiuk said, according to the independent UNIAN news
agency.
	   People over 60 years old constitute 20 percent of the country's
population.
	   Demographers blame rising mortality rates, low birth rates and
falling life expectancy in Ukraine and some other former Soviet
republics on declining health care in recent years and protracted
economic turmoil that has left millions impoverished.
	   Serdiuk said more than 6 million Ukrainians suffer from heart
disease, 1.2 million have mental illnesses, and 800,000 are
alcoholics.
	   He said these factors ``significantly influence'' the average
life expectancy in Ukraine and will continue to push it lower.
	   Ukrainian demographers say life expectancy is 62.3 years for men
and 73.2 for women _ nine years behind Western nations and 12 years
behind Japan.

Finns send winter clothes for 10,000 Russians in Murmansk area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Helping their neighbors fend off the
bitter chill, Finland sent winter clothes for 10,000 people Monday
to the northwestern Russian province of Murmansk.
	   The 14 tons of clothes from the Red Cross are for retirees, the
unemployed, single-parent families and families caring for the
sick.
	   The Finnish Red Cross is also providing medicine, food and other
aid to hospitals, nurseries, schools and nursing homes in the
Murmansk area and further south in Karelia near the Finnish border.
	   Later this month, it plans to send 6{ tons of clothes to
Karelia.
	   This year, Finland has pledged $1.6 million in emergency aid to
help the needy across its 790-mile border with Russia, channeled
mostly through the Red Cross.
	   In September, Murmansk provincial governor Yuri Yevdokimov
appealed to Finland, Sweden and Norway for food supplies.

Ukraine shutting down Chernobyl's lone reactor for repairs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The only remaining reactor at the Chernobyl
nuclear plant was being shut down Monday for long-needed repairs,
officials said.
	   Output at Chernobyl's Reactor No. 3 was being reduced during the
day and would be completely halted at midnight, according to the
Nuclear Regulation Administration, Ukraine's nuclear safety agency.
	   The reactor is the only one still used at Chernobyl, the site of
the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986. It has had frequent
malfunctions, and has been stopped many times since major repairs
were completed in May.
	   It had been due to be shut down Dec. 1 to repair and upgrade
safety equipment, using $118 million provided by the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development.
	   But with Ukraine facing energy shortages this winter, the
government decided to delay repairs until Dec. 15, saying it would
shut down Chernobyl's reactor only after a different reactor was
restarted.
	   On Sunday, a reactor at the Zaporizhia plant that had been idle
for several months was restarted and was being brought up to full
capacity, said the state-owned nuclear energy company Energoatom.
	   Reactor No. 3 has been Chernobyl's only working reactor since
1996, and plans call for the plant to be shut down entirely by
2000.
	   The plant had four reactors. One was closed in 1996, another was
shut down after a 1991 fire, and the fourth was destroyed in the
explosion and fire in 1986.
	   Ukraine has five nuclear power plants that account for more than
40 percent of the country's electricity production.

Kazakstan needs millions for nuclear test site cleanup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kazakstan needs at least dlrs 43 million to clean
up lingering health, environmental and economic effects of 40 years
of Soviet nuclear tests at Semipalatinsk, a U.N. official said
Monday.
	   Kazak and international experts are preparing 38 proposed
projects to tackle the aftermath of the 1949-1989 nuclear tests, a
U.N. spokesman said in Almaty, Kazakstan, the Interfax news agency
reported. The report did not give his name.
	   The projects are aimed at improving health care, cleaning up the
environment and revitalizing the economy around Semipalatinsk,
Kazak Natural Resources Minister Serkbek Daukeyev said Monday,
according to Interfax.
	   About 1.6 million people were exposed to high radiation levels
during the 470 tests, more than 100 of which took place above
ground.
	   Kazakstan's cash-strapped government has done little to address
the resulting health problems, and Russia has ignored the issue.
	   Residents who lived in the area during the tests are entitled to
a one-time compensation from Kazakstan's government, but only
56,445 pensioners have received money, the equivalent of dlrs 215
each.
	   The total health and environmental damage from the tests are
unclear. All data collected during the Soviet era were sent to
Moscow and have not been made public.

Foe of former Vladivostok mayor named in his place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ex-mayor of Russia's eastern city of
Vladivostok was replaced Monday by a former deputy who he later
dismissed.
	   Viktor Cherepkov was ousted Friday by a decree by President
Boris Yeltsin. Regional governor Yevgeny Nazdratenko named Yuri
Kopylov acting mayor on Monday, Russian news reports said.
	   The developments were the latest in a long history of scandals
and petty squabbling between Cherepkov, Yeltsin and Nazdratenko
that have left Vladivostok's government in shambles.
	   Kopylov was dismissed as deputy mayor last year over differences
with Cherepkov. Kopylov then joined Nazdratenko's camp, and ran
unsuccessfully for mayor this summer, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Kopylov will serve as acting mayor until a new mayor is chosen
in an election Jan. 17.
	   A Cherepkov aide has charged that Kopylov misappropriated dlrs
1.7 million while in office. An investigation was launched.
	   In 1994, Nazdratenko kicked Cherepkov from office on corruption
charges. Cherepkov fought back, and Yeltsin reinstated him as mayor
in 1996 after the courts found him innocent of corruption.
	   Cherepkov's term ended in July, but subsequent mayoral elections
were declared void when voters rejected all candidates to protest a
court's last-minute decision to bar him from running. Cherepkov
remained in office.
	   On Friday, Yeltsin fired Cherepkov, saying he held office
illegally because his term had run out months before.
	   Cherepkov filed suit against Yeltsin for the ouster, and the
ex-mayor and dozens of his supporters protested his removal outside
city hall Monday. Cherepkov also registered Monday for next month's
mayoral election.
	   Vladivostok, a city of 800,000 people located 6,400 kilometers
(4,000 miles) east of Moscow, suffers from periodic cuts of water,
heat and electricity. City services like public transport,
emergency medical help and trash removal are sometimes put on hold
when neither mayor nor governor agrees to pay the bills.

Activists protest EBRD financing of Ukrainian nuclear reactors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Environmental activists in several European
capitals demonstrated Monday at offices of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, protesting its possible plans to
finance two nuclear reactors in Ukraine.
	   Ukraine wants to complete the reactors at the Khmelnytsky and
Rivne power plants to compensate for the planned closing of the
Chernobyl nuclear plant. The government has promised to close
Chernobyl, site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, by 2000.
	   About 40 representatives from environmental groups picketed the
EBRD's headquarters in London for two hours, and a similar number
of protesters demonstrated at the bank's office in the Moldovan
capital, Chisinau, the EBRD's London office said.
	   A smaller number of demonstrators protested in Kiev, Prague and
Warsaw, holding placards that called on the EBRD not to fund the
completion of the reactors.
	   Organizers of the protest in Kiev said similar pickets were
planned for Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia and other
countries.
	   The former Soviet republic has said it does not have the money
to finish the reactors and has sought help from the EBRD and
Western nations.
	   EBRD President Horst Koehler said in Kiev on Saturday that the
bank was considering a loan for the two reactors as soon as it sees
proof that the project will be profitable.
	   However, Ukraine's decision to complete the reactors has
prompted numerous protests from environmental groups in Ukraine and
neighboring countries.
	   Environmentalists say Ukraine should drop the dlrs 1.2 billion
project altogether because of the dangers of nuclear energy and
radiation fallout in Ukraine and nearby countries in case of a
serious accident.
	   But the protests have had little influence on the government,
which has warned repeatedly that it would not shut down Chernobyl
until the two reactors are finished.
	   The reactors at Rivne and Khmelnytsky are more than 80 percent
completed. Construction was halted after the 1991 Soviet collapse,
first because of a lack of funds and later because of a
parliamentary moratorium on the construction of new nuclear
facilities.
	   Ukraine's five nuclear plants have 14 operational reactors,
which account for nearly half the country's electricity production.
	   The last functioning reactor at Chernobyl was scheduled to be
shut down for repairs Monday night.

Clinton asserts right of Palestinians to 'their own land'

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu quote. &QL;

 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ On the first visit of a U.S.
president to Palestinian territory, President Bill Clinton told
Palestinians Monday they are free to ``determine their own destiny
on their own land.''
	   He then witnessed a dramatic show of hands by Palestine National
Council members affirming revocation of Palestinian charter
provisions that deny Israel's right to exist. Israel immediately
accepted the unusual action as sufficient to end the issue.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat declared that through Clinton
``peace will prevail in the Middle East.''
	   Clinton applauded Arafat for making bold moves toward peace with
Israel and said it was time to think harder about ways to cement
the peace and ensure a more prosperous future for all Palestinians.
	   ``For too many Palestinians, lives are hard, jobs are scarce,''
Clinton said in an address to the Palestine National Council after
its members voted nearly unanimously on the charter issue.
	   ``I know the way is often difficult and frustrating, but you
have come to this point through a commitment to peace and
negotiations,'' Clinton said. ``You reaffirmed that commitment
today. I believe it is the only way to fulfill the aspiration of
your people.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was satisfied
with the vote. ``This will lead to a real peace, a lasting peace,
not a minute-long peace,'' he said at a news conference.

 &UR; Iranian police report arrests in serial killings of dissidents &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with arrests in killings reported; changes overline,

 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian authorities on Monday reported the
first arrests in the recent serial killings of dissidents, which
have terrified intellectuals opposed to hard-liners in the ruling
clergy.
	   Iran radio quoted an unnamed spokesman of the judiciary as
saying that police have arrested ``some of the killers.'' It said
details will be released later.
	   The detainees were connected with ``the recent serial killings
in Iran,'' the radio said without elaborating. Judiciary officials
were not immediately available for comment.
	   Meanwhile, the official daily, Iran, said two other political
activists still are missing: Pirouz Davani, who led a small
political group called the United Left, and Rostami Hamedani, a
little known activist allied with Davani. Iran gave no other
details.
	   Earlier Monday, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
said ``the killing of citizens, whatever their beliefs may be, was
a crime.''
	   Khamenei leans towards hard-line clergymen who have been the
target of criticism of Iranian liberals, including the three
writers and two opposition activists who died over the past month
under mysterious circumstances.
	   The conservative clergymen are opposed to moderate President
Mohammad Khatami's attempts at social and political reforms.
	   Hard-line activists and vigilantes have often resorted to
violence against Khatami's supporters, but nobody has accused them
of being behind the killings.
	   The hard-liners themselves have blamed unnamed foreign agencies
and even an exiled Iranian opposition group. Khamenei repeated that
line Monday.
	   The killings are ``the work of the enemies and a plot against
the Islamic system,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency
quoted him as saying.
	   One opposition writer told The Associated Press that the
killings have spread panic among dissidents.
	   ``Some of our intellectual friends have been trying to keep a
low profile by moving out of their homes into the homes of friends
or relatives,'' the writer, Houshang Golshiri, said in a telephone
interview.
	   Golshiri was collaborating with seven others, including two of
the dead writers _ Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh and Mohammad Mokhtari _
to establish a writers' association.
	   Pouyandeh and Mokhtari were summoned by a court about two months
ago to answer questions about their activities. Their bodies were
found dumped on the outskirts of Tehran. They were apparently
strangled.
	   Another writer, Majid Sharif, was also found dead after
disappearing from home. The head of an Iranian opposition group,
Dariush Foruhar, and his wife, Parvaneh, were found stabbed to
death in their home on Nov. 22.
	   President Khatami said in a statement Monday that the government
was determined to bring the killers to justice.
	   He said there was ``high hope'' that a special investigative
team he set up would ``soon have something to report to the
nation.''
	   The moderate Zan daily published a telling cartoon this week on
the plight of dissident writers in Iran: A magician tries but fails
to make his subject vanish. Then a hand offers the magician a pen.
``Give him this and he's finished,'' says the unidentified owner of
the hand.

In Canada's frigid north, warming trend seen as foe, not friend

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout to add metric conversions; No Pick Up &QL; 
 &UR; AP Graphic CANADA WARMING &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Global warming might seem like a treat for
Canada's frigid far north, perhaps even opening the ice-blocked
Northwest Passage to east-west shipping. New research, however,
depicts the expected thaw as far more of a threat than a boon.
	   Displaced wildlife, increased pollution risks, a thaw of the
permafrost that could destabilize infrastructure across the
Canadian sub-Arctic _ these are among the many perils detailed in a
wide-ranging climate-change study released by Canada's environment
department.
	   The study expresses particular concern for the region's
indigenous people, the Inuit, who could find their hunting prey out
of reach, their water supplies contaminated and their coastal
communities subjected to erosion from seas no longer covered by
ice.
	   ``Northern indigenous people, already one of the more vulnerable
segments of Canadian society, would be affected by ecosystem shifts
that may be outside the limits of historical experience,'' says the
Canada Country Study, compiled by dozens of government, academic
and industry experts.
	   There is nothing hypothetical about temperature increases in the
far north. In the northwest corner of the Northwest Territories,
where the Mackenzie River flows into the Beaufort Sea, temperatures
this year have been 9 degrees F (5 degrees C) above normal _ among
the highest jumps anywhere during an unusually warm year.
	   ``Northerners are obviously looking for ways to adapt,'' said
Helen Fast, a Manitoba-based expert who co-authored a chapter of
the study focusing on the far north.
	   ``They're probably ahead of us southerners because they see the
problem as a reality. It's an immediate concern.''
	   According to the study, the warming trend will reduce the size
and stability of ice fields where much of the Inuit community
hunts, and could push many species out of traditional habitats.
Eventually, forests could spread much farther north, taking range
land from some of the world's biggest caribou herds.
	   If less fresh meat is available, the Inuit would likely
compensate with less nutritious food, increasing the risk of
obesity, diabetes and vitamin deficiencies, the study warns.
	   The thaw has already affected animals. Fast said the fur of
mammals has dropped in quality as the temperature warms.
	   Canadian Wildlife Service scientist reported last week that
polar bears around Hudson Bay are 90 to 220 pounds (40 to 100
kilograms) lighter than 30 years ago, apparently because earlier
ice-melting has meant less chance to gorge on seal pups.
	   The thaw of the rock-hard permafrost under the tundra could
wreak widespread chaos _ destabilizing roads, bridges, buildings
and oil pipelines and disrupting transportation.
	   Fast said some coastal communities already are noticing effects
of erosion as the ocean _ covered by ice for shorter periods _
generates greater wave action. In Tuktoyaktuk, a town near the
mouth of the Mackenzie River, several buildings have been lost to
erosion, she said.

NBA lockout claims 100 league jobs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TOPS with league saying 100 jobs lost &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The U.S. National Basketball Association has
lost 100 employees during a lockout, and its workforce is expected
to shrink even more.
	   The losses represent more than 10 percent of the NBA's
employees. League spokesman Brian McIntyre called the reductions
through attrition ``significant.''
	   ``And we expect that to continue,'' he said. ``We have had a
hiring freeze and payroll freeze since July 1.''
	   He said those who left their jobs worked in various departments
in a variety of positions. All of them, he added, left voluntarily.
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit _ or lock out
_ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   McIntyre, noting commissioner David Stern has not drawn his
salary during the lockout, said the number of league employees is
down to 750.
	   Another new twist was added to the lockout Monday as Newsweek
magazine reported that some players believe race is playing a
factor in negotiations.
	   The union's leadership and all but two of the players on the
negotiating committee are black, while all the owners and the
league's top two officials are white.
	   ``I think there is a perception from the owners to even some
fans that we're blacks who should be happy with what we've got _
fair or not,'' said Alonzo Mourning of the Miami Heat. ``There's a
lack of respect given us in large part because we're athletes. I'm
not saying it's all about race because it's not _ but it plays a
factor.
	   Stern denied race is an issue and pointed out that the league
has successfully promoted a sport whose player population is nearly
90 percent black.
	   ``This is a collective bargaining dispute _ no more, no less,''
he said.
	   The league and the union met Saturday for less than 30 minutes,
one of their shortest meetings of the 5 1/2-month-old dispute.
	   Before the session, Hunter said: ``What we've put on the table
so far is not something they're going to be quick to run away
from.''
	   Hunter then put even more concessions on the table, but it
wasn't enough. No new talks are scheduled.

 &UR; National Front leader Le Pen locks rival out of headquarters

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Fighting off an attempted political coup, National
Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen traded charges of corruption Monday
and locked his rival Bruno Megret and other party members out of
his headquarters.
	   ``The National Front is doing well! The old man isn't dead,''
said the 67-year-old Le Pen. The party's founder, a former
paratrooper, said one of his opponents was wrong in calling him a
ball and chain. ``I'm a cannonball!''
	   Besieged by calls within his own party to resign, Le Pen was
holding a meeting of his political bureau at his suburban
headquarters in Saint-Cloud when Megret, the party's No. 2 leader,
arrived with his supporters and a lawyer.
	   ``They forbade us to enter, and as it is out of the question for
us to practice violence, we decided to retreat,'' said Megret
supporter Serge Martinez, a former leading party official.
	   Jean-Yves Le Gallou, leader of the Front's caucus in the Paris
area Regional Council, said he and the other renegades were like
the late U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur: ``If they don't let us in, we
shall return!''
	   The political bureau decided to hold an executive bureau meeting
Dec. 23 to decide whether to permanently bar Megret and a number of
other rebellious members from the party.
	   The standoff came a day after Megret held an emergency meeting
of the party's National Council, where Le Gallou said more than
half the members attended and supported a special party congress
next month that Le Pen opposes.
	   Megret supporters claim he has assembled more than 10,000
signatures backing such a meeting, well over the required 8,000.
	   Meanwhile, Le Pen counter-attacked Martinez, who accused the
party leader of ``family enrichment'' for using party funds to pay
for a housekeeper.
	   Le Pen said Martinez was overpaying a personal secretary with a
monthly salary of 27,000 francs (dlrs 5,000) in party funds.
	   The Front mayor of the southern city of Marignane, Daniel
Simonpieri, said Le Pen was ``listening to a court that is giving
him some very bad advice.''
	   Simonpieri predicted Megret would hold the party congress Jan.
17 or 24.
	   The National Front, with its hard-line and anti-immigrant
policies, made strong gains in regional elections in spring and has
maintained about 15 percent support nationwide.
	   But a power struggle between Le Pen and Megret, ahead of next
spring's Europarliament elections, threatens to split the Front
apart.

Guinea-Bissau rivals meet with Togo, Nigeria heads of state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ The president and the rebel leader of
Guinea-Bissau were meeting Monday with Togolese President Gnassigbe
Eyadema and Nigerian head of state Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar,
discussing plans to send peacekeeping soldiers to the war-torn
country.
	   Eyadema and Abubakar met separately with Guinea-Bissau President
Joao Bernardo Vieira and rebel leader Brig. Ansumane Mane to talk
about plans to send in West African peacekeepers, as well as the
withdrawal of Guinean and Senegalese troops.
	   The leaders also were to discuss the constitution of a
transitional government of national unity and planning for general
elections, which are to be held in March.
	   No announcement had been made by any of the participants by
early Monday night.
	   Senegal and Guinea deployed troops in the small West African
country and former Portuguese colony in June, sent to help Vieira
contain a military rebellion lead by Mane.
	   About half of Guinea-Bissau's 1 million inhabitants were
displaced by the fighting triggered by the rebellion that ended in
November when Vieira and Mane agreed to cease hostilities and form
a government of national unity.
	   Both sides have agreed that rebel leader Francisco Fadul will be
the new prime minister, but have yet to reach a consensus on the
remaining Cabinet.
	   The pact also called for the withdrawal of Senegalese troops and
the deployment of the Nigerian-led West African peacekeeping force,
due to arrive later this month.
	   Civil war broke out June 7 when disenchanted colonial war
veterans rebelled against Vieira's allegedly corrupt regime.
	   Under the peace agreement, presidential elections are to be held
by March.

Strike ends at Louvre, and doors reopen Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A six-day strike by employees at the Louvre Museum
which shut out tens of thousands of visitors is over, and the
museum will reopen its doors on Wednesday, officials announced
Monday.
	   The strike ended Monday evening, but the museum will observe its
regular Tuesday closing, a statement said.
	   The walkout cost the Louvre about 4 million francs (dlrs
715,000), and deprived nearly 60,000 visitors of the museum's
extensive collections, according to the statement.
	   The striking employees, protesting the ``strenuousness'' of
constant public contact, obtained two extra days off per year and
an annual bonus increase of 1,500-2,000 francs (dlrs 270-360) in
negotiations to end the walkout, the museum said.
	   The Louvre walkout was the latest in a wave of strikes that have
closed major Paris attractions, including the Eiffel Tower and the
National Library.
	   A latest strike has also closed the Grand Palais exposition
hall, which is running a special exhibit of the works of painter
Gustave Moreau.
	   The Orsay Museum turned away frustrated visitors for two weeks
in November while museum workers waged a strike during a hugely
popular exposition of the works of Jean-Francois Millet and Vincent
Van Gogh.
	   Orsay Museum employees had said that working conditions had
deteriorated because of the surge of visitors viewing the exhibit.

Russia's Primakov calls for investments in `real economy'
</HEADLINE>

investment insurance agency in grafs 13-14. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The European Bank of Reconstruction and
Development could lend Russia dlrs 1 billion next year _ but not
until the country's forbidding business climate improves, the
bank's president said Monday.
	   Speaking at a Moscow conference that included visiting
executives from many large Western firms, Horst Koehler singled out
Russian banks as a looming problem, and said several should be
closed or more tightly controlled by the government.
	   The EBRD has been a big lender to Russia's beleaguered banks,
many of which were crushed by the August devaluation of the ruble
and default on treasury debt, two events that sparked the country's
economic crisis.
	   Koehler said the EBRD could lend Russia another dlrs 1 billion,
``but this is dependent on an improvement in business climate.'' He
did not say what sectors the money would target.
	   ``I am first of all interested in the banking sector,'' he said.
``Our concern is that there are too many insolvent banks that have
been allowed to continue operating.''
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who also spoke at
Monday's conference, said the Cabinet would ``do its best to
improve the investment climate'' _ but said the country needs
investment in factories and industry, not stock markets.
	   Russian leaders have complained that many foreign investors have
focused on liquid investments, such as stocks, that quickly
evaporated after Russia's financial markets collapsed in August.
	   ``There will be no isolation from the rest of the world,''
Primakov told the Consultative Council on Foreign Investments.
``Russia is interested in investments.''
	   Primakov said his government would like to see foreign money
directed more toward major industries that are ailing.
	   Many investors see Soviet-era industrial firms as too
inefficient and outdated to merit the large-scale investments that
would be required.
	   Also, Russian law has often frustrated foreign investors, such
as oil companies, which have established major projects only to see
them founder because of repeated bureaucratic delays.
	   ``Many production facilities are now idle in our country,'' said
First Vice Premier Yuri Maslyukov. ``We must give the green light
to large strategic investors into the economy of Russia.''
	   Primakov also said the government was setting up an investment
insurance agency to protect investors from political risks.
	   The EBRD has repeatedly cited Russian banks as a major problem.
Nevertheless, the EBRD has been an unusually forthcoming lender to
Russia, providing at least dlrs 3 billion since 1994. In November,
despite Russia's latest economic crisis, the bank agreed to release
the second tranche of a dlrs 100 million loan to the city of St.
Petersburg.
	   Russia's market collapse in August was part of the larger
meltdown that hit emerging markets worldwide. The Russian economy
is expected to contract about 5 percent this year, and to shrink
next year as well.
	   Russia's economic decline in the 1990s is one of the worst
depressions ever suffered by an industrialized nation.

Canada's finance minister rejects two proposed bank mergers

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Bucking the global merger trend, Canada's finance
minister Monday rejected proposals by four of the country's biggest
banks to merge into two mega-banks controlling 70 percent of
Canadian banking assets.
	   The mergers might help the banks compete internationally, but
``they are not in the best interests of Canadians,'' said Finance
Minister Paul Martin.
	   His pronouncement marked the end of a public relations ordeal
for the four banks, which confidently announced the merger plans
early this year, then struggled to win support from politicians,
small businesses and the public.
	   The mergers would have joined Royal Bank of Canada, the
country's largest bank, with third-ranked Bank of Montreal, and
second-ranked Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce with No. 5
Toronto-Dominion Bank.
	   The two new banks would have controlled roughly dlrs 960 billion
(dlrs 623 billion U.S.) in banking assets _ or 70 percent of the
national total.
	   ``The mergers would lead to an unacceptable concentration of
economic power in the hands of fewer, very large banks,'' Martin
said. ``They would result in a a significant reduction of
competition.''
	   Hundreds of communities _ urban and rural _ would face reduced
services, he said.
	   Soon after Martin's announcement, all four banks formally
canceled their merger plans while expressing disappointment at the
rebuff.
	   ``The minister clearly has a different vision of the future of
our industry and our country's ability to compete in it,'' the
chairmen of Royal Bank and Bank of Montreal said in a joint
statement. ``History will judge if Mr. Martin has made the right
decision for Canada.''
	   Martin said the government needed at least a year to create a
new financial services framework that would accommodate
restructuring and possible mergers in the future.
	   ``Whereas the merger proponents wanted the mergers to be allowed
in order to change the status quo, we believe the status quo must
be changed before any merger can be considered,'' Martin said.
	   Even when the new policies are in place, he said new merger
proposals will have to demonstrate they don't excessively
concentrate economic power or reduce competition.
	   The banks _ coming off several years of record profits _ never
managed to rally public support since Royal Bank and Bank of
Montreal unveiled their proposal in January, followed by CIBC and
Toronto-Dominion in April.
	   Polls indicated most Canadians thought bank executives, not
customers, stood to gain the most from such deals.
	   The banks said mergers were necessary to battle foreign
competition and expand in the future. They pointed to the wave of
huge bank mergers in other countries, notably next door in the
United States.
	   Opponents, including Canada's biggest association of small
businesses, worried the mergers would lead to job cuts, reduced
banking services in small towns, and fewer options for obtaining
loans.
	   ``We want a better banking system,'' said Catherine Swift,
president of the 90,000-member Canadian Federation of Independent
Business. ``But better banks does not have to mean bigger banks and
fewer competitive choices.''
	   Canada's Competition Bureau's expressed concerns that the
Royal-Bank of Montreal merger would lead to excessive domination in
credit card and brokerage operations.
	   The merger plans also were undercut by Canada's No. 4 bank, the
Bank of Nova Scotia, the only one of the so-called Big Five not
part of the plans. It contended the mergers would create ``a level
of concentration that wouldn't be tolerated anywhere else in the
world.''
	   Martin said the government would proceed with plans to allow
foreign banks to do business in Canada directly through branches.
At present, they must set up separately capitalized, Canadian
subsidiaries.
	   For Martin, who made millions as a corporate executive,
rejection of the mergers enables him to pose as defender of the
little guy. He is the front-runner to become prime minister
whenever Jean Chretien decides to retire, and the image could be
useful in any leadership campaign.

State-run daily fined dlrs 15,000 on slander charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A local Serbian court found a
state-run newspaper guilty of slander Monday and fined it the
equivalent of dlrs 15,000, the lowest penalty under a restrictive
media law.
	   The ruling against the Borba daily, run by neo-Communists, is
the second against state-run papers since the law on public
information was passed by the Serbian parliament in October.
	   The law mostly has targeted independent media, critical of the
government loyal to President Slobodan Milosevic. It sets enormous
fines for alleged ``anti-state'' reporting.
	   The court in Zrenjanin, in central Serbia, ruled Borba published
false information about a former official in the town. The report
by Studio B television gave no further details except to say
statements by several witnesses refuted the Borba report.

Son of Yemeni lawmaker kidnapped
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen on Monday kidnapped the
11-year-old son of a Yemeni Parliament member, security officials
said.
	   Omar Khaled, son of Hamoud Khaled, a deputy of the ruling
General People's Congress party, was kidnapped outside his school
in downtown San'a by men dressed in military uniforms, the
officials said.
	   The kidnapping follows that of four German tourists on Monday by
the Bani Dhabyan tribe.
	   Khaled informed the Interior Ministry but said he has no dispute
with any group and can't think of any suspects, the officials said.
They spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The Parliament discussed the kidnapping and requested Interior
Minister Hussein Mohammed Arab to attend a session Tuesday, the
officials said.
	   Attempts to secure the release of the four German tourists have
failed so far. The Yemeni government has said the Bani Dhabyan
tribe abducted them to force it to pay for land on which a dam was
built.
	   Armed tribesmen, who control large parts of Yemen, frequently
kidnap people to get their demands fulfilled. But they mostly
abduct foreigners and it is the first time that a lawmaker's son
has been targeted.
	   The hostages are usually treated well and released unhurt.
	   On Monday, the Yemen Times identified the German hostages as
Norbert Degen, Petra Penglista, Rozwita Adlung and Inge Brunner. It
gave no other details and the names could not be confirmed with the
German Embassy.
	   Security officials said their kidnappers have moved them to a
new location.

EMI stops production of German traditional folk song cassette
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ International recording label EMI said
Monday it has stopped production of a cassette by German folk
singer Heino that contains traditional marching songs the Nazis
used during World War II.
	   The cassette, titled ``As We March Side By Side,'' was produced
several years ago but never marketed commercially because of EMI's
concerns about its content, EMI spokesman Erich Grote said in
Cologne.
	   The 60-year-old Heino, popular mostly with older Germans, has
been singing folk music since the 1960s. ``As We March Side By
Side'' contains songs popular before the Third Reich but exploited
by the Nazis as propaganda about the glories of Germany.
	   Heino also sings the German national anthem on the cassette,
including the original first verse which was banned after the war.
It begins: ``Deutschland, Deutschland ueber alles,'' or ``Germany
above all.''
	   The decision to stop production of the cassette followed a
German TV report that ``As We March ...'' was being offered for
sale by mail order in the extreme right-wing German National
Newspaper.
	   ``This was an unpleasant surprise,'' the EMI spokesman told The
Associated Press. ``We immediately informed our customers that we
would not fill any more orders (for the cassette), because we in no
way want to support this kind of product.''
	   Heimo was not immediately available for comment about EMI's
decision.
	   The newspaper, published in Munich by politician Gerhard Frey,
had been running the mail-order advertisements for about a year,
the station ARD reported.
	   Frey's German People's Union won 13 percent in a state election
this fall with anti-foreigner slogans appealing to Germans fearful
that immigrants are worsening the nation's chronically high
unemployment. It was the extreme right's best election showing in
Germany since World War II.
	   EMI has produced 21,688 copies of the cassette, according to the
ARD report.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's tense standoff between
Serbian forces and separatist rebels exploded Monday in the
deadliest reported clash since an October truce _ a five-hour
battle in which border guards were said to have killed dozens of
guerrillas.
	   The pre-dawn clash along Kosovo's southwestern border with
Albania resulted in Yugoslav army troops killing at least 30 armed
ethnic Albanians and wounding 12 trying to enter the country
illegally, the Serb-run Media Center reported.
	   Hours later, according to ethnic Albanian sources, heavy
detonations and shooting were heard from the area of three nearby
villages sealed off by Serb police.
	   Details of the fighting could not be independently confirmed.
International monitors confirmed the clash but said they were
uncertain about the death toll.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels, who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence, have frequently armed themselves in neighboring
Albania.
	   The worst reported violence in Kosovo in more than two months
casts further gloom on stalled diplomacy to bring lasting peace to
the Serbian province, where many believe a resumption of full-scale
fighting is inevitable.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since an Oct. 12
peace agreement brokered by U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke halted
months of fighting in the separatist province in southern Serbia.
	   Holbrooke is expected in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade on
Tuesday from Athens. But after two months of failed shuttle
diplomacy, chances of mediating an end to the continuing violence
seem unlikelier than ever.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule, while the rebels say they won't
accept anything short of outright independence. Serbia, meanwhile,
refuses to consider anything more than partial autonomy for the
predominantly ethnic Albanian province.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who met with ethnic Albanian
negotiators in Pristina on Monday and plans talks in Belgrade with
government officials on Tuesday, has seen his proposals for a
political settlement rejected by both sides.
	   The Serb Media Center report said armed ethnic Albanians were
trying to enter Kosovo from Albania when the shootout erupted at 2
a.m. Monday near Gorozup and Liken, 70 kilometers (45 miles)
southwest of Pristina.
	   Yugoslav soldiers confiscated arms and other material that the
Albanians were trying to smuggle in, according to the Serb Media
Center report, which could not be independently confirmed.
	   Municipal authorities in nearby Prizren were quoted as saying
that all those killed and wounded were wearing camouflage uniforms
with the insignia of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. Eight
Albanians were killed in a border clash near the same area on Dec.
3.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is assembling a force of 2,000 unarmed peace verifiers under the
terms of the Oct. 12 agreement, said it could confirm only two
deaths, and two detentions on which it did not elaborate.
	   But an OSCE spokeswoman who declined to be named said verifiers
were still uncertain about what happened or the full extent of
casualties.
	   Asked about the OSCE's lower figure, the Serb Media Center said
it was ``absolutely certain'' about its figures and said the
verifiers would eventually determine the casualty count was
accurate.
	   The OSCE has previously condemned the continuing violence and
blamed both sides.

Azerbaijani newspaper fined for reports about president's family

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ An opposition newspaper in Azerbaijan
was fined Monday for reporting that the president's relatives
bought expensive foreign real estate, the latest in a string of
libel lawsuits in the former Soviet republic.
	   Azerbaijani journalists have been holding hunger strikes
recently to protest the lawsuits and what they call a crackdown on
the media by authoritarian President Geidar Aliev.
	   A Baku city court ruled Monday that the Azadlyg newspaper's
reports about real estate deals in Britain by five relatives of
Aliev _ two brothers, a son, son-in-law and nephew _ were untrue
and libelous.
	   Azadlyg was ordered to pay 500 million manat (dlrs 125,000) to
the men in compensation and to print a retraction on its front
page.
	   The newspaper sticks by its story. Other opposition journalists
held a news conference Monday and slammed the ruling as an attack
on Azerbaijan's free press.
	   Other officials are also suing Azadlyg for libel, seeking a
total of more than dlrs 500,000 _ a substantial sum in a country
where average salaries rarely exceed the equivalent of dlrs 43 a
month.
	   The opposition newspaper Yeni Musavat was ordered last month to
pay the equivalent of dlrs 50,000 to the head of Aliev's
administration over articles he said damaged his reputation. The
paper also lost a libel case by the chief investigator with the
Azerbaijani Interior Ministry for articles connecting him to the
slaying of one of his deputies.
	   Aliev has been criticized by international human rights groups
for cracking down on the press, though he eased censorship this
summer ahead of presidential elections.

	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The United States Olympic Committee
said Monday it was confident of the NHL's participation in the 2002
Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.
	   ``We're confident the NHL will play,'' said Dick Schultz,
secretary-general of the USOC. ``I think they probably will. I
can't see where you have Games in the United States and the NHL
does not participate.''
	   The issue has been a thorny one since the Nagano Olympics in
February, where the American NHL players made an early quarterfinal
exit, and subsequently trashed rooms in the Olympic village.
	   The NHL took a three-week break to allow players to skate for
their national teams, only to see CBS relegate the games to its
late-night show.
	   League commissioner Gary Bettman said last week the NHL's
participation would depend on how negotiations go with broadcast
rights holder NBC, explaining that ``considerable prime-time (TV)
exposure for the U.S. and Canadian teams'' was important to give
their players the proper exposure.
	   Otherwise, ``it doesn't make sense for us to go,'' Bettman said.
	   ``It will be very difficult for NBC to carry entire hockey games
at prime time,'' said Schultz, following an IOC executive committee
meeting. ``It's the Olympics so there'll be a little of this and a
little of that.
	   ``The ratings are important,'' Schultz said. ``There will be a
lot of hockey at prime time, but it will also be on cable.''
	   The NHL is expected to give its answer in February.

Private sector urges consumers to buy local goods to support

currency &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ A business group has joined government
calls for consumers to buy more locally produced goods to prevent
further declines in the value of the Guyanese currency.
	   The Guyanese dollar has declined in value by 20 percent in
recent months to a rate of 170 to one U.S. dollar, triggering fears
of inflation.
	   On Monday, the Private Sector Commission, an umbrella
organization of business groups, said reducing imports to the South
American country is a key part of propping up the currency.
	   ``All we are asking is that people buy a little more of what is
manufactured locally. We have passed the stage where we can call
for a restriction of imports with all the conventions we have
signed to open up the economy and with globalization on the
horizon,'' said David Yankana.
	   The currency has also been weakened by depressed world market
prices for sugar, bauxite, gold and timber. Most of these are key
Guyana exports.
	   Previous administrations took the buy-local effort even further,
nearly cutting off foreign investment and trying to make the
country self-sufficient. That trend has been reversed by recent
administrations and such U.S.-based chains as Sears and McDonald's
are now doing business in Guyana.

Report: Angolan rebels gained from lax policing of diamond
</HEADLINE>
sanctions &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Angola-Fighting &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Several governments and the world
diamond market failed to comply with U.N. sanctions against the
Angolan rebel group UNITA, allowing it use diamond sales to finance
a renewed war with the government, according to a report released
Tuesday.
	   The report elaborated by Global Witness, a London-based human
rights organization, also faulted the United Nations for not
ensuring that member nations only bought Angolan diamonds with a
certificate of origin issued by the Angolan government.
	   The lax observance of the U.N. sanctions allowed UNITA to earn
an estimated dlrs 3.7 billion on the world market between 1992 and
1998, according to the report.
	   ``The failure of the U.N. member states and the diamond industry
to fully implement the embargo has meant that UNITA has been able
to restock munitions and supplies, and this has fatally undermined
the peace process,'' the report said.
	   UNITA runs diamond operations, mostly in the northeast of the
country, with small-scale miners known as ``garimpeiros.'' The
diamonds are smuggled out of the country before being sold on the
international market.
	   The Global Witness said Belgium, a major world diamond center,
had been particularly lax in implementing the U.N. embargo on UNITA
diamonds.
	   Diamond giant De Beers was also called on to clarify how it
identifies the origin of diamonds handled by its Central Selling
Organization.
	   A De Beers spokesman denied the company had broken the ban on
trading in non-official Angolan diamonds.
	   ``De Beers, since the U.N. mandate is in place, has not bought
diamonds exported from Angola without a government certificate of
origin,'' Andrew Lamont said by phone from London.
	   The U.N. Security Council decreed the diamond ban in July in an
effort to cut the rebels' main source of revenue and pressure the
group into complying with a 1994 peace accord. UNITA's foreign bank
accounts were also frozen and members were banned from traveling
abroad.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a two-decade civil war
against the government following the country's 1975 independence
from Portugal.
	   Several attempts at establishing a lasting peace between the two
sides had already failed before the 1994 U.N.-brokered pact
apparently collapsed Dec. 4, after a government offensive against
UNITA's central highland strongholds.

U.S. envoy Holbrooke tries to defuse Russian missile crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs, UPDATES with Holbrooke meeting defense minister, no
apparent result from talks &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK QUINN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ With the Cyprus impasse reaching a
critical juncture, U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke tried Monday to
prevent the deployment of missiles that could start a war between
NATO allies Greece and Turkey.
	   But Holbrooke seems to have made little progress after talking
with Defense Minister Akis Tsochadzopoulos. Leaving with his
assistant Thomas Miller, an annoyed-looking American envoy refused
to utter a word after the one-hour talks.
	   He had arrived a few hours earlier from Istanbul, Turkey, where
he met with business leaders from the war-divided island.
	   Tsochadzopoulos was just as reticent about the missiles.
	   ``No, no I can't discuss further about proposals that concern
Mr. Holbrooke and Miller, who have a specific mission and it is
their issue to say if they think they will have a future,''
Tsochadzopoulos said.
	   Tsochadzopoulos also indicated they did not see eye-to-eye on
Cyprus' planned deployment of the Russian S-300 missiles. The
United States strongly opposes Cyprus' plans to install the
anti-aircraft weapons.
	   ``It was a communication where both sides heard views that
mutually express the prospects that each side sees as realistic for
the outcome'' of the problem, he said.
	   American ambassador Nicholas Burns, who spent an extra 30
minutes alone with Tsochadzopoulos, tried to sound upbeat after the
meeting by describing the minister as ``a very valued interlocutor
of the United States.''
	   Burns was to later host a private dinner meeting for Holbrooke
with Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos at his residence. Pangalos
said the two men would make no public comments after their talks.
	   Reports said the initial delivery schedule had the missiles
leaving Russia on Tuesday. But there was no independent
confirmation that the repeatedly delayed delivery was imminent.
Such a development would significantly shorten the time available
to Holbrooke.
	   Turkey has said it will use force to stop them, which could
touch off a conflict with regional rival Greece. Athens has a
defense accord with Greek Cypriots.
	   The eastern Mediterranean island has been separated since 1974,
when Turkish troops invaded its northern third after an abortive
Athens-backed coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in a northern breakaway state
recognized only by Ankara.
	   Holbrooke did not see Premier Costas Simitis, who has the most
clout to persuade the Cypriots to change their minds on the
missiles.
	   It was not known if Holbrooke wanted a meeting, but a government
spokesman said Simitis did not ask for one.
	   It is doubtful Holbrooke will hold further talks here as he
confirmed reports of a trip to Belgrade Tuesday.
	   Holbrooke and others are said to favor placing the missiles in
storage here, or deploying them on the Greek island of Crete.
	   Worried about the political cost of such a move, Simitis has
firmly placed the decision with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides.
On Sunday, Clerides said the deployment will go ahead as scheduled.
	   In Istanbul, Holbrooke avoided the political difficulties as
part of a low-stakes strategy to encourage business contacts across
the U.N.-monitored line dividing Cyprus.
	   Greek and Turkish Cypriot entrepreneurs at the meeting agreed to
try and cooperate on several initiatives, including solving a water
shortage; having their languages taught in each others' schools;
establishing an island-wide cellular phone network and making
efforts to restore historic monuments.
	   It was a small step considering that U.N.-sponsored talks have
been deadlocked since late 1997, after Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash insisted on recognition and an end to negotiations for
Cyprus' accession to the European Union.

Iraq for second time denies U.N. inspectors access to site
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite Baghdad's promise of full
cooperation with U.N. inspectors, Iraq for the second time denied
access to a site related to its banned weapons programs, a U.N.
spokesman said Monday.
	   The incident occurred Friday when a Baghdad-based chemical
monitoring team was denied entry to a warehouse which had been
inspected many times previously.
	   Iraqi officials barred inspectors on grounds that it was the
Muslim sabbath.
	   In deference to local religious sensitivities, inspectors have
limited Friday missions, but maintain ``the right to go any time,
any place, 24 hours a day,'' said Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for the
U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which is charged with
verifying the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``They should have let us in, they didn't,'' he said.
	   It wasn't clear whether the monitoring team tried to enter the
warehouse over the weekend, Buchanan said.
	   Last Wednesday, Iraq prevented a visiting team from conducting a
surprise inspection of the offices of the ruling Baath Party in
Baghdad. Iraqi officials announced Thursday that the offices were
off limits to future inspections.
	   The surprise inspections were the final test of Iraq's
compliance with UNSCOM before chief weapons inspector Richard
Butler reports to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, either late Monday
or Tuesday.
	   The last three visiting teams were expected to leave Baghdad
Monday but up to 140 resident experts remain in the country to
monitor Iraq's known weapons.
	   Under threat of U.S.-British airstrikes, Iraq promised on Nov.
14 to resume full cooperation with inspectors and allow unfettered
access to sites and documents. Washington and London maintain that
military action remains an option to compel Baghdad to cooperate
with the inspectors.
	   In two interim reports on Iraq's cooperation Dec. 3 and Dec. 9,
Butler told the Security Council that several inspections were
completed without incident, and one document on a missile program
was delivered to UNSCOM. But Iraq failed to produce several other
key documents, and placed ``unacceptable'' conditions on weapons
experts during other inspections.
	   Annan will deliver Butler's report to the U.N. Security Council
which will then determine whether to go ahead with the first
``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions
since economic sanctions were imposed in 1990 after Baghdad's
invasion of Kuwait.
	   The secretary-general told a news conference Monday that he was
reserving judgment on Butler's report, but suggested that Baghdad
had fallen short of his expectations.
	   ``On that fateful November weekend, they did indicate that they
were going to cooperate and made it clear that their offer to
cooperate was unconditionally clear,'' Annan said. ``I had expected
them to cooperate fully. Beyond that, I will have to await the
report from Mr. Butler.''
	   ``Mr. Butler has indicated that his assessment will be based on
the overall operation and not on this or that incident,'' he said.
	   The secretary-general said he thinks the council would like to
know after eight years where Iraq stands in terms of disarmament,
what needs to be done, and in what time frame.
	   Annan said he is guided by the Security Council's position that
once UNSCOM says Iraq has been disarmed that sanctions will be
lifted _ not by U.S. policy which goes beyond that.
	   The United States insists that a comprehensive review is not
linked to lifting sanctions and President Clinton has called for
the overthrow of Iraq's President Saddam Hussein.
	   A comprehensive review is in line with Security Council
resolutions and not designed to pressure the Americans to change,
he said.
	   ``The fact that there may be a conflict in the council because
one or two members may disagree does not mean that the council
should not move ahead and do what it has promised to do in its own
resolutions,'' Annan said.

Russia's Primakov calls for investments in factories
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Barely solvent Russian banks are a looming problem
and several should be closed or more tightly controlled by the
government, the president of the European Bank of Reconstruction
and Development said Monday.
	   The EBRD has been a big lender to Russia's beleaguered banks,
many of which were crushed by the August devaluation of the ruble
and default on treasury debt, two events that sparked the country's
economic crisis.
	   Bank president Horst Koehler said the EBRD could lend Russia
another $1 billion, ``but this is dependent on an improvement in
business climate.'' He did not say what sectors the money would
target.
	   ``I am first of all interested in the banking sector,'' he said,
speaking at a Moscow conference that included visiting executives
from many large Western firms. ``Our concern is that there are too
many insolvent banks that have been allowed to continue
operating.''
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who also spoke at
Monday's conference, said the Cabinet would ``do its best to
improve the investment climate'' _ but said the country needs
investment in factories and industry, not stock markets.
	   Russian leaders have complained that many foreign investors have
focused on liquid investments, such as stocks, that quickly
evaporated after Russia's financial markets collapsed in August.
	   ``There will be no isolation from the rest of the world,''
Primakov told the Consultative Council on Foreign Investments.
``Russia is interested in investments.''
	   Primakov said his government would like to see foreign money
directed more toward major industries that are ailing.
	   Many investors see Soviet-era industrial firms as too
inefficient to merit the large-scale investments that would be
required. Also, Russian law has often frustrated foreign investors,
such as oil companies, which have established major projects only
to see them founder because of repeated bureaucratic delays.
	   ``Many production facilities are now idle in our country,'' said
First Vice Premier Yuri Maslyukov. ``We must give the green light
to large strategic investors into the economy of Russia.''
	   Primakov also said the government was setting up an investment
insurance agency to protect investors from political risks.
	   The EBRD has repeatedly cited Russian banks as a major problem.
Nevertheless, the EBRD has lent Russia at least $3 billion since
1994.
	   Russia's market collapse in August was part of the larger
meltdown that hit emerging markets worldwide. The Russian economy
is expected to contract about 5 percent this year, and to shrink
next year as well.
	   Russia's economic decline in the 1990s is one of the worst
depressions ever suffered by an industrialized nation.

As Clinton watches, Palestinians renounce call for Israel's

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a historic day stirring
Palestinian passions for statehood, President Bill Clinton stood
witness Monday as hundreds of Palestinian leaders renounced a call
for the destruction of Israel. Clinton urged ``legitimate rights
for Palestinians, real security for Israel.''
	   The Palestinian vote _ registered with a show of hands and
applause _ removed a contentious issue dating back to 1964 from the
crisis-shrouded Mideast peace process.
	   The action appeared to have cleared the way for a three-way
meeting among Clinton, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. At stake was the revival of the
Wye River land-for-security accord, nearing collapse with Israelis
and the Palestinians accusing each other of violating the deal.
	   Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem that Palestinian vote
would ``lead to a real peace, a lasting peace, not a minute-long
peace.'' But at the same time, he told reporters, Arafat must
renounce plans to declare statehood and take steps to end the
violence in the region.
	   Just as Netanyahu told Clinton on Sunday that the Palestinians
were violating peace accords, Arafat told the president Monday that
Israel was guilty of violations. He called on Israel to release
jailed Palestinians _ ``our heroes in prison.'' Netanyahu has vowed
not to release prisoners he regards as terrorists.
	   Pressing both sides to reconcile, Clinton said, ``I think there
will be more breakdowns, frankly. But I think there will be more
breakthroughs as well.''
	   Addressing former guerrilla fighters and other top Palestinians,
Clinton said the peace process has brought rewards: elections and
self-government in Gaza and the West Bank, Israeli troop
redeployments, relations with Washington and a Palestinian airport.
	   But he also acknowledged Palestinian bitterness over Israeli
restrictions on people and commerce, land confiscation and Israeli
settlements. He said Israel, for its part, has justifiable concerns
about Palestinian violence.
	   ``Enough of this gnashing of teeth, let us join hands and
proudly go forward together,'' the president said.
	   Welcomed by Arafat as ``a president whom we love and respect,''
Clinton was the first American president to step onto
Palestinian-ruled soil. Thousands of people jammed the
freshly-scrubbed streets in this ancient city although many
Palestinians mistrust Clinton as an unwavering ally of Israel.
	   With Clinton watching from the head table, hundreds of top
Palestinian officials annulled anti-Israeli clauses in the 1964
charter of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Arafat said the
provisions were revoked two years ago, but Netanyahu had insisted
that vote was inadequate.
	   ``I hope this will close this chapter forever,'' Arafat said.
Clinton said it was a step taken ``fully, finally and forever.''
Netanyahu's government agreed the case was closed, allowing Clinton
to claim a measure of success on his three-day visit to the Holy
Land.
	   Clinton's visit encouraged Palestinian hopes for statehood, a
move adamantly opposed by Israel. The president said at a luncheon
that Palestinians ``now have a chance to determine their own
destiny on their own land.'' In his address to Palestinian leaders,
Clinton went further with his call for ``legitimate rights for
Palestinians, real security for Israel.''
	   The 1979 Camp David accords embraced the ``legitimate rights''
concept but the phrase _ seen by Palestinians as the cornerstone of
statehood _ has not been emphasized by the United States. Clinton's
statement was hailed as a big step.
	   ``It's the assertion of Palestinian rights and will hopefully be
translated into full support for Palestinian independence,'' said
Nasser Qidweh, the Palestinian representative to the United
Nations.
	   Clinton's visit here was watched nervously by Israel, fearing
that its special military, economic and diplomatic relationship
with Washington is being diluted by closer American-Palestinian
ties.
	   In Israel, Nissim Smoliansky, a member of the right-wing
National Religious Party in Netanyahu's coalition government said
Clinton had purposely tried to make Palestinians would believe he
was supporting statehood. ``We lost a lot,'' he said.
	   There were signs and symbols proclaiming a Palestinian state,
from the newly opened airport at Rafah to the seaside headquarters
of Arafat's Palestinian Authority here. A painted banner, hung from
a downtown building where Clinton spoke, showed the president
standing with Arafat and giving a thumbs up sign a proclamation
that ``We Have a Dream. Free Palestine.''
	   Clinton opened his day at Gaza International Airport, whose
opening was negotiated as part of the Wye River peace accord.
	   Albright said the airport was ``a very important sign of the
progress here on the peace talks ... a very visible sign of what
was accomplished at Wye.'' The airport is a gateway for exporting
Palestinian flowers and farm produce, and Albright said it offers
hope for improving the troubled Palestinian economy.

A vote finally closes chapter on PLO founding charter

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Many of the middle-aged men in dark
suits and elegant matrons in the Gaza City convention center shed
their youthful dreams of destroying Israel years ago.
	   On Monday, 456 of the 727 members of the Palestine National
Council, the top Palestinian decision-making body, voted in unison
and in the presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton to make it
official.
	   There was some reluctance as the delegates in the Shawa Center
in Gaza City raised their hands, looking at one another for
assurance, and then got up from their seats for greater emphasis.
	   Many of the former guerrillas, PLO functionaries and street
activists said they took the crucial vote already in 1996 when the
PNC met in Gaza City to revoke clauses of the PLO founding charter
calling for Israel's destruction.
	   They said they gave a repeat performance Monday to please
Clinton and to rob Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
excuses to hold up a West Bank troop pullback that is to take place
Friday under the Wye River peace agreement.
	   Netanyahu had insisted on a show of hands as one of several
preconditions for a pullback. Minutes after the vote, he issued a
statement saying he considered the procedure acceptable.
	   However, he later said the Palestinians would have to do more,
such as drop plans to declare a state in May, before he will pull
back his troops.
	   Clinton sensed the delegates' reservations and hurt pride.
	   ``You did a good thing today in raising your hands,'' Clinton
said reassuringly. ``You know why? It has nothing to do with the
government of Israel. You will touch the people in Israel.''
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, reinforced the
theme. ``This is a message to Israelis that we extent a hand to
them,'' said Erekat, also a PNC delegate.
	   The PLO founding charter was written in 1964 and most of its
provisions referred to armed struggle against Israel and the need
to destroy the Jewish state and reclaim all of Palestine.
	   Bassam Abu Sharif followed those instructions as a young member
of a radical PLO faction, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, in the 1970s.
	   He recruited one of the world's most notorious terrorists,
``Carlos the Jackal,'' into the PFLP and plotted several airline
hijackings. His face remains scarred from a 1972 Israeli letter
bomb that tore three fingers off his left hand.
	   On Monday, Abu Sharif, along with his colleagues, listened
attentively as Arafat appealed to the PNC members to approve his
January 1998 letter to Clinton in which he listed all the PLO
charter clauses that should be considered revoked.
	   ``Brothers, I am talking from my heart to your heart,'' Arafat
said, shaking his right index finger for emphasis. As the delegates
raised their hands one after the other, a smile quickly spread
across Arafat's face and he began to clap.
	   Ghassan Matar, a delegate from Cairo, jumped up and yelled: ``We
did it for the American president and the American people and the
First Lady.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three small children were killed when a television
exploded in southern Kazakstan, a news report said Monday.
	   The children, ages 3, 4 and 6, were in a residential building in
the town of Lugovaya, in the south of the central Asian nation,
when the blast occurred Saturday, the Kazak State Committee for

Reality jolts dreams of early entry for EU candidate states
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Slovak comment
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland _ Poland and other EU candidate nations went to
last weekend's European Union summit in Vienna to find out when
they could join up.
	   They came back with a simple, stark political truth _ no one is
quite ready to cough up the money needed to expand Europe across
former ideological and battle lines.
	   The 15-member EU decided to put off until March any decisions on
accepting a handful of new members that would broaden its territory
from the Atlantic to the Ukraine.
	   That sparked frustration among some leaders who wanted a set
timetable for the wide-ranging reforms and negotiations required.
	   ``On one side, the EU demands that we adjust our legislation to
the European urgently, while on the other side, there are
tendencies to slow down the enlargement process,'' complained
Slovenian Premier Janez Drnovsek.
	   Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said overhauling the economy
and other sectors must have a tangible, realistic deadline for
those undergoing the changes.
	   ``To keep dynamics of these changes, we need specific dates,''
he said.
	   Some newspapers in central and eastern Europe portrayed the EU
as stingy, with headlines such as ``Viennese `Summit of Misers'
causes disappointment'' in Hungary's center-left Nepszabadsag daily
newspaper.
	   But Buzek and others noted that nobody at the EU summit tried to
rule out expansion. The problem involved when to do it, rather than
why, they said.
	   ``For four years we did not move at all,'' Slovakia's prime
minister, Mikulas Dzurinda, told the Bratislava newspaper Sme. ``So
now we should not be disappointed that we need a year to work on
some things.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Two people accused of offering Fiat automobiles
in exchange for a vote to place the 1997 world ski championships in
an Italian resort were former employees of the Turin, Italy-based
carmaker, a spokesman said Monday.
	   Vittorio Vellano, former president and chief executive officer,
and Angelica DiSilvestri, former public relations manager, had both
worked in Fiat's U.S. headquarters in New York, Fiat spokesman
Paolo Vannini said.
	   He said he did not know if their time in New York corresponded
with the period in 1992 when former U.S. Skiing president Howard
Peterson said they offered him two cars in exchange for his vote
for Sestriere, a winter resort where the Agnelli family that owns
Fiat holds major interests in hotels and real estate.
	   Vannini repeated Fiat's denials of any wrongdoing and said legal
action might be considered.
	   Peterson said Saturday that he had rejected the automobile offer
because ``I didn't sell my vote'' and supported a Swiss challenger.
Sestriere won the balloting.
	   Peterson's comments followed charges by Marc Hodler, an
executive board member of the International Olympic Committee and
former head of the International Ski Federation, who said Fiat
tycoon Gianni Agnelli had given free vans to influence votes for
Sestriere.

Royal Dutch-Shell to sell off 40 percent of chemicals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS for AMs, UPDATING with closing stock price; fresh Shell
quotes; quote from analyst

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Oil giant Royal Dutch-Shell warned Monday that its
fourth-quarter earnings will fall dlrs 4.5 billion because of a
group restructuring that includes the sale of 40 percent of its
chemical business.
	   But the company said it will also achieve savings of dlrs 2.5
billion a year by 2001 in a major cost cutting program that is part
of its regrouping designed to better protect itself from declining
oil prices, which are the lowest they have been in 12 years.
	   Shell's shares closed down 3.75 pence at 350.25 pence on the
London Stock Exchange on the back of the company's announcement.
	   ``We have had to make tough choices,'' Shell chairman Mark
Moody-Stuart said. ``But although we have made some very big cuts,
with an dlrs 11 billion global spending program, we still have
plenty of room for growth ... and remain ahead of the
competition.''
	   Several oil companies have announced significant consolidations
and revampings in the last few weeks, including Exxon Corp. and
Mobil Corp., who plan a dlrs 73.7 billion merger.
	   ``We have looked at merger possibilities and will continue to
look at such possibilities, and if the right opportunity arises, we
will act,'' Moody-Stuart said.
	   ``But we are large enough to be the leading company on our own
without any merger,'' he said. ``We have a great deal of work to do
in our own shop.''
	   Oil prices have fallen as producers have flooded the market with
a surplus of crude. And the global economic slowdown has depressed
demand for fuel, making the prospect of higher prices in the near
future unlikely.
	   Announcing the plan, Shell said the drop in earnings would be
due to reorganization costs, a reduction in the value of some
assets and because of compensation paid to employees being laid
off. In the last few months, the company has announced it is to
slash 6,000 jobs.
	   The group is to reduce the number of its chemical product
businesses from 21 to 13 and half of the Dutch petrochemical
company Montell will be sold off, Shell said.
	   Products such as building blocks and large volume polymers will
be the focus of the company's plans for the future.
	   Shell's strategy was first unveiled to a group of financial
analysts on Monday.
	   An investment fund manager who attended the meeting said he
welcomed the company facing up to its problems.
	   ``It's more revolution than evolution this time,'' said the
analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``It's been a very
disappointing year for the company and they have acknowledged that.
That's often the first step toward improving things.''
	   Moody-Stuart said management changes announced Thursday should
result in a much greater degree of executive accountability at all
levels.

US Olympic Committee confident of NHL's participation in 2002
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The United States Olympic Committee
said Monday it was confident of that the U.S. National Hockey
League would participation in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake
City.
	   ``We're confident the NHL will play,'' said Dick Schultz,
secretary-general of the USOC. ``I think they probably will. I
can't see where you have Games in the United States and the NHL
does not participate.''
	   The issue has been a thorny one since the Nagano Olympics in
February, where the American NHL players made an early quarterfinal
exit, and subsequently trashed rooms in the Olympic village.
	   The NHL took a three-week break to allow players to skate for
their national teams, only to see CBS relegate the games to its
late-night show.
	   League commissioner Gary Bettman said last week the NHL's
participation would depend on how negotiations go with broadcast
rights holder NBC, explaining that ``considerable prime-time (TV)
exposure for the U.S. and Canadian teams'' was important to give
their players the proper exposure.
	   Otherwise, ``it doesn't make sense for us to go,'' Bettman said.
	   ``It will be very difficult for NBC to carry entire hockey games
at prime time,'' said Schultz, following an IOC executive committee
meeting. ``It's the Olympics so there'll be a little of this and a
little of that.
	   ``The ratings are important,'' Schultz said. ``There will be a
lot of hockey at prime time, but it will also be on cable.''
	   The NHL is expected to give its answer in February.

Minister: Women needn't prove virtue to obtain passport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Interior Minister has ordered police not
to force uneducated, poor women to provide proof of their virtue in
order to obtain a passport, officials said Monday.
	   Although the law did not require it, Egyptian police have for
decades demanded that such women seeking a passport get clearance
from the vice squad that they were not involved in immoral
activities such as prostitution.
	   Passports are issued by the Interior Ministry, which runs the
police.
	   Seeking to end the unusual practice, Interior Minister Habib
el-Adly said in his order Sunday that a passport is ``the
constitutional right'' of all citizens, the officials said. They
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Women with at least high school education and those employed by
the government were not required to get the vice squad clearance.
That left millions of illiterate women, usually from the poorer
sections of the society.
	   Investigations by the vice squad is considered a shame for women
in this conservative, Muslim country.
	   ``It is embarrassing that such a procedure even existed,'' said
Mohammed Abdel-Aal, who researches laws concerning women in the
Egyptian Organization for Human rights.
	   The decision is part of an administrative overhaul in the police
ordered by el-Adly since he took over the ministry in November,
1997.

slayings; CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian authorities have arrested the first
suspects in a string of slayings of dissidents that has terrified
intellectuals opposed to hard-liners in the ruling clergy, state
radio said Monday.
	   Iran radio quoted an unnamed judiciary spokesman as saying
police had made some arrests in the five slayings. It did not
elaborate, and judiciary officials were not immediately available
for comment.
	   Meanwhile, the official newspaper, Iran, said two other
political activists remained missing: Pirouz Davani, who led a
small political group called the United Left, and Rostami Hamedani,
an activist allied with Davani. It gave no other details.
	   In a speech Monday to a group of clerics, Iran's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, condemned the slayings, saying ``the
killing of citizens, whatever their beliefs may be, is a crime.''
	   Khamenei leans toward hard-line clergymen who have been the
target of criticism of Iranian liberals, including the three
writers and two opposition activists killed in the past month.
	   The conservative clergymen are opposed to moderate President
Mohammad Khatami's attempts at social and political reforms.
	   Hard-line activists and vigilantes have often resorted to
violence against Khatami's supporters, but nobody has accused the
hard-line camp of being behind the killings.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley said the
United States strongly condemned the slayings, calling them an
attempt to stifle free speech.
	   ``We urge the Iranian leadership to protect the lives of all
Iranian citizens, including writers and other voices of dissent,
and to preserve the rule of law,'' Foley said.
	   The hard-liners have blamed unnamed foreign agencies and even an
exiled Iranian opposition group.
	   One opposition writer, Houshang Golshiri, said the killings have
spread panic among dissidents.
	   ``Some of our intellectual friends have been trying to keep a
low profile by moving out of their homes into the homes of friends
or relatives,'' Golshiri said in a telephone interview.
	   Golshiri had been working with seven other dissidents, including
two of the dead writers _ Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh and Mohammad
Mokhtari _ to establish a writers' association.
	   Pouyandeh and Mokhtari were summoned by a court two months ago
for questioning about their activities. Their bodies were later
found dumped on the outskirts of Tehran. They were apparently
strangled.
	   Another writer, Majid Sharif, was also found dead after
disappearing from his home. The head of an Iranian opposition
group, Dariush Foruhar, and his wife, Parvaneh, were found stabbed
to death in their home Nov. 22.
	   Khatami said in a statement Monday that the government was
determined to bring the killers to justice.
	   He said there was ``high hope'' that a special investigative
team he set up would ``soon have something to report to the
nation.''

Netanyahu praises PNC vote, says Palestinians have to do more

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday
praised the Palestinians' vote to renounce clauses of the PLO
charter hostile to Israel, but said this was not enough to clear
the way for an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   Under the Wye River land-for-security agreement, five percent of
the West Bank are to be transferred from Israeli control to joint
jurisdiction on Friday.
	   However, Netanyahu said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would
have to drop plans to declare a state in May, collect illegal
weapons and accept Israel's criteria for the release of Palestinian
prisoners before Israeli will hand over more land.
	   ``If these commitments are taken and honored, the Israeli
government will carry out its part,'' Netanyahu said, but was
evasive when pressed whether he would meet the Friday deadline.
	   On Monday, Netanyahu faces a tough challenge to his crumbling
coalition in parliament when a bill calling for early elections
comes up for a vote.
	   Hard-liners in Netanyahu's coalition have threatened to vote in
favor of spring elections if Netanyahu carries out a troop
pullback. If they make good on their word, they bill will pass.
	   Netanyahu portrayed Monday's vote in the Palestine National
Council, the Palestinians' top decision-making body, as a personal
achievement. Netanyahu had insisted on a show of hands, and the
Palestinians eventually complied, even though the Wye agreement
only calls on the Palestinians to ``reaffirm'' decisions by lesser
bodies to declare the offending charter clauses null and void.
	   ``It was achieved today and it was achieved first and foremost
because we insisted that the charter be canceled,'' he told a news
conference.
	   ``It is a very important step,'' Netanyahu said of the PNC vote.
``I welcome it. It's a positive step, but it needs to be recognized
as one step. Other steps are necessary.''

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian authorities on Monday reported the
first arrests in the recent serial killings of dissidents, which
have terrified intellectuals opposed to hard-liners in the ruling
clergy.
	   Judicial spokesman Nasiri Savadkuhi said several suspects have
been arrested and authorities are ``striving to arrest all the
perpetrators of the recent mysterious killings,'' Iranian

	   The television quoted Savadkhui as saying the investigation into
the writers' slayings has been expanded to include the August
shooting of a hard-liner, Assadollah Lajevardi. He was the former
chief of prisons and former chief prosecutor.

the killings, saying they ``point to a pattern of violence and

Iran signs Caspian oil exploration deal with Shell, Lasmo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran signed an agreement Monday with Royal
Dutch-Shell and Britain's Lasmo for oil exploration in the southern
Caspian Sea, off the Iranian coast, Tehran television reported.
	   The agreement was signed after months of talks between the
National Iranian Oil Co. and the two European companies, the report
said.
	   Under the agreement, exploration operations will be carried out
for 18 months, leading to production, the broadcast said.
	   In a statement issued in London, Lasmo said the agreement also
gives British Petroleum the option to join the consortium at a
later date, but only after obtaining full board approval.
	   It said the exploration cost of 19 million pounds (dlrs 11
million) will be shared equally by Lasmo, Shell and, assuming board
approval is granted, BP.
	   The Iranian oil company will not contribute any capital.
	   Lasmo said that within the first six months, the consortium will
identify prospects where seismic data already exist. Having
selected two prospective areas, the consortium will have a year to
negotiate service agreements for the blocks.
	   It will also acquire seismic data and conduct geological and
geophysical studies over a large and previously unexplored area.
	   The consortium will have preferential rights to select up to
four blocks and a period of 12 months after the study has concluded
to negotiate service agreements, the statement said.

Kosovo border clash leaves dozens of ethnic Albanians dead
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A tenuous standoff between Serbian
forces and separatist rebels in Kosovo exploded in violence Monday
in the worst clash since an October truce _ a five-hour gunbattle
in which border guards killed dozens of guerrillas.
	   The pre-dawn clash along Kosovo's southwestern border with
Albania resulted in Yugoslav army troops killing at least 30 ethnic
Albanians and wounding 12 who were trying to enter the country
illegally, the Serb-run Media Center reported.
	   Hours later, according to ethnic Albanian sources, heavy
detonations and shootings were heard from the area of three nearby
villages about 45 miles southwest of Pristina that had been sealed
off by Serb police.
	   Details of the fighting could not be independently confirmed.
International monitors confirmed the clash but were uncertain about
the number of casualties.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence have frequently armed themselves in neighboring
Albania.
	   The worst reported violence in Kosovo in more than two months
casts further gloom on the diplomatic efforts to bring a lasting
peace to the Serbian province, where many believe a resumption of
full-scale fighting by spring is inevitable.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since an Oct. 12
peace agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke halted
months of fighting in the separatist province in southern Serbia.
	   Holbrooke is expected in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade for
talks with government officials on Tuesday. But after two months of
failed shuttle diplomacy, chances of mediating an end to the
continuing violence in Kosovo seem unlikely.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule, while the rebels say they won't
accept anything short of independence. Serbia, meanwhile, refuses
to consider anything more than partial autonomy for the
Albanian-majority province.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who met with ethnic Albanian
negotiators in Pristina on Monday and who also plans to be in
Belgrade on Tuesday, has seen his proposals for a political
settlement rejected by both sides.
	   The report by the Media Center, which has generally proved
reliable, said armed ethnic Albanians were trying to enter Kosovo
from Albania when the shootout erupted at 2 a.m. Monday near
Gorozup and Liken, southwest of Pristina.
	   Yugoslav soldiers confiscated arms and other material that the
Albanians were trying to smuggle in, the Media Center report said.
	   Municipal authorities in nearby Prizren were quoted as saying
that all those killed and wounded were wearing camouflage uniforms
with the insignia of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. Eight
Albanians were killed in a border clash near the same area on Dec.
3.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is assembling a force of 2,000 unarmed peace verifiers under the
terms of the agreement, had no immediate comment. The OSCE has
previously condemned the violence and blamed both sides.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
were left homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
launched a crackdown against separatist rebels in February.
	   Meanwhile, a delegation of Kosovo's Serbs arrived in Pristina to
plead with international peace monitors to find loved ones who
disappeared five months ago.
	   About 50 Serbs met with Gabriel Keller, deputy head of the
2,000-strong OSCE peace mission.
	   Keller received a list of the missing people whom the Serbs
believe were kidnapped by KLA rebels, and promised the OSCE would
``try its best to find traces of the missing.''
	   In another development, the second-ranking diplomat at the
French embassy in Belgrade and two other embassy employees were
killed Monday in a car accident in Kosovo.
	   French officials said Gerard Fauveau, the embassy's first
counselor, fellow diplomat Richard Berthaux and embassy security
guard Jean-Pierre Latour were killed when their car collided with a
passenger bus in Besinje, just north of Pristina.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Barely solvent Russian banks are a looming problem
and several should be closed or more tightly controlled by the
government, the president of the European Bank of Reconstruction
and Development said Monday.
	   The EBRD has been a big lender to Russia's beleaguered banks,
many of which were crushed by the August devaluation of the ruble
and default on treasury debt, two events that sparked the country's
economic crisis.
	   Bank president Horst Koehler said the EBRD could lend Russia
another $1 billion, ``but this is dependent on an improvement in
business climate.'' He did not say what sectors the money would
target.
	   ``I am first of all interested in the banking sector,'' he said,
speaking at a Moscow conference that included visiting executives
from many large Western firms. ``Our concern is that there are too
many insolvent banks that have been allowed to continue
operating.''
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who also spoke at
Monday's conference, said the Cabinet would ``do its best to
improve the investment climate'' _ but said the country needs
investment in factories and industry, not stock markets.
	   Russian leaders have complained that many foreign investors have
focused on liquid investments, such as stocks, that quickly
evaporated after Russia's financial markets collapsed in August.
	   ``There will be no isolation from the rest of the world,''
Primakov told the Consultative Council on Foreign Investments.
``Russia is interested in investments.''
	   Primakov said his government would like to see foreign money
directed more toward major industries that are ailing.
	   Many investors see Soviet-era industrial firms as too
inefficient to merit the large-scale investments that would be
required. Also, Russian law has often frustrated foreign investors,
such as oil companies, which have established major projects only
to see them founder because of repeated bureaucratic delays.
	   ``Many production facilities are now idle in our country,'' said
First Vice Premier Yuri Maslyukov. ``We must give the green light
to large strategic investors into the economy of Russia.''
	   Primakov also said the government was setting up an investment
insurance agency to protect investors from political risks.
	   The EBRD has repeatedly cited Russian banks as a major problem.
Nevertheless, the EBRD has lent Russia at least $3 billion since
1994.
	   Russia's market collapse in August was part of the larger
meltdown that hit emerging markets worldwide. The Russian economy
is expected to contract about 5 percent this year, and to shrink
next year as well.
	   Russia's economic decline in the 1990s is one of the worst
depressions ever suffered by an industrialized nation.

	   VAIL, Colo. (AP) _ Take it to Russia and you might get arrested
for spying. Take it up a chairlift here, and you'll know exactly
where you skied, how far and how fast.
	   Skiers who must have the latest gadget can try the
SportsTracker, which follows a skier's progress by using the Global
Positioning System, or GPS, a network of orbiting satellites
developed by the U.S. military.
	   Skiers can rent a lightweight GPS receiver the size of a pack of
cigarettes, turn it in at the end of the day and get a map of the
mountain with colored lines showing where they skied and how fast.
It costs $27 a day.
	   Not bad for indisputable bragging rights, said Jeff Cricco, 24.
``People want to say, `This is where I skied, this is my exact line
_ and show it off.'''
	   The gadget was created by former chef and ski bum James ``Hoot''
Gibson, who hopes it will catch on with mountain bikers, hikers,
even golfers. Last year, an American technician using GPS equipment
to install a cellular phone system in Russia was arrested on
espionage charges. He was later released.
	   Gibson said the device eventually could be used by parents to
keep track of their children while they ski, and he plans to add a
911 button allowing skiers to signal if they are in trouble so
authorities can locate them instantly.

	   SESTRIERE, Italy (AP) _ Norway's Finn Christian Jagge edged
Austrian Thomas Stangassinger by six hundredths of a second in a
battle between veteran skiers as he captured the third World Cup
slalom of the season Monday night.
	   The 32-year-old Norwegian, a former Olympic slalom champion,
mastered an icy track, shining under floodlight, in the combined
time of one minute, 51.92 seconds.
	   For Jagge it was the fifth World Cup career victory and a repeat
of his triumph in last year's night slalom at Sestriere.
	   Stangassinger, 33, winner of the previous World Cup slalom at
Aspen, completed the two runs in 1:51.98.
	   Slovenian Jure Kosir placed third for his best slalom showing
since 1996.
	   French rising star Pierrick Bourgeat, who had won the season
opener at Park City, edged Norwegian Kjetil Andre Aamodt for fourth
place.
	   Austrian Christian Mayer trailed the winner by 1.64 seconds in
sixth place.
	   Olympic slalom champion Hans-Petter Buraas was one of the
victims of the demanding, hard course as he fell midway through the
second run,
	   The Giovanni Agnelli track, named after the young heir of the
Agnelli family who died last year, was the same which hosted the
slalom race of the 1997 World Championships, when Norwegian Tom
Stiansen beat Sebastien Amiez and Alberto Tomba for gold.
	   Tomba, a three-time Olympic champion who announced his
retirement last October, was the big absentee at his favorite
course where he won the first of his 50 World Cup career wins.
	   Tomba retirement left Italian fans and the national slalom team
astray.
	   However Italian supporters still had something to cheer as young
Giorgio Rocca rallied ten places from the first run to finish
seventh - his best career showing.
	   Austrian World Cup leader Stephan Eberharter and other
specialists of speed races did not compete in Sestriere, to spare
form and determination for the back-to-back downhill races
scheduled in Val Gardena, northern Italy, Friday and Saturday.
	   Eberharter, who was off to a better season start than defending
overall, super-G and giant slalom champion Hermann Maier, commands
the overall standings with 368 points after eight races.
	   Mayer, who pocketed 40 points Monday, strenghened his second
place at 342.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A tenuous standoff between Serbian
forces and separatist rebels in Kosovo exploded in violence Monday
in the worst clash since an October truce _ a five-hour gunbattle
in which border guards killed dozens of guerrillas.
	   The pre-dawn clash along Kosovo's southwestern border with
Albania resulted in Yugoslav army troops killing at least 30 ethnic
Albanians and wounding 12 who were trying to enter the country
illegally, the Serb-run Media Center reported.
	   Hours later, according to ethnic Albanian sources, heavy
detonations and shootings were heard from the area of three nearby
villages about 45 miles (70 kilometers) southwest of Pristina that
had been sealed off by Serb police.
	   Details of the fighting could not be independently confirmed.
International monitors confirmed the clash but were uncertain about
the number of casualties.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence have frequently armed themselves in neighboring
Albania.
	   The worst reported violence in Kosovo in more than two months
casts further gloom on the diplomatic efforts to bring a lasting
peace to the Serbian province, where many believe a resumption of
full-scale fighting by spring is inevitable.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since an Oct. 12
peace agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke halted
months of fighting in the separatist province in southern Serbia.
	   Holbrooke is expected in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade for
talks with government officials on Tuesday. But after two months of
failed shuttle diplomacy, chances of mediating an end to the
continuing violence in Kosovo seem unlikely.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule, while the rebels say they won't
accept anything short of independence. Serbia, meanwhile, refuses
to consider anything more than partial autonomy for the
Albanian-majority province.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who met with ethnic Albanian
negotiators in Pristina on Monday and who also plans to be in
Belgrade on Tuesday, has seen his proposals for a political
settlement rejected by both sides.
	   The report by the Media Center, which has generally proved
reliable, said armed ethnic Albanians were trying to enter Kosovo
from Albania when the shootout erupted at 2 a.m. Monday near
Gorozup and Liken, southwest of Pristina.
	   Yugoslav soldiers confiscated arms and other material that the
Albanians were trying to smuggle in, the Media Center report said.
	   Municipal authorities in nearby Prizren were quoted as saying
that all those killed and wounded were wearing camouflage uniforms
with the insignia of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. Eight
Albanians were killed in a border clash near the same area on Dec.
3.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is assembling a force of 2,000 unarmed peace verifiers under the
terms of the agreement, had no immediate comment. The OSCE has
previously condemned the violence and blamed both sides.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
were left homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
launched a crackdown against separatist rebels in February.
	   Meanwhile, a delegation of Kosovo's Serbs arrived in Pristina to
plead with international peace monitors to find loved ones who
disappeared five months ago.
	   About 50 Serbs met with Gabriel Keller, deputy head of the
2,000-strong OSCE peace mission.
	   Keller received a list of the missing people whom the Serbs
believe were kidnapped by KLA rebels, and promised the OSCE would
``try its best to find traces of the missing.''
	   In another development, the second-ranking diplomat at the
French embassy in Belgrade and two other embassy employees were
killed Monday in a car accident in Kosovo.
	   French officials said Gerard Fauveau, the embassy's first
counselor, fellow diplomat Richard Berthaux and embassy security
guard Jean-Pierre Latour were killed when their car collided with a
passenger bus in Besinje, just north of Pristina.

Royal Dutch-Shell to sell off 40 percent of chemicals

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Oil giant Royal Dutch-Shell warned Monday that its
fourth-quarter earnings will fall dlrs 4.5 billion because of a
group restructuring that includes the sale of 40 percent of its
chemical business.
	   But the company said it will also achieve savings of dlrs 2.5
billion a year by 2001 in a major cost cutting program that is part
of its regrouping designed to better protect itself from declining
oil prices, which are the lowest they have been in 12 years.
	   Shell's shares closed down 3.75 pence at 350.25 pence on the
London Stock Exchange on the back of the company's announcement.
	   ``We have had to make tough choices,'' Shell chairman Mark
Moody-Stuart said. ``But although we have made some very big cuts,
with an dlrs 11 billion global spending program, we still have
plenty of room for growth ... and remain ahead of the
competition.''
	   Several oil companies have announced significant consolidations
and revampings in the last few weeks, including Exxon Corp. and
Mobil Corp., who plan a dlrs 73.7 billion merger.
	   ``We have looked at merger possibilities and will continue to
look at such possibilities, and if the right opportunity arises, we
will act,'' Moody-Stuart said.
	   ``But we are large enough to be the leading company on our own
without any merger,'' he said. ``We have a great deal of work to do
in our own shop.''
	   Oil prices have fallen as producers have flooded the market with
a surplus of crude. And the global economic slowdown has depressed
demand for fuel, making the prospect of higher prices in the near
future unlikely.
	   Announcing the plan, Shell said the drop in earnings would be
due to reorganization costs, a reduction in the value of some
assets and because of compensation paid to employees being laid
off. In the last few weeks, the company has announced it is to
slash 4,000 jobs.
	   The group is to reduce the number of its chemical product
businesses from 21 to 13 and half of the Dutch petrochemical
company Montell will be sold off, Shell said.
	   Products such as building blocks and large volume polymers will
be the focus of the company's plans for the future.
	   Shell's strategy was first unveiled to a group of financial
analysts on Monday.
	   An investment fund manager who attended the meeting said he
welcomed the company facing up to its problems.
	   ``It's more revolution than evolution this time,'' said the
analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``It's been a very
disappointing year for the company and they have acknowledged that.
That's often the first step toward improving things.''
	   Moody-Stuart said management changes announced Thursday should
result in a much greater degree of executive accountability at all
levels.

Stricken minister Chevenement to return to work in January
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement,
recovering from a life-threatening allergic reaction he suffered
during surgery, plans to return to work in January, the government
said Monday.
	   Chevenement ``will resume his functions at the beginning of next
year,'' the prime minister's office said, adding the exact date was
``dependent on medical opinion.''
	   Sitting in for Chevenement as acting minister is Jean-Jack
Queyranne, a junior minister for overseas territories.
	   Last month, the 59-year-old Chevenement appeared at a film
festival in Belfort, in eastern France, and said his recovery was
on schedule. ``God didn't want me, but the devil didn't either, so
I came back,'' Chevenement said at the time.
	   Chevenement's heart stopped for nearly an hour Sept. 2 after he
was administered curare, a muscle relaxant known to cause allergic
reactions in some patients, just ahead of planned gall bladder
surgery. He spent eight days in a coma.
	   Chevenement is a key figure in Socialist Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's Cabinet. He has held several ministry portfolios in
previous governments, including industry, education and defense.
	   He resigned as defense minister in 1991 to protest France's
involvement with the U.S.-led alliance in the Gulf War against
Iraq.
	   As interior minister, he is responsible for the nation's police
and security forces.

Russian Communist chief meets with Gadhafi

 &UR; Eds; UPDATES with Zyuganov meeting Gadhafi, addresses parliament &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Russian Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi Monday and
discussed enhancing cooperation between the two countries.
	   Zyuganov described the talks as ``interesting'' and said the two
discussed ``means of fortifying and deepening ties between Russia
and Libya.''
	   Zyuganov made the remarks while addressing the members of the
General People's Congress, or Parliament. He arrived in Tripoli
Sunday at the invitation of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
	   In his speech to Parliament, Zyuganov blasted the U.N. flight
sanctions on Libya imposed in 1992 to force it to hand over two
suspects in the Dec. 21 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over
Scotland.
	   ``It is morally incorrect for an entire people to be under
sanctions,'' Zyuganov said.
	   ``In the 21st century, there should be a world free of sanctions
and aggressions,'' he added.
	   On Sunday, Zyuganov called for the lifting of U.N. sanctions and
``condemned the unjust measures,'' saying they contravened all
international values and principles.
	   The General People's Congress is currently discussing the fate
of the Libyans suspects in the Pan Am bombing.
	   Libya has accepted in principle to a trial of the two suspects
before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands. But the hand
over of the men has been held up because of Libya's demand for a
guarantee that the two men, if convicted, will be jailed in Libya.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects serve
their prison term in Britain.
	   Some 270 people were killed on board and on ground when the
jetliner blew up over the Scottish town of Lockerbie.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Global warming threatens Canada's frigid far
north, where the expected thaw could displace wildlife, increase
pollution and destabilize infrastructure across the Canadian
sub-Arctic, a new study warns.
	   The study, released by Canada's environment department,
expresses particular concern for the region's indigenous people,
the Inuit, who could find their hunting prey out of reach, their
water supplies contaminated and their coastal communities subjected
to erosion from seas no longer covered by ice.

NBA lockout claims 100 league jobs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Stern quotes on possibility of layoffs &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The National Basketball Association has lost
more than 100 employees during the lockout and its workforce is
expected to shrink even more.
	   Commissioner David Stern said some of the remaining employees
could face layoffs if the season is canceled.
	   ``We're still hoping to make a deal, so we haven't contemplated
that yet. But obviously that would affect the situation
dramatically,'' Stern said. ``Right now, we're 125 positions
reduced from where we were in June through attrition and the
elimination of part-time work and the like. We're achieving very
successful cutbacks without mandating layoffs.''
	   The league has had a hiring freeze and payroll freeze since July
1, and Stern has not been drawing his salary.
	   League spokesman Brian McIntyre said those who left their jobs
worked in various departments in a variety of positions. All of
them, he added, left voluntarily.
	   The number of league employees is down to about 750. The NBA
office draws its budget from a 6 percent cut of gate receipts. The
losses represent more than 10 percent of the NBA's employees.
	   Many NBA employees _ some of whom have been lamenting their job
security for weeks _ planned to attend the league's Christmas party
on Monday at the NBA Store in Manhattan.
	   Another new twist was added to the lockout on Monday as Newsweek
reported that some players believe race is playing a factor in
negotiations.
	   The union's leadership and all but two of the players on the
negotiating committee are black, while all the owners and the
league's top two officials are white.
	   ``I think there is a perception from the owners to even some
fans that we're blacks who should be happy with what we've got _
fair or not,'' said Alonzo Mourning of the Miami Heat. ``There's a
lack of respect given us in large part because we're athletes. I'm
not saying it's all about race because it's not _ but it plays a
factor.
	   Stern denied race is an issue and pointed out that the league
has successfully promoted a sport whose player population is nearly
90 percent black.
	   The league and the union met Saturday for less than 30 minutes,
one of their shortest meetings of the 5 1/2-month-old dispute.
	   The quick end to Saturday's session surprised many around the
league, especially some on the ownership side who had been told
after Thursday's secret negotiating session that a deal was close.
	   The union contingent seemed to think the same thing as it walked
into Saturday's meeting, hoping the sides would make enough
progress to call back the full negotiating teams Tuesday or
Wednesday to perhaps close the deal.
	   But the league's bargaining team took a different tack, arriving
in a gloom-and-doom mode.
	   The union's offer, which was believed to include an absolute
limit on the top salary for any player with less than seven years'
of experience, wasn't good enough to keep Stern at the table.
	   Stern has said the season will cancel itself if a deal isn't
reached in the not-too-distant future. The union still thinks he is
bluffing.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a historic day stirring
Palestinian passions for statehood, President Bill Clinton stood
witness Monday as hundreds of Palestinian leaders renounced a call
for the destruction of Israel. Clinton urged ``legitimate rights
for Palestinians, real security for Israel.''
	   The Palestinian vote _ registered with a show of hands and
applause _ removed a contentious issue dating back to 1964 from the
crisis-shrouded Mideast peace process.
	   The action cleared the way for a three-way meeting Tuesday
morning among Clinton, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. At stake was the revival of the
Wye River land-for-security accord, nearing collapse with Israelis
and the Palestinians accusing each other of violating the deal.

EU farm ministers clear last hurdle to approve Russian food aid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union farm ministers agreed on
a $460 million program Monday that would send tons of European
grain, beef and other food aid to Russia, possibly as soon as the
end of January, officials said.
	   ``The ministers have unanimously endorsed the program,'' said EU
Commission spokesman Gerry Kiely, after the EU executive hammered
home the need for strict monitoring to make sure the aid does not
end up in the hands of black marketeers.
	   The program will now be sent to the European parliament for an
assessment. The legislature cannot stop the deal, however, and it
is expected to be finally approved at a meeting of EU fisheries
ministers on Thursday or Friday.
	   Under the current program, the 15 EU member nations, the
Commission and the European Parliament will share responsibility to
make sure the food reaches the needy.
	   There will be monthly reports from Russia, the EU's Court of
Auditors will be allowed to inspect the distribution of the aid in
Russia itself and the local governors will be handed detailed lists
of what should be coming their way, Kiely said.
	   The food aid will be sold in Russia at market prices, and
profits used to fund social projects.
	   The EU had been debating the aid package since Nov. 9, four days
after the United States announced it would provide Russia with a
$600 million food aid package.
	   Russia's worst grain harvest in 40 years, combined with the
summer's financial collapse, have sent prices 50 percent higher and
prompted fears the poor won't be able to afford food through the
winter.

Bypass surgery for Falcons' Reeves
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CAROL WOODFORD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Dan Reeves, who has the Atlanta Falcons on pace
for their best National Football League season, underwent
triple-bypass surgery today after feeling ill during Sunday's game.
	   Team physician Dr. Charles Harrison said there had been no
damage to the 54-year-old coach's heart and he is expected to be
discharged Friday. The operation at Piedmont Hospital was to last
four hours.
	   Falcons president Taylor Smith, speaking at a news conference at
the team's training camp in Suwanee, said defensive coordinator
Rich Brooks would act as head coach for this weekend's game at
Detroit.
	   Harrison said he expects Reeves to be able to coach during the
playoffs.
	   Ann Reeves, the coach's mother, told The Associated Press that
her son experienced a burning sensation in his throat during the
game in New Orleans against the Saints. She said her son had
surgery to clear his arteries in 1990 and 1991 while coaching
Denver.
	   ``He knew he was having difficulty so he went this morning'' to
the hospital, she said.
	   The Falcons (12-2), in first place in the NFC West, defeated the
Saints 27-17. Reeves and the team flew back to Atlanta late Sunday.
	   Reeves, the NFL's winningest active coach, is a three-time AFC
coach of the year.
	   He is in his second year at Atlanta and is given much of the
credit for the team's turnaround. The Falcons have won 17 of their
last 20 games after years of mediocrity, including a 3-13 finish
the year before Reeves arrived.
	   He coached the Giants for four years and was honored as NFL
coach of the year in 1993. He left after two straight losing
seasons and a feud with management over personnel decisions.
	   Reeves led the Broncos for 12 years, taking them to the Super
Bowl three times during the 1980s.

a hostile takeover by crosstown rival The Toronto Star, have

the equivalent of $639 million in U.S. funds.
	   That topped the recently increased offer by Torstar Corp. of 900
million Canadian dollars, or $585 million, up from its initial bid
in Octover of 748 million Canadian dollars, or $486 million.
	   Quebecor plans to combine Sun Media's assets with its own
newspapers in a new publishing division to be headed by Sun Media's
chief executive Paul Godfrey.
	   Torstar could try to outbid Quebecor by raising its own bid
again, but its chances of getting enough support among Sun Media
shareholders are slight, according to Quebecor and Sun Media
executives.
	   Sun Media said Dec. 9 its board of directors has unanimously
approved the Quebecor offer and will recommend the bid to
shareholders. The offer is scheduled to be mailed by Dec. 18.
	   Torstar's takeover bid on Oct. 28 provoked anger at Sun Media
and surprise elsewhere in Canada, because the Star _ Canada's
largest circulation paper _ and the Toronto Sun are so different in
style and outlook.
	   The Star is perhaps the country's most earnestly liberal paper,
with strong sympathies for feminism, anti-poverty programs and gay
rights, among many other causes. The Sun is home to several of
Canada's most caustic right-wing columnists and features a
bikini-clad Sunshine Girl on Page Three each day.
	   Quebecor is Canada's largest commercial printer. It also
publishes daily papers in Montreal, Quebec City, Winnipeg, Manitoba
and Sherbrooke, Quebec, and 56 weeklies.
	   Sun Media publishes seven dailies, including Sun tabloids in
Toronto, Ottawa, Calgary and Edmonton.

 &UR; Texas newspaper reporter listed missing in southern Mexico
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A correspondent for the San Antonio
Express-News was listed as missing, two weeks after he set out to
hike into the mountains of the Sierra Madre Occidental of western
Mexico.
	   Mexico City-based correspondent Philip True headed into the
mountains in western Jalisco state Nov. 29, with dehydrated food,
water, a camera and sleeping bag, hoping to photograph the rough
terrain and write about the Huichol Indians who live there.
	   True intended to hike for 65 miles through neighboring Nayarit
state until Dec. 10. He was last seen around Dec. 1 at Tuxpan,
Jalisco, 370 miles northwest of Mexico City.
	   ``We are seriously concerned, but we remain optimistic that
Philip will be located in good condition,'' said Robert Rivard,
senior vice president of the Express-News.
	   Local authorities in four Mexican states began cooperating in
search efforts for True, 50, an experienced hiker who has written
for the Express-News from Mexico since January 1996.
	   The region is extremely remote with few roads and telephone
service only in some larger towns.

 &UR; AWARDS:
 &UR; Belarusian journalist receives press freedom award
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A Belarusian journalist, barred from
traveling to New York to accept a press freedom award, received the
honor in Minsk from officials of the New York-based Committee to
Protect Journalists.
	   CPJ leaders, including director Ann Cooper, flew to Belarus to
give Pavel Sheremet the International Press Freedom Award in person
on Dec. 8.
	   ``We came here to show our personal support and solidarity with
Pavel Sheremet and all Belarusian journalists who continue to
perform their professional duties in such difficult conditions,''
said Chrystina Lapychak, program coordinator for Eastern Europe.
	   Sheremet, Minsk bureau chief for Russia's ORT television and
chief editor of the newspaper Belarusskaya Delovaya Gazeta, was
selected ``for his great courage and ability to defend his rights
despite constant persecution,'' she said.
	   Sheremet has endured arrest and imprisonment while covering the
increasingly strict government in this former Soviet republic.
	   Belarus' visa department refused him an exit visa to attend the
Nov. 24 CPJ award ceremony in New York, citing orders from the
administration of President Alexander Lukashenko.
	   Belarusian citizens still need an exit visa to leave the
country, a practice left over from Soviet times that has been
abolished in most other former Soviet republics.
	   ``A couple of years ago fear prevented us from struggling for a
normal, human life,'' Sheremet said in his acceptance speech in
Minsk's central Hotel Yubileinaya.
	   ``Belarus is viewed in the world as a country of dictatorship
... but I am sure that in several years Belarus will be viewed as a
normal country, where nobody will be able to impose on the people
the (Soviet-style) system the entire world has already abandoned.''
	   Lukashenko frequently has complained about Russian news coverage
of his country, and has claimed on several occasions that Sheremet
and other journalists were trying to harm Belarus' image.
	   Despite protests by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and human
rights activists, Belarusian authorities held Sheremet in jail for
2{ months and then gave him a two-year suspended sentence for a
report on Belarus' lax border controls.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ The resignation Monday of Prime Minister
Ahmed Ouyahia, struggling with a political and economic crisis,
opened the way for a caretaker government ahead of an early
presidential election next spring.
	   After three years in power Ouyahia managed to knock down
inflation to about 5 percent, but unemployment remains around 30
percent and a Muslim insurgency will be seven years old next month.
	   President Liamine Zeroual noted ``the work done and the results
obtained'' by Ouyahia, but he accepted the prime minister's
resignation as expected.
	   Senator Smail Hamdani is expected to form the new government,
but there had not yet been an official announcement of who would
succeed Ouyahia. The new government is expected to be made of
technocrats whose main task would be to prepare for the election,
set for April.
	   Ouyahia has been rumored as a potential candidate, but his
popularity is at a low point.
	   The struggling Algerian economy further foundered under Ouyahia.
Sinking oil prices sharply reduced the country's foreign currency
earnings, 95 percent of which come from the sale of oil and gas.
	   Ouyahia also was unable to quell an Islamic insurgency that
erupted in 1992 when the government canceled parliamentary
elections that the now banned Islamic Salvation Front was expected
to win. At least 75,000 people have died in the violence.
	   Hamdani, 68, who began his career in the diplomatic service, has
a reputation as a pragmatic politician. A former ambassador to
Paris, he has been one of the architects of Algeria's foreign
policy.

DiMaggio, on the mend, talks with his lawyer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ American baseball legend Joe DiMaggio felt good
enough Monday to sit up in bed and talk football with his lawyer,
another step in his remarkable recovery from a coma that had left
him near death.
	   ``Joe looked great this morning,'' attorney Morris Engelberg
told The Associated Press on Monday. ``I was shaking his hand,
talking about the game last night. He is a miracle man.''
	   The New York Jets defeated the Miami Dolphins 21-16 Sunday
night, and because the television is often on in DiMaggio's room,
Engelberg thinks the 84-year-old baseball great was watching the
game.
	   DiMaggio, who developed pneumonia following cancer surgery at
Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida, fell into a coma
late last week and doctors described his situation ``dire.''
	   His condition improved dramatically when doctors discovered an
antibiotic medication was not being absorbed into his bloodstream
and began administering it intravenously instead of orally.
	   ``These people saved his life,'' Engelberg said.
	   DiMaggio, however, became upset when he learned from family and
friends of the extensive coverage of his condition. The Hall of
Famer told his doctors and lawyer to stop discussing his health
with the media.
	   He admonished his doctors for their daily updates, saying ``No
more press.''
	   DiMaggio's brother, Dom, told the Sun-Sentinel of Fort
Lauderdale, ``It was like putting a television set in Joe's
hospital room.
	   ``It was against Joe's wishes, against my wishes, against the
family's wishes. He deserves a little privacy. I talked to the
doctor and I thought he was going a little too far in his
explanations and descriptions.
	   ``These are very sad days for myself, my immediate family and
friends. I would urge people around the world who care for him to
remember Joe in their prayers.''
	   Doctors were considering upgrading DiMaggio's condition from
critical to serious. But Engelberg, following DiMaggio's orders,
refused to say if that had been done.
	   ``Joe DiMaggio's health condition is a private matter and he has
requested that there be no further release of information,''
Engelberg said.
	   ``Mr. DiMaggio and his family wish to thank all of the millions
of people praying for him and the thousands of letters he has
received wishing him a speedy recovery.
	   ``Our only concern is to get Joe out of the hospital and get him
better.''

World Council of Churches vows to instill accountability in world
</HEADLINE>
economy &QL; 
 &UR; By RICHARD N. OSTLING &QC; 
 &UR; AP Religion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The World Council of Churches wound up
its second assembly this decade with a rejection Monday of an
unfettered global economy, vowing to help create institutions that
hold the free market accountable to social values.
	   The assembly, which takes place every seven years, also approved
a study of the ``diversity'' of human sexuality _ which in effect
includes homosexuality _ despite objections by a Russian Orthodox
delegation which has criticized what it sees as the council's more
liberal trend.
	   In its flurry of final pronouncements ending the 12-day
assembly, the council also denounced the use of child soldiers and
reaffirmed its position that the United Nations should maintain
stewardship over Jerusalem.
	   This year's assembly in the Zimbabwe capital of Harare brought
together 960 delegates from 112 countries representing churches
with 350 to 450 million non-Catholic Christians.
	   The council said it will make the ``globalization'' of the
economy a ``central emphasis'' of the ecumenical agenda.
	   Member churches will work toward creating global economic
institutions of to counter ``the unaccountable power of
transnational corporations and organizations that often operate
around the world with impunity,'' the council said.
	   The council said in a paper on economics that it lamented the
rise of ``a subtle but powerful ideology which assumes that the
most promising way to improve the quality of life for all people is
to give free rein to market forces.''
	   World power is increasingly concentrated in 30 or so rich
nations and 60 multinational corporations, and the global media has
become part of a successful strategy by the United States and other
nations to ``secure military and political hegemony on a global
scale,'' the council said.
	   Economic globalization is eroding the importance of nation
states, undermining social cohesion and intensifying a ``merciless
attack'' on the environment, the council said.
	   The council also called on member churches to seek cancellation
of international debt for the world's most impoverished nations and
reduction of debt for middle-income nations by the end of 1999.
	   The council endorsed a ``study of human sexuality, in all of its
diversity.'' A Russian Orthodox representative, who had petitioned
to drop the matter entirely, warned ``improper work'' on
homosexuality would risk the loss of additional Orthodox churches
from the council's membership.
	   The council proclaimed that the United Nations should retain
authority over Jerusalem and reserve the right to authorize any
changes in its status. No action by one state or party has force of
law, the council said.
	   ``Jerusalem must be a shared city in terms of sovereignty and
citizenship,'' that rights of both Palestinians and Israelis should
be honored, and that freedom of worship and access to holy places
must be guaranteed for Christians, Muslims and Jews alike, the
council said.

Rafsanjani's daughter fined, banned from publishing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A court on Monday fined and temporarily shut
down a daily newspaper headed by Iran's leading woman activist and
a weekly newspaper, Iranian television reported.
	   The reports did not say why the penalties were imposed on Zan
and Bavar. Only last Tuesday, Zan's owner, Faezeh Hashemi, was
cleared by a court of publishing untruths.
	   Hashemi or court officials were not immediately available for
comment.
	   The television report said Hashemi, the daughter of former
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, was fined 2.5 million rials (dlrs
833) and prohibited from publishing for two weeks.
	   The court also fined the proprietor of Bavar, Mirza Baba
Motahhari-Nezhad, 3 million rials (dlrs 1,000) and banned him from
publishing Bavar or any other paper for six months.
	   The penalties are part of a crackdown on several liberal
newspapers by hard-liners in the judiciary, and are the best
representation of the conservative clergy's moves to thwart
moderate President Mohammad Khatami's efforts to open up the
society by allowing a free press.
	   Hashemi, who is a member of Parliament, is one of the country's
top advocates for women's rights.
	   Her earlier problem in court stemmed from a complaint filed last
month by the head of police intelligence, Mohammad Naqdi, against
Zan for implying he was involved in the September attack on Iran's
Culture Minister Ataollah Mohajerani and former Interior Minister
Abdollah Nouri.
	   Naqdi is a hard-liner while Mohajerani and Nouri are Khatami's
allies.
	   Zan said witnesses had seen Naqdi in street clothes at the scene
of the attack.
	   Hard-liners in the judiciary have shut down six other
publications in recent months and detained six journalists for
allegedly publishing lies.

New Palestinian industrial zone opened to mark Clinton visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARNI, Gaza Strip (AP) - In another small step toward peace,
Israel and the Palestinians inaugurated their first joint
industrial park Monday, which will give jobs to 20,000 Palestinians
and a boost to Gaza's flagging economy.
	   U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley and his Israeli and
Palestinian counterparts, Natan Sharansky and Abdel Nofal, were on
hand for the ceremony that coincided with U.S. President Bill
Clinton's historic visit to the Gaza Strip.
	   The opening of the Karni Industrial Estate is part of the Wye
River peace agreement Clinton helped negotiate.
	   Karni lies just inside the Gaza Strip, close to the border fence
with Israel. It is the first of a series of industrial parks which
Israel and the Palestinian Authority hope to establish, with
international aid, to create jobs in the Palestinian areas.
	   Palestinian unemployment is highest in the Gaza Strip.
	   For the ceremony the Palestinians decorated the park with
American and Palestinian flags, but not Israeli flags.
	   Daley told The Associated Press that Coca-Cola and other large
corporations had expressed interest in opening production plants in
Karni.
	   The three governments hope that Palestinian, Israeli and
overseas entrepreneurs will be attracted to Karni. At the ceremony,
Sharansky announced that he had instructed the government's foreign
trade insurance corporation to budget dlrs 50 million to underwrite
Israeli investments at Karni.
	   Israel spent 60 million shekels (dlrs 15 million) in
construction of the industrial park and approximately the same
amount in security devices for X-raying trucks at the Karni
crossing point before they enter Israel.
	   Nofal said he and Sharansky were cooperating, with the help of
the Americans, to market the facility to overseas investors.

Gene therapy builds strong muscles in laboratory mouse study
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Injecting new genes into aging muscles can
restore youthful vigor and strength, according to a laboratory
study of mice. But researchers caution that many safety questions
must be resolved before they can try the therapy on humans.
	   Old mice gained 27 percent of the muscle lost to age when they
were injected with a gene that prompts muscle cell growth, the
researchers at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center said
Monday.
	   For younger mice, the gain was about 15 percent, said Dr. H. Lee
Sweeney, the study's senior author.
	   Before the technique is ready for humans, however, there are
both ethical and safety questions to be resolved, Sweeney said. For
athletes, he said, the injections could be the ``perfect
performance enhancer.''
	   ``You build muscle mass and strength even without exercise,''
said Sweeney. ``And it is not detectable in the blood.''
	   Olympic athletes are routinely tested for drugs that
artificially improve strength and performance. Most such drugs are
now outlawed.
	   The safety issue arises because the same gene that causes
muscles to grow can also cause the overgrowth of unwanted cells.
	   ``Abnormal growth could be a health risk,'' said Sweeney. ``For
instance, you wouldn't want your heart to grow larger.''
	   Nonetheless, the experimental gene therapy offers the promise of
correcting one of the major problems of aging _ muscle feebleness,
the researcher said.
	   Some experts estimate that humans lose 10 percent of their
muscle strength and mass each decade after the age of 50. Weakness
from old age can cause falls, broken bones and loss of the ability
to walk or care for oneself.
	   This feebleness may be caused because the muscles stop making a
protein called insulin growth factor-1, or IGF-1, which causes new
cells to grow,
	   In muscle tissue, that protein sends a signal to satellite
cells, which are immature cells within the muscle tissue. The
signal turns the satellite cells into functional muscle cells,
which then replace damaged or weaken tissue.
	   Without the IGF-1 signal, muscle cells that wear out or become
injured are not replaced and a person becomes weaker.
	   To deliver the growth factor gene, the researchers used what is
called an adeno-associated virus. The scientists first stripped the
virus of any genes that would cause disease, then inserted the gene
for the growth factor.
	   When it was injected into mouse muscle, the altered virus
quickly infected nearby cells, delivering the growth factor gene
but causing no other infection.
	   Once in place, the new gene caused the muscles to make IGF-1,
which, in turn, led to more muscles.
	   But the therapy worked only in the muscles directly receiving
the injection. It would thus be ``cumbersome'' and take scores of
injections to treat each muscle in the body, the researcher said.
	   ``Instead, you would inject only into the muscles necessary for
walking or other daily functions,'' said Sweeney. ``For the
majority of the elderly population, the border line between being
able to walk or not can be dealt with by targeting key muscle
groups.''
	   The experimental gene therapy next will be tested on rabbits and
then on monkeys. Even if those studies go smoothly, Sweeney said,
it will be at least two years before the gene therapy is ready for
human experiments.
	   Sweeney presented his study at a San Francisco meeting of the
American Society for Cell Biology. The study is to appear next week
in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a
scientific journal.

New Palestinian industrial zone opened to mark Clinton visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARNI, Gaza Strip (AP) - In another small step toward peace,
Israel and the Palestinians on Monday inaugurated their first joint
industrial park that will give jobs to 20,000 Palestinians and a
boost to Gaza's flagging economy.
	   U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley and his Israeli and
Palestinian counterparts, Natan Sharansky and Abdel Nofal, were on
hand for the ceremony that coincided with President Bill Clinton's
historic visit to the Gaza Strip.
	   The opening of the Karni Industrial Estate is part of the Wye
River peace agreement Clinton helped negotiate.
	   Karni lies just inside the Gaza Strip, close to the border fence
with Israel. It is the first of a series of industrial parks which
Israel and the Palestinian Authority hope to establish, with
international aid, to create jobs in the Palestinian areas.
	   Palestinian unemployment is highest in the Gaza Strip, where
unemployment is running high.
	   For the ceremony the Palestinians decorated the park with
American and Palestinian flags, but not Israeli flags, a sign of
the current poor relations between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Daley told The Associated Press that Coca Cola and other large
corporations had expressed interest in opening production plants in
Karni.
	   The three governments hope that Palestinian, Israeli and
overseas entrepreneurs will be attracted to Karni. At the ceremony,
Sharansky announced that he had instructed the government's foreign
trade insurance corporation to budget dlrs 50 million to underwrite
Israeli investments at Karni.
	   Israel spent 60 million shekels (dlrs 15 million) in
construction of the industrial park and approximately the same
amount in security devices for X-raying trucks at the Karni
crossing point before they enter Israel.
	   Nofal said he and Sharansky were cooperating, with the help of
the Americans, to market the facility to overseas investors.

	   JABALIYA REFUGEE CAMP, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Gathered with 12
grandchildren and other relatives around a tiny television,
Mohammed Nabham watched Yasser Arafat declare an end to hostilities
with Israel.
	   ``I have witnessed three wars, and I saw nothing but destruction
in these wars,'' Nabham said.
	   He lived in the tiny Gaza village of Jabaliya that mushroomed
into the world's most crowded refugee camp after Israel's war of
independence in 1948.
	   That was when Nabham was 20, just starting his family. In 1956,
Israel joined Britain and France in the Suez Canal war with Egypt _
and Israeli forces occupied Gaza for the first time.
	   His house was destroyed. It was the same year his son, Rabie,
was born.
	   Mohammed Nabham didn't get the wherewithal to build the house
again until 1967 _ the year Israel entered Gaza again. In that war,
Rabie lost his hand when he stepped on a mine.
	   On Monday, Nabham watched Arafat's speech to the Palestine
National Council on his TV set that was propped on a wobbly old
table.
	   In his speech, Arafat was imagining a future ``that will enable
Israeli and Palestinian children to work together to remove the
fences of hatred.''
	   Rabie Nabham's 12 children _ the girls in veils _ watched the TV
intently, seated on the straw mats that doubled as beds at night.
	   Their father _ Rabie, now 42 _ was skeptical.
	   ``America and Israel are much stronger than we are and so they
can afford to dictate what happens to us,'' he said.
	   His wife, Najah, said she was hopeful.
	   ``I remember the time of the intefadeh,'' she said referring to
the 1987-1993 Palestinian uprising, ``and how we had to hide most
of the day because of the constant clashes in the camp. I would
like to see a better future for my son.''
	   Outside the camp, children cheered a school bus of Gaza City
schoolchildren who had participated in the airport welcoming
ceremony.
	   Fifty years after witnessing his first war, Mohammed Nabham was
undecided.
	   ``Israel is a notorious enemy, but war brings so much
destruction, more than you can imagine. ... ''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   JERUSALEM _ Asked why the TV hanging from the ceiling of his
shop wasn't tuned into live coverage of President Bill Clinton's
visit to Gaza, Azriel Danieli laughed and said: ``This is a video
store _ that's a movie.''
	   Like many Israelis on Monday, Danieli didn't think the Clinton
visit would affect the way he feels about peace prospects with the
Palestinians.
	   ``The Palestinians will get a state,'' he said. ``I don't know
if I'm for it or against it, but that's what's going to happen.''
	   Dafna Shoham sold lottery tickets as usual on a downtown Tel
Aviv street.
	   ``This won't change very much because there are many complicated
things that still need to be solved,'' said Shoham, cradling her
dog.
	   Israeli leaders were transfixed by the events _ especially by
the Palestine National Council meeting convened to renunciate
clauses of the Palestinian charter calling for Israel's
destruction.
	   Legislators relaxed in the Knesset VIP lounge, watching the
proceedings on a widescreen TV.
	   Yael Dayan, whose father Moshe Dayan worked for the 1967
conquest of Gaza, smiled brightly and applauded her Palestinian
counterparts when they rose to approve the renunciation.
	   She leaned over and said ``Mazal Tov'' to Shimon Peres, the
former prime minister and an architect of the 1993 Oslo peace
accords. Other legislators also shook his hand.
	   ``This is a great day for the Palestinian people, I wish them
well,'' Peres said.
	   An aide to Peres' hard-line successor, Benjamin Netanyahu, was
also satisfied with the result.
	   ``This issue is now, as far as we are concerned, off the
table,'' David Bar-Illan said, flipping channels in his office.
	   Not all the proceedings pleased Bar-Illan. When a camera zoomed
in on Ghazi Gibali, the Palestinian police chief wanted in Israel
for plotting attacks, he shook his head and said: ``Ghazi Gibali
should be in jail, and there he is picking his nose.''

Rebel offer to swap prisoners creates dilemma for government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A guerrilla proposal to swap hundreds of
captured soldiers and police for jailed rebels has handed President
Andres Pastrana the most agonizing dilemma of his young government.
	   The offer by leftist insurgents to trade nearly 300 security
force members for 452 rebels held by the government figured
prominently in private talks Monday in the southern jungles between
presidential peace envoy Victor G. Ricardo and guerrilla chief
Manuel Marulanda.
	   Rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,
say the offer is a humanitarian gesture and an ice-breaker to get
peace talks going. But critics are wary of guerrilla intentions.
	   Few disagree that the offer is a leadership test for Pastrana,
who presides over a nation hungry to end decades of civil conflict.
	   Refuse, and Pastrana risks souring the FARC to what appear to be
the most promising peace talks in decades _ not to mention dashing
the hopes of family and friends of the mostly poor conscripts
carted off by the rebels since 1996.
	   Accept, and Pastrana grants the FARC unprecedented political
status while sending hundreds of hardened guerrillas, some of them
accused war criminals, back to their units.
	   All for a chance at building goodwill with a 15,000-member rebel
force that many feel has yet to prove its peaceful intentions.
	   ``It's a political and military decision of immense
transcendence,'' said former national security adviser Alfredo
Rangel, who claims the rebels are only using the negotiations to
further their battlefield advantage over Colombia's floundering
military.
	   The FARC has shrewdly reaped political gain from a three-year
string of military victories, said Rangel, giving Pastrana little
choice but to accept the proposed prisoner swap even though that
may exacerbate the violence.
	   Peace expectations, which soared after Pastrana's meeting with
Marulanda in August, have recently dimmed over security
arrangements for the negotiations, originally set to begin last
month, and ongoing guerrilla attacks.
	   At least 14 civilians, including five children, were killed in
weekend fighting with leftist rebels, many apparently victims of
rockets and strafing by military aircraft.
	   Three soldiers also died and 13 were wounded in combat that
began Saturday as troops pursued FARC units in the northeastern
state of Arauca, the military said. The army said fighting
continued in the area on Monday but provided no details.
	   The rebels have refused to negotiate until Pastrana removes all
troops from the main army base in a southern region selected as the
site of the talks.
	   Pastrana did pull 2,000 police and soldiers from the massive,
rebel-dominated area last month but he infuriated the FARC by
keeping 120 unarmed men on the base as support staff for government
negotiators.
	   If the impasse can be resolved, analysts expect the prisoner
exchange will be among the thorniest issues.
	   ``This could turn into a practically insolvable obstacle,''
wrote National University political analyst Eduardo Pizarro in
Cambio magazine.
	   With Pastrana appearing to give the prisoner exchange serious
consideration, humanitarian workers are warning him to think twice.
Some of the jailed rebels took part in political assassinations or
executions of captured troops, and at least 76 are charged with
kidnapping, the public prosecutor's office says.
	   ``This is a trial-run,'' said Carlos Rodriguez of the Colombian
Commission of Jurists, who warns that a blanket prisoner release
would be the first step toward a peace settlement granting broad
amnesty for human rights violators.
	   Others worry the prisoner exchange would feed Colombia's kidnap
rate, already the highest in the world.
	   ``This wouldn't be the end of it. It would be an incentive for
those kinds of actions to be carried out in the future,'' said
Francisco Santos, news editor of the newspaper El Tiempo and
himself a former kidnap victim.

Kansas State's Bill Snyder voted AP Coach of the Year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD ROSENBLATT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Bill Snyder never wavered in his philosophy of
getting a little better every day. In his 10th season at Kansas
State, the Wildcats came close to perfection.
	   But a crushing, double-overtime loss to Texas A and M in the Big
12 title game ended K-State's national championship hopes and
stunned even the soft-spoken Snyder.
	   ``It was like climbing to the top of the mountain,'' Snyder
said, ``and then falling off.''
	   On Monday, Snyder became The Associated Press' first College
Coach of the Year in balloting by AP member newspapers, TV and
radio stations.
	   ``I've been in this business a long time,'' Snyder said, ``and I
accept this award on behalf of the players and assistants and
administrators in this program. It has been an emotional season.''
	   Snyder collected 37 of the 143 votes in the AP balloting, edging
Tennessee's Phillip Fulmer, who had 35 votes. Tommy Bowden, who
coached Tulane to a perfect season before leaving for Clemson, was
third with 29 votes.
	   Arkansas' Houston Nutt was fourth with 14 votes and Wisconsin's
Barry Alvarez fifth with seven votes.
	   Snyder guided the Wildcats to an 11-0 mark and No. 2 ranking in
the AP media poll before the 36-33 loss to the Aggies on Dec. 5.
Afterward, K-State only fell to No. 4 in the poll, but found itself
out of a Bowl Championship Series game _ and a dlrs 12 million
payday _ and in the low-rent Alamo Bowl on Dec. 29 against unranked
Purdue (8-4).
	   Snyder was always confident he could turn around college
football's biggest losers. After going 1-10 in his first season in
1989, the winning began. By 1991, K-State was 7-4 and, by '93 the
record jumped to 9-2-1, including a 52-17 win over Wyoming in the
Copper Bowl _ K-State's first bowl win.
	   Now, Kansas State is among the winningest schools in America
over the last six seasons, with a 59-12-1 record.

RJR Nabisco plans to cut about 3,900 tobacco jobs worldwide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Longer version moved on business wire. &QL; 
 &UR; By SKIP WOLLENBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Smokers already are paying the price of the
mammoth tobacco settlement with the states. Tobacco workers are
next.
	   RJR Nabisco, parent of the second-biggest U.S. tobacco company,
is cutting 3,900 tobacco jobs worldwide, nearly 16 percent of its
cigarette work force. RJR's cigarette brands include Winston and
Camel.
	   The cuts announced Monday include about 1,000 jobs in the United
States, where fewer cigarettes are expected to be sold following
last month's price hike of 45 cents per pack.
	   The increase is a result of the industry's $206 billion
settlement with the states over health claims.
	   The remaining 2,900 job cuts are coming in Russia and the other
former Soviet states, where RJR says economic turmoil is making
smokers reach for cheaper and less profitable brands. That's about
half of the people RJR employed in Russia and the former Soviet
nations.
	   RJR employs 8,800 people in its U.S. tobacco operations and
16,000 overseas.
	   The latest cuts are in addition to 315 domestic tobacco job cuts
announced last month.
	   ``We knew when we agreed to resolve the state tobacco litigation
that the domestic tobacco company would have to make enormous
sacrifices financially and operationally,'' said Steven F.
Goldstone, RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.'s chairman and chief
executive.
	   The U.S. job cuts are expected to occur sometime in 1999, but
Reynolds spokeswoman Jan Sneed wouldn't say where they would be
made.
	   Meanwhile, the snack foods company Nabisco Holdings Corp., which
is 80 percent owned by RJR, announced it will eliminate about 1,500
jobs and close more plants, mostly overseas, in the second phase of
a restructuring aimed at making it more competitive.
	   Nabisco makes Ritz crackers and the Snackwell's low-fat snack
line.
	   In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, RJR shares
were up 56\ cents at $28.87{.

U.N. chief fears worst in Iraq, African, the Balkans, Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Looking ahead to 1999, Secretary-General
Kofi Annan warned Monday that the world has every reason to fear
the worst in Iraq, Africa, the Balkans and Afghanistan unless
efforts to find peaceful solutions are redoubled.
	   Annan warned that unless the underlying distortions and
imbalances in the global economy are tackled ``we must expect more
conflicts and even more intractable ones.''
	   At a year-end news conference, the U.N. chief said the perennial
challenge of achieving international peace is now coupled with the
new challenge of a global financial crisis which has affected
entire nations and the lives of millions of people.
	   While wars and conflicts consume an enormous amount of the
United Nations' time, he said economic and social issues cannot be
ignored because if they are not addressed there will be more wars
and conflicts.
	   Painting a grim picture of crises in Africa, the Balkans,
Afghanistan, ``and above all, Iraq,'' Annan noted that none has
been resolved.
	   ``The best we can say is that in Kosovo, and in Iraq, all-out
war has been avoided for the time being. But unless people abide by
their commitments, and unless they redouble their efforts to find
peaceful solutions, we have every reason to fear the worst in
1999,'' he warned.
	   Stressing that he doesn't believe in ``megaphone diplomacy,''
the secretary-general urged both chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler and Iraqi officials to cool the rhetoric, develop a
working relationship, and get on with their jobs.
	   In Baghdad's case, he said, that means cooperating with the
inspectors to eliminate the country's weapons of mass destruction
and after eight years to finally ``get it done.''
	   The secretary-general said he was reserving judgment on a report
from Butler, expected late Monday or Tuesday, on whether Iraq has
kept its Nov. 14 promise to cooperate fully with U.N. inspectors
and provide unfettered access to sites and documents.
	   But he suggested that Baghdad had fallen short of his
expectations, by blocking an inspection and refusing to hand over
key documents.
	   Annan, who visited Libya earlier this month, said he believes
``we are near a decision'' on whether two Libyans accused of
blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 are
handed over for trial in The Netherlands.
	   ``I think they will move in the right direction,'' he said. ``My
sense is that they have realized that they've come to the end of
the road and that they've been given all the explanations and
assurances necessary.''
	   Annan praised President Clinton's ``courageous decision'' to go
to the Middle East to try to push the peace process forward and
urged leaders in the region to work with him to achieve progress.
	   In Africa, he lamented that not only are there long and
protracted conflicts but new ones breaking out which must be
tackled collectively by African leaders.
	   The Security Council will have to decide whether to send
peacekeeping troops to the Congo if a cease-fire is signed, he
said.
	   ``We have had some difficulties attracting governments to join
peacekeeping operations in certain parts of the world,'' Annan
said, citing the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Somalia from 1992-95
which got bogged down in factional fighting and led to the deaths
of 18 U.S. soldiers.
	   ``I don't think we have fully overcome the Somali syndrome _ and
the Somali syndrome affected Rwanda. It is likely to affect any
operation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. But we should
not give up,'' he said.
	   In Haiti, he expressed disappointment that ``all Haitian leaders
and patriots'' have not pulled together to improve the political
situation.

Burkina Faso leader warns against arms trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The president of Burkina Faso on Monday
warned African leaders against trading in arms, saying it will only
lead to more wars, displacement of people and the destruction of
the continent.
	   Trading in arms ``is not like selling and purchasing of candies
or biscuits,'' President Blaise Compaore told a news conference.
	   Compaore, who is the current chairman of the 52-nation
Organization of African Unity, said Africans should stop looking at
the economic gains of arms trade and consider its consequences.
	   Compaore is in Sudan to attend an OAU-sponsored conference on
refugees. Ministers and officials from 40 African countries
attended the meeting that ended Monday. Details of their
deliberations were not immediately released.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says some 23 million
people have been displaced by war or famine throughout Africa.
	   Some of the displaced are in Sudan, where Christian and animist
rebel forces are fighting the Muslim government for autonomy to the
predominantly Christian areas of southern Sudan.
	   The Washington-based U.S. Committee for Refugees, a humanitarian
group, says at least 1.9 million people have died in southern and
central Sudan in the past 15 years as a direct result of civil war,
war-related famine and disease.
	   A six-nation committee called the Inter-Governmental Authority
on Development has achieved little progress in its prolonged effort
to end the conflict.
	   Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir, addressing the news
conference with the Burkina Faso leader, said he was disappointed
by IGAD's efforts.
	   ``We are presently studying the whole IGAD process so as to
reach a clear decision on whether or not to continue with the
initiative,'' el-Bashir said.
	   IGAD groups Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia and
Djibouti.

Astronauts pack to come home but weather doubtful

<TEXT>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Still aglow over their space station
handiwork, Endeavour's astronauts were in a holiday mood Monday as
they packed for the trip home.
	   ``We are feeling terrific,'' Nancy Currie radioed. ``We are
ready to start packing and coming home to see our families just in
time for Christmas. Can't be more pleased with the way the
mission's gone.''
	   Space shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to land at Kennedy Space
Center late Tuesday, nearly 12 days after blasting off on NASA's
first station-assembly mission.
	   The six astronauts were taking a break after Sunday's release of
the 77-foot international space station, which trailed the shuttle
by more than 250 miles Monday afternoon.
	   Flight controllers in Houston and Moscow monitored the station,
as they will for its expected 15-year lifetime.
	   Power was being provided by the Russian-built control module
Zarya. Communications were being handled by Unity, the
American-made chamber.
	   The astronauts connected Zarya and Unity, which had never before
touched, and wired them together by hand. They also attached
antennas, tools and handrails for future crews.
	   The next construction team is due to arrive in May.

Iranian police report arrests in killings of dissidents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with 10 grafs to UPDATE with judicial official quoted as
saying several suspects in custody, killing of hard-liner also
being probed.
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian authorities have arrested the first
suspects in a string of slayings of dissidents that has terrified
intellectuals opposed to hard-liners in the ruling clergy, state
media reported Monday.
	   Judicial spokesman Nasiri Savadkuhi said several suspects had
been arrested in the five slayings and authorities were ``striving
to arrest all the perpetrators of the recent mysterious killings.''
	   The report, carried on Iranian television, gave no other
details. Judiciary officials were not immediately available for
comment.
	   The official newspaper, Iran, said two other political activists
remain missing: Pirouz Davani, who led a small political group
called the United Left, and Rostami Hamedani, an activist allied
with Davani. It gave no other details.
	   In a speech Monday to a group of clerics, Iran's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, condemned the slayings, saying ``the
killing of citizens, whatever their beliefs may be, is a crime.''
	   Khamenei leans toward hard-line clergymen who have been the
target of criticism of Iranian liberals, including the three
writers and two opposition activists killed in the past month.
	   The conservative clergymen are opposed to moderate President
Mohammad Khatami's attempts at social and political reforms.
	   The television quoted Savadkhui as saying the investigation into
the writers' slayings has been expanded to include the August
shooting of a hard-liner, Assadollah Lajevardi. He was the former
chief of prisons and a former chief prosecutor.
	   The United States strongly condemned the killings of the
dissident writers, calling the crimes an attempt to stifle free
speech.
	   ``We urge the Iranian leadership to protect the lives of all
Iranian citizens, including writers and other voices of dissent,
and to preserve the rule of law,'' State Department spokesman James
Foley said from Washington.
	   Hard-line activists and vigilantes have often resorted to
violence against Khatami's supporters, but nobody has accused the
hard-line camp of being behind the killings.
 &UR; The hard-liners have blamed, pick up 10th graf pvs.

Cocoa prices fall to lowest level for 20 months

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Cocoa prices have fallen to the lowest level in 20
months after selling on the New York and London market late last
week.
	   The International Cocoa Organization's on Monday set the market
indicator price at dlrs 1,514.46 per metric ton _ a low not seen
since April 1997.
	   Traders said the selling of cocoa, a key export for Ghana, the

over demand because of Russia's and Asia's economic problems and by
the prospect of a better season in the key West African producing

A little late in the game for some NFL teams
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When training camps opened, Tampa Bay,
Washington and the New York Giants had great expectations. All
figured to be in the thick of the playoff race, and the Buccaneers
were a dark horse Super Bowl choice.
	   Now, with two games left in the regular season, they're finally
playing as expected. Only it's too late for Washington and probably
New York. Tampa Bay will need help just to make the playoffs.
	   The Giants, who have won three of four to climb to 6-8 after
winning the NFC East at 10-5-1 last season, were the showpiece on
Sunday, handing Denver its first loss of the season after 13 wins
and leaving the 1972 Miami Dolphins the only unbeaten team in
National Football League history.
	   Washington is 5-2 after starting 0-7 and Tampa Bay has won three
straight to get back to .500, 7-7 after beating Pittsburgh 16-3 on
Sunday. Still, if the Bucs win both their remaining games _ at
Washington and Cincinnati _ Arizona has to lose once or Dallas
twice for Tampa Bay to make it to the postseason.
	   Why did it take most of the season for these teams to come on?
	   ``There's a whole locker room full of guys who would love to
know why we can get it done now after starting 0-7,'' said
Washington running back Skip Hicks.
	   In truth, the three are a microcosm of the NFL in the free
agent-salary cap era.
	   It's not hard to get from the pack to playoff level, but it's
easier to slip back into the pack than it is to become a Super Bowl
team. It took six years for Minnesota to get to the level it has
reached this year. It took Randy Moss, bypassed by 19 other teams
(Jacksonville twice) to put the Vikings over the top.
	   The Redskins committed dlrs 56 million to defensive linemen Dana
Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson and forgot about offense.
	   The return from Stubblefield and Wilkinson has been minimal, and
the offense has only come around in the second half of the season.
Trent Green has been OK, if not great, at quarterback. Hicks has
developed into a pretty good runner and, frankly, the schedule
hasn't been overwhelming.
	   The Giants' season probably ended when Jason Sehorn was lost
while returning a punt in an exhibition game.
	   Last year, New York relied on Sehorn, Jessie Armstead and
Michael Strahan, impact players on an impact defense that carried a
very average offense. This year, the offense has been less than
average and Armstead has played on a sprained ankle. And until
Sunday _ when last year's defense surfaced against Denver _ the
Giants have been worn down by the good teams (San Francisco,
Atlanta, Dallas and Green Bay).
	   Tampa's problems are a spotty offense and an unhealthy defense.
	   Trent Dilfer remains inconsistent at quarterback, Warrick Dunn
and Mike Alstott haven't put together a season like last year's,
and too many injuries and illnesses (Hardy Nickerson, in
particular) have hurt the defense.
	   The prognosis? In this league, who knows?
	   The Bucs still need an offense, and the Redskins and Giants seek
a quarterback (despite his heroics in the 20-16 win over Denver,
Kent Graham is better as a backup). The Redskins will get two high
draft picks, Carolina's (for Sean Gilbert and their own), but
they've blown high picks before on Desmond Howard, Heath Shuler
and, to an extent, Michael Westbrook.
	   But given what the Bucs, Giants and Redskins have been through
this season, the declines to watch for next year are from teams
that have jumped precipitously _ like the Falcons. One injury
(Chris Chandler or Jamal Anderson) and they're back in the pack.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Once again, Puerto Ricans voted on
an issue that has become a pastime of sorts: their relationship
with the United States. And once again, they decided: We like
things as they are. Kind of.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello tried to argue Monday that the U.S.
statehood movement won a victory in Sunday's non-binding referendum
_ even though statehood was second to a ``none of the above''
option backed by supporters of the existing commonwealth
arrangement, 50.2 percent to 46.5 percent.
	   ``The only sentiment that has grown since the mid-century has
been statehood,'' he declared at a news conference Monday.
	   Rossello faces a hard sell convincing a skeptical Congress that
the result means Puerto Rico wants to join the Union. But he seems
willing to try.
	   The commonwealth party backed ``none of the above'' because it
disagreed with the ballot's commonwealth definition, which
suggested Congress could revoke the U.S. citizenship of the 3.8
million islanders.
	   Statehood, Rossello tried to argue, won a huge majority among
people who chose one of the definitions.
	   ``Once the new Congress is constituted, that will be the
appropriate time to send the results ... saying to the Congress and
the president, `You respond to these results,''' Rossello said.
``That may include another plebiscite.''
	   Rossello's interpretation was seconded by Indiana Republican
Rep. Dan Burton, who warned in a statement from Washington that
Congress would not continue to bankroll Puerto Rico at a cost of
some dlrs 10 billion annually.
	   ``Given that a mere 0.06 percent ... supported the current
status, and given the enormous economic burden placed on the
overtaxed American people, the Congress should, and more than
likely will, reevaluate the federal subsidy of the current
status,'' he said.
	   Burton anticipated ``a long process'' that ultimately would
offer Puerto Ricans just two choices: independence or statehood.
	   San Juan Mayor Sila Calderon, the key statehood opponent, said
her Popular Democratic Party might agree to yet another referendum
_ but with commonwealth included and the proviso that, if
victorious, commonwealth would endure no further challenges.
	   In a 1993 vote, commonwealth beat statehood by 49 percent to 46
percent.
	   The stark choice of statehood or independence likely would yield
a statehood majority, because Puerto Ricans prize their U.S.
citizenship.
	   But many Puerto Ricans would rather never have to make that
choice.
	   They clearly value the advantages they have under the
commonwealth established in 1952. They are U.S. citizens who can
travel and work and live on the mainland _ but who also have
symbols of sovereignty like their own Olympic team.
	   ``We cherish our U.S. citizenship _ but we are Puerto Ricans,''
said Calderon.
	   The depressing reality for statehooders is that Rossello's
tireless campaigning _ and even the federal government's dlrs 1.5
billion aid package after September's Hurricane Georges _ failed to
persuade even half the people to vote for that option.
	   The statehood campaign may have been undone by what many here
charged was a dishonest effort to persuade voters there was nothing
unusual about a Spanish-speaking U.S. state. Its TV ads said U.S.
statehood actually guaranteed Hispanic culture.
	   Statehooders promised a huge windfall, citing a 1996 report by
the General Accounting Office that shows federal spending would
double to $19.8 billion a year. They also promised millions in
federally-funded job training programs, welfare payments, social
security and child care supplements.
	   Advocates also said a Puerto Rican state could benefit the
United States by offering a cultural and economic bridge to Latin
America.
	   ``The culture of the United States is becoming more Hispanic''
and ``will become richer because of more Spanish influence, not
less,'' Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont said on the eve of the vote.
	   At least one U.S. lawmaker said it was unlikely that Washington
would accept Rossello's logic.
	   ``It is disappointing to see the statehood forces subvert the
will of the people now that the balloting is over and now that the
statehood option has clearly failed,'' said Rep. Luis Gutierrez, an
Illinois Democrat.

Olympian angered over Salt Lake fund
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CARTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Former Olympic track star Henry Marsh
wants a full accounting of the dlrs 500,000 ``humanitarian aid''
fund used to pay for scholarships to at least six relatives of IOC
members.
	   ``If some heads have to roll, then so be it,'' he said Monday.
``This went over the line. And I'll say right now that if it turns
out that I should have known about this, then I'll resign. That is
not what the Olympic movement is about.''
	   Marsh, a four-time Olympian, is a Salt Lake Organizing Committee
trustee.
	   The existence of the scholarship fund and its use to benefit IOC
members has snowballed into the biggest corruption scandal in
Olympic history.
	   On Sunday, SLOC president Frank Joklik apologized to the IOC
executive committee in Lausanne, Switzerland. He regretted the
appearance that the fund was used to bribe IOC members to award the
2002 Winter Games to Salt Lake.
	   Marc Hodler, a senior member of the IOC's executive board, is
using the Salt Lake payoffs as a catalyst to flush alleged
corruption from the IOC. On Monday, Hodler said Salt Lake was a
victim of blackmail by unscrupulous agents and IOC members in its
successful bid for the 2002 Olympics.
	   Hodler said other bids have been tainted as well and the IOC has
opened an investigation. Other bid cities say Hodler's accusations
are groundless.
	   Several officials who sat on both the bid and organizing
committees said they didn't know the fund existed _ despite
Joklik's assurances last week that it was ``common knowledge'' to
those close to the Salt Lake bid.
	   ``This came right out of the blue,'' said Fred Ball, a former
bid committee member and retired executive director of the Salt
Lake Chamber of Commerce. ``I darn near cried when I saw this.''
	   Joklik, chairman of the bid committee at the time, claims he did
not know the specifics of the program, which was being run by
former bid president Tom Welch and vice president Dave Johnson, who
remains in that job.
	   Welch resigned as SLOC president last summer amid a spouse-abuse
scandal. He continues to be paid dlrs 10,000 a month as an SLOC
consultant.
	   The only recipient of the scholarship fund identified so far has
been Sonia Essomba, daughter of late IOC member Rene Essomba, a
surgeon and former head of the National Olympic Committees of
Africa.
	   Joklik has said most of the 13 recipients of the scholarship
fund _ including the six relatives of IOC members _ were from
Africa.
	   Two weeks ago, Welch assured The Associated Press that besides
Essomba, no other IOC relatives were fund recipients. He has not
returned messages left at his Park City condominium since.
	   Nick Badami, former president of the U.S. Ski Association and a
member of the bid committee, said he knew only of a vague plan to
assist Third World athletes.
	   ``This just shocked me,'' he said. ``I think we're all feeling a
little victimized right now.''
	   Badami, Marsh and others plan to press the point at a meeting of
the SLOC executive committee on Friday after Joklik returns from
Lausanne.

Jagge wins night slalom at Sestriere
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Ams. UPDATES with detail, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SESTRIERE, Italy (AP) _ Norway's Finn Christian Jagge edged
Austrian Thomas Stangassinger by six hundredths of a second in a
battle between veteran skiers as he captured the third World Cup
slalom of the season Monday night.
	   The 32-year-old Norwegian, an Olympic slalom champion back in
1992, mastered an icy track, shining under floodlight, in the
combined time of one minute, 51.92 seconds.
	   For Jagge it was the fifth World Cup career victory and a repeat
of his triumph in last year's night slalom at Sestriere.
	   Stangassinger, 33, winner of the previous World Cup slalom at
Aspen, completed the two runs in 1:51.98.
	   Slovenian Jure Kosir placed third for his best slalom showing
since 1996.
	   Kosir finished 0.18 behind the Norwegian winner who had the
fastest first-run time in 53.67 seconds and a more cautious second
run in 58.25.
	   ``I skied extremely well in the flat parts, that's my
speciality,'' said Jagge, who had placed 7th in Aspen. ``I was a
bit nervous starting 30th in the second run and I made a few
mistakes on the top. Yet I managed to fight off Thomas
(Stangassinger).''
	   Stangassinger barely missed the sixth season victory, out of
eight races, for the powerful Austrian men's team but was not
disappointed.
	   ``I did my best on a tricky course. It was a difficult slalom
and Jagge a tough opponent at this track,'' he said.
	   Second place kept Stangassinger atop the slalom standings, with
216 points, a 30-point lead over Jagge.
	   French rising star Pierrick Bourgeat, who had won the season
opener at Park City, edged Norwegian Kjetil Andre Aamodt for fourth
place.
	   Austrian Christian Mayer trailed the winner by 1.64 seconds in
sixth place.
	   Olympic slalom champion Hans-Petter Buraas was one of the
victims of the demanding, hard course as he fell midway through the
second run as well as his more experienced teammate Ole Christian
Furuseth.
	   The Giovanni Agnelli track, named after the young heir of the
Agnelli family who died last year, was the same which hosted the
slalom race of the 1997 World Championships, when Norwegian Tom
Stiansen beat Sebastien Amiez and Alberto Tomba for gold.
	   Stiansen placed ninth in Monday's night slalom, behind teammate
Lasse Kjus.
	   Tomba, a three-time Olympic champion who announced his
retirement last October, was the big absentee at his favorite
course where he won the first of his 50 World Cup career wins.
	   Tomba retirement left Italian fans and the national slalom team
astray.
	   However Italian supporters still had something to cheer as young
Giorgio Rocca rallied ten places from the first run to finish
seventh - his best career showing.
	   Austrian World Cup leader Stephan Eberharter and other
specialists of speed races did not compete in Sestriere, to spare
form and determination for the back-to-back downhill races
scheduled in Val Gardena, northern Italy, Friday and Saturday.
	   Eberharter, who was off to a better season start than defending
overall, super-G and giant slalom champion Hermann Maier, commands
the overall standings with 368 points after eight races.
	   Mayer, who pocketed 40 points Monday, strenghened his second
place to 342.
	   Kjus was third at 313 with the muscular Maier fourth at 280 from
two wins and a second place.

Hodler appears to back off Sydney claims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Adds details on Melbourne bid payments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Senior International Olympic Committee
member Marc Hodler appears to have backed off claims that Sydney
illegally bought votes to win its bid to host the 2000 Olympics.
	   Hodler sent the IOC into its biggest scandal since Canadian
sprinter Ben Johnson tested positive for steroids 10 years ago when
he claimed on Saturday
	   that four agents _ including one IOC member _ had been involved
in vote-buying for the past 12 to 15 years for bidding cities.
	   Australian IOC member Phil Coles said Hodler had later
acknowledged he had been ``way off target'' in alleging that Sydney
had paid for votes.
	   Hodler, an 80-year-old Swiss lawyer, said Monday that agents
claimed that
	   votes had been bought on behalf of bidding cities.
	   ``We believe that the agents are the real villains, the crooks,
the corrupters, not the cities,'' he told Australian Broadcasting
Corp. radio.
	   ``I know that Sydney claims to have been resisting the offers or
the blackmails from the agencies, I don't know, I never said this
was not true ... but the agents claim they have corrupted all
cities.
	   ``I don't know anything about Sydney, I only know that Sydney
very firmly
	   says they never did anything against the existing rules.''
	   This contradicted the position he took on Saturday, when he
said: ``I can't imagine that Sydney is different from the others.
Sydney pretends it is
	   completely clean, clean, clean.''
	   Coles said that Hodler had backed down on his earlier
suggestions that the Sydney bid committee had been involved in
bribery.
	   ``He said he never said Sydney was involved, he just wondered
how they escaped the temptations,'' said Coles.
	   ``That was the nearest to an apology we are going to get.''
	   ``There probably is a need for a change. It has been changed
over the years and it's pretty strictly controlled at the moment.''
	   ``I don't know how you stop it. It's a huge prize for the city
that won and when there is a lot at stake there is a lot of savage
disappointment.''
	   On Tuesday, The Australian newspaper reported that cash payments
of between 5,000 to 10,000 Australian dollars were made to
International Olympic Committee members during the failed Melbourne
1996 Olympic bid process.
	   The newspaper quoted senior members of the Melbourne bid
committee admitting to the payments but denying they were given in
exchange for votes.
	   The Australian said one committee member, who refused to be
named, said he was present when the cash payments were being
organized for IOC members.
	   However, he said he did not see money exchanged and doubted it
would have
	   been to buy votes.
	   The Australian said about three of the 70 IOC members who
visited Melbourne dropped strong hints they would like to be given
a car.
	   ``It was said in jest,'' a senior official was quoted as saying.
``But you could tell they were hoping you'd think it was a
request.''
	   The bid committee members said they had never been explicitly
asked for money to buy IOC votes, The Australian reported.
	   Meanwhile, the Sydney Morning Herald said Sydney bid officials
channelled several million dollars of ``leftover'' money to the
Australian Olympic Committee to sway crucial wavering African votes
and win the 2000 Games.
	   The Herald reported the AOC set up a trust fund with the money
to administer an African Olympic Training Center at Canberra's
Australian Institute of Sport.
	   It was a political move credited with ensuring Sydney's bid
success.
	   AOC president John Coates defended the action, with the Herald
quoting him as saying: ``It is very hard when you are looking for
votes and you are visiting these countries and you know how wealthy
our countries are not to offer some help.''
	   Sallyanne Atkinson, who was heavily involved in Brisbane's bid
to host the 1992 Games, Melbourne's campaign for 1996 and Sydney's
successful bid for 2000, said she was aware of lavish gifts being
given as part of the process to decide the host cities.
	   Atkinson said gifts including offers of holidays, entertainment
and ``sometimes material things'' were part of the way the system
operated and the ``wining and dining'' was often lavish.
	   But she claimed she never saw money change hands in an underhand
fashion. (djp)

Clinton's visit to Gaza stirs tears, jokes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-Mideast &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ ``Would you forget your daughter?''
11-year-old Nihad Zakout asked U.S. President Bill Clinton,
pleading with him to pressure Israel to release her father,
imprisoned for killing an Israeli.
	   ``No, not for one second,'' Clinton told the sobbing girl.
``Your father will be very proud of you,'' he added, prompting
tears to well in the eyes of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   Four daughters of Palestinians who are imprisoned in Israel
handed Clinton a letter pleading for the release of some 2,000
Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to release killers
or members of militant Islamic groups under the recent peace
accords brokered by Clinton. The Palestinians say all prisoners
should be eligible for release.
	    &UR; ___
	   Two huge flags, one American and one Palestinian, hung side by
side from the control tower of Gaza International Airport, covering
its entire length. ``Welcome to Palestine, Mr. Clinton,'' read a
banner strung alongside the airport access road.
	   For the Palestinians, the first visit by a sitting president to
Palestinian-controlled areas was an American seal on their claims
to statehood.
	   Clinton's Marine One helicopter touched down at Gaza
International Airport and dozens of Palestinian dignitaries jumped
to their feet, flashed victory signs and clapped rhythmically.
	   Clinton cut a crimson ribbon to inaugurate the passenger
terminal, an Oriental-style building with graceful arches and
Moroccan tiles.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, savoring the moment, made a
surprised Clinton cut several slices off the ribbon, then handed
pieces to the president and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, as
mementos.
	   A rumored Clinton motorcade never materialized, but
English-language banners along the way were clearly aimed at the
honored guest.
	   ``Settlements kill peace,'' one said.
	   The sentiments were different at the entrance of Kefar Darom, a
Jewish settlement. Next to a giant Hanukkah menorah, a banner
declared: ``We are here forever'' _ also in English.
	    &UR; ___
	   When Arafat greeted the Clintons one by one at the beginning of
a Palestine National Council meeting, Mrs. Clinton got the longest
standing ovation.
	   She has been news in the Mideast since May, when she endorsed
the establishment of a Palestinian state.
	   PNC delegate Ghassan Matar said that endorsement won the hearts
and minds of Palestinians.
	   He said of Monday's vote by the council, ``We did it for the
American president and the American people and the first lady.''

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke tried
Monday to defuse the latest crisis between NATO members Greece and
Turkey over the planned deployment of Russian missiles to Cyprus.
	   But Holbrooke seems to have made little progress in preventing
the deployment after talking with Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsochadzopoulos. Leaving the hourlong talks along with his
assistant Thomas Miller, the annoyed-looking American envoy refused
to utter a word.
	   He had arrived a few hours earlier from Istanbul, Turkey, where
he met with business leaders from the war-divided island.
	   Greek Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides on Sunday insisted the
planned deployment of the Russian S-300 missiles later this month
will go ahead as scheduled.
	   Turkey has said it will use force to stop them, which would
probably lead to a war with Greece. Athens has a defense accord
with Cyprus and has nearly fought two wars with NATO ally Turkey in
the past 11 years over territorial disputes over the Aegean Sea.
	   The eastern Mediterranean island has been separated since 1974,
when Turkish troops invaded its northern third after an abortive
Athens-backed coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in a northern breakaway state
recognized only by Ankara.
	   Tsochadzopoulos indicated he and the Americans didn't see
eye-to-eye on the missiles. The United States strongly opposes
Cyprus' plans to install the anti-aircraft weapons.
	   ``It was a communication where both sides heard views that
mutually express the prospects that each side sees as realistic for
the outcome'' of the problem, he said.
	   Reports said the initial delivery schedule had the missiles
leaving Russia on Tuesday. But there was no independent
confirmation that the repeatedly delayed delivery was imminent.
Such a development would significantly shorten the time available
to Holbrooke.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A tenuous standoff between Serbian
forces and separatist rebels in Kosovo exploded in violence Monday
in the worst clash since an October truce _ a five-hour gunbattle
in which border guards killed dozens of guerrillas.
	   The pre-dawn clash along Kosovo's southwestern border with
Albania resulted in Yugoslav army troops killing at least 30 ethnic
Albanians and wounding 12 who were trying to enter the country
illegally, the Serb-run Media Center reported.
	   Sources at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which sent a team to the site, said at least 31 ethnic
Albanians had been killed, including one woman. Nine others were
taken prisoner, two of them wounded, the sources said on condition
their names not be used.

	   In another possible indication of rising ethnic tension, the
OSCE sources said gunmen opened fire Monday in a Serb-run bar in
the western Kosovo city of Pec, killing four Serbs and wounding
five others.
	   It was unclear, however, whether the attack was ethnically
motivated because the gunmen escaped.
	   Hours after the pre-dawn battle, ethnic Albanian sources said
heavy detonations and shootings were heard from the area of three
nearby villages about 70 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of
Pristina that had been sealed off by Serb police.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence have frequently armed themselves in neighboring
Albania.
	   The worst reported violence in Kosovo in more than two months
casts further gloom on the diplomatic efforts to bring a lasting
peace to the Serbian province, where many believe a resumption of
full-scale fighting by spring is inevitable.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since an Oct. 12
peace agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke halted
months of fighting in the separatist province in southern Serbia.
	   Holbrooke is expected in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade for
talks Tuesday with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. In
Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley said Holbrooke
would ``drive home'' to Milosevic ``the need for progress on the
negotiating front.''
	   After two months of failed shuttle diplomacy, chances of
mediating an end to the continuing violence in Kosovo seem
unlikely.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule, while the rebels say they won't
accept anything short of independence. Serbia, meanwhile, refuses
to consider anything more than partial autonomy for the
Albanian-majority province.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who met with ethnic Albanian
negotiators in Pristina on Monday and who also plans to be in
Belgrade on Tuesday, has seen his proposals for a political
settlement rejected by both sides.
	   The report by the Media Center, which has generally proved
reliable, said armed ethnic Albanians were trying to enter Kosovo
from Albania when the shootout erupted at 2 a.m. (0100 gmt) Monday
near Gorozup and Liken, southwest of Pristina.
	   Yugoslav soldiers confiscated arms and other material that the
Albanians were trying to smuggle in, the Media Center report said.
	   Municipal authorities in nearby Prizren were quoted as saying
that all those killed and wounded were wearing camouflage uniforms
with the insignia of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. Eight
Albanians were killed in a border clash near the same area on Dec.
3.
	   The OSCE, which is assembling a force of 2,000 unarmed peace
verifiers under the terms of the agreement, has previously
condemned the violence and blamed both sides.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
were left homeless after Milosevic launched a crackdown against
separatist rebels in February.
	   Meanwhile, a delegation of Kosovo's Serbs arrived in Pristina to
plead with international peace monitors to find loved ones who
disappeared five months ago.
	   About 50 Serbs met with Gabriel Keller, deputy head of the
2,000-strong OSCE peace mission.
	   Keller received a list of the missing people whom the Serbs
believe were kidnapped by KLA rebels, and promised the OSCE would
``try its best to find traces of the missing.''
	   In another development, the second-ranking diplomat at the
French embassy in Belgrade and two other embassy employees were
killed Monday in a car accident in Kosovo.
	   French officials said Gerard Fauveau, the embassy's first
counselor, fellow diplomat Richard Berthaux and embassy security
guard Jean-Pierre Latour were killed when their car collided with a
passenger bus in Besinje, just north of Pristina.

Leeds beats Coventry to go third

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ Returning David Batty was shown the yellow
card after only five minutes but Leeds United moved up to third in
the Premier League Monday after a 2-0 victory over Coventry City.
	   David Hopkin scored the first five minutes before half time and
Lee Bowyer added the second in second half injury time.
	   The goals came after Coventry's Steve Froggatt and Noel Whelan
hit the posts in the same move midway through the first half. But
the Sky Blues, struggling near the foot of the standings, rarely
threatened after that.
	   Tough-tackling England midfielder Batty, rehired by Leeds' coach
David O'Leary after he had been sold to Blackburn and then
Newcastle, was making his first appearance since returning.
	   But he was shown the yellow card barely five minutes into the
game at Elland Road for sliding menacingly into Coventry's Ghanaian
midfielder, George Boateng.

	   In another possible indication of rising ethnic tension, the
OSCE sources said gunmen opened fire Monday in a Serb-run bar in
the western Kosovo city of Pec, killing four Serbs and wounding
five others.
	   It was unclear, however, whether the attack was ethnically
motivated. The gunmen escaped.
	   Hours after the pre-dawn battle, ethnic Albanian sources said
heavy detonations and shootings were heard from the area of three
nearby villages about 70 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of
Pristina that had been sealed off by Serb police.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence have frequently armed themselves in neighboring
Albania.
	   The worst reported violence in Kosovo in more than two months
casts further gloom on the diplomatic efforts to bring a lasting
peace to the Serbian province, where many believe a resumption of
full-scale fighting by spring is inevitable.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since an Oct. 12
peace agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke halted
months of fighting in the separatist province in southern Serbia.
	   Holbrooke is expected in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade for
talks Tuesday with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. In
Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley said Holbrooke
would ``drive home'' to Milosevic ``the need for progress on the
negotiating front.''
	   After two months of failed shuttle diplomacy, chances of
mediating an end to the continuing violence in Kosovo seem
unlikely.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule, while the rebels say they won't
accept anything short of independence. Serbia, meanwhile, refuses
to consider anything more than partial autonomy for the
Albanian-majority province.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who met with ethnic Albanian
negotiators in Pristina on Monday and who also plans to be in
Belgrade on Tuesday, has seen his proposals for a political
settlement rejected by both sides.
	   The report by the Media Center, which has generally proved
reliable, said armed ethnic Albanians were trying to enter Kosovo
from Albania when the shootout erupted at 2 a.m. Monday near
Gorozup and Liken, southwest of Pristina.
	   Yugoslav soldiers confiscated arms and other material that the
Albanians were trying to smuggle in, the Media Center report said.
	   Municipal authorities in nearby Prizren were quoted as saying
that all those killed and wounded were wearing camouflage uniforms
with the insignia of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. Eight
Albanians were killed in a border clash near the same area on Dec.
3.
	   The OSCE, which is assembling a force of 2,000 unarmed peace
verifiers under the terms of the agreement, has previously
condemned the violence and blamed both sides.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
were left homeless after Milosevic launched a crackdown against
separatist rebels in February.
	   In another development, the second-ranking diplomat at the
French embassy in Belgrade and two other embassy employees were
killed Monday in a car accident in Kosovo.
	   French officials said Gerard Fauveau, the embassy's first
counselor, fellow diplomat Richard Berthaux and embassy security
guard Jean-Pierre Latour were killed when their car collided with a
passenger bus in Besinje, just north of Pristina.

Clemens throws a big curve at winter meetings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ This chase for Roger Clemens is
becoming more curious by the minute.
	   Houston's general manager says the Astros are out of it, but
their owner might put them back in.
	   Texas is trying to close the deal for the five-time Cy Young
winner. Baltimore and Colorado are still in the bidding. The New
York Yankees are just watching and waiting.
	   On Monday, there was action in other areas.
	   The New York Mets traded outfielder Butch Huskey to the Seattle
Mariners for minor league pitcher Lesli Brea. Also, Heisman Trophy
winner Ricky Williams was picked by the Montreal Expos off
Philadelphia's roster in the Rule 5 draft. The Expos, however, are
expected to trade the Texas running back to the Texas Rangers.
	   The Minnesota Twins traded outfielder Alex Ochoa to Milwaukee
for a player to be named while St. Louis sent pitcher Mark
Petkovsek to Anaheim for a player to be named or cash.
	   The Toronto Blue Jays made the first trade of the winter
meetings Sunday when they swapped one of their starters _ but it
wasn't Clemens.
	   Toronto sent Woody Williams, reliever Carlos Almanzar and
outfield prospect Peter Tucci to the San Diego Padres for pitcher
Joey Hamilton.
	   In another move, the Mets caught up with the leadoff man they
wanted, signing free agent Rickey Henderson to a one-year deal
worth dlrs 2.3 million.
	   In Sunday's strangest twist, Astros GM Gerry Hunsicker called a
news conference to express his disgust with the Clemens'
negotiations. Hunsicker had harsh words for Randy and Alan
Hendricks, Clemens' agents and brokers for a potential deal.
	   ``Quite frankly, we are stunned and outraged at the demands of
the agents,'' Hunsicker said. ``The talent we would have to
potentially give up would leave us with a team that Roger Clemens
would not want to play for.''
	   Randy Hendricks called Astros owner Drayton McLane on Saturday
and proposed that if Houston wanted to acquire Clemens, it extend
his contract for one year at dlrs 27.4 million, which would leave
him with what amounts to a new dlrs 43.5 million, three-year
contract.
	   Another big topic continued to be the dlrs 105 million deal Los
Angeles gave Kevin Brown a day earlier and the increasing split
between teams from big and small markets.
	   ``People say it's monopoly money. That's wrong. When we were
kids we never had that much monopoly money,'' new Florida manager
John Boles said.
	   ``Parity is not the American way,'' countered Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson. ``The American way is to dominate somebody else.''
	   In all, more than dlrs 1 billion has been spent on this year's
free-agent class. Six of the richest clubs _ Anaheim, Arizona,
Baltimore, Los Angeles, the Yankees and Mets _ have shelled out
dlrs 718 million for only 26 players.
	   The Mets, one of the majors' busiest teams in the offseason,
gave Henderson a one-year deal that includes an option year.
	   Henderson, 40 on Christmas Day, led the majors with 66 steals
last season for Oakland and is baseball's career leader in stolen
bases. The Mets, meanwhile, were last in the majors with 62 steals.
	   Henderson ranks sixth on the runs list with 2,014, with Ty Cobb
leading at 2,245. He is much closer to the walks record with a
total of 1,890, trailing leader Babe Ruth (2,056).

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A tenuous standoff between Serbian
forces and separatist rebels in Kosovo exploded in violence Monday
in the worst clash since an October truce _ a five-hour gunbattle
in which border guards killed dozens of guerrillas.
	   The pre-dawn clash along Kosovo's southwestern border with
Albania resulted in Yugoslav army troops killing 30 ethnic
Albanians and wounding 12 who were trying to enter the country
illegally, the Serb-run Media Center reported.
	   Sources at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which sent a team to the site, said 31 ethnic Albanians had
been killed, including one woman. Nine others were taken prisoner,
two of whom were wounded, the sources said on condition their names
not be used.
	   In other violence, the OSCE sources said assailants opened fire
Monday in a Serb-run bar in the western Kosovo city of Pec, killing
four Serbs and wounding five others. It was unclear whether the
attack was ethnically motivated, however, because the gunmen
escaped.
	   Hours after the pre-dawn battle, ethnic Albanian sources said
heavy detonations and shootings were heard from the area of three
nearby villages about 45 miles southwest of Pristina that had been
sealed off by Serb police.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence have frequently armed themselves in neighboring
Albania.
	   The worst reported violence in Kosovo in more than two months

3.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
were left homeless after Milosevic launched a crackdown against
separatist rebels in February.
	   Meanwhile, a delegation of Kosovo's Serbs arrived in Pristina to
plead with international peace monitors to find loved ones who
disappeared five months ago.
	   About 50 Serbs met with Gabriel Keller, deputy head of the
2,000-strong OSCE peace mission.
	   Keller received a list of the missing people whom the Serbs
believe were kidnapped by KLA rebels, and promised the OSCE would
``try its best to find traces of the missing.''
	   In another development, the second-ranking diplomat at the
French embassy in Belgrade and two other embassy employees were
killed Monday in a car accident in Kosovo.
	   French officials said Gerard Fauveau, the embassy's first
counselor, fellow diplomat Richard Berthaux and embassy security

Atlanta organizers: We didn't buy games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DICK PETTYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Despite assertions that Atlanta's bid for the
1996 Olympics was tainted, state and Olympic officials insist they
did not buy the votes of IOC members.
	   ``No one ever approached me for payments or offering votes,''
Charlie Battle, who was senior vice president of international
relations for the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, said
Monday.
	   ``No one at ACOG, to my knowledge, was approached. It never came
up at any meetings I attended. There was never any mentioned of
such demands.''
	   The charges of payoffs were raised during the weekend by Swiss
Olympic executive Marc Hodler, who cited irregularities in the
selections of Atlanta; Nagano, Japan; Sydney, Australia; and Salt
Lake City.
	   Hodler, a senior IOC executive board member, said some IOC
members seek to profit from their power to decide where the games
will be held.
	   The IOC has begun investigating a scholarship fund instituted by
organizers of the 2002 Salt Lake City Games. The fund provided
nearly dlrs 400,000 in aid to 13 people, including six relatives of
IOC members.
	   Hodler has described that as a ``bribe,'' and when asked whether
Atlanta's victory in the vote for the games was clean, he replied,
``Certainly not.''
	   Billy Payne, ACOG president and chief executive officer, said no
scholarships _ ``direct or otherwise'' _ were offered to IOC
relatives.
	   In the 1996 book ``The New Lords of the Rings,'' British
journalist Andrew Jennings accused ACOG of paying tuition for the
stepson of a Russian Olympic official.
	   Payne acknowledged helping Andrey Petelin, the stepson of
then-IOC executive committee member Vitaly Smirnov, enroll at the
University of Georgia.
	   ``We said, `Call this person and call that person.' We gave him
a name at a Ramada Inn, where he got a job cleaning toilets,''
Payne said.
	   Petelin was enrolled at the university from 1992 through 1994,
but he received no scholarship money from the school or the
University of Georgia Foundation, said Tom Landrum, chief of staff
to university president Michael Adams.
	   Landrum said school officials did not know the Russian student
was related to an Olympic official until they saw news reports of
the bribery allegations.
	   Stephen Portch, the university system chancellor, said he placed
calls to the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech and Georgia State
on Monday to ask about any scholarships for relatives of Olympic
officials.
	   ``I have found nothing to indicate anyone in the universities or
in the related organizations of universities were in any way
involved in scholarships related to the Olympic bid.''
	   Outgoing Gov. Zell Miller said the charges ``hit me right out of
the blue. I've never heard of anything like this. If it is true, it
should be remedied. If it isn't true, that cloud should be removed
from everybody that's been involved in the Olympics over the last
several years.''

Frazier is after Roy Jones
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ For Roy Jones Jr.'s next fight, they've called a
cop.
	   He's Rick Frazier, a 39-year-old New York City policeman, who
will challenge Jones for the WBC-WBA light heavyweight titles Jan.
9 at the champion's hometown of Pensacola, Florida.
	   Frazier said Monday he won't be bothered by fighting before a
hostile crowd or being a decided underdog.
	   ``Look, I'm a cop _ the most hated profession in the world,''
said Frazier, a 17-year veteran of the force, stationed in Harlem,
where he was born.
	   ``I know the writers and other people don't have much hope for
me, but I have hope in myself,'' he said.
	   Frazier, ranked No. 1 by the WBC and No. 2 by the WBA, has only
an 18-3-1 record, with seven knockouts, in seven years as a pro.
Most of his fights were scheduled for less than 10 rounds. His
title bid will be at 12 rounds.
	   The Jones-Frazier fight will be the second half of an HBO
doubleheader. Shane Mosley (30-0, 28 knockouts), who did not attend
Monday's news conference, will defend the IBF lightweight
championship in the first bout.
	   Mosley was to have defended against Justin Rowsell of Australia,
who was 27-0-1 until this past weekend. Then he got knocked out in
the sixth round by Lovemore Ndou of South Africa in Australia. A
new challenger to Mosley is expected to be announced this week.
	   What will be a WBC mandatory defense for Jones (38-1, 32
knockouts) will be the first match of what could be his busiest
year since he fought four times in 1993.
	   ``I'd like to see him fight five times, and I think you will see
him fight four times,'' said Seth Abraham, president of Time Warner

	   Jones, who will be 30 Jan. 16, admitted he did lose interest in
boxing for a time, but ``I think I'm really starting to enjoy
myself in the ring again.''
	   Jones last fought Nov. 14 when he stopped Otis Grant in the 10th
round. The 56 days is the shortest period he's had between fights
since he fought twice within 49 days in 1996.

Report: Angolan rebels gained from lax policing of diamond
</HEADLINE>
sanctions &QL; 
 &UR; With Angola-Fighting &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Several countries and companies have
failed to comply with U.N. sanctions against Angolan rebels,
allowing UNITA to use diamond sales to finance a renewed civil war,
according to a report being released Tuesday.
	   The report, by Global Witness, a London-based human rights
organization, also faulted the United Nations for failing to ensure
that U.N. members bought only Angolan diamonds with a certificate
of origin issued by the Angolan government.
	   ``The failure of the U.N. member states and the diamond industry
to fully implement the embargo has meant that UNITA has been able
to restock munitions and supplies, and this has fatally undermined
the peace process,'' the report said.
	   The U.N. Security Council approved the diamond ban in July in an
effort to cut the rebels' main source of revenue and pressure the
group into complying with a 1994 peace accord. UNITA's foreign bank
accounts were also frozen and members were banned from traveling
abroad.
	   UNITA earned an estimated dlrs 3.7 billion between 1992 and
1998, according to the report.
	   Belgium, a major world diamond center, had been particularly lax
in implementing the U.N. embargo, the report said.
	   Diamond giant De Beers was also called on to clarify how it
identifies the origin of diamonds handled by its Central Selling
Organization.
	   A De Beers spokesman denied the company had broken the ban on
trading in non-official Angolan diamonds.
	   ``De Beers, since the U.N. mandate is in place, has not bought
diamonds exported from Angola without a government certificate of
origin,'' Andrew Lamont said by phone from London.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a two-decade civil war
against the government following the country's 1975 independence
from Portugal.
	   Several attempts at establishing a lasting peace between the two
sides had already failed before the 1994 U.N.-brokered pact
apparently collapsed Dec. 4, following a government offensive
against UNITA's central highland strongholds.

Burkina Faso leader warns against arms trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The president of Burkina Faso on Monday
warned African leaders against trading in arms, saying it will only
lead to more wars, displacement of people and the destruction of
the continent.
	   Trading in arms ``is not like selling and purchasing of candies
or biscuits,'' President Blaise Compaore told a news conference.
	   Compaore, who is the current chairman of the 52-nation
Organization of African Unity, said Africans should stop looking at
the economic gains of arms trade and consider its consequences.
	   Compaore is in Sudan to attend an OAU-sponsored conference on
refugees. Ministers and officials from 40 African countries
attended the meeting that ended Monday. Details of their
deliberations were not released.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says some 23 million
people have been displaced by war or famine throughout Africa.
	   The U.S. Committee for Refugees, a humanitarian group, says at
least 1.9 million people have died in southern and central Sudan in
the past 15 years as a direct result of civil war, war-related
famine and disease.
	   Christian and animist rebel forces are fighting the Muslim
government for autonomy to the predominantly Christian areas of
southern Sudan.
	   A six-nation committee called the Inter-Governmental Authority
on Development has achieved little progress in its prolonged effort
to end the conflict.
	   Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir, addressing the news
conference with the Burkina Faso leader, said he was disappointed
by IGAD's efforts.
	   ``We are presently studying the whole IGAD process so as to
reach a clear decision on whether or not to continue with the
initiative,'' el-Bashir said.
	   IGAD comprises Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia
and Djibouti.

Puerto Rican voters rebuff statehood, affirm identity

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Once again, Puerto Ricans voted on
an issue that has become a pastime of sorts: their relationship
with the United States. And once again, they decided: We like
things as they are. Kind of.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello tried to argue Monday that the U.S.
statehood movement won a victory in Sunday's non-binding referendum
_ even though statehood was second to a ``none of the above''
option backed by supporters of the existing commonwealth
arrangement, 50.2 percent to 46.5 percent.
	   ``The only sentiment that has grown since the mid-century has
been statehood,'' he declared at a news conference Monday.
	   Rossello faces a hard sell convincing a skeptical Congress that
the result means Puerto Rico wants to join the Union. But he seems
willing to try.
	   The commonwealth party backed ``none of the above'' because it
disagreed with the ballot's commonwealth definition, which
suggested Congress could revoke the U.S. citizenship of the 3.8
million islanders.
	   Statehood, Rossello tried to argue, won a huge majority among
people who chose one of the definitions.
	   ``Once the new Congress is constituted, that will be the
appropriate time to send the results ... saying to the Congress and
the president, `You respond to these results,''' Rossello said.
``That may include another plebiscite.''
	   Rossello appeared to receive support Monday from President
Clinton, who noted in a statement that ``a majority of the vote was
not for any of the options.''
	   ``Among the rest, the overwhelming majority supported statehood
... I remain committed to implementing a majority choice for Puerto
Rico's future status,'' Clinton said. He pledged to work with
Congress and Puerto Ricans ``to clarify the choice.''
	   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., warned in a statement from Washington
that Congress would not continue to bankroll Puerto Rico at a cost
of some $10 billion annually.
 &UR; ``Given that a, pick up 9th graf pvs.

U.S. diplomat warns Milosevic to cooperate with tribunal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A U.S. envoy warned Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday to cooperate with the
Yugoslav war crimes tribunal ``or pay the price.''
	   Yugoslav authorities have repeatedly obstructed the U.N. court's
work by refusing to hand over three army officers indicted for
allegedly ordering a 1991 massacre and also barring investigators
from probing war crimes claims in Kosovo.
	   Harold Koh, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for human
rights and labor, is scheduled to meet Milosevic in Belgrade on
Thursday.
	   ``It is clear that Milosevic is the problem,'' Koh said in The
Hague after meeting with tribunal officials. ``He is not just part
of the problem, he is the problem, and until steps are taken to
address these issues, there will continue to be instability in the
region.''
	   Koh said the U.S. government's message for Milosevic was clear:
``If you do not (cooperate), there will be a price to pay.''
	   He said measures to enforce cooperation could include
strengthening sanctions against Yugoslavia and reporting the matter
to the U.N. Security Council.
	   Koh's visit to the Yugoslav capital coincides with hearings by a
Belgrade military court into the massacre of 260 non-Serbs driven
out of a hospital in the eastern Croatian city of Vukovar in
November 1991.
	   Three Serb officers _ Veselin Sljivancanin, Miroslav Radic and
Milan Mrksic _ have been charged by the tribunal with ordering the
massacre. Belgrade officials refuse to extradite them to The Hague
to stand trial.
	   The Belgrade military judge investigating the killings plans to
call the three officers as witnesses _ not defendants _ in his
investigation. He rejected tribunal charges against the men as
unfounded.
	   Officials at the U.N. tribunal see the Belgrade hearings as a
sham, designed to shield the indicted suspects from trial in The
Hague. U.N. judges have ordered Belgrade to stop investigating the
case and turn over any evidence it has gathered to the tribunal.

Kosovo border clash leaves dozens of ethnic Albanians dead

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A tenuous standoff between Serbian
forces and separatist rebels in Kosovo exploded in violence Monday
in the worst clash since an October truce _ a five-hour gunbattle
in which border guards killed dozens of guerrillas.
	   The pre-dawn clash along Kosovo's southwestern border with
Albania resulted in Yugoslav army troops killing 30 ethnic
Albanians and wounding 12 who were trying to enter the country
illegally, the Serb-run Media Center reported.
	   Sources at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which sent a team to the site, said 31 ethnic Albanians had
been killed, including one woman. Nine others were taken prisoner,
two of whom were wounded, the sources said on condition their names
not be used.
	   In other violence, the OSCE sources said assailants opened fire
Monday in a Serb-run bar in the western Kosovo city of Pec, killing
four Serbs and wounding five others. It was unclear whether the
attack was ethnically motivated, however, because the gunmen
escaped.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said two ``masked
terrorists'' entered the bar about 8 p.m. (1900 gmt) and ``sprayed
the bar'' with automatic weapons fire.
	   Hours after the pre-dawn battle, ethnic Albanian sources said
heavy detonations and shootings were heard from the area of three
nearby villages about 70 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of
Pristina that had been sealed off by Serb police.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence have frequently armed themselves in neighboring
Albania.
	   The worst reported violence in Kosovo in more than two months
casts further gloom on the diplomatic efforts to bring a lasting
peace to the Serbian province, where many believe a resumption of
full-scale fighting by spring is inevitable.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since an Oct. 12
peace agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke halted
months of fighting in the separatist province in southern Serbia.
	   Holbrooke is expected in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade for
talks Tuesday with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. In
Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley said Holbrooke
would ``drive home'' to Milosevic ``the need for progress on the
negotiating front.''
	   After two months of failed shuttle diplomacy, chances of
mediating an end to the continuing violence in Kosovo seem
unlikely.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule, while the rebels say they won't
accept anything short of independence. Serbia, meanwhile, refuses
to consider anything more than partial autonomy for the
Albanian-majority province.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who met with ethnic Albanian
negotiators in Pristina on Monday and who also plans to be in
Belgrade on Tuesday, has seen his proposals for a political
settlement rejected by both sides.
	   The report by the Media Center, which has generally proved
reliable, said armed ethnic Albanians were trying to enter Kosovo
from Albania when the shootout erupted at 2 a.m. Monday near
Gorozup and Liken, southwest of Pristina.
	   Yugoslav soldiers confiscated arms and other material that the
Albanians were trying to smuggle in, the Media Center report said.
	   Municipal authorities in nearby Prizren were quoted as saying
that all those killed and wounded were wearing camouflage uniforms
with the insignia of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. Eight
Albanians were killed in a border clash near the same area on Dec.
3.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
were left homeless after Milosevic launched a crackdown against
separatist rebels in February.
	   Meanwhile, a delegation of Kosovo's Serbs arrived in Pristina to
plead with international peace monitors to find loved ones who
disappeared five months ago.
	   About 50 Serbs met with Gabriel Keller, deputy head of the
2,000-strong OSCE peace mission.
	   Keller received a list of the missing people whom the Serbs
believe were kidnapped by KLA rebels, and promised the OSCE would
``try its best to find traces of the missing.''
	   In another development, the second-ranking diplomat at the
French embassy in Belgrade and two other embassy employees were
killed Monday in a car accident in Kosovo.
	   French officials said Gerard Fauveau, the embassy's first
counselor, fellow diplomat Richard Berthaux and embassy security
guard Jean-Pierre Latour were killed when their car collided with a
passenger bus in Besinje, just north of Pristina.

Rebel offer to swap prisoners creates dilemma for government

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ The announcement Monday that peace talks
with leftist rebels will begin next month pushes President Andres
Pastrana closer to deciding an agonizing dilemma: whether to swap
hundreds of jailed guerrillas for captured soldiers and police.
	   A proposal by leftist insurgents to trade nearly 300 security
force members for 452 rebels held by the government figured
prominently in talks Monday in the southern jungles between
presidential peace envoy Victor G. Ricardo and the commander of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.
	   After the four-hour meeting, Ricardo announced that Pastrana and
the FARC commander, Manuel Marulanda, would meet Jan. 7 in San
Vicente de Caguan, a southern town in rebel-dominated territory.
	   Without offering details, the presidential envoy said the two
sides had overcome a persisting dispute over the presence of 120
unarmed soldiers at an army base in the town.
	   The FARC had refused to begin peace talks unless the men were
withdrawn, saying Pastrana had reneged on a pledge to withdraw all
government forces from San Vicente and four neighboring towns.
	   Peace expectations, which soared after Pastrana's meeting with
Marulanda in August, had dimmed recently and new fighting brought
little encouragement.
	   At least 14 civilians, including five children, were killed in
weekend combat in the northeastern state of Arauca, many apparently
victims of rockets and strafing by military aircraft.
	   Once talks begin, analysts expect the proposed prisoner swap to
be among the thorniest issues.
	   ``This could turn into a practically insolvable obstacle,''
wrote National University political analyst Eduardo Pizarro in
Cambio magazine.
	   The FARC says the offer is a humanitarian gesture and an
icebreaker. But critics are wary of guerrilla intentions.
	   The proposal is a leadership test for Pastrana, who presides
over a nation hungry to end decades of civil conflict.
	   Refuse, and Pastrana risks souring the FARC to what appear to be
the most promising peace talks in decades _ not to mention dashing
the hopes of family and friends of the mostly poor conscripts
carted off by the rebels since 1996.
	   Accept, and Pastrana grants the FARC unprecedented political
status while sending hundreds of hardened guerrillas, some of them
accused war criminals, back to their units.
	   All for a chance at building goodwill with a 15,000-member rebel
force that many feel has yet to prove its peaceful intentions.
	   ``It's a political and military decision of immense
transcendence,'' said former national security adviser Alfredo
Rangel, who claims the rebels are only using the negotiations to
further their battlefield advantage over Colombia's floundering
military.
	   The FARC has shrewdly reaped political gain from a three-year
string of military victories, said Rangel, giving Pastrana little
choice but to accept the proposed prisoner swap even though that
may exacerbate the violence.
	   With Pastrana appearing to give the prisoner exchange serious
consideration, humanitarian workers are warning him to think twice.
	   Some of the jailed rebels took part in political assassinations
or executions of captured troops, and at least 76 are charged with
kidnapping, the public prosecutor's office says.
	   ``This is a trial-run,'' said Carlos Rodriguez of the Colombian
Commission of Jurists, who warns that a blanket prisoner release
would be the first step toward a peace settlement granting broad
amnesty for human rights violators.
	   Others worry the prisoner exchange would feed Colombia's kidnap
rate, already the highest in the world.
	   ``This wouldn't be the end of it. It would be an incentive for
those kinds of actions to be carried out in the future,'' said
Francisco Santos, news editor of the newspaper El Tiempo and
himself a former kidnap victim.

RJR Nabisco plans to cut about 3,900 tobacco jobs worldwide

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Smokers already are paying the price of the
mammoth tobacco settlement with the states. Tobacco workers are
next.
	   RJR Nabisco, parent of the second-biggest U.S. tobacco company,
is cutting 3,900 tobacco jobs worldwide, nearly 16 percent of its
cigarette work force. RJR's cigarette brands include Winston and
Camel.
	   The cuts announced Monday include about 1,000 jobs in the United
States, where fewer cigarettes are expected to be sold following
last month's price hike of 45 cents per pack.
	   The increase is a result of the industry's $206 billion
settlement with the states over health claims.
	   The remaining 2,900 job cuts are coming in Russia and the other
former Soviet states, where RJR says economic turmoil is making
smokers reach for cheaper and less profitable brands. That's about
half of the people RJR employed in Russia and the former Soviet
nations.
	   RJR employs 8,800 people in its U.S. tobacco operations and
16,000 overseas.
	   The latest cuts are in addition to 315 domestic tobacco job cuts
announced last month.
	   ``We knew when we agreed to resolve the state tobacco litigation
that the domestic tobacco company would have to make enormous
sacrifices financially and operationally,'' said Steven F.
Goldstone, RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.'s chairman and chief
executive.
	   The U.S. job cuts are expected to occur sometime in 1999, but
Reynolds spokeswoman Jan Sneed wouldn't say where they would be
made.
	   Meanwhile, the snack foods company Nabisco Holdings Corp., which
is 80 percent owned by RJR, announced it will eliminate about 1,500
jobs and close more plants, mostly overseas, in the second phase of
a restructuring aimed at making it more competitive.
	   Nabisco makes Ritz crackers and the Snackwell's low-fat snack
line.
	   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, RJR shares closed up
50 cents at $28.81\.

British aid worker shot in Albania returns home for surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British aid worker known as the ``angel of
Mostar'' for her humanitarian efforts in that Bosnian city during
the war, flew back home Monday night for surgery after being shot
in Albania.
	   Sally Becker was shot in the right leg last month in the town of
Bajram Curri by an unidentified gunman as she walked with another
volunteer outside her hotel. She had been delivering aid to Kosovo
refugees staying there.
	   Arriving at London's Heathrow airport, the 38-year-old Becker
said she had decided to step down as director of charity Operation
Angel because bad publicity obout her was hindering the group's
fundraising efforts.
	   Critics have accused her of being a meddling self-publicist who
had endangered the lives of her fellow aid workers.
	   However, she said she will continue to work indirectly with the
group.

Formal peace dialogue set for January

<TEXT>
	   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) _ President Andres
Pastrana will inaugurate peace talks with rebel commander Manuel
Marulanda in early January, setting in motion a process that could
end nearly four decades of civil conflict, the government announced
Monday.
	   The presidential peace envoy, Victor G. Ricardo, said after a
four-hour meeting with the 68-year-old Marulanda in a remote
southern hamlet that the Colombian president and the commander of
the hemisphere's oldest and largest rebel band would meet on Jan. 7
to ``begin in earnest to work on the agenda.''
	   It will be the first time the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, riding high after a three-year string of
military victories and dominating more than one-third of the
countryside, has held peace talks with the government since failed
1991-92 parleys in Venezuela and Mexico.
	   ``Peace continues to open up new paths,'' said Ricardo, adding
that the discussions would be held in this town 300 kilometers (190
miles) south of Bogota, the largest municipality in an area from
which the government has withdrawn troops as a security guarantee.
	   The 90-day withdrawal, begun Nov. 7, met a FARC demand. But
leaders of the rebel group maintained that Pastrana did not comply
because he left 120 unarmed soldiers at a military garrison in San
Vicente.
	   Ricardo said Monday that the issue had been resolved, but did
not provide details.
	   He said only that Pastrana would ``issue the pertinent
instructions.''
	   It was not immediately clear when the soldiers, which Pastrana
said were needed to serve the government delegation and
international observers, would be removed.
	   One of four congressman who along with Attorney General Jaime
Bernal attended Monday's talks in nearby Caquetania said the issue
was ``nearly solved'' and that the evacuation was imminent.
	   The lawmaker spoke with The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity.
	   In addition to discussing the lingering soldiers, Ricardo and
Marulanda talked about the rebel proposal to swap 452 imprisoned
rebels for some 300 soldiers and police captured by the guerrillas
since 1996.
	   Although the government's 90-day withdrawal expires on Feb. 7,
it is widely anticipated that it will be prolonged for another
three to six months at least, sources close to the negotiations
have told the AP.
	   The FARC, founded by Marulanda in 1964, has refused to call a
cease-fire and its commanders say that even if they agree to peace
with the government their 15,000 fighters will not lay down their
arms.

U.S. envoy Holbrooke tries to defuse Cyprus missile crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICK QUINN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke tried
Monday to defuse the latest crisis between NATO members Greece and
Turkey over the planned deployment of Russian missiles to Cyprus.
	   But Holbrooke seems to have made little progress in preventing
the deployment after talks with Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsochadzopoulos. Leaving the hourlong talks along with his
assistant Thomas Miller, the annoyed-looking American envoy refused
to utter a word.
	   He had arrived a few hours earlier from Istanbul, Turkey, where
he met with business leaders from the war-divided island.
	   Greek Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides on Sunday insisted the
planned deployment of the Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles will
go ahead as scheduled later this month.
	   Turkey has said it will use force to stop them, which would
probably lead to a war with Greece. Athens has a defense accord
with Cyprus and has nearly fought two wars with NATO ally Turkey in
the past 11 years over territorial disputes over the Aegean Sea.
	   The eastern Mediterranean island has been divided between
Greek-and Turkish-Cypriot governments since 1974, when Turkish
troops invaded its northern third after an abortive Athens-backed
coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in a northern breakaway state
recognized only by Ankara.
	   Tsochadzopoulos indicated he and the Americans didn't see
eye-to-eye on the missiles. The United States strongly opposes
Cyprus' plans to install the anti-aircraft weapons.
	   He said he and the U.S. envoy exchanged views on what ``each
side sees as realistic for the outcome'' of the problem.
	   Reports said the initial delivery schedule had the missiles
leaving Russia on Tuesday. But there was no independent
confirmation that the repeatedly delayed delivery was imminent.
Such a development would significantly shorten the time available
to Holbrooke.

Kosovo border clash leaves dozens of ethnic Albanians dead

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A tenuous standoff between Serbian
forces and separatist rebels in Kosovo exploded in violence Monday
in the worst clash since an October truce _ a five-hour gunbattle
in which border guards killed dozens of alleged guerrillas.
	   The American diplomat who heads a peace monitoring force in
Kosovo appealed on both sides to show restraint and remain calm
``in this difficult time,'' and said efforts to create stability in
the province would intensify.
	   The pre-dawn clash along Kosovo's southwestern border with
Albania resulted in Yugoslav army troops killing 30 ethnic
Albanians and wounding 12 who were trying to enter the country
illegally, the Serb-run Media Center reported.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
sent a team to the site, said 31 people had been confirmed killed,
including one woman. Nine others were taken prisoner, two of whom
were wounded, officials said.
	   In other violence, OSCE sources said unidentified assailants
opened fire Monday night in a Serb-run bar in the western Kosovo
city of Pec, killing four Serbs and wounding five others. The
government's Tanjug news agency said two masked ``terrorists,''
using authorities' term for the Albanian rebels, entered the bar
about 8 p.m. and ``sprayed the bar'' with automatic weapons fire.
	   The worst violence in Kosovo in more than two months casts
further gloom on the diplomatic efforts to bring a lasting peace to
the Serbian province, where many believe a resumption of full-scale
fighting by spring is inevitable.
	   William Walker, head of the OSCE's still-forming Kosovo
Verification Mission aimed at ensuring the peace agreement is kept,
condemned the violence ``in the strongest terms.''
	   The violence, he said, ``can only lead to a spiral of
retribution that will stand in the way of a reasonable political
solution much needed in this region.''
	   In a statement issued shortly before midnight from Belgrade and
distributed in Kosovo, he called on both sides to ``show restraint
and remain calm in this difficult time.'' He said the verification
mission ``will intensify, in the light of the recent violence''
efforts to help create the conditions of confidence and respect for
human life.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since an Oct. 12
peace agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke halted
months of fighting in the separatist province in southern Serbia.
	   Holbrooke is expected in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade for
talks Tuesday with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. In
Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley said Holbrooke
would ``drive home'' to Milosevic ``the need for progress on the
negotiating front.''
	   After two months of failed shuttle diplomacy, chances of
mediating an end to the continuing violence in Kosovo seem
unlikely.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule, while the rebels say they won't
accept anything short of independence. Serbia, meanwhile, refuses
to consider anything more than partial autonomy for the
Albanian-majority province.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who met with ethnic Albanian
negotiators in Pristina on Monday and who also plans to be in
Belgrade on Tuesday, has seen his proposals for a political
settlement rejected by both sides.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence have frequently armed themselves in neighboring
Albania.
	   The report by the Media Center said armed ethnic Albanians were
trying to enter Kosovo from Albania when a shootout erupted at 2
a.m. Monday near Gorozup and Liken, about 70 kilometers (45 miles)
southwest of Pristina.
	   Yugoslav soldiers confiscated arms and other material that the
Albanians were trying to smuggle in, the Media Center report said.
	   Municipal authorities in nearby Prizren were quoted as saying
that all those killed and wounded were wearing camouflage uniforms
with the insignia of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Hours after the pre-dawn border battle, ethnic Albanian sources
said heavy detonations and shootings were heard from the area of
three nearby villages that had been sealed off by Serb police.
Further information was not immediately available.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
were left homeless after Milosevic launched a crackdown against
separatist rebels in February.

mediating an end to the continuing violence in Kosovo seem
unlikely.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule, while the rebels say they won't
accept anything short of independence. Serbia, meanwhile, refuses
to consider anything more than partial autonomy for the
Albanian-majority province.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who met with ethnic Albanian
negotiators in Pristina on Monday and who also plans to be in
Belgrade on Tuesday, has seen his proposals for a political
settlement rejected by both sides.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels who have been fighting for Kosovo's
independence have frequently armed themselves in neighboring
Albania.
	   The report by the Media Center said armed ethnic Albanians were
trying to enter Kosovo from Albania when a shootout erupted at 2
a.m. Monday near Gorozup and Liken, about 70 kilometers (45 miles)
southwest of Pristina.
	   Yugoslav soldiers confiscated arms and other material that the
Albanians were trying to smuggle in, the Media Center report said.
	   Municipal authorities in nearby Prizren were quoted as saying
that all those killed and wounded were wearing camouflage uniforms
with the insignia of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Hours after the pre-dawn border battle, ethnic Albanian sources
said heavy detonations and shootings were heard from the area of
three nearby villages that had been sealed off by Serb police.
Further information was not immediately available.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
were left homeless after Milosevic launched a crackdown against
separatist rebels in February.
	   In another development, the second-ranking diplomat at the
French embassy in Belgrade and two other embassy employees were
killed Monday in a car accident in Kosovo.
	   French officials said Gerard Fauveau, the embassy's first
counselor, fellow diplomat Richard Berthaux and embassy security
guard Jean-Pierre Latour were killed when their car collided with a
passenger bus in Besinje, just north of Pristina.

Refugees to top agenda of Bosnia peace conference

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Helping Bosnian war refugees return home
three years after the conflict ended is expected to dominate the
agenda of the Peace Implementation Council's annual conference that
begins Tuesday.
	   ``The return of refugees is the emblematic issue of this
conference, which must provide political and financial support for
those who want to return,'' Carlos Westendorp, Bosnia's top
international mediator, was quoted as saying Monday by the Spanish
daily El Mundo.
	   The council, which represents some 40 countries and
organizations, was set up to oversee the implementation of the
December 1995 Dayton peace accords that ended Bosnia's civil war.
	   The agreement divided the country into the Muslim-Croat
Federation and the Serb Republic, and deployed a NATO-led
peacekeeping force.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and U.S. Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott were among those expected at the two-day
Madrid conference.
	   The 1995 accords promised a safe return home and compensation
for property lost to the hundreds of thousands of refugees who fled
Bosnia or were internally displaced during the 1992-95 ethnic-based
war involving Muslims, Serbs and Croats.
	   The council is also expected to discuss the town of Brcko _ a
key strategic location claimed by both the Muslem-Croat Federation
and the Serb Republic and the last territorial issue still
outstanding from the Dayton accords.
	   Some 12,000 Muslims who lived in Brcko before the war now live
in neighboring villages waiting to find out if they will be able to
return to the town that is now dominated by Serbs, many of whom are
refugees from Sarajevo.
	   Meanwhile, the Muslim-led Federation has said it will use the
conference to raise the issue of long sentences handed down
Saturday by a Serb court to three Muslims found guilty of murder.
	   Westendorp has condemned the sentences because of the scant
evidence presented at trial.

SEC alleges fraud
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARCY GORDON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Salt Lake Olympics, the Rolling Stones and
the Mormon Church wouldn't appear to have much in common.
	   Federal security regulators say the link is an Internet company
which fraudulently claimed to have contracts with all of them in an
attempt to bilk investors.
	   The Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday it had
secured a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against
WARPnet Holdings LLC, which portrays itself as a provider of
Internet technology, and its manager, Kevin Tauber of Salt Lake
City.
	   The order last Friday came from U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball
in Salt Lake City.
	   The market watchdog agency also is seeking an injunction against
WARPnet and Tauber, and unspecified civil fines and reimbursement
from them for allegedly violating securities laws and defrauding
investors. A hearing has been scheduled for Friday.
	   The SEC said that in addition to contract claims involving the
rock group and the church, Taubner falsely told investors that
WARPnet had obtained written agreements from NBC, ABC, CBS and ESPN
for the company to be the official Internet provider for the 2002
Winter Olympics, to be held in Salt Lake City, the SEC said.
	   The city's organizing committee has denied any relationship with
WARPnet or Tauber, according to the SEC.
	   ``This is the first Olympics-related scam we've seen'' in Salt
Lake City, said Kenneth Israel, the SEC's district administrator in
that city.
	   Tauber, a British citizen, denied any wrongdoing in a telephone
interview and said he would contest the allegations. An attorney
representing WARPnet declined comment.
	   ``We're obviously going to defend against it to the extreme,''
Tauber said by telephone from Salt Lake City. ``We're frankly
flabbergasted that this has been put together.''
	   The SEC alleged that WARPnet, based in Columbia, Mo., and Tauber
defrauded investors in Utah and California by selling stakes in the
company and falsely representing some of its business agreements.
	   Potential investors were told they would receive a percentage of
WARPnet's profits from the contracts and that after a year, the
company would repurchase the stakes at a profit to the investors of
dlrs 2 for each dlrs 8 investment unit.
	   The scheme, started last summer, netted at least dlrs 100,000
from more than 40 investors, the SEC said in its complaint. The
agency said Tauber solicited potential investors in person, by
phone and by mail.
	   The investments ranged from small amounts up to dlrs 70,000,
according to the SEC.
	   Jonathan Dalton, an attorney in St. Louis, Missouri,
representing WARPnet, said he had just learned of the SEC's action
on Monday and wasn't able to comment.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Stirring Palestinian passions for
statehood, President Clinton stood witness Monday as hundreds of
Palestinian leaders renounced a call for the destruction of Israel.
Clinton urged ``legitimate rights for Palestinians, real security
for Israel.''
	   The Palestinian vote _ registered with a show of hands and
applause _ removed a contentious issue dating back to 1964 from the
crisis-shrouded Mideast peace process.
	   Clinton, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned a three-way meeting early
Tuesday. At stake was the revival of the Wye River
land-for-security accord, nearing collapse with Israelis and the
Palestinians accusing each other of violating the deal.
	   Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem that the Palestinian vote
would ``lead to a real peace, a lasting peace, not a minute-long
peace.'' But at the same time, he told reporters, Arafat must
renounce plans to declare statehood and take steps to end the
violence in the region.
	   Just as Netanyahu told Clinton on Sunday that the Palestinians
were violating peace accords, Arafat told the president Monday that
Israel was guilty of violations. He called on Israel to release
jailed Palestinians _ ``our heroes in prison.'' Netanyahu has vowed
not to release prisoners he regards as terrorists.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged Netanyahu to move
ahead with West Bank troop withdrawals, although she acknowledged
Israel probably will not conduct a pullback by Friday. ``We hope
very much that it can be as close to the schedule as possible,''
she said.

Deeper, tougher Iowa climbs into poll
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG SMITH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) _ Iowa coach Tom Davis knew all along it
would take a signature victory to get his basketball team in the
Top 25.
	   When the Hawkeyes beat Kansas to end the Jayhawks' 62-game
winning streak at home, they got that victory.
	   That victory and a 74-54 win over Iowa State, earned Iowa (7-1)
the No. 25 spot Monday in The Associated Press poll.
	   ``We snuck in, huh?,'' said Davis, who is in his final season of
coaching the Hawkeyes. ``We talked about it with the team, whether
it was possible or not. It was a good week.
	   ``I frankly thought it was going to take a couple more wins
because there are a lot of teams in the country with 7-1 records _
or better records with more significant victories,'' he said.
	   Connecticut (8-0) remained No. 1 for the third straight week
after beating Massachusetts 59-54 and then escaping from Pittsburgh
with a 70-69 victory. With Maryland, last week's No. 2 team, losing
at Kentucky, Connecticut's margin in first-place votes went from
53-17 over the Terrapins to 66-4 over Duke this week.
	   Kentucky jumped from fifth to third, while Cincinnati held at
No. 4 and Maryland dropped to fifth in the voting by a national
media panel.
	   There were big changes at the bottom of the Top 25 with Auburn,
Wisconsin and Oklahoma joining Iowa in their season debut in the
rankings.
	   Connecticut had 1,768 points, 99 more than Duke (9-1), which
crushed Florida and Michigan by an average of 37 points.
	   Kentucky (9-1), the defending national champion, beat Maryland
(10-1) 103-91 in a much-awaited matchup at Rupp Arena. Cincinnati
(6-0), which handed Duke its only loss, had the only other
first-place vote.
	   Stanford and North Carolina remained sixth and seventh, Arizona
and Purdue tied for eighth and Indiana moved up one place to No.
10.
	   New Mexico started the second 10 and was followed by UCLA,
Kansas, Michigan State, St. John's, Clemson, Minnesota, Oklahoma
State, Auburn and Arkansas. The last five were Syracuse,
Pittsburgh, Wisconsin, Oklahoma and Iowa.
	   Temple, Tennessee, Washington and Utah dropped out.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes from astronauts, concern over

 &UR; By MARCIA DUNN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Still aglow over their space station
handiwork, Endeavour's astronauts were in a holiday mood Monday as
they packed for the trip home.
	   ``We are feeling terrific,'' Nancy Currie radioed down. ``We are
ready to start packing and coming home to see our families just in
time for Christmas. Can't be more pleased with the way the
mission's gone.''
	   Space shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to land at Kennedy Space
Center late Tuesday, nearly 12 days after blasting off on NASA's
first station-assembly mission. Cloudy skies could interfere.
	   Currie needs to get back fast _ she has Christmas shopping to
do.
	   ``Considering we went into quarantine on Thanksgiving Day, I
wasn't looking that far ahead,'' explained, Currie, who has an
11-year-old daughter.
	   With two toddlers at home, James Newman has more to buy, too,
even though he was busy wrapping Christmas presents right up until
the crew's Dec. 4 launch.
	   The six astronauts enjoyed a break following Sunday's release of
the 77-foot international space station, which trailed the shuttle
by more than 300 miles Monday night.
	   Flight controllers in Houston and Moscow monitored the station,
as they will throughout its expected 15-year lifetime.
	   Power was being provided by the Russian-built control module
Zarya. Communications were being handled by Unity, the
American-made chamber.
	   The astronauts connected Zarya and Unity, which had never before
touched, and wired them together by hand. They also attached
antennas, tools and handrails for future crews.
	   The next construction team is due to arrive in May.
	   Shuttle commander Robert Cabana said the mission seemed, at
times, surreal.
	   ``We kept pinching ourselves and saying it can't be real, it's
going so well and everything is so right and it just looks so
good,'' he told reporters. ``Yeah, there was a little sense of
unreality about it.''

State oil monopoly's profits down 71 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Plummeting oil prices have cut profits
at Venezuela's state oil monopoly by 71 percent this year,
Petroleos de Venezuela president Luis Giusti said Monday.
	   The company's profits dropped from dlrs 4.8 billion last year to
an estimated dlrs 1.4 billion this year, Giusti told reporters.
Prices for Venezuelan oil hit a 12-year low last week, dropping to
dlrs 7.66 a barrel _ barely half the average price in 1997.
	   The plummeting prices forced the government to slash about dlrs
2 billion from this year's national budget. Revenue from Petroleos
de Venezuela accounts for one-fourth of the budget.
	   Venezuela's fiscal deficit is estimated at about dlrs 5 billion
and is expected to balloon to at least dlrs 6 billion next year.
	   The crisis also forced Petroleos de Venezuela, which is one of
the world's largest oil companies, to reduce spending on investment
by 29 percent, to dlrs 4 billion, Giusti said.
	   He added that he did not expect prices to rebound in the next
few months.
	   Oil officials from Venezuela, Mexico and Saudi Arabia plan to
meet in Madrid on Thursday to discuss new cuts in production to try
to raise prices.
	   However, Giusti said any such cut could be difficult for
Venezuela to carry out because it would contribute to unemployment
in an already battered economy.

Dlrs 20 million loan to Penguins approved
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Over the objection of some creditors, the
Pittsburgh Penguins were given permission Monday by a federal
bankruptcy judge to borrow dlrs 20 million from a French bank.
	   The loan will allow the Penguins to meet their payroll on
Tuesday and to remain in business until the start of the 1999-2000
National Hockey League season.
	   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz agreed the Penguins
could borrow the money from Societe Generale after the bank
renegotiated terms of the loan. The team will pay 7 1/2 percent
interest.
	   ``This is a major step in the reorganization of the Pittsburgh
Penguins,'' said Garvin Warden, the team's interim chief executive
officer. ``This should eliminate many of the questions we have been
facing in recent weeks.
	   ``Players and employees will continue to be paid. Bills will
continue to be paid. Business is moving forward.''
	   Warden also said the team is close to announcing a new, more
lucrative agreement with TV rights holder Fox Sports Pittsburgh.
	   The judge previously had a problem with a requirement that the
team pay all legal fees and bank expenses related to the loan. Some
creditors also objected, saying the Penguins needed only dlrs 12
million to dlrs 14 million _ not dlrs 20 million _ to operate
through the 1998-99 season.
	   The creditors included Allstate, Principal and TMG life
insurance companies and the Bank of America Trust and Savings
Association, which argued the team is not worth enough to secure
its debts.
	   The Penguins, who have an estimated worth of dlrs 75 million to
dlrs 95 million, owe approximately dlrs 125 million in addition to
the new dlrs 20 million loan. Despite the mounting debt, Markovitz
told the team on Friday that it could not borrow an additional dlrs
18.5 million from the NHL.

Olympian angered over Salt Lake fund
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 11th graf to CORRECT to 1997 &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CARTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Former Olympic track star Henry Marsh
wants a full accounting of the dlrs 500,000 ``humanitarian aid''
fund used to pay for scholarships to at least six relatives of IOC
members.
	   ``If some heads have to roll, then so be it,'' he said Monday.
``This went over the line. And I'll say right now that if it turns
out that I should have known about this, then I'll resign. That is
not what the Olympic movement is about.''
	   Marsh, a four-time Olympian, is a Salt Lake Organizing Committee
trustee.
	   The existence of the scholarship fund and its use to benefit IOC
members has snowballed into the biggest corruption scandal in
Olympic history.
	   On Sunday, SLOC president Frank Joklik apologized to the IOC
executive committee in Lausanne, Switzerland. He regretted the
appearance that the fund was used to bribe IOC members to award the
2002 Winter Games to Salt Lake.
	   Marc Hodler, a senior member of the IOC's executive board, is
using the Salt Lake payoffs as a catalyst to flush alleged
corruption from the IOC. On Monday, Hodler said Salt Lake was a
victim of blackmail by unscrupulous agents and IOC members in its
successful bid for the 2002 Olympics.
	   Hodler said other bids have been tainted as well and the IOC has
opened an investigation. Other bid cities say Hodler's accusations
are groundless.
	   Several officials who sat on both the bid and organizing
committees said they didn't know the fund existed _ despite
Joklik's assurances last week that it was ``common knowledge'' to
those close to the Salt Lake bid.
	   ``This came right out of the blue,'' said Fred Ball, a former
bid committee member and retired executive director of the Salt
Lake Chamber of Commerce. ``I darn near cried when I saw this.''
	   Joklik, chairman of the bid committee at the time, claims he did
not know the specifics of the program, which was being run by
former bid president Tom Welch and vice president Dave Johnson, who
remains in that job.
	   Welch resigned as SLOC president in the summer of 1997 amid a
spouse-abuse scandal. He continues to be paid dlrs 10,000 a month
as an SLOC consultant.
	   The only recipient of the scholarship fund identified so far has
been Sonia Essomba, daughter of late IOC member Rene Essomba, a
surgeon and former head of the National Olympic Committees of
Africa.
	   Joklik has said most of the 13 recipients of the scholarship
fund _ including the six relatives of IOC members _ were from
Africa.
	   Two weeks ago, Welch assured The Associated Press that besides
Essomba, no other IOC relatives were fund recipients. He has not
returned messages left at his Park City condominium since.
	   Nick Badami, former president of the U.S. Ski Association and a
member of the bid committee, said he knew only of a vague plan to
assist Third World athletes.
	   ``This just shocked me,'' he said. ``I think we're all feeling a
little victimized right now.''
	   Badami, Marsh and others plan to press the point at a meeting of
the SLOC executive committee on Friday after Joklik returns from
Lausanne.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Still aglow over their space station
handiwork, Endeavour's astronauts were in a holiday mood Monday as
they packed for the trip home.
	   ``We are feeling terrific,'' Nancy Currie radioed down. ``We are
ready to start packing and coming home to see our families just in
time for Christmas. Can't be more pleased with the way the
mission's gone.''
	   Space shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to land at Kennedy Space
Center late Tuesday, nearly 12 days after blasting off on NASA's
first station-assembly mission. Cloudy skies could interfere.
	   Currie needs to get back fast _ she has Christmas shopping to
do.
	   ``Considering we went into quarantine on Thanksgiving Day, I
wasn't looking that far ahead,'' explained Currie, who has an
11-year-old daughter.
	   With two toddlers at home, James Newman has more to buy, too,
even though he was busy wrapping Christmas presents right up until
the crew's Dec. 4 launch.
	   The six astronauts were enjoying a break following Sunday's
release of the 77-foot international space station, which trailed
the shuttle by more than 300 miles Monday night.
	   Flight controllers in Houston and Moscow monitored the station,
as they will throughout its expected 15-year lifetime.
	   Power was being provided by the Russian-built control module
Zarya. Communications were being handled by Unity, the
American-made chamber.
	   The astronauts connected Zarya and Unity, which had never before
touched, and wired them together by hand. They also attached
antennas, tools and handrails for future crews.
	   The next construction team is due to arrive in May.
	   Shuttle commander Robert Cabana said the mission seemed, at
times, surreal.
	   ``We kept pinching ourselves and saying it can't be real, it's
going so well and everything is so right and it just looks so
good,'' he told reporters. ``Yeah, there was a little sense of
unreality about it.''

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton stood
witness Monday as hundreds of Palestinian leaders renounced a call
for the destruction of Israel. The Palestinian vote _ registered
with a show of hands and applause _ removed a contentious issue
dating back to 1964 from the crisis-shrouded Mideast peace process.
Clinton, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned a three-way meeting early
Tuesday. At stake was the revival of the Wye River
land-for-security accord, nearing collapse with Israelis and the
Palestinians accusing each other of violating the deal. Netanyahu
told reporters in Jerusalem that the Palestinian vote would ``lead
to a real peace, a lasting peace, not a minute-long peace.'' But at
the same time, he told reporters, Arafat must renounce plans to
declare statehood and take steps to end the violence in the region.
(CLINTON-MIDEAST)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A tenuous standoff between Serbian
forces and separatist rebels in Kosovo exploded in violence Monday
in the worst clash since an October truce _ a five-hour gunbattle
in which border guards killed dozens of alleged guerrillas. The
pre-dawn clash along Kosovo's southwestern border with Albania
resulted in Yugoslav army troops killing 30 ethnic Albanians and
wounding 12 who were trying to enter the country illegally, the
Serb-run Media Center reported. The Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which sent a team to the site, confirmed 31
people had been killed, including one woman. Nine others were taken
prisoner, two of whom were wounded, officials said. The worst
violence in Kosovo in more than two months casts further gloom on
the diplomatic efforts to bring a lasting peace to the Serbian
province, where many believe a resumption of full-scale fighting by
spring is inevitable. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The ranks of pro-impeachment Republicans
swelled on Monday in the run-up to a momentous House vote as Vice
President Al Gore accused the Republicans of ignoring the ``wisdom
of the American people'' by blocking censure. Dogged by the issue
on a trip to the Middle East, Clinton said he was open to ``any
reasonable compromise'' with Congress short of impeachment. But if
anything, the shaky ground under the president appeared to soften
further during the day. Two northeast Republican lawmakers eyed by
Clinton's defenders as potential opponents of impeachment announced
their intention to vote the other way. The developments came two
days after the House Judiciary Committee completed work on four
articles of impeachment alleging perjury, obstruction of justice
and abuse of power. All stem from the investigation into Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) _ President Andres
Pastrana will inaugurate peace talks with rebel commander Manuel
Marulanda in early January, setting in motion a process that could
end nearly four decades of civil conflict, the government announced
Monday. The presidential peace envoy, Victor G. Ricardo, said after
a four-hour meeting with the 68-year-old Marulanda in a remote
southern hamlet that the Colombian president and the commander of
the hemisphere's oldest and largest rebel band would meet on Jan. 7
to ``begin in earnest to work on the agenda.'' It will be the first
time the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, riding
high after a three-year string of military victories and dominating
more than one-third of the countryside, has held peace talks with
the government since failed 1991-92 parleys in Venezuela and
Mexico. (COLOMBIA-PEACE TALKS)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned Monday
that the world has every reason to fear the worst next year in
Iraq, Africa, the Balkans and Afghanistan unless efforts to find
peaceful solutions are redoubled. Annan warned that unless the
underlying distortions and imbalances in the global economy are
tackled, ``we must expect more conflicts and even more intractable
ones.'' At a yearend news conference, the U.N. chief said the
perennial challenge of achieving world peace is now coupled with
the new challenge of a global financial crisis that has affected
entire nations and the lives of millions of people. Painting a grim
picture of crises in Africa, the Balkans, Afghanistan, ``and above
all, Iraq,'' Annan noted that none has been resolved. (UN-ANNAN'S

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Earnings disappointments and weakening
technology shares pushed stocks sharply lower Monday, extending the
market's week-long drop to nearly 400 points. The Dow Jones
industrial average dropped 126.16 points _ or by 1.4 percent _ to
8,695.60. The blue-chip index has fallen 374.87 points since Dec.
7. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Oil giant Royal Dutch-Shell warned Monday that its
fourth-quarter earnings will fall dlrs 4.5 billion because of a
group restructuring that includes the sale of 40 percent of its
chemical business. But the company said it will also achieve
savings of dlrs 2.5 billion a year by 2001 in a major cost cutting
program that is part of its regrouping designed to better protect
itself from declining oil prices, which are the lowest they have
been in 12 years. Shell's shares closed down 3.75 pence at 350.25
pence on the London Stock Exchange on the back of the company's
announcement. Several oil companies have announced significant
consolidations and revampings in the last few weeks, including
Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., which plan a dlrs 73.7 billion merger.
(ROYAL DUTCH-SHELL)
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Four of Canada's biggest banks suffered a
stinging defeat Monday when the finance minister rejected merger
proposals that would have created two mega-banks controlling 70
percent of the nation's banking assets. The mergers would have
joined Royal Bank of Canada, the country's largest bank, with
third-ranked Bank of Montreal, and second-ranked Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce with No. 5 Toronto-Dominion Bank. Finance Minister
Paul Martin said the banks' proposals ``are not in the best
interests of Canadians.'' The two merged banks would have
controlled about 70 percent Canada's banking assets _ roughly 960
billion Canadian dollars (dlrs 623 billion U.S.). (CANADA-BANK
MERGERS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Oracle Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. are
licensing each other's software in a pact that encourages
development of new business computers that don't require the use of
an operating system such as those sold by rival Microsoft Corp. The
pairing of Oracle's database software and Sun's computer technology
is the latest attempt to slow explosive demand for Microsoft's
operating software, which runs the basic functions of most desktop
computers and a growing number of more powerful business machines
as well. Oracle is the No. 1 maker of database software and Sun is
a major maker of powerful business computers that compete with
machines running on Windows NT, Microsoft's popular software for
corporate computers. (US-ORACLE-SUN)
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's King Fahd said Monday
his country wants to bring balance to the world oil markets through
cooperation by members and non-members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries. In remarks made at the weekly
Cabinet meeting and carried by the official Saudi Press Agency,
Fahd underscored the ``frank'' comments made at last week's Gulf
Cooperation Council summit by his heir apparent, Crown Prince
Abdullah. Fahd's brief statement Monday didn't elaborate beyond
backing his half-brother's statements at the GCC meeting. Abdullah
said at that meeting last week that oil producers shouldn't
hesitate to act again to restore balance to the crude markets.
(SAUDI-FAHD-OIL)
	   WESTBORO, Massachusetts (AP) _ In a deal valued at approximately
dlrs 3.2 billion, New England Electric System announced on Monday
that it has agreed to be taken over by National Grid, the English
and Welsh electricity operation. In a news conference in London,
National Grid chief executive David Jones said NEES has a strong
track record and provides an excellent entry point into the
American market, given the good economic climate in New England and
deregulation of utilities in Massachusetts. Jones said the merger
gives NEES the necessary experience to navigate deregulation, since
National Grid had been through a similar situation when utilities
were privatized in United Kingdom in the early 1990s.
(BRITAIN-NATIONAL GRID)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mattel Inc. took its biggest step yet toward
expanding beyond Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars into the
fast-growing world of high-tech toys, announcing its purchase of
The Learning Company Inc., maker of software games Riven, Myst and
Carmen Sandiego. The world's biggest toymaker also warned Monday
that its earnings will be lower than expected largely due to a
significant shift in buying practices from many of its important
retail customers. Mattel's dlrs 3.8 billion stock purchase of The
Learning Company comes as it looks to greatly develop its
interactive business, realizing that children today yearn for more
technologically savvy products during playtime. (US-MATTEL)

	   PARIS (AP) _ Sophie Marceau edged out Sharon Stone for vixen in
the next James Bond movie, Le Parisien reported Monday.
	   The 32-year-old French actress has starred in ``Braveheart,''
``Anna Karenina'' and ``Firelight.'' She also appears in fragrance
adds.
	   Marceau will play the evil Electra to Pierce Brosnan's Bond.
	   Le Parisien said Marceau beat out Stone for the part and signed
her contract with MGM studios last week.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Fire destroyed the roof and top
floor of Earl Spencer's house on Monday after lightning struck its
thatched roof, firemen said.
	   About a dozen firemen and three fire engines were at the house
of Spencer, brother to the late Princess Diana, at 7 p.m. local
time.
	   Spencer, a member of the British aristocracy, and his children
were not home when the fire started, but returned soon after. They
left the premises again, according to the fireman, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   ``Half of the top of the house is gone. It looks pretty bad,''
the fireman said.
	   The home is located in Constantia, one of Cape Town's plushest
residential areas.
	   ___
	   BEVERLY HILLS, California (AP) _ Not a day goes by that Barbara
Sinatra doesn't think about her late husband.
	   ``I miss him every day. He was my strength,'' she said Saturday,
on what would have been Frank Sinatra's 83rd birthday. ``These past
months have been difficult but I am doing my best to adjust.''
	   She and Frank Sinatra Jr. are organizing her husband's charity
golf tournament at Westin Mission Hills Resort to benefit the
Barbara Sinatra Children's Center at Eisenhower Medical Center in
Rancho Mirage.
	   Sinatra died of a heart attack May 14.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ William Ginsburg, who met a burst of publicity
as one of Monica Lewinsky's lawyers during the investigation of
President Clinton, says the case took quite a personal toll.
	   ``I am suffering from post-traumatic-stress syndrome from this
case,'' Ginsburg said in the Dec. 21 issue of The New Yorker
magazine. ``It took me months to recover.''
	   The Lewinsky case made him lose touch with his values and his
ability to focus on trial work, Ginsburg said in an article
retelling the events of the past year from his perspective.
	   Ginsburg, who has returned to his practice in Los Angeles, was
asked to help Ms. Lewinsky by her father, Bernard Lewinsky, in
January.
	   He became immediately visible on talk shows, often criticizing
independent counsel Kenneth Starr. He departed Ms. Lewinsky's legal
team on June 2.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says he is offended by
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's criticism of Donald Trump's
plans for a skyscraper near the United Nations.
	   ``That was sort of a knee-jerk reaction to criticize the city,''
Giuliani was quoted as saying in the Daily News on Sunday. ``I
would suspect that if I had a knee-jerk reaction just to criticize
the U.N. without checking, he would be offended by that.''
	   Giuliani's comment came after Annan was quoted as saying that
Trump's planned 72-story apartment tower would cast a ``colossal
shadow'' over the East Side of Manhattan.
	   ``As someone who lives and works in the neighborhood, he's
concerned that the building might be out of scale,'' Annan
spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   The mayor said he was most angered that Annan ``never bothered
to check'' how the city approves skyscrapers before making his
comments.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ South Africa native Charlize Theron was born to
play opposite a cuddly 15-foot-tall (5-meter) gorilla in the remake
of ``Mighty Joe Young.''
	   ``I chased and chased after this part because it reminded me so
much of my own life,'' Theron said in Sunday's Daily News. ``I was
an only child raised on a farm in South Africa. I entertained
myself through my relationships with animals, particularly my pet
goat, Bok. He used to sleep with me in my bed.''
	   The 23-year-old actress whose film credits include ``That Thing
You Do,'' ``The Devil's Advocate'' and ``Celebrity'' was a Milan
model and aspiring ballet dancer before moving to Hollywood.
	   Theron's South African accent was seen as a liability by casting
agents. She said she got rid of it ``by leaving the TV on 24 hours
a day. A constant diet of `The Love Boat' and `Dallas' will do the
trick.''
	   ___
	   BANGALORE, India (AP) _ Last year, red pepper trader Karim Abbas
married his wife atop an elephant. This year, wishing a memorable
wedding for his younger brother too, Abbas had him married in an
airborne helicopter.
	   On Sunday, thousands of residents of Alipur village in India's
southern state of Karnataka who had never seen a helicopter before,
gathered to watch the ``bird'' descend on a dry farm field.
	   The groom and bride took off in a helicopter, accompanied by two
Islamic priests, who administered the vows during the 20-minute
flight.
	   ``It was such an extraordinary feeling that words fail me,''
said Zamin Abbas, the groom.
	   The Abbas family could not afford the normal rates for hiring a
helicopter, but the owner reduced the price because of the novelty
of the wedding.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   IRVINE, California (AP) _ Some might say 11-year-old Thomas
Michon is the Frank Lloyd Wright of Lego builders _ with a little
Stephen King thrown in for good measure.
	   The Irvine boy won first place in the Lego national championship
over the weekend by creating a Godzilla-like monster with flapping
wings attacking cars on a bridge.
	   The effort won him a trip to the Legoland theme park, scheduled
to open in March in Carlsbad. There, he'll be presented with a
statue in his likeness made of the interlocking plastic bricks.
	   ``I think I may end up with a job building things,'' said the
boy, who has been playing with Lego bricks since he was 3. At age
5, he won the Lego World Cup in Denmark.
	   He spends about 20 hours each week building things from the
nearly 80,000 Lego pieces in his collection. He also plays
baseball, computer games and the violin.

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs to UPDATE with government plane shot down &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A government plane was shot down as it
flew over a rebel-held town in the central highlands, killing 10
passengers and crew, the Angolan air force said.
	   The air force statement didn't blame the UNITA rebels for the
crash of the Russian-made Antonov 12, which went down just north of
the city of Kuito, which lies about 500 kms (300 miles) southeast
of the capital Luanda.
	   The aircraft was returning to Luanda after flying logistical
equipment into Kuito, where government forces are under attack by
UNITA.
	   UNITA rebel forces have taken four towns in Huambo province and
four others in neighboring Bie province since Dec. 4, when fighting
restarted in the highlands about 300 miles (480 kilometers)
southeast of Luanda, state radio RNA reported.
	   The renewed fighting, which has ended a four-year peace pact
between the government and UNITA, has displaced thousands of people
who had converged on Kuito, according to the World Food Program.
	   UNITA and the army were engaged in heavy combat to the north and
east of Kuito, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) from the city, RNA
said.
	   Rebel artillery shells lobbed into Kuito on Monday hit the
airport, the radio said, and the WFP suspended aid flights into the
city because of security concerns.
	   However, the army was holding back a rebel advance on Huambo,
another major city 70 miles (110 kilometers) west of Kuito, RNA
said, and the WFP said it was maintaining its regular flights into
the city.
	   A UNITA spokesman in Lisbon, Portugal, said Monday that rebel
units had slipped into the suburbs of Kuito where they were
fighting the army.
	   The spokesman, Carlos Morgado, said rebel forces had inflicted
heavy casualties on five army regiments totaling 10,000 men.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the reports, and the
government has refused to allow foreign reporters into the region.
	   Neither side has acknowledged the collapse of the United
Nations-brokered 1994 peace agreement, which was supposed to end a
two-decade civil war that broke out after the southwest African
nation's 1975 independence from Portugal.
	   The fighting was halted by a 1991 peace deal, but the agreement
collapsed a year later after UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ rejected its
defeat in the country's first elections.

Chechen parliament bars president from using army to fight crime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's parliament hampered the president's
plans to stop rampant crime in the breakaway Russian territory,
declaring Monday he cannot use army reserves to fight internal
lawlessness.
	   The parliament ruled that the decree by Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov, issued Saturday to call up reservists to work against
criminal gangs, was unconstitutional, Russia's Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Thousands of army reservists had already shown up for service
Sunday, and it was unclear if Maskhadov would order them to step
down after parliament's decision or continue his call for reserves.
	   Parliament said the move contradicts Chechnya's constitution,
which says reservists can only be mobilized in the face of an
outside threat, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Maskhadov supporters maintain that many criminal groups in
Chechnya are financed by foreign sources and therefore constitute
an outside threat, Interfax said.
	   Since Chechnya's 1994-96 independence war with Russia, the
Caucasus Mountains region has been awash in violence as feuding
gangs wage bloody turf wars. Hundreds of people, including many
foreigners, have been kidnapped.

	   BOGOTA, (AP) _ Weekend fighting between the army and leftist
rebels killed at least 14 civilians, including five children _ many
apparently victims of rockets and strafing by military aircraft.
	   Three soldiers also died and 13 were wounded in combat that
began Saturday as troops pursued units from the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, in the northeastern state of Arauca,
the military said Monday.
	   The army said fighting continued Monday in the area, 200 miles
(325 kilometers) from Bogota, but provided no details.
	   Local human rights workers and municipal officials said
residents blamed the civilian deaths on strafing and bombardments
Sunday in support of army troops in the village of Santo Domingo.
	   The mayor of the nearby town of Tame, Luis Ramon Marquez, said
residents who left their houses Sunday morning to show military
helicopter pilots they weren't guerrillas but civilians were cut
down by military gunfire.
	   ``What the people are saying, and they're saying it with much
certainty, is that they were in the middle of the village of Santo
Domingo and a plane dropped a bomb on the civilian population,''
Marquez told the Radionet network, adding that the dead included
five children.
	   Marquez said that he also understood rebels had sought shelter
in civilian homes.
	   The army accused the rebels of putting civilians in the line of
fire.
	   ``If they were victims of our rockets, it's because they were
outside of their homes, shooting or being used as human shields, ''
Air Force commander Hector Fabio Velasquez told a news conference
Monday.
	   ``It's difficult to know at any given moment whether I'm
shooting at a civilian or at a guerrilla, because we're in the
dense jungle and they're firing in all directions, from where there
are civilians,'' said army commander Gen. Alfredo Mora Rangel.
	   Red Cross officials confirmed the civilian casualties, but did
not comment on which side was to blame.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Still aglow over their space station
handiwork, Endeavour's astronauts were in a holiday mood Monday as
they packed for the trip home.
	   ``We are feeling terrific,'' Nancy Currie radioed down. ``We are
ready to start packing and coming home to see our families just in
time for Christmas. Can't be more pleased with the way the
mission's gone.''
	   Space shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to land at Kennedy Space
Center late Tuesday, nearly 12 days after blasting off on NASA's
first station-assembly mission. Cloudy skies could interfere.
	   Currie needs to get back fast _ she has Christmas shopping to
do.
	   ``Considering we went into quarantine on Thanksgiving Day, I
wasn't looking that far ahead,'' explained, Currie, who has an
11-year-old daughter.
	   With two toddlers at home, James Newman has more to buy, too,
even though he was busy wrapping Christmas presents right up until
the crew's Dec. 4 launch.
	   The six astronauts enjoyed a break following Sunday's release of
the 77-foot international space station, which trailed the shuttle
by more than 300 miles Monday night.
	   Flight controllers in Houston and Moscow monitored the station,
as they will throughout its expected 15-year lifetime.
	   Power was being provided by the Russian-built control module
Zarya. Communications were being handled by Unity, the
American-made chamber.
	   The astronauts connected Zarya and Unity, which had never before
touched, and wired them together by hand. They also attached
antennas, tools and handrails for future crews.
	   The next construction team is due to arrive in May.
	   Shuttle commander Robert Cabana said the mission seemed, at
times, surreal.
	   ``We kept pinching ourselves and saying it can't be real, it's
going so well and everything is so right and it just looks so
good,'' he told reporters. ``Yeah, there was a little sense of
unreality about it.''

they packed for the trip home.
	   ``We are feeling terrific,'' Nancy Currie radioed down. ``We are
ready to start packing and coming home to see our families just in
time for Christmas. Can't be more pleased with the way the
mission's gone.''
	   Space shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to land at Kennedy Space
Center late Tuesday, nearly 12 days after blasting off on NASA's
first station-assembly mission. Cloudy skies could interfere.
	   Currie needs to get back fast _ she has Christmas shopping to
do.
	   ``Considering we went into quarantine on Thanksgiving Day, I
wasn't looking that far ahead,'' explained Currie, who has an
11-year-old daughter.
	   With two toddlers at home, James Newman has more to buy, too,
even though he was busy wrapping Christmas presents right up until
the crew's Dec. 4 launch.
	   The six astronauts were enjoying a break following Sunday's
release of the 77-foot international space station, which trailed
the shuttle by more than 300 miles Monday night.
	   Flight controllers in Houston and Moscow monitored the station,
as they will throughout its expected 15-year lifetime.
	   Power was being provided by the Russian-built control module
Zarya. Communications were being handled by Unity, the
American-made chamber.
	   The astronauts connected Zarya and Unity, which had never before
touched, and wired them together by hand. They also attached
antennas, tools and handrails for future crews.
	   The next construction team is due to arrive in May.
	   Shuttle commander Robert Cabana said the mission seemed, at
times, surreal.
	   ``We kept pinching ourselves and saying it can't be real, it's
going so well and everything is so right and it just looks so
good,'' he told reporters. ``Yeah, there was a little sense of
unreality about it.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ Sophie Marceau edged out Sharon Stone for vixen in
the next James Bond movie, Le Parisien reported Monday.
	   The 32-year-old French actress has starred in ``Braveheart,''
``Anna Karenina'' and ``Firelight.'' She also appears in fragrance
adds.
	   Marceau will play the evil Electra to Pierce Brosnan's Bond.
	   Le Parisien said Marceau beat out Stone for the part and signed
her contract with MGM studios last week.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Fire destroyed the roof and top
floor of Earl Spencer's house on Monday after lightning struck its
thatched roof, firemen said.
	   About a dozen firemen and three fire engines were at the house
of Spencer, brother to the late Princess Diana, at 7 p.m. local
time.
	   Spencer, a member of the British aristocracy, and his children
were not home when the fire started, but returned soon after. They
left the premises again, according to the fireman, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   ``Half of the top of the house is gone. It looks pretty bad,''
the fireman said.
	   The home is located in Constantia, one of Cape Town's plushest
residential areas.
	   ___
	   BEVERLY HILLS, California (AP) _ Not a day goes by that Barbara
Sinatra doesn't think about her late husband.
	   ``I miss him every day. He was my strength,'' she said Saturday,
on what would have been Frank Sinatra's 83rd birthday. ``These past
months have been difficult but I am doing my best to adjust.''
	   She and Frank Sinatra Jr. are organizing her husband's charity
golf tournament at Westin Mission Hills Resort to benefit the
Barbara Sinatra Children's Center at Eisenhower Medical Center in
Rancho Mirage.
	   Sinatra died of a heart attack May 14.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ William Ginsburg, who met a burst of publicity
as one of Monica Lewinsky's lawyers during the investigation of
President Clinton, says the case took quite a personal toll.
	   ``I am suffering from post-traumatic-stress syndrome from this
case,'' Ginsburg said in the Dec. 21 issue of The New Yorker
magazine. ``It took me months to recover.''
	   The Lewinsky case made him lose touch with his values and his
ability to focus on trial work, Ginsburg said in an article
retelling the events of the past year from his perspective.
	   Ginsburg, who has returned to his practice in Los Angeles, was
asked to help Ms. Lewinsky by her father, Bernard Lewinsky, in
January.
	   He became immediately visible on talk shows, often criticizing
independent counsel Kenneth Starr. He departed Ms. Lewinsky's legal
team on June 2.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says he is offended by
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's criticism of Donald Trump's
plans for a skyscraper near the United Nations.
	   ``That was sort of a knee-jerk reaction to criticize the city,''
Giuliani was quoted as saying in the Daily News on Sunday. ``I
would suspect that if I had a knee-jerk reaction just to criticize
the U.N. without checking, he would be offended by that.''
	   Giuliani's comment came after Annan was quoted as saying that
Trump's planned 72-story apartment tower would cast a ``colossal
shadow'' over the East Side of Manhattan.
	   ``As someone who lives and works in the neighborhood, he's
concerned that the building might be out of scale,'' Annan
spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   The mayor said he was most angered that Annan ``never bothered
to check'' how the city approves skyscrapers before making his
comments.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ South Africa native Charlize Theron was born to
play opposite a cuddly 15-foot-tall (5-meter) gorilla in the remake
of ``Mighty Joe Young.''
	   ``I chased and chased after this part because it reminded me so
much of my own life,'' Theron said in Sunday's Daily News. ``I was
an only child raised on a farm in South Africa. I entertained
myself through my relationships with animals, particularly my pet
goat, Bok. He used to sleep with me in my bed.''
	   The 23-year-old actress whose film credits include ``That Thing
You Do,'' ``The Devil's Advocate'' and ``Celebrity'' was a Milan
model and aspiring ballet dancer before moving to Hollywood.
	   Theron's South African accent was seen as a liability by casting
agents. She said she got rid of it ``by leaving the TV on 24 hours
a day. A constant diet of `The Love Boat' and `Dallas' will do the
trick.''
	   ___
	   BANGALORE, India (AP) _ Last year, red pepper trader Karim Abbas
married his wife atop an elephant. This year, wishing a memorable
wedding for his younger brother too, Abbas had him married in an
airborne helicopter.
	   On Sunday, thousands of residents of Alipur village in India's
southern state of Karnataka who had never seen a helicopter before,
gathered to watch the ``bird'' descend on a dry farm field.
	   The groom and bride took off in a helicopter, accompanied by two
Islamic priests, who administered the vows during the 20-minute
flight.
	   ``It was such an extraordinary feeling that words fail me,''
said Zamin Abbas, the groom.
	   The Abbas family could not afford the normal rates for hiring a
helicopter, but the owner reduced the price because of the novelty
of the wedding.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   IRVINE, California (AP) _ Some might say 11-year-old Thomas
Michon is the Frank Lloyd Wright of Lego builders _ with a little
Stephen King thrown in for good measure.
	   The Irvine boy won first place in the Lego national championship
over the weekend by creating a Godzilla-like monster with flapping
wings attacking cars on a bridge.
	   The effort won him a trip to the Legoland theme park, scheduled
to open in March in Carlsbad. There, he'll be presented with a
statue in his likeness made of the interlocking plastic bricks.
	   ``I think I may end up with a job building things,'' said the
boy, who has been playing with Lego bricks since he was 3. At age
5, he won the Lego World Cup in Denmark.
	   He spends about 20 hours each week building things from the
nearly 80,000 Lego pieces in his collection. He also plays
baseball, computer games and the violin.

Fourteen civilians killed in fighting in army clash with

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, (AP) _ Weekend fighting between the army and leftist
rebels killed at least 14 civilians, including five children _ many
apparently victims of rockets and strafing by military aircraft.
	   Three soldiers also died and 13 were wounded in combat that
began Saturday as troops pursued units from the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, in the northeastern state of Arauca,
the military said Monday.
	   The army said fighting continued Monday in the area, 200 miles
(325 kilometers) from Bogota, but provided no details.
	   Local human rights workers and municipal officials said
residents blamed the civilian deaths on strafing and bombardments
Sunday in support of army troops in the village of Santo Domingo.
	   The mayor of the nearby town of Tame, Luis Ramon Marquez, said
residents who left their houses Sunday morning to show military
helicopter pilots they weren't guerrillas but civilians were cut
down by military gunfire.
	   ``What the people are saying, and they're saying it with much
certainty, is that they were in the middle of the village of Santo
Domingo and a plane dropped a bomb on the civilian population,''
Marquez told the Radionet network, adding that the dead included
five children.
	   Marquez said that he also understood rebels had sought shelter
in civilian homes.
	   The army accused the rebels of putting civilians in the line of
fire.
	   ``If they were victims of our rockets, it's because they were
outside of their homes, shooting or being used as human shields, ''
Air Force commander Hector Fabio Velasquez told a news conference
Monday.
	   ``It's difficult to know at any given moment whether I'm
shooting at a civilian or at a guerrilla, because we're in the
dense jungle and they're firing in all directions, from where there
are civilians,'' said army commander Gen. Alfredo Mora Rangel.
	   Red Cross officials confirmed the civilian casualties, but did
not comment on which side was to blame.

Japan corporate bankruptcies fall for first time in 18 months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese corporate bankruptcies fell 4.6 percent in
November from a year earlier, the first drop in 18 months, a
private credit research agency said.
	   But the good news was likely to be temporary given the
deterioration of the economy and corporate earnings, Teikoku
Databank Ltd. said Monday.
	   Credit risk remains extremely high and funding pressures at the
end of this year and the close of the fiscal year in March may
prompt another surge in corporate failures, Teikoku said.
	   Debts left behind by insolvent companies in November tumbled
67.8 percent to 649.72 billion yen (U.S. dlrs 5.62 billion), the
agency said. There were a total of 1,360 bankruptcies for the
month.
	   Teikoku said government efforts to ease the credit crunch
afflicting small and medium-sized companies, including a loan
guarantee plan introduced in October, caused business failures to
drop.
	   The bankruptcy figures came on the heels of a Bank of Japan
quarterly business survey that showed confidence at the country's
recession-hit small and medium-sized manufacturers has fallen to a
record low.
	   Confidence at major Japanese manufacturers also continued to
erode, falling to its worst level since February 1994, the central
bank's ``tankan'' survey, released Monday, showed.

Snyder says Russia, Eastern Europe needs continued U.S. help
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; dlphfon &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LITTLE ROCK (AP) _ A week-and-half trip to Russia and Eastern
Europe proved the need for continued American involvement in
building fledgling democracies, Rep. Vic Snyder, D-Ark., said
Monday.
	   Snyder and four other Democrats on the House National Security
Committee returned from the fact-finding trip last week. They met
with Russian officials in St. Petersburg, visited with United
States troops in Bosnia and talked with Czechoslovakian leaders
about their desire to join NATO.
	   In all three areas, the threat to the United States was the
same.
	   ``The threat to us is instability,'' Snyder said. ``So that
market economy needs to be nurtured and stabilized...and in Russia,
helping them safeguard their nuclear materials, that has to be a
priority to us.''
	   Were he a legislator in Czechoslovakia, Snyder said, he would
support the bid to join the military alliance originally exclusive
to Western European and North American nations.
	   But the Czech military has inadequate training, different
equipment and more of a top-down chain of command than most NATO
members, Snyder said.
	   Snyder said morale among troops in Bosnia appeared to be good.
He also said the troops need to remain there for an indefinite
time.
	   ``It's clearly not the time to remove them now,'' Snyder said.
``They're doing very, very well at stopping the bloodshed that was
going on. But things such as the resettlement of refugees still has
a long way to go. ...The hard work of nation building is more
problematic.''
	   The delegation was in St. Petersburg during local elections,
which Snyder said were both troubling and encouraging.
	   ``In the days leading up to it, the Mafia was involved in the
election in a major way,'' Snyder said. ``Money and vodka was being
used to buy votes, there was intimidation, an assassination....sham
candidates being put on ballots.... just a tremendous effort made
to thwart the reformers of democracy.''
	   But in a relatively high voter turnout, ``all the Mafia
candidates where defeated. It was interpreted as a tremendous boost
forward for democracy,'' Snyder said.
	   Snyder said he noticed that frustrations with the United States
were high among some Russian officials. One of the concerns of
those he talked with was the possibility of the Czech Republic,
Hungary and Polland joining NATO. Russians also had opposing views
about the United State's role in Bosnia, he said.

Gene therapy builds strong muscles in laboratory mouse study
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Injecting new genes into aging muscles can
restore youthful vigor and strength, according to a laboratory
study of mice. But researchers caution that many safety questions
must be resolved before they can try the therapy on humans.
	   Old mice gained 27 percent of the muscle lost to age when they
were injected with a gene that prompts muscle cell growth, the
researchers at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center said
Monday.
	   For younger mice, the gain was about 15 percent, said Dr. H. Lee
Sweeney, the study's senior author.
	   Before the technique is ready for humans, however, there are
both ethical and safety questions to be resolved, Sweeney said. For
athletes, he said, the injections could be the ``perfect
performance enhancer.''
	   ``You build muscle mass and strength even without exercise,''
said Sweeney. ``And it is not detectable in the blood.''
	   Olympic athletes are routinely tested for drugs that
artificially improve strength and performance. Most such drugs are
now outlawed.
	   The safety issue arises because the same gene that causes
muscles to grow can also cause the overgrowth of unwanted cells.
	   ``Abnormal growth could be a health risk,'' said Sweeney. ``For
instance, you wouldn't want your heart to grow larger.''
	   Nonetheless, the experimental gene therapy offers the promise of
correcting one of the major problems of aging _ muscle feebleness,
the researcher said.
	   Some experts estimate that humans lose 10 percent of their
muscle strength and mass each decade after the age of 50. Weakness
from old age can cause falls, broken bones and loss of the ability
to walk or care for oneself.
	   This feebleness may be caused because the muscles stop making a
protein called insulin-like growth factor-1, or IGF-1, which causes
new cells to grow,
	   In muscle tissue, that protein sends a signal to satellite
cells, which are immature cells within the muscle tissue. The
signal turns the satellite cells into functional muscle cells,
which then replace damaged or weaken tissue.
	   Without the IGF-1 signal, muscle cells that wear out or become
injured are not replaced and a person becomes weaker.
	   To deliver the growth factor gene, the researchers used what is
called an adeno-associated virus. The scientists first stripped the
virus of any genes that would cause disease, then inserted the gene
for the growth factor.
	   When it was injected into mouse muscle, the altered virus
quickly infected nearby cells, delivering the growth factor gene
but causing no other infection.
	   Once in place, the new gene caused the muscles to make IGF-1,
which, in turn, led to more muscles.
	   But the therapy worked only in the muscles directly receiving
the injection. It would thus be ``cumbersome'' and take scores of
injections to treat each muscle in the body, the researcher said.
	   ``Instead, you would inject only into the muscles necessary for
walking or other daily functions,'' said Sweeney. ``For the
majority of the elderly population, the border line between being
able to walk or not can be dealt with by targeting key muscle
groups.''
	   The experimental gene therapy next will be tested on rabbits and
then on monkeys. Even if those studies go smoothly, Sweeney said,
it will be at least two years before the gene therapy is ready for
human experiments.
	   The researchers would first like to use the technique on
patients with a mild form of muscular dystrophy, said Sweeney.
	   But Dr. Leon Charash of Cornell University, a prominent
researcher in muscular diseases and a medical adviser to the
Muscular Dystrophy Association, said he doubted the gene therapy
would have much effect on muscular dystrophy.
	   ``It might enhance the strength of the aging population,'' he
said. ``But that will have to be very cautiously done.''
	   A previous experimental use of IGF-1 injections to treat Lou
Gehrig's disease resulted in no side effects but also no dramatic
benefits. Lou Gehrig's disease includes degeneration of the nervous
system and muscle weakness.
	   Sweeney presented his study at a San Francisco meeting of the
American Society for Cell Biology. The study is to appear next week
in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a
scientific journal.

Back to the practice field for 13-1 Broncos
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AARON J. LOPEZ &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Shannon Sharpe wasn't going to catch his usual
afternoon movie, and John Mobley wasn't going to catch up on his
cherished sleep.
	   Like the rest of the working world, the Denver Broncos finally
had a reason to hate Monday.
	   With their 18-game winning streak a thing of the past, the
Broncos (13-1) held their first Monday practice since Dec. 8, 1997
_ the day after they lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers.
	   ``We haven't done this in a while,'' said running back Derek
Loville. ``It's weird. It's something we're not going to get used
to. This is the last Monday.''
	   As an incentive, Denver coach Mike Shanahan allows players to
work out at their leisure on Mondays following a victory. He also
gives them the luxury of practicing in baseball caps instead of
helmets during Friday's practice.
	   ``A lot of guys _ because it hadn't happened in such a long time
_ kind of forgot what the schedule was like,'' Sharpe said. ``They
had to call in and get the information.''
	   The New York Giants altered Denver's schedule with a 20-16 upset
Sunday in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
	   New York's victory prevented the Broncos from becoming the first
National Football League team to win 19 straight games _ postseason
and regular-season combined _ and ended Denver's bid to join the
1972 Miami Dolphins (17-0) as the only team to construct a perfect
season.
	   ``Life goes on,'' Shanahan said. ``In my wildest dreams, I never
even thought about an undefeated season.
	   ``It's kind of a wake-up call where we say, `Hey, that's over
with. What are we made of? How do we bounce back?' We'll get a
chance to see in the near future.''
	   The Broncos had been living dangerously even before the New York
loss, playing sloppy, turnover-filled games against San Diego and
Kansas City.
	   Their luck ran out Sunday when they couldn't run out the clock
in the final minutes and then watched as Amani Toomer caught a
37-yard touchdown pass from Kent Graham with 48 seconds remaining.
	   Denver cornerback Tito Paul, who had good coverage on Toomer,
still had trouble shaking the memory more than 24 hours later.
	   ``Without question, that was the low point in my career,'' Paul
said. ``You don't understand the magnitude of that play. I'm
running that play over and over in my head.''
	   Paul is not alone. Shanahan took the blame for poor play calls
and could not explain why the Broncos bogged down inside the
20-yard line, settling for three field goals on three trips inside
the red zone.
	   Entering Sunday, Denver had scored 36 touchdowns on 57 trips
inside the 20.
	   Having clinched home-field throughout the playoffs, the Broncos
have little to lose over the season's final two weeks.
	   Monday night's game at Miami, once billed as a clash of
perfection past and perfection present, has primary importance only
for the Dolphins (9-5), who are trying to secure a playoff spot.

Netanyahu: Palestinians must take more steps before withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Clinton-Mideast &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday
that the Palestinians must carry out further steps before he will
approve a further withdrawal in the West Bank. He also said he will
not give in to any U.S. pressure.
	   ``We are not susceptible to pressure. We will do what is
right,'' Netanyahu declared. ``We expect the Palestinians to keep
all the provisions, and no amount of pressure is going to change
this.''
	   Netanyahu spoke in a post-midnight interview with The Associated
Press after a day in which U.S. President Bill Clinton honored
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat with a visit and endorsed the
``legitimate rights'' of Palestinians.
	   The Israeli leader praised the Palestine National Council's vote
Monday to reaffirm that anti-Israel provisions in its national
charter were null and void.
	   But he listed a series of steps the Palestinians must take in
order to meet their obligations under the Wye River accord and set
the stage for a further Israeli withdrawal.
	   These included an end to violence in the West Bank, a reduction
in the size of the Palestinian police force, the collection of
illegal weapons and a retraction of threats by Palestinians leaders
to declare a state next May.
	   ``I'm glad they did the first thing. They have to do the other
things. There will be a withdrawal as soon as they complete all
their obligations,'' he said.
	   ``The fact the Palestinians kept one out of a half-dozen major
provisions doesn't entitle them not to keep the other parts.''
	   Netanyahu said he would raise the issue of further Palestinian
compliance when he met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Clinton at the Erez border checkpoint in Gaza later Tuesday.
	   He refused to say if he would seek a delay in the next stage of
withdrawal from Clinton and Arafat. Netanyahu is facing a critical
vote in the Knesset next Monday that could determine the fate of
his government, and many believe he cannot carry out the pullback
and keep his shaky coalition intact.
	   Netanyahu, who narrowly avoided defeat in the Knesset last week,
said he would not shy away from elections. ``If we need them, we
will have them. I don't fear elections,'' he declared.
	   Sitting in the Cabinet room at the prime ministry, Netanyahu
criticized Clinton's remarks Monday in Gaza comparing the children
of jailed Palestinians to Israeli children who lost their fathers
in attacks.
	   ``There's a world of difference between the children of the
murderers who are in jail and the children of those who are
murdered,'' Netanyahu said. ``These murderers, some of them
murdered children.''
	   ``The last thing we should do is make any parallelism between
the murderers and their victims ...,'' he said.
	   Clinton told the Palestine National Council meeting in the Gaza
Strip that he had been touched by the encounters with Israeli and
Palestinian children during his visit. ``Those children brought
tears to my eyes. We have to find a way for both sets of children
to get their lives back and to go forward,'' he said.
	   The issue of releasing Palestinian prisoners has stirred
powerful emotions on both sides, and Netanyahu showed no signs of
giving ground on the issue.
	   ``Believe me, it's a very emotional issue for me,'' he told the
AP. ``I don't release terrorist murderers. I don't care what their
views are. They're not in there for their political views. They're
in jail because they murdered people.''

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The Government warned Monday that
counterfeit versions of 38 drugs are being sold in pharmacies and
hospitals across the country.
	   The Health Ministry is advising consumers to be wary of a wide
variety of products from simple headache remedies to antibiotics
and drugs for hypertension, said Kadu Machado, spokesman for the
Rio state health ministry.
	   The list of fraudulently packaged drugs issued this week follows
recent scandals involving phony birth control pills and falsely
labeled cancer drugs found to contain only water.
	   Oscar Berro, director of the lab which analyzed the phony
medicines, said most of the drugs analyzed were diluted to only 30
percent of their strength. Others had no medicinal value at all.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ President-elect Hugo Chavez embarks on
a four-day trip Tuesday to Brazil, Argentina and Colombia to try to
promote integration in the region.
	   Chavez, 44, the leader of a failed 1992 coup attempt who won a
landslide victory Dec. 6, said Monday he hopes the trip will change
the image his political opponents spread depicting him as a violent
dictator-in-waiting.
	   On Tuesday, Chavez will meet with Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso in Brasilia before heading to Buenos Aires to meet
with Argentine President Carlos Menem and Chilean President Eduardo
Frei.
	   On Thursday, Chavez travels to Colombia where he will meet with
Colombian President Andres Pastrana.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The search continued Monday above the Sierra
Madre Occidental range for a reporter who failed to return from a
planned 11-day mountain hike in western Mexico.
	   Philip True, a Mexico City-based reporter for the San Antonio
Express-News, headed into the mountain range in Jalisco state on
Nov. 29 to photograph and write about the region's Huichol Indians.
	   He last was seen around Dec. 1 in Tuxpan, Jalisco, 370 miles
(590 kms) northwest of Mexico City.
	   The Sierra de los Huicholes, as the area is known, is extremely
remote, with few roads and telephone service only in some larger
towns. The region is marked by deep canyons, some not adequately
marked on maps.
	   ___
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ The leftist rebel
Zapatista National Liberation Army has announced it will hold an
Indian rights referendum across Mexico early next year.
	   A rebel statement released Sunday in southern Chiapas state said
the ``Consultation on the Recognition of Indian People's Rights''
will take place March 21.
	   The poll will ask four questions: should Indians be actively
involved in building a ``new'' Mexico; should the Constitution
recognize their rights; should there be talks to reach a ``true''
peace settlement; and should the people demand that the government
``rule by obedience.''
	   Voting, to be open to all Mexicans ages 12 and over, will be
held a polling stations in urban areas.
	   The Zapatista rebels staged a brief armed uprising in January
1994 to demand greater rights and democracy for Chiapas'
impoverished Indians. Peace talks with the government have been
stalled since 1996.
	   ___
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ A group trying to help El
Salvador dispose of arms left over from its 1979-92 civil war
collected 300 weapons in a weekend drive, organizers said Monday.
	   El Salvadorans turned in submachine guns, mines and grenades in
exchange for food coupons, the Patriotic Movement Against Crime
said.
	   The independent group received money from the Norwegian
government and from other organizations for the trade-in drive. The
weapons collected over the weekend were delivered to the national
police.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A 29-year-old accused of shipping 10-15
kilograms (about 25 pounds) of heroin a week to U.S. cities will be
the first Colombian extradited to the United States under a
year-old law, police said Monday.
	   Jaime ``Jimmy'' Orlando Lara, who was arrested in Bogota on
Saturday night, headed a heroin distribution ring with outlets in
Houston, Miami and New York, said Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, the
national police director.
	   ``I think he will be the first Colombian-born person extradited
to the United States for drug trafficking because the evidence is
overwhelming,'' Serrano told reporters.
	   A December 1997 law restored extradition of Colombian citizens
for trial abroad. The country's 1991 constitution, enshrined during
a bloody war with the late Medellin drug cartel, had prohibited it.
	   The new law is not retroactive, however, meaning Colombians can
only be extradited for crimes committed after its enactment. Cali
cartel bosses Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez, who were captured in
1995 and are imprisoned in Colombia, were thereby exempt.
	   Had they been convicted in the United States, the two could have
expected to receive life sentences without the possibility of
parole. As it stands, both could be paroled in about 10 years.

Chile considers suspending arms contracts over Pinochet arrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ The government may suspend some of
Chile's multi-million dollar contracts to purchase arms from
Britain and Spain to protest the continued house arrest of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet.
	   Defense Minister Jose Florencio Guzman said Monday the
government considers the move necessary because it feels that the
arrest in London of Pinochet on a Spanish warrant left Chile
``without a judicial protection'' in those countries.
	   He said a commission of government officials and military
officers has been appointed to review Chile's contracts and decide
which ones should be suspended.
	   Chile insists Britain and Spain violated the immunity Pinochet
is entitled to as a member of the Chilean senate and argue he
should be tried at home.
	   Pinochet, wanted in Spain on genocide and torture charges, was
arrested in London on Oct. 16 while recovering from back surgery.
	   Britain's highest court ruled that the former dictator doesn't
have immunity, and the British government agreed to allow
proceedings to continue for his extradition to face prosecution in
Spain.

For country and career, some Chinese reverse brain drain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY192 &QL; 
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Michael Cao was doing fine in New York. He made
friends easily, found the city exciting, and thrived on the hectic
pace. But something stronger pulled him back to his home in China.
	   Just as he felt he was hitting a glass ceiling at the Manhattan
investment firm where he worked, Cao started to read about China's
stunning economic transformation.
	   ``There were limits to what I could do in the United States,''
Cao said recently in an interview in China. ``Here it's polluted,
it's crowded, the living conditions are not good. So what? I can do
what I want.''
	   People like Cao who return to China with advanced degrees from
abroad are just the beginning of a reversal of a serious brain
drain. Even though their numbers are small, they are becoming an
important force for changing China and bringing the outside world
closer to home.
	   Twenty years ago, senior leader Deng Xiaoping declared that
China's best students should pursue advanced degrees in the West.
They would become the intellectual propellant for the reforms that
launched China from communes and central planning toward markets
and laws.
	   Since then, more than 300,000 Chinese students, many from the
nation's top universities, have gone abroad to study, usually to
the United States.
	   Most have not rushed back to China. Of the 160,000 Chinese
students who have gone to the United States, less than 20 percent
are estimated to have returned.
	   The returnees are a prestigious lot, including a vice president
of elite Peking University, senior researchers at the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, and economists at the China Center for
Economic Research who advise Premier Zhu Rongji.
	   Others with less influential positions exert a more subtle
influence, bringing back experience with Western business and
personal freedoms.
	   It was a mix of career opportunity and patriotism that drew Cao
Jun, Michael Cao to his American friends, back to China two years
ago after pursuing a master's in business administration in New
York.
	   Cao, who specializes in mergers and acquisitions, went to work
for CITIC, the Chinese government's investment arm, after returning
from six years in the United States. He insists his experience
doesn't set him apart from his Chinese friends who are lawyers,
bankers and artists.
	   China has been rapidly tuning into Western ideas and lifestyles
through foreign movies, foreign fashion magazines in
Chinese-language editions and the growing use of the Internet.
	   ``I was amazed at the changes in China among my friends when I
got back,'' Cao said. Political pressure from above is less
intense, and ``they're a lot more open to new ideas.''
	   Zhang Jiansheng of the Western Returned Scholars Association, a
non-governmental group that has met in the same house near
Tiananmen Square since the 1920s, said the main draw is an
influential job.
	   ``Of course they don't enjoy luxury. They can't afford a house
or a car. But they enjoy their job. You cannot force them back, so
you have to attract them,'' he said.
	   Zhang predicted that in five to 10 years, people with degrees
from the United States would hold important positions in the
Chinese government, just as the technocrats trained in the Soviet
Union in the 1950s do now.
	   Through its web site, the association offers to help Chinese
academics abroad make professional links in China, or romantic ones
through a matchmaking service. Next spring it will sponsor its
first conference in the United States.
	   U.S. rules call for granting student visas only to people likely
to return to China.
	   But many find legal ways to avoid returning. Only 5 percent of
Chinese students are believed to abide by the terms of their
student visas and return after one year of work experience
following graduation, said a U.S. official speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   After Japan, China ranks No. 2 in the number of foreign students
in the United States.
	   Li Yifei graduated from the nation's college for diplomats
before leaving China at 21 to attend Baylor College in Waco, Texas.
	   While in the United States, Li met and married her husband, then
a fellow Chinese expatriate who now is an adviser to China's first
investment bank.
	   Li said that as a manager of the Beijing office of the public
relations company Burson-Marsteller, she has an advantage: She can
communicate easily with American business clients and has the trust
of influential Chinese contacts.
	   ``Chinese who go to study abroad are the risk takers,'' she
said.

Gulf of Aden port cashes in on Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD LEE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DJIBOUTI (AP) _ The border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea
has produced another windfall for Djibouti, a tiny former French
colony which derives three quarters of its annual income from its
port and related services.
	   Soon after hostilities broke out in early May, landlocked
Ethiopia transferred all its business from the Eritrean ports of
Assab and Massawa to Djibouti. During the following three months,
the port handled almost as much cargo as it did in the whole of
1997.
	   To the end of July, 117 more ships visited the port than during
the same period last year. The total volume of goods rose by 85
percent, while imports destined for Ethiopia jumped by 671 percent.
	   Strategically situated at the entrance to the Red Sea, Djibouti
has been trying for decades to establish its port as the most
efficient in the northeastern Africa.
	   Tens of million of dollars have been invested in the
construction of modern facilities, including berths for fuel
tankers and a specialized container terminal.
	   But the sudden surge in traffic caught the port unprepared.
	   ``It was very difficult in the beginning, '' said port general
manager Aden Ahmed Dwale. ``All of Ethiopia's shipping fleet was
suddenly diverted to Djibouti, and at the same time, we started
receiving hundreds of extra trucks. But things are now under
control.''
	   By hiring over a thousand additional workers and by operating 24
hours a day, the port has so far managed to cope, and
Ethiopia-bound goods move through relatively smoothly.
	   But some local importers have been adversely affected.
	   ``There is a delay of between one to two weeks for Djiboutian
importers because our shippers are all working 24 hours a day on
imports for Ethiopia,'' said Said Omar Musa, vice chairman of the
Djibouti International Chamber of Commerce. ``There are not enough
machines, and if you want to hire a truck, you have to put in an
order 90 days before.''
	   The trucks are the biggest headache. Before May, 60 trucks and
fuel tankers passed through every day.
	   The number has risen to 300, and there is nowhere for the trucks
to wait outside so they park inside, clogging up the port.
	   The problem is compounded by mountains of empty metal
containers. Ethiopia does not have a container terminal in its
capital, Addis Ababa, so the containers have to emptied in the port
and the cargo loaded manually into trucks.
	   In the next few months, 400,000 tons of fertilizer and grain _
much of it food aid for the World Food Program _ are expected, and
fears are growing that the port might seize up all together.
	   ``The system is working efficiently at the moment,'' said Judith
Lewis, WFP's country director for Ethiopia, ``but the crunch will
come in the next few months because there will be so many more
ships coming in.''
	   The port authorities are concerned, but they are confident that
major problems will be avoided.
	   Djibouti thrives on crises. In the early 1990s during the Gulf
War and Operation Restore Hope in neighboring Somalia, the port was
inundated with business.
	   The port, however, has been unable to capitalize on the
increased business brought in by crises. Once they are over, trade
always falls off dramatically.
	   Aden Ahmed Dwale is adamant that even if Ethiopia and Eritrea
settle their differences, the port of Djibouti will hang onto the
lion's share of Ethiopian trade.
	   ``This gives us the chance to reassert our historic role as
Ethiopia's main port,'' he said. ``Considering the size of Ethiopia
and its potential for economic growth, we hope that we will
eventually be handling 10 million tons a year.''
	   That will depend on how efficiently the port operates in the
short term and on how rapid and amicable the settlement is between
Ethiopia and Eritrea.

	   FREMONT, California (AP) _ It's been hailed as the bridge
between our physical world and the virtual life inside our
computers, and criticized as a cause of very sore wrists. The
inventor says it's just a nifty device.
	   The computer mouse turned 30 on Dec. 8.
	   Although it didn't start showing up on desks until the
mid-1980s, the mouse was first unveiled in public in 1968 at a
computer conference as the best ``pointing device'' to help
computer users interact with their machines. It beat out
trackballs, light pens and small tablets.
	   The stubby, tennis ball-size block with a button impressed those
at the conference. They liked the idea of a device outside a
computer that moves things around inside the computer.
	   The inventor, Douglas Engelbart, says he can't remember who
named it a mouse, but with its small, rodent-like shape and wire of
a tail, it certainly seemed fitting.
	   The mouse didn't make it big until it was attached in 1984 to
Apple Computer's Macintosh computers. From there it moved on to
work with Microsoft's Windows and virtually all other computers.
	   At Logitech, the world's largest maker of the mouse, chief
executive Guerrino De Luca is looking beyond pumping out 50 million
of the devices a year. He's dreaming of a mouseless world.
	   ``Someday the cursor on your screen will move with your eyes,''
he says.
	   Last year 90 million mice were produced, mostly in China and
Mexico, and sold around the world.
	   They've spawned an allied industry: mouse pads, designed to make
using a mouse smoother and more efficient. Companies of all kinds
put their logos on mouse pads and give them away as freebies, and
people have pictures of their children, cats and dogs printed on
them.
	   One unfortunate result of the mouse proliferation showed up soon
after the device made it to users' desks _ repetitive strain
injury. Office workers began to complain that their arms were in
constant pain. Doctors found that the problem _ often tendinitis
leading to carpal tunnel syndrome _ came from endlessly
manipulating the mouse.
	   In industrialized countries, repetitive strain injury resulting
from intensive work with computers is becoming a major cause of
disability, according to Jeanne Mager Stellman, a Columbia
University professor and editor of the Encyclopedia of Occupational
Health and Safety. More than 70 percent of sufferers are women.
	   The solution for Logitech and other smaller mouse sellers has
been to improve the shape of the device, De Luca says. These days,
the cutting-edge mice are shaped to cup comfortably in users'
hands, move more easily and at different angles.
	   The mouse has become an intrinsic part of our society. Children
know what mice are and what they do. Practically anyone who works
at a desk in this country reaches to touch it dozens of times a
day. Common users no longer stop to think about when they're using
one.
	   ``It's an instinctive gesture now,'' De Luca says. ``You see
something on the screen, and your hand moves.''
	   Engelbart, 73, who works out of Logitech's Fremont headquarters,
is a Silicon Valley pioneer who was part of a small group of
high-tech trailblazers at the Stanford Research Institute in the
late 1950s.
	   Throughout his career, he has added crucial technologies to the
computer world: the mouse, multiple windows, multi-tool
integration, 2-dimensional display editing, hypermedia and more.
	   Engelbart says he's excited that the mouse has become so
widespread. But he says that while he comes up with ways to make
computers easier to use, he really has much loftier concerns.
	   ``The real question I've been working these past 50 years on is
how to augment the human intellect through collective thinking,''
he says.

Funeral directors seek to lighten the mood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA NOONAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Making a living from death doesn't have to be
morbid. Take it from the National Funeral Directors Association.
	   At the industry's largest gathering of the year this past fall,
funeral directors said it's about time their profession overhaul
some outmoded rituals, personalize services and generally just
lighten up.
	   ``The image is the old, scary guy with cold hands,'' said Paul
Johnson of Bradshaw Funeral Cremation Services in St. Paul,
Minnesota. He said this year's theme, ``Revolutionize Your
Thinking,'' was timely.
	   ``We don't do cookie-cutter funerals,'' he told several hundred
attendees Monday. ``We ask, `How would you like your mom or spouse
to be remembered?' and take it from there.''
	   According to industry figures, more than 124,000 people are
employed by more than 21,000 funeral homes in the United States,
with the average funeral home handling 160 services annually.
	   The survival of small, family-owned funeral homes depends on
innovation and response to customer demand, directors say. Creating
a meaningful death ceremony should be as unique as celebrations of
birth or marriage.
	   Take, for example, the effort to personalize the service of a
Harley Davidson enthusiast. One of the man's five beloved bikes was
parked alongside his casket and one of his sons hopped on the bike
to lead the procession to the cemetery.
	   Another family that lost their 25-year-old son to a drug
overdose asked that the funeral chapel be decorated with the young
man's rock posters and glow-in-the-dark astronomy decals.
	   As a musical tribute, the parents asked Johnson to turn off the
lights and play their son's favorite Nine Inch Nails album. ``One
guest said to me later, `This is just like being in his bedroom,'''
Johnson said.
	   David Walkinshaw, owner of Saville and Grannan Funeral Home in
Arlington, also advised conventioneers _ in a seminar titled
``Putting All Your Eggs in One Casket?'' _ to abandon old-fashioned
approaches.
	   ``People can bring in their own caskets these days if they want
to,'' said the third-generation funeral director. ``Traditions are
breaking down and people are developing their own.''
	   Caskets are now available with a ``Fairway to Heaven'' golf
course motif, painted shamrocks or decorated with Renaissance-style
cherubs.
	   There's even the EnviroCasket _ a dlrs 195 box built from aspen
wood by Ontario-based Northern Casket Ltd. Ten dollars from each
purchase is donated toward a tree-growing program in Canada.
	   ``It's not about money, it's about helping people,'' said
Walkinshaw. ``It's a calling.''

Pinochet lawyers ask Britain's highest court to set aside judgment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs; court hearing scheduled to start 1030 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In a highly unusual move, lawyers for Gen. Augusto
Pinochet are asking Britain's highest court to set aside its own
ruling that denied him immunity from arrest, arguing that one of
the judges has close ties to Amnesty International.
	   A hearing, scheduled to last two days, opens Tuesday before a
five-judge tribunal at the House of Lords. It is the first time
since 1823, according to one report, that the court has been asked
to sit in judgment of itself. The previous challenge, involving a
land ownership case, failed.
	   The return of Pinochet's British lawyers to the Lords marks the
next step in a long legal battle by the 83-year-old former Chilean
dictator to avoid extradition to Spain on charges of murder and
torture during his 1973-90 rule.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in a hospital while recuperating
from back surgery. He is now under police guard at a rented mansion
at Wentworth, an exclusive residential estate 20 miles (30 kms)
west of London.
	   In a 3-2 decision, the Lords ruled Nov. 25 that Pinochet has no
immunity from prosecution under British law as a former head of
state.
	   One of the three who ruled against Pinochet was Lord Justice
Leonard Hoffmann, the unpaid director of the fundraising arm of
Amnesty International, the human rights group which has played a
key role in a long campaign to have Pinochet arrested.
	   Hoffmann, a native-born South African and opponent of apartheid,
settled in Britain in the 60s. His wife, Gillian, also a South
African, is a secretary in the London press office of Amnesty.
	   The human rights group says the Hoffmanns played no part in its
campaign to get Pinochet arrested. Pinochet's lawyers could have
found out before the hearing about the Amnesty link, it says.
	   As well as the attempt in the Lords, Pinochet's lawyers also
plan to challenge a British Cabinet member's decision to allow
Spain to try to extradite him.
	   London attorney Kingsley Napley said Monday he would ask
England's High Court to challenge Home Secretary Jack Straw's
approval of the Spanish extradition request.
	   Such applications normally contend a decision was wrong in law
or that Straw did not properly exercise discretionary powers.
	   An official Chilean report says 3,197 people, including
Spaniards, were murdered or disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's
secret police after he overthrew an elected Marxist in a violent
coup. Chile wants Pinochet freed, partly because he is a
senator-for-life in the new democratic government built on
compromise.
	   On Monday, Chile said it will suspend some arms deals with
Britain and Spain. A commission has been appointed to choose
projects.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks fall in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen early
Tuesday amid worries over a move in the U.S. Congress to impeach
President Bill Clinton and weakness on Wall Street. Japanese stock
prices fell.
	   The dollar bought 115.52 yen in early trading, down 0.10 yen
from Monday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 115.49
yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 22.73 points,
or 0.16 percent, to 14,088.04 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Monday, the average closed down 294.02 points, or 2.04
percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar remained under some selling
pressure amid increasing concern over whether Clinton will be
impeached, traders said.
	   The U.S. House of Representatives was slated to hold a special
session Thursday to vote on an impeachment recommendation.
	   Also weighing on the dollar was weakness on Wall Street, where
the Dow Jones industrial average fell 126.16 points Monday to close
at 8,695.60 on earnings disappointment and weakening technology
shares.
	   Traders also continued to fret about the financial health of
Brazil and other Latin American economies.
	   Besides the overnight fall on Wall Street, the Tokyo stock
market turned bearish following worse-than-expected business
sentiment among Japanese companies reported by Japan's central bank
on Monday.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section shed 5.59 points, or 0.51 percent, to 1,094.72
points. The TOPIX closed down 17.85 points, or 1.60 percent, the
day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 1.270 percent, unchanged from Monday's
finish. Its price remained at 104.49 yen.

Ashes of woman killed by bat will be returned to Switzerland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The ashes of an Australian woman who
died after being bitten by a bat will be scattered in her homeland
of Switzerland, her family said Tuesday.
	   Monique Todhunter, 37, died in Mackay Base Hospital in Queesland
state on Sunday from Australian Bat Lyssavirus, a rabies-like virus
which causes the brain to swell.
	   Health authorities said Todhunter was bitten by an infected
fruit bat two years ago. The virus had lain dormant in her system
and became active two weeks ago.
	   She is only the second person in Australia to die from the
virus.
	   In 1996, bat handler Patricia Paget died in Rockhampton,
Queensland, after being scratched by an infected fruit bat, also
known as flying foxes because of their fox-like heads.
	   Mackay is about 497 miles (800 kms) north of the Queensland
capital Brisbane. Rockhampton is about 310 miles (500 kms) north of
Brisbane.
	   Clint Todhunter said Tuesday his wife could have been saved by
an Australian dollars 700 (U.S. dlrs 434) course of vaccinations
but they did not think it necessary.
	   ``Even when (Paget) died of lyssavirus we didn't worry because
we thought if Monique had it she would already be sick,'' Clint
Todhunter told the Courier-Mail newspaper.
	   Todhunter was bitten as she tried to remove a bat which had
landed on the back of a young girl at a party in 1996.

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (CP) _ RCMP officers are sifting through hundreds of
Canadian visas, citizenship cards and immigration forms seized from
arrested Russian and Asian mobsters.
	   The Mounties also seized about 7,000 credit cards in various
stages of manufacture and a plate used to make government of Canada
cheques in a series of raids last week.
	   ``We think thousands of people in Toronto have been hit and they
don't know it,'' said Cpl. Stephen Fedor.
	   Fedor said officers and bank investigators are poring over two
truckfuls of materials seized from 18 raids last week. Seven people
have been charged with 65 offences.
	   Officers also seized hundreds of Ontario driver licences, social
insurance cards and passports from several countries.
	   ``We've got the motherlode here,'' Fedor said. ``Its
unbelievable the setup these people had.''
	   Fedor said a manufactured credit card, using legitimate card
numbers, would sell for about $500.
	   He said police suspect some of the immigration visas and
citizenship cards were used by organized crime members to enter
Canada.
	   ``We're talking about members of Russian and Asian organized
crime,'' Fedor said. ``The Russians skimmed the numbers and the
Asians manufactured the cards.''
	   He said the gold and platinum card numbers were obtained from a
network of gas station and restaurant employees who ``double
swiped'' cards upon payment.
	   The card would be swiped once on a legitimate machine and again
on a hidden laptop computer, whose disks were collected nightly.
	   ``The employees were paid up to $20 for every credit card number
they obtained,'' Fedor said. (Toronto Sun)

Kosovo border clash leaves dozens of ethnic Albanians dead

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A tenuous standoff between Serbian
forces and separatist rebels in Kosovo exploded in violence Monday
in the worst clash since an October truce _ a five-hour gunbattle
in which border guards killed dozens of guerrillas.
	   The pre-dawn clash along Kosovo's southwestern border with
Albania resulted in Yugoslav army troops killing 30 ethnic
Albanians and wounding 12 who were trying to enter the country
illegally, the Serb-run Media Center reported.
	   Sources at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which sent a team to the site, said 31 ethnic Albanians had
been killed, including one woman. Nine others were taken prisoner,
two of whom were wounded, the sources said on condition their names
not be used.
	   In other violence, the OSCE sources said assailants opened fire
Monday in a Serb-run bar in the western Kosovo city of Pec, killing
four Serbs and wounding five others. It was unclear whether the
attack was ethnically motivated, however, because the gunmen
escaped.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said two ``masked
terrorists,'' a term authorities use for the ethnic Albanian
rebels, entered the bar and fired automatic weapons.
	   The worst reported violence in Kosovo in more than two months
casts further gloom on the diplomatic efforts to bring a lasting
peace to the Serbian province, where many believe a resumption of
full-scale fighting by spring is inevitable.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since an Oct. 12
peace agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke halted
months of fighting in the separatist province in southern Serbia,
the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   William Walker _ the U.S. diplomat who heads the OSCE's
still-forming peace monitoring force, Kosovo Verification Mission _
condemned the violence.
	   The killing, he said, ``can only lead to a spiral of retribution
that will stand in the way of a reasonable political solution much
needed in this region.''
	   Holbrooke is expected in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade for
talks Tuesday with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. In
Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley said Holbrooke
would ``drive home'' to Milosevic ``the need for progress on the
negotiating front.''
	   After two months of failed shuttle diplomacy, chances of
mediating an end to the continuing violence in Kosovo seem
unlikely.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule, while the rebels say they won't
accept anything short of independence. Serbia, meanwhile, refuses
to consider anything more than partial autonomy for the
Albanian-majority province.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who met with ethnic Albanian
negotiators in Pristina on Monday and who also plans to be in
Belgrade on Tuesday, has seen his proposals for a political
settlement rejected by both sides.
	   Hours after the pre-dawn battle, ethnic Albanian sources said
heavy detonations and shootings were heard from the area of three
nearby villages, about 45 miles southwest of Pristina, that had
been sealed off by Serb police.
	   The report by the Media Center, which has generally proved
reliable, said armed ethnic Albanians were trying to enter Kosovo
from Albania when the shootout erupted at 2 a.m. Monday near
Gorozup and Liken, southwest of Pristina.
	   Yugoslav soldiers confiscated arms and other material that the
Albanians were trying to smuggle in, the Media Center report said.
The rebels have frequently armed themselves in neighboring Albania.
	   Municipal authorities in nearby Prizren were quoted as saying
that all those killed and wounded were wearing camouflage uniforms
with the insignia of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. Eight
Albanians were killed in a border clash near the same area on Dec.
3.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
were left homeless after Milosevic launched a crackdown against
separatist rebels in February.
	   Meanwhile, a delegation of Kosovo Serbs arrived in Pristina to
plead with international peace monitors to find loved ones who
disappeared five months ago.
	   About 50 Serbs met with Gabriel Keller, deputy head of the
2,000-strong OSCE peace mission.
	   Keller received a list of the missing people whom the Serbs
believe were kidnapped by KLA rebels, and promised the OSCE would
``try its best to find traces of the missing.''

Prosecution brings stained mattress into Malaysian courtroom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prosecutors in the high-profile
trial of Malaysia's jailed former No. 2 leader brought a
semen-stained mattress into the courtroom Tuesday for use as
evidence of the defendant's alleged illegal sexual activities.
	   Prompted by curiosity about the well-publicized exhibit, many
people peeked into the courtroom to catch a glimpse of the
mattress, which was wrapped in brown paper and tied with rope,
leaning against one wall.
	   Prosecutors are trying to prove that Anwar Ibrahim had sex with
the wife of his former secretary and that he tried to abuse his
powers as deputy prime minister of the Southeast Asian country to
cover up sexual trysts.
	   The mattress was seized by police in July from an apartment in a
posh Kuala Lumpur suburb which Anwar is accused of using for secret
rendezvous with sex partners.
	   It had been sent for testing to police laboratories along with
blood samples from Anwar for DNA analysis. The results of those
tests have not been disclosed to the court.
	   Anwar, sacked in September, currently faces abuse of power
charges and will be tried separately for allegedly having engaged
in illegal sex acts.
	   He has denied all the charges against him, saying they were
cooked up to eliminate the challenge he posed to Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year-rule.
	   The prosecution's case depends heavily on testimony from Ummi
Hafilda Ali, the sister of Anwar's former secretary, and Azizan Abu
Bakar, a former driver in the politician's household.
	   While Ummi has accused Anwar of sleeping with her brother's
wife, Shamsidar Taharin, driver Azizan has claimed he was
repeatedly sodomized by Anwar.
	   Azizan and Ummi made the accusations in letters sent last year
to Prime Minister Mahathir. The pair retracted their allegations
after being arrested by police, but later said they were forced to
do so.

Hyundai chief visits North Korea to discuss business ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The owner of South Korea's largest
industrial conglomerate crossed the heavily armed border into North
Korea Tuesday to discuss tourism and other business opportunities
in the reclusive communist country.
	   Chung Ju-yung, 84, accompanied by several aides, walked into
North Korea through the neutral village of Panmunjom inside the
demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas. It was his third
visit to the North so far this year.
	   ``I have many things to discuss,'' the founder of the Hyundai
group told reporters before crossing the border.
	   Hyundai launched unprecedented sightseeing cruise tours of
Diamond Mountain, a scenic attraction on the North's east coast, on
Nov. 18.
	   Nearly 6,000 South Koreans have visited the mountain under the
largest inter-Korea joint venture since the Korean peninsula was
divided into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945.
	   In return for the right to organize the tours, Hyundai must pay
North Korea dlrs 906 million over the next six years.
	   During his four-day visit this week, Chung will follow up other
joint venture projects discussed earlier, including a thermal power
plant, a car assembly plant and an industrial park, Hyundai
officials said.

Investigators probing wide range of causes of Swiss Air crash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Canadian investigators are still studying a wide
range of possible causes for the crash of Swissair 111, from
insulation damage to anomalies in electronic systems, a spokesman
said Monday.
	   ``It's impossible to point the finger at anything right now,''
said Jim Harris in a telephone interview from Dartmouth, Nova
Scotia, offices of the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. He
noted that board chairman Benoit Bouchard has said it might take
two years to determine the cause.
	   The MD-11 crashed off the coast of Canada on a flight from New
York to Geneva on Sept. 2, killing all 229 people aboard.
	   There were four different types of wiring on the aircraft with
different insulations, all of which showed heat damage, Harris
added. Insulation was cracked or otherwise damaged or had
disappeared altogether, Harris added.
	   Reconstruction of the jet's nose section offers hope of
pinpointing the problem, but that will take time because of the
difficulty of recovering pieces from that section from the
seafloor, he said.
	   About 85 percent of the plane has been recovered, but only 50
percent of the front section has been brought up. A dragger is
still pulling up bits of debris from the floor of St. Margaret's
Bay.
	   Although some larger pieces have been recovered from other
sections of the plane, most of the pieces from the nose section are
small.
	   ``We don't have very many pieces that are bigger than a
handkerchief,'' said Harris. ``This aircraft hit with a lot of
energy. It broke up into a lot of small pieces.''
	   He noted that the investigators have found signs of intense heat
in the ceiling area above the cockpit, in front of and behind the
bulkhead separating the cockpit from the cabin.
	   One of the indications is a small piece of molten aluminum,
which means that the temperature reached the melting point of
aluminum _ 660.45 degrees Celsius (1,220.81 Fahrenheit) _ in one
area of the bulkhead.
	   ``Once we've got that nose section nearer completion we might
have a better idea of what we're looking for, but right now we're
looking at virtually everything,'' he said.
	   Harris said one area still puzzling investigators is that the
flight data recorders show nothing abnormal occurring for nearly 10
minutes after the pilots first reported smoke in the cockpit.
	   ``The first indication on the flight recorders that there's a
problem occurs 90 seconds before they stop,'' he said. Then the
data started to show more and more errors.
	   Harris said that because of the missing data, the investigators
are trying different methods to determine what happened. They've
painted pieces of aluminum with primer and baked them at different
temperatures to see the color change.
	   ``We can determine what the pattern of that heat is. If we know
what is the source of that heat we can maybe tell what caused it.''
	   He noted the investigators also found a problem with the two
forward doors into the passenger section on MD-11 aircraft. Unlike
other aircraft doors, these open inward and then stow upward in the
ceiling. Over time, they chafe wiring insulation around them. As a
result of the Canadian findings, last week the U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration issued a directive that the wiring be
inspected and repaired where necessary.

Jockeys arrested for allegedly fixing horse races in Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Anti-corruption officials in Hong Kong said
Tuesday that they have arrested 12 people, including several former
and current jockeys, for allegedly fixing two horse races.
	   The jockeys are suspected of having been bribed to manipulate
the results of two races in 1996 through a middleman who was an
apprentice jockey at the time, a statement from the Independent
Commission Against Corruption said.
	   They allegedly accepted one million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
128 million) for each race, it said.
	   Those arrested included three jockeys, three apprentice jockeys,
four former apprentice jockeys and two others, the statement said.
	   Earlier this year, a Hong Kong court sentenced a businessman to
3 1/2 years in jail after his was found guilty of offering bribes
to jockeys to fix horse races.
	   The Jockey Club operates Hong Kong's only legal gambling and its
races generate huge revenues, which the club funnels to charities.

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ A Salt Lake Organizing Committee trustee
and former Olympian says city bid officials responsible for a
vote-buying scandal will have to account for their actions, even if
it turns out they were being blackmailed.
	   ``I knew a lot of athletes who were using steroids, but does
that mean I should have, too?'' four-time track and field Olympian
Henry Marsh asked Monday. ``If you can't win with honor, then
what's the point?''
	   Marsh said he will demand a full accounting of the dlrs 500,000
``humanitarian aid'' fund used by high-ranking committee members to
pay for scholarships to at least six relatives of International
Olympic Committee members, mostly from Africa.
	   ``If some heads have to roll, then so be it,'' Marsh said.
``This went over the line. And I'll say right now that if it turns
out that I should have known about this, then I'll resign. That is
not what the Olympic movement is about.''
	   The existence of the scholarship fund and its use to benefit IOC
members has blown up into the biggest corruption scandal in IOC
history.
	   On Sunday, SLOC president Frank Joklik apologized to the IOC
executive committee meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, for the
appearance that the fund was used to bribe IOC members to award the
2002 Winter Games to Salt Lake, even though he steadfastly
maintained that was not its intent.
	   Marc Hodler, a senior member of the IOC's executive board, is
using the Salt Lake payoffs as a catalyst to flush alleged
corruption from the IOC's ranks. On Monday, Hodler said Salt Lake
was a victim of blackmail by unscrupulous agents and IOC members in
its successful quest for the 2002 Olympics.
	   Hodler said other bids have been tainted as well and the IOC has
opened an investigation. Officials from other bid cities say
Hodler's accusations are groundless.
	   Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt said Monday that he was disheartened by
the allegations. In a written statement, he said he had ``trusted
reports from the bid committee that the process was entirely
honorable.''
	   The governor said he expected a thorough review that ``should
identify activites that were not in keeping with an appropriate bid
process. A report and recommendations should be made to SLOC and
the public.''
	   Marsh and some other SLOC members are looking at the genesis of
the Salt Lake scholarship fund and how its professed humanitarian
purpose was somehow twisted.
	   In fact, several officials who sat on both the bid and
organizing committees said they didn't know the fund existed _
despite Joklik's assurances to reporters last week that it was
``common knowledge'' within the Salt Lake Olympic bid community.
	   Joklik, who was chairman of the bid committee at the time,
claims he did not know the specifics of the program, which was
being run by former bid president Tom Welch and vice president Dave
Johnson, who continues in that post with SLOC.
	   ``This came right out of the blue,'' said Fred Ball, a former
bid committee member and retired executive director of the Salt
Lake Chamber of Commerce. ``I darn near cried when I saw this.''
	   Nick Badami, former president of the U.S. Ski Association and a
member of the bid committee, said he knew only of a vague plan to
provide assistance to athletes from Third World countries.
	   ``This just shocked me,'' he said. ``I think we're all feeling a
little victimized right now.''
	   Badami, Marsh and others plan to press the point at a
closed-door meeting of the SLOC executive committee on Friday after
Joklik returns from Lausanne.
	   Salt Lake City itself was feeling a little victimized after its
razor-thin loss to Nagano, Japan, for the 1998 Winter Games at an
IOC meeting in Birmingham, England, in 1991. The scholarship fund
apparently sprang from a determination that the city not be
outflanked when the vote for the 2002 Games came up in 1995.
	   ``The joke around Birmingham was that we were giving out salt
water taffy and that Japan was giving out Toyotas,'' Ball said.
	   According to interviews and news accounts at the time, Salt Lake
decided it would concentrate its courting of IOC delegates on
Africa and Latin America. The feeling was that finalists Ostersund,
Sweden, and Sion, Switzerland, likely had the support of most
European IOC members and that Quebec's bid might neutralize Salt
Lake's support in North America.
	   The only recipient of the scholarship fund identified so far has
been Sonia Essomba, daughter of late IOC member Rene Essomba, a
prominent surgeon and former head of the National Olympic
Committees of Africa.
	   Joklik has said most of the 13 recipients of the scholarship
fund _ including the six relatives of IOC members _ were from
Africa. Otherwise, he has refused to name them.

Rider and horse killed in lightning strike during trackwork
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ A young track rider and a top contender
for the Perth Cup were killed by a lightning strike during
trackwork Tuesday, racing authorities said.
	   Licensed track rider Damion Beckett was working Brave Buck when
a lightning bolt struck the pair during a morning storm, said
Bernie Ryan, president of the Western Australia Jockey's
Association.
	   The strike happened at Ascot racetrack in Perth about 5.20 a.m.
local time (2120 GMT).
	   Ryan said another jockey went to Beckett's aid but found both
rider and horse apparently dead.
	   Radio reports said Beckett was rushed by ambulance to hospital
but was dead on arrival.
	   Brave Buck, who was third favorite for the Group Two Perth Cup
(3,200m) on Jan. 1, died almost instantly.
	   Ryan said the storm came in very fast, giving turf club
officials no time to call jockeys off the track.
	   Trainer Graeme Webster, whose horse Matriculate was about 40
meters (yards) from Brave Buck when the bolt hit, said it was
raining heavily at the time.
	   ``We had some really big claps of thunder and the heavens opened
up like tropical rain, then a flash of lightning came from
nowhere,'' Webster said.
	   ``I actually saw the lightning hit Brave Buck and he went down
in a flash.''
	   Trackwork for the rest of the day has been canceled.
	   Ryan said Beckett, 22, was well-known and respected in racing
circles.
	   ``Everybody's quite shocked by it,'' Ryan said.

Cubs send Brown to Pirates for Lieber

	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Brant Brown, who nearly cost the
Chicago Cubs a spot in the playoffs when he dropped a fly ball in
the season's final week, was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates on
Monday night for pitcher Jon Lieber.
	   Brown, 27, hit .291 last season with 14 homers and 48 RBIs. He
is best known for dropping a fly ball by Geoff Jenkins on Sept. 23
at Milwaukee, what would have been the final out of a 7-5 win.
Three runs scored to give the Brewers an 8-7 victory, and the Cubs
needed to beat San Francisco five days later in a one-game playoff
for the National League wild-card spot.
	   ``It could have been a larger event if we don't win the game on
Sept. 28,'' Cubs general manager Ed Lynch said after the trade was
announced. ``I felt for him more than any player I think I've ever
felt for from any singular event I ever witnessed.''
	   Brown, a first baseman and outfielder, has spent parts of three
seasons in the major leagues, all with the Cubs, hitting .278 with
24 homers and 72 RBIs in 553 at-bats.
	   ``We'll probably play Brant Brown in center field,'' said
Pirates general manager Cam Bonifay. ``We feel like he's a fine
defensive player.''
	   Lieber, a 28-year-old right-hander, was 8-14 with a 4.11 ERA
last season, striking out 138 and walking 40 in 171 innings.
	   He fills the spot in the Cubs' rotation vacated when Mark Clark
signed a dlrs 9.3 million, two-year contract with Texas.
	   Lieber made his debut with the Pirates in 1994 and went 38-47
with a 4.36 ERA in 104 starts and 47 relief appearances. He made it
through the entire 1998 season despite pitching with a pulled
muscle in his side.

Astronauts pack to come home but weather doubtful

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Still aglow over their space station
handiwork, Endeavour's astronauts were in a holiday mood Monday as
they packed for the trip home.
	   ``We are feeling terrific,'' Nancy Currie radioed down. ``We are
ready to start packing and coming home to see our families just in
time for Christmas. Can't be more pleased with the way the
mission's gone.''
	   Space shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to land at Kennedy Space
Center late Tuesday, nearly 12 days after blasting off on NASA's
first station-assembly mission. Cloudy skies could interfere.
	   Currie needs to get back fast _ she has Christmas shopping to
do.
	   ``Considering we went into quarantine on Thanksgiving Day, I
wasn't looking that far ahead,'' explained Currie, who has an
11-year-old daughter.
	   With two toddlers at home, James Newman has more to buy, too,
even though he was busy wrapping Christmas presents right up until
the crew's Dec. 4 launch.
	   The six astronauts were enjoying a break following Sunday's
release of the 77-foot international space station, which trailed
the shuttle by more than 300 miles Monday night.
	   One of their last tasks was the release of an Air Force science
satellite Monday night. As the satellite was deployed, a small
debris shield for a bolt cutter inadvertently was set loose. It
floated away harmlessly.
	   Flight controllers in Houston and Moscow monitored the station,
as they will throughout its expected 15-year lifetime.
	   Power was being provided by the Russian-built control module
Zarya. Communications were being handled by Unity, the
American-made chamber.
	   The astronauts connected Zarya and Unity, which had never before
touched, and wired them together by hand. They also attached
antennas, tools and handrails for future crews.
	   The next construction team is due to arrive in May.
	   Shuttle commander Robert Cabana said the mission seemed, at
times, surreal.
	   ``We kept pinching ourselves and saying it can't be real, it's
going so well and everything is so right and it just looks so
good,'' he told reporters. ``Yeah, there was a little sense of
unreality about it.''

Norwegian slalom team increasingly competitive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SESTRIERE, Italy (AP) _ It was a close duel between former
Olympic champions, over 30 of age.
	   Finn Christian Jagge edged Thomas Stangassinger by six
hundredths of a second in a World Cup night slalom at Sestriere to
underline the continuing competitiveness and determination of the
``old guard'' in the most technical discipline of Alpine skiing.
	   By claiming his fifth World Cup career victory in Monday's race,
the 32-year-old Jagge also underlined the growing competitiveness
of the Norwegian slalom team.
	   Four Norwegian skiers finished within the top nine at Sestriere.
	   There were three Norwegians in the top seven in the previous
slalom at Aspen, Colorado won by Stangassinger, a 33-year-old
Austrian who won the Olympic slalom title in 1994.
	   In the season opener at Park City, defending Olympic champion
Hans-Petter Buraas placed second to France's Pierrick Bourgeat with
Jagge coming in fourth and Kjetil Andre Aaamodt ninth.
	   ``We can be as successful in slaloms as the Austrians in the
other disciplines,'' Jagge said after victory.
	   An Olympic slalom champion in 1992, Jagge said it was
challenging to have strong teammates.
	   ``We have a strong team in slalom and we take advantage from
rivalry,'' he added.
	   The Norwegian team combines the experience of Jagge, Ole
Christian Furuseth, Lasse Kjus and Aamodt with the talent of
younger Buraas and Tom Stiansen, the defending world slalom
champion.
	   Jagge, Buraas and Stiansen will have the next shot in an early
January slalom at Kranjska Gora while Aamodt and Kjus will try to
stop the dominant Austrians in back-to-back downhill races
scheduled in Val Gardena Friday and Saturday and in a giant slalom
at nearby Alta Badia Monday.
	   World Cup leader Stephan Eberharter and defending overall
champion Hermann Maier, teammates on the Austrian ``power team,''
have won a giant slalom and a super-G each while Kjus clinched the
first season downhill in Val D'Isere last Saturday taking advantage
of quickly changing weather and course condition.
	   Eberharter enters the next World Cup race with 368 points, with
teammate Christian Mayer runnerup at 342 and Kjus third with 313.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International officials have
condemned the deadliest clash between Serb forces and ethnic
Albanian rebels in Kosovo in months _ a gunbattle on the eve of a
round of U.S. diplomatic efforts to revive the peace process.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke was expected to meet here Tuesday
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to ``emphasize the need
to move ahead expeditiously'' on a peace plan, the U.S. State
Department said Monday.
	   Holbrooke and Milosevic brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end
the fighting in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic
Serbia.
	   The deal averted threatened NATO aistrikes and bought time for
diplomats to work out an agreement on the future of the province,
where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts, however, appear stalled, raising
fears that the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   On the eve of Holbrooke's visit, the pro-government Serb Media
Center said Yugoslav troops killed 30 ethnic Albanian separatists
and wounded a dozen others in a five-hour gunbattle near the border
with Albania, which the guerrillas use as a sanctuary.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
sent a team to the site, confirmed 31 people had been killed,
including one woman. Nine others were taken prisoner, two of whom
were wounded, officials said.
	   William Walker, head of the OSCE's still-forming Kosovo
Verification Mission aimed at ensuring the peace agreement is kept,
condemned the violence ``in the strongest terms.''
	   The clash, he said, ``can only lead to a spiral of retribution
that will stand in the way of a reasonable political solution much
needed in this region.''
	   In a statement issued shortly before midnight from Belgrade and
distributed in Kosovo, he called on both sides to ``show restraint
and remain calm in this difficult time.'' He said the verification
mission ``will intensify, in the light of the recent violence''
efforts to help create the conditions of confidence and respect for
human life.
	   In other violence, OSCE sources said unidentified assailants
opened fire Monday night in a Serb-run bar in the western Kosovo
city of Pec, killing four Serbs and wounding five others. The
government's Tanjug news agency said two masked ``terrorists,''
using the authorities' term for the Albanian rebels, entered the
bar about 8 p.m. and ``sprayed the bar'' with automatic weapons
fire.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the Oct.
12 peace agreement, which sought to end the violence sparked after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February.
	   The crackdown left hundreds dead and an estimated 300,000
homeless.
	   After two months of failed shuttle diplomacy, chances of
mediating an end to the continuing violence in Kosovo seem
unlikely.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule, while the rebels say they won't
accept anything short of independence. Serbia, meanwhile, refuses
to consider anything more than partial autonomy for the
Albanian-majority province.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright believed the time was right for Holbrooke
to drive home to Milosevic ``some truths'' about the ``need for
progress on the negotiating front.''

New Palestinian industrial zone opened to mark Clinton visit

	   KARNI, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In another small step toward peace,
Israel and the Palestinians inaugurated their first joint
industrial park that will give jobs to 20,000 Palestinians and a
boost to Gaza's flagging economy.
	   U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley and his Israeli and
Palestinian counterparts, Natan Sharansky and Abdel Nofal, were on
hand Monday for the ceremony that coincided with U.S. President
Bill Clinton's historic visit to the Gaza Strip.
	   The opening of the Karni Industrial Estate is part of the Wye
River peace agreement Clinton helped negotiate.
	   Karni lies just inside the Gaza Strip, close to the border fence
with Israel. It is the first of a series of industrial parks which
Israel and the Palestinian Authority hope to establish, with
international aid, to create jobs in the Palestinian areas.
	   Palestinian unemployment is highest in the Gaza Strip.
	   For the ceremony the Palestinians decorated the park with
American and Palestinian flags, but not Israeli flags.
	   Daley praised the Coca-Cola company for being among the first to
open a facility in the park. The American soft drinks manufacturer
has opened a distribution center to work with its bottling plant at
Ramallah in the West Bank.
	   Daley told The Associated Press that other large American
corporations had expressed interest in Karni.
	   The three governments hope that Palestinian, Israeli and
overseas entrepreneurs will be attracted to Karni. At the ceremony,
Sharansky announced that he had instructed the government's foreign
trade insurance corporation to budget dlrs 50 million to underwrite
Israeli investments at Karni.
	   Israel spent 60 million shekels (dlrs 15 million) in
construction of the industrial park and approximately the same
amount in security devices for X-raying trucks at the Karni
crossing point before they enter Israel.
	   Nofal said he and Sharansky were cooperating, with the help of
the Americans, to market the facility to overseas investors.

Gloomy India and record-breakers at Asian Games

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Four countries -- Bhutan, Maldives,
Palestine and Yemen -- are hoping to depart Thailand with what has
eluded them in all Asian Games past -- a medal.
	   And 13 of the 41 participating nations have yet to appear on the
medal's chart at the current Games, which end Dec. 20.
	   There's also gloom in Indian camp, which has only managed to
pick up 13 medals. The nation of 980 million people won 22 medals,
including four golds, at the last Asiad in Hiroshima four years
ago.
	   Other teams are confident of breaking their medal records.
Malaysia has only two medals to win before equaling its best haul
of 19, while Kuwait, with eight medals, has just one to go to tie
its best showing.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has come through with its best
performance since the 6th Asian Games in Bangkok, 28 years ago. It
has reaped four silvers and two bronzes so far.

facing loss of income, a depressed stock market and unemployment,
according to Mental Health Department official Yaowarat Janchorn.
	   ``Whatever we do that makes us happy, such as cheering at
sports, will let people forget things for awhile,'' says Ms.
Yaowarat.
	   A Games' press release noted that national stress levels may
have come down because there have been fewer reports of suicides
after competition began Dec. 6. Suicides were a daily news staple
in recent months, with many attributed to financial problems.
	   ``The economic benefits from the Asian Games have not been
clarified,'' the release said. ``But one thing is for sure, the
13th Asian Games have helped Thais take a rest from many problems
and prepare them to face the IMF era.''
	   The bottom fell out of the Thai economy mid-1997, forcing the
International Monetary Fund to bail out the country with large cash
infusions.
	   ---  &QC; 
	   HEAVY MEDAL: Not only is winning an Asian Games medal hard,
keeping it on can be tough too. At least three athletes have had
medals put around their necks, only to have them drop off their
ribbons moments later.
	   One was a member of China's winning women's badminton team,
whose coach screwed the gold medal back onto its attachment after
it fell off.
	   Another was an Indian runner whose medal dropped off shortly
after an award ceremony Monday.
	   Risa Sugawara, a Japanese gymnast, also had her bronze medal
fall off its ribbon during an award ceremony. She laughed as an
official helpfully screwed it back on for her.
	   The problem appears to be with the screw that goes into the top
of the medals and attaches them to the ribbon. Despite the mishaps,
organizers said Monday they had no complaints from teams about the
medals.
	   ---  &QC;  UPWARDLY MOBILE: When you're racking up medals as quickly
as China, you need high-technology to keep track. Leaders and
managers of the Chinese delegation have been using mobile phones to
send in results to their headquarters at the Asian Games, allowing
them to keep track of their mounting pile of gold.
	   After another Chinese woman weightlifter got gold Sunday, Wei
Di, the team manager was on the phone within minutes to report in
the good news.
	   Li Furong, the delegation's deputy head, was watching a
badminton match Friday when he heard over his mobile phone that
Taiwan had beaten China for gold in women's team tennis.
	   ``What? They lost? How did that happen?'' Li said. ``That's a
shame. It was a very good opportunity.'' As of Monday, China had 84
golds, way ahead of second-placed South Korea with 43.
	   ---  &QC;  THE TUK-TUKS ARE BACK: Organizers are promising that
drivers of ``tuk-tuk'' taxis at the Asian Games won't go on strike
again.
	   More than 100 of these three-wheelers have been shuttling
athletes, officials and visitors around the Thammasat Sports
Complex, one of three major sites for the Games.
	   Citing delays in payment, some drove off the job before the
Games even started. In recent days they threatened to do so again,
fearing they wouldn't get their last pay packet after the Games
ended.
	   A Games' press release quoted the resident manager of the
Athletes Village, Choopong Kiangsiri, as saying a promise to the
drivers that they would be paid expeditiously will keep them on the
job.
	   They are receiving 300 baht (dlrs 8) a day plus free food and
accommodation.
	   ``Specially designed for the Games, the typical Thai vehicles
are installed with four-stroke engines for unleaded gasoline and
safety is a top priority,'' the release said.
	   In real, life tuk-tuks are notorious polluters and safety
hazards. Using their small size and maneuverability to advantage,
drivers frequently dart in front of other vehicles as they slalom
through traffic.
	   ---  &QC;  NO CASH COW: The Thai government admits it hasn't set
aside enough money to reward all its winning athletes at the Asian
Games. The problem: too many are grabbing medals.	   Predicting a total medal haul of about a dozen golds, Thailand
has already picked up 13 with more expected in boxing, billiards
and sepak takraw.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul admits the government
didn't budget for what it will have to pay out, but promised all
winners would somehow be rewarded.
	   Like a number of other participating nations at the Games,
Thailand has promised to award cash prizes. Thai gold medalists
will get 1 million baht (dlrs 27,778), winners of silvers 300,000
baht (dlrs 8,333) and 100,000 baht (dlrs 2,778) goes to bronze
medalists.
	   ---  &QC;  GOOD-BYE EXTRAVAGANZA: Gigantic puppets relating a
Buddhist tale and pop singers from Thailand's four regions are to
highlight the closing ceremony of the Asian Games Dec. 20.
	   Like the highly praised opening ceremony, the finale will be
attended by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who has won sailing
medals in international competition.
	   Organizers say the story depicting the second life of the Lord
Buddha reflects the importance of perseverance and thus applicable
to sports. Puppets, a shadow play and classical dances will be used
to tell how Mahajanaka had to swim for seven days and nights to
survive a shipwreck.
	   Four leading singers, each representing one of the country's
major regions, will also take the stage. The Games will conclude
with a lantern-lit parade.

Dollar higher against yen, Japanese stocks fall in morning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar gained moderately against the yen
Tuesday morning on bargain-hunting by Japanese investors. Stock
prices fell.
	   The dollar bought 115.94 yen at midday, up 0.32 yen from late
Monday in Tokyo and above its late New York level of 115.49 yen
overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 51.78 points,
or 0.37 percent, to close the morning session at 14,059.84. On
Monday, the average closed down 294.02 points, or 2.04 percent.
	   On the foreign exchange market, dollar-buying by Japanese
institutional investors and covering of short, or oversold, dollar
positions boosted the U.S. currency from its morning low of 115.40
yen, traders said.
	   But persistent selling by U.S. funds and other players is
capping the rise, they said.
	   The dollar remained under selling pressure in early trading amid
increasing concern over whether U.S. Bill Clinton will be
impeached, traders said.
	   The U.S. House of Representatives was slated to hold a special
session Thursday to vote on an impeachment recommendation.
	   Also weighing on the dollar was weakness on Wall Street, where
the Dow Jones industrial average fell 126.16 points Monday to close
at 8,695.60 on earnings disappointment and weakening technology
shares.
	   Traders also continued to fret about the financial health of
Brazil and other Latin American economies.
	   On the stock exchange, Wall Street's overnight drop coupled with
concern over a report on worsening business sentiment among
Japanese companies pushed share prices down, traders said.
	   The closely-watched report, issued Monday by Japan's central
bank, showed business confidence to be worse than expected.
	   ``The market is in a very precarious state,'' said Louis Tseng,
the head of derivatives at Jardine Fleming Securities. ``The
likelihood of it going down is much greater than it going up.''
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section shed 7.55 points, or 0.69 percent, to 1,092.76. The
TOPIX closed down 17.85 points, or 1.60 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 1.270 percent, unchanged from Monday's
finish. Its price remained at 104.49 yen.

England teetering on 221 for six
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath
removed John Crawley with the last ball before lunch to leave
England fighting to salvage an unlikely draw in the third Ashes
cricket test at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday.
	   Mark Waugh made amends for twice dropping England skipper Alec
Stewart when he took a reflex catch at second slip to end a
stubborn stand that took England to 221 for six at the break.
	   England began the day needing 443 runs to win the test and
square the series 1-1. Australia won the second test in Perth by
seven wickets; the first was drawn after being washed out.
	   After losing Mark Ramprakash in the 17th over of the morning, a
struggling Stewart and Crawley batted resolutely to take the side
within reach of lunch.
	   But McGrath, armed with the second new ball, struck just before
the break when Crawley (13) edged a low catch to Waugh.
	   Earlier, Waugh at silly point had dropped Stewart on 38 and 45,
as the England skipper nervously approached his first half century
of the series.
	   Stewart, dismissed for naught in the first innings, was unbeaten
on 51, hitting five boundaries from 102 balls in 112 minutes.
	   Ramprakash (57) was clean bowled by a yorker from swing bowler
Damien Fleming in the first hour of the day.

<TEXT>
	   EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Before heading home to resume
his struggle against impeachment, U.S. President Bill Clinton is
making a final stab at getting the Wye River peace accords back on
track. His No. 1 goal is to persuade Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to resume a partial troop pullback on the West
Bank.
	   Even though Yasser Arafat led the Palestine National Council
into nullifying calls for Israel's destruction on Monday, Clinton's
task appeared difficult on the third and final day of a trip to the
region.
	   Netanyahu is demanding that Arafat stop proclaiming his
intention to establish a Palestinian state even before negotiations
open on explosive final-status issues.
	   But Arafat, in a rousing speech to the Council in Clinton's
presence Monday, renewed his hope for a state with its capital in
Jerusalem.
	   Speaking to hundreds of Palestinians, Clinton did not discourage
statehood hopes. In fact, he said he sought ``legitimate rights for
Palestinians'' along with ``real security for Israel.''
	   Previewing what Clinton was likely to tell the two leaders
Tuesday at a meeting at the Erez border crossing, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said ``it's important for the Israelis to
move forward on the redeployment. It would unfortunate if that did
not happen soon.''
	   Still, Albright said ``there are indications it will not happen
on schedule.''
	   Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem that Palestinian vote
would ``lead to a real peace, a lasting peace, not a minute-long
peace.'' But at the same time, he said Arafat must renounce plans
to declare statehood and take steps to end the violence in the
region.
	   ``We are not susceptible to pressure. We will do what is
right,'' Netanyahu declared in an interview with The Associated
Press. ``We expect the Palestinians to keep all the provisions, and
no amount of pressure is going to change this.''
	   Albright, for her part, lodged a familiar plea for both leaders
to stop making statements that appeared to prejudge the outcome of
negotiations on an overall settlement. She also suggested
Palestinian complaints that Israel was releasing common criminals
but not political prisoners should be taken up directly with
Israel.
	   ``It clearly is a very sensitive point for the Palestinians,''
she said. ``It can be resolved by having honest and frank
discussions.''
	   Clinton, in his Gaza speech, pressed both sides to reconcile.
``I think there will be more breakdowns, frankly. But I think there
will be more breakthroughs as well.''
	   Addressing former guerrilla fighters and other top Palestinians,
Clinton said the peace process has brought rewards: elections and
self-government in Gaza and the West Bank, Israeli troop
redeployments, relations with Washington and a Palestinian airport.
	   But he also acknowledged Palestinian bitterness over Israeli
restrictions on commerce, land confiscation and Israeli
settlements. He said Israel, for its part, has justifiable security
concerns.
	   ``Enough of this gnashing of teeth, let us join hands and
proudly go forward together,'' the president said.
	   Once the three-way meeting is over, Clinton planned to balance
the rest of the day with a pre-Christmas visit to Bethlehem on the
West Bank and a tour of Masada in Israel, where the remnants of a
Jewish rebel force in the 1st century took their lives rather than
surrender to conquering Romans.

Report: Matsushita, Sun to develop consumer products
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan and Sun
Microsystems Inc. of the United States are teaming up to develop
and sell digital home electronic appliances, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   Matsushita will develop and sell products that can be easily
linked to computer networks through software developed by Sun, the
Nihon Keizai, Japan's top business daily, said.
	   Masashi Sakamoto, a Matsushita spokesman, refused to comment on
the report, saying that executives from the two companies would
hold a news conference in Tokyo on a joint project later Tuesday.
	   The Nihon Keizai said Matsushita will adopt Java programming
language in computer programs in its home appliance products, while
developing appliances applicable with Jini network software.
	   Through a tie-up with the Japanese consumer electronics giant,
Sun will try to gain ground in the home appliances area, where
Microsoft Inc., a leading U.S. computer software maker, has yet to
establish a foothold with its Windows CE operating system, the
report said.
	   Jini, introduced by Sun earlier this year, is a new network
technology enabling appliances to exchange data automatically via
networks.

Report: Matsushita, Sun to develop consumer products
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan and Sun
Microsystems Inc. of the United States are teaming up to develop
and sell digital home electronic appliances, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   Matsushita will develop and sell products that can be easily
linked to computer networks through software developed by Sun, the
Nihon Keizai, Japan's top business daily, said.
	   Masashi Sakamoto, a Matsushita spokesman, refused to comment on
the report, saying that executives from the two companies would
hold a news conference in Tokyo on a joint project later Tuesday.
	   The Nihon Keizai said Matsushita will adopt Java programming
language in computer programs in its home appliance products, while
developing appliances applicable with Jini network software.
	   Through a tie-up with the Japanese consumer electronics giant,
Sun will try to gain ground in the home appliances area, where
Microsoft Inc., a leading U.S. computer software maker, has yet to
establish a foothold with its Windows CE operating system, the
report said.
	   Jini, introduced by Sun earlier this year, is a new network
technology enabling appliances to exchange data automatically via
networks.

Snyder says Russia, Eastern Europe needs continued U.S. help

<TEXT>
	   LITTLE ROCK (AP) _ A week-and-half trip to Russia and Eastern
Europe proved the need for continued American involvement in
building fledgling democracies, Rep. Vic Snyder, D-Ark., said
Monday.
	   Snyder and four other Democrats on the House National Security
Committee returned from the fact-finding trip last week. They met
with Russian officials in St. Petersburg, visited with United
States troops in Bosnia and talked with Czechoslovakian leaders
about their desire to join NATO.
	   In all three areas, the threat to the United States was the
same.
	   ``The threat to us is instability,'' Snyder said. ``So that
market economy needs to be nurtured and stabilized...and in Russia,
helping them safeguard their nuclear materials, that has to be a
priority to us.''
	   Were he a legislator in Czechoslovakia, Snyder said, he would
support the bid to join the military alliance originally exclusive
to Western European and North American nations.
	   But the Czech military has inadequate training, different
equipment and more of a top-down chain of command than most NATO
members, Snyder said.
	   Snyder said morale among troops in Bosnia appeared to be good.
He also said the troops need to remain there for an indefinite
time.
	   ``It's clearly not the time to remove them now,'' Snyder said.
``They're doing very, very well at stopping the bloodshed that was
going on. But things such as the resettlement of refugees still has
a long way to go. ...The hard work of nation building is more
problematic.''
	   The delegation was in St. Petersburg during local elections,
which Snyder said were both troubling and encouraging.
	   ``In the days leading up to it, the Mafia was involved in the
election in a major way,'' Snyder said. ``Money and vodka was being
used to buy votes, there was intimidation, an assassination....sham
candidates being put on ballots.... just a tremendous effort made
to thwart the reformers of democracy.''
	   But in a relatively high voter turnout, ``all the Mafia
candidates where defeated. It was interpreted as a tremendous boost
forward for democracy,'' Snyder said.
	   Snyder said he noticed that frustrations with the United States
were high among some Russian officials. One of the concerns of
those he talked with was the possibility of the Czech Republic,
Hungary and Poland joining NATO. Russians also had opposing views
about the United State's role in Bosnia, he said.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Marc Savard and Adam Graves scored power-play
goals in the first period and the New York Rangers went on to a 5-2
victory over the Calgary Flames on Monday night.
	   The Rangers also got another power-play goal from Petr Nedved in
the third period, as they converted three of five chances with the
man advantage to snap a two-game losing streak.
	   Mike Knuble and Mathieu Schneider also scored for the Rangers.
Steve Smith and Theo Fleury scored for the Flames, who had a
two-game winning streak snapped.
	   The Rangers went 3-for-5 on the power play, the Flames went
0-for-6.
 &UR; Canadiens 2, Coyotes 2
	   In Montreal, Teppo Numminen scored with 1:53 left in the third
period as the Phoenix Coyotes rallied twice in the final minutes
for a tie with the Montreal Canadiens.
	   The game was marred for Phoenix by an injury to scoring leader
Keith Tkachuk, who did not come out for the third period after
suffering a groin injury. It was not immediately known how serious
the injury was.
	   Phoenix rookie Daniel Briere tied the score at 1-1 at 14:53 of
the third only to see Benoit Brunet put Montreal back in front at
17:13.
	   The Coyotes, first overall in the NHL, improved to 17-3-4 and
extended their unbeaten streak to five games.

Anchorage Olympic organizer says he was approached for bribes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAUREEN CLARK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) _ One of the organizers of Anchorage's
unsuccessful bids for the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics said Monday
he was solicited for bribes by agents of the International Olympic
Committee.
	   Rick Nerland, who served as executive vice president with the
Anchorage Olympic Organizing Committee, said the incidents occurred
in the mid- and late 1980s.
	   ``It was suggested to me by an individual that, for financial
payment, votes could be influenced,'' said Nerland, who owns an
Anchorage advertising and public relations agency. ``I told them we
didn't need that kind of help.''
	   Nerland revealed the bribes for the first time in an interview
with KTUU-TV in Anchorage.
	   Nerland's revelations came two days after Marc Hodler, a senior
IOC official from Switzerland, accused four people of vote-buying
and cited alleged irregularities in the selection of four Olympic
cities _ Salt Lake City; Atlanta; Nagano, Japan; and Sydney,
Australia.
	   The IOC also is investigating another scandal surrounding the
selection of Salt Lake City for the 2002 Winter Olympics. That case
centers on a scholarship fund set up by the Salt Lake bidding
committee. The fund gave nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarship aid to
13 people, including six relatives of IOC members.
	   Nerland refused to name the individuals who solicited the bribes
from Anchorage organizers.
	   ``There are a lot of people on the periphery of the IOC who
claim to have a lot of influence. It was people on the periphery,''
Nerland said.
	   The first contact came from an Asian representative at a meeting
in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1985 or 1986, Nerland said. The second
came from an African representative at a meeting in Anchorage in
1987 or 1988.
	   Nerland said he had heard rumors that bribes were solicited from
cities bidding for the games and was disappointed when it occurred.
He said he dismissed the idea ``on the spot.''
	   Nerland said he discussed the solicitation with Dave Baumeister,
president of the Anchorage Organizing committee. Baumeister died
several years ago.
	   ``He and I discussed this,'' Nerland said. ``I don't know if
other members were approached. I don't think so. Dave and I were
the ones that were primarily involved in the lobbying.''
	   Despite the scandal, Nerland said he thinks most IOC members are
ethical and honest.
	   ``There may be some bad apples in the bunch that they need to
cull out, but that's not representative of the body,'' Nerland
said. ``Hopefully this will clean up the process of selecting
cities.''

Reports: U.S. lawmakers urge Thailand not to privatize tobacco
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A group of lawmakers from the United
States has urged Thailand not to privatize its tobacco industry as
the move would likely increase the number of smokers, local papers
reported Tuesday.
	   Citing research done by Thai academics, the lawmakers said the
number of smokers had increased by about 10 percent in countries
where the United States had pressured governments to privatize
their tobacco industries, The Nation newspaper reported.
	   They named Japan, South Korea and Taiwan as examples.
	   Thailand has told the International Monetary Fund in a letter of
intent that it will privatize its government-controlled tobacco
monopoly as part of economic reforms
	   The IMF, supervising a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout of the THai
economy, is asking for reforms, including privatization of state
enterprises, in exchange for the assistance.
	   But a letter signed by 14 members of the U.S. House of
Representatives and three senators, asked the Thai government to
reconsider.
	   ``Whatever the merits of privatization of other sectors, tobacco
represents a grave public-health menace and must be treated
differently,'' the letter said.
	   The paper did not name the lawmakers who signed the letter.
	   The United States pressured Thailand earlier in this decade to
open up its tobacco market to imports of U.S.-made cigarettes,
which are now widely available and popular.
	   At the time, Thailand resisted, arguing it would increase the
number of smokers and adversely affect public health.

Leaders warn of dangers of globalization
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos staffing &QL; 
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Leaders of developing countries from
Southeast Asia warned Tuesday that while they are united in
liberalizing their economies to recover from their financial
crisis, they are being hurt by globalization.
	   Addressing the opening session of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations summit, both Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad and Vietnamese counterpart Phan Van Khai called for reform
of international financial and monetary institutions.
	   ``The financial turmoil has underscored the many challenges
inherent in globalization,'' Mahathir said in a speech to a packed
house in Ba Dinh Hall, home of Vietnam's National Assembly. ``Even
as we embrace it, we must be wary of the dangers which accompany
it.''
	   While each of the nine leaders spoke of unity and a concerted
joint effort to show the world they are serious about making strong
efforts to address their ongoing economic crisis, there also were
clear signs of division.
	   ASEAN includes both industrialized countries and some of the
world's poorest nations.
	   Even as officials have said they are determined to keep ASEAN
from turning into a two-tier group, Singapore, Thailand and the
Philippines have pressed for quicker economic liberalization, while
Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar have insisted on a slower timetable.
	   ``Rapid economic globalization is bringing about greater market
access and new partners for development, but also putting the
weaker economies in a more vulnerable and disadvantageous position,
and in an uneven competition,'' Khai said.
	   Mahathir, one of ASEAN's most outspoken members, has long been
critical of international currency traders, blaming their
unregulated activities for sparking the Asian economic crisis 19
months ago.
	   He made a pitch for the currency and stock-market controls that
his country have imposed.
	   ``We liberalized because we believed in the free market,''
Mahathir said. ``But our liberalism was abused, resulting in
economic and financial depression. We have no choice but to
reimpose controls.
	   ``Until the international community agrees on an international
regime that will remove the kind of dangers we have been exposed
to, we will have to continue with our controls.''
	   Speaker after speaker highlighted the region's stability but
said the economic crisis has taken its toll. Indonesian Prime
Minister B.J. Habibie called it ``devastating.''
	   ``The economic crisis has impoverished ASEAN economies and
undermined national stability,'' Mahathir said. ``Millions of
people have been thrown out of work, while others have their
purchasing power drastically reduced.
	   ``Businesses, large and small, have been bankrupted. The social
well-being of the people has been disrupted.''
	   The leaders were to go into close meetings later Tuesday and
Wednesday to endorse several documents, including their ``bold
measures,'' then hold talks with their ``dialogue partners'' _
Japan, China and South Korea.
	   Officials and analysts have question how bold the measures are.
	   ``Some of the members are moving much more slowly than others,''
one Western diplomat said. ``If they can impolement the bold
measures, they will be a good step forward, but the expectations
are that there is a stinger at the end of the tail. whether they
can actually deliver on them is unknown.''

Prosecution brings stained mattress into Malaysian courtroom

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prosecutors in the high-profile
trial of Malaysia's jailed former No. 2 leader Tuesday exhibited a
gray-colored mattress which police said had semen stains from Anwar
Ibrahim's alleged illegal sexual activities.
	   Silence fell over the packed courtroom as a senior police
officer cut open brown paper wrapping to reveal a queen-sized,
spring mattress from which 13 pieces of cloth had been snipped out
for testing by police experts.
	   Prompted by curiosity about the well-publicized exhibit, many
people peeked into the courtroom even before Tuesday's hearing
began to catch a glimpse of the mattress leaning against a wall.
	   Prosecutors are trying to prove that Anwar had sex with the wife
of his former secretary and that he tried to abuse his powers as
deputy prime minister of the Southeast Asian country to cover up
sexual trysts.
	   The mattress was seized by police in July from an apartment in a
posh Kuala Lumpur suburb which Anwar is accused of using for secret
meetings with sex partners.
	   As the wrapping was removed, Anwar smiled and then jokingly made
a gesture of sleeping by clasping both palms onto the side of his
head.
	   Pieces from the cloth covering of the mattress had been sent for
testing to police laboratories along with samples of Anwar's blood
for DNA analysis.
	   The results of those tests have not been disclosed to the court.
Prosecutors were expected to call in forensic experts later and
even produce a pillow that was seized along with the mattress.
	   Anwar, fired in September, currently faces abuse of power
charges and will be tried separately for allegedly having engaged
in illegal sex acts.
	   He has denied all the charges against him, saying they were
cooked up to eliminate the challenge he posed to Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year-rule. Mahathir said his former protege
was morally unfit to rule.
	   ``While examining the mattress on July 10, 1998, I saw patches
on the cloth which I suspected to be seminal stain,'' said Musa
Hassan, the assistant commissioner of police who investigated the
charges against Anwar.
	   ``It was in the spots that had been slashed,'' he said after
uncovering the mattress with bits of sponge stuffing spilling out
from the areas where the cloth had been cut.
	   The new evidence has created obvious parallels with the case of
Monica Lewinsky, whose semen-stained blue dress has been touted as
vivid proof of her affair with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   The prosecution's case was based on accusations by Ummi Hafilda
Ali, the sister of Anwar's former secretary, and Azizan Abu Bakar,
a former driver in the politician's household.
	   While Ummi has accused Anwar of sleeping with her brother's
wife, Shamsidar Taharin, driver Azizan has claimed he was
repeatedly sodomized by Anwar.
	   Azizan and Ummi made the accusations in letters sent last year
to Prime Minister Mahathir. The pair retracted their allegations
after being arrested by police, but later said they were forced to
do so.
	   The prosecution's case is that Shamshidar, who has been
attending the hearings regularly, was taken to the apartment by an
ally of Anwar, who is now being tried for illegal possession of
ammunition.

High food prices push up inflation as economy slides
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ High food prices pushed up
Malaysia's annualized inflation rate to 5.6 percent in November,
the national news agency Bernama reported, quoting official
statistics released Tuesday.
	   For the first eleven months of the year, the consumer price
index rose 5.3 percent compared with the same period last year.
Inflation was at 5.2 percent in October.
	   With the exception of transport and communications, prices in
all other sectors had risen, the statistics department said.
	   Food prices rose by 8.9 percent, while those of miscellaneous
goods and services were up by 7.1 percent. Medical care was 6.2
percent higher.
	   The economy shrank 8.6 percent in the third quarter of 1998, a
dramatic slowdown from the 7.8 percent expansion registered in 1997
and the once booming growth rates recorded over the past decade.
	   The government has even said the situation is so bad it may have
to revise its full year forecast of a 4.8 percent contraction
because of the effects of Asia's currency and stock market tumble
last year.

Mixed feelings in Israel, celebration in Palestinian territories

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Years of violent conflict have effected Guy
Elhanan's family more than it has others in Israel. Last year, his
14-year-old sister was killed by a Palestinian suicide bomber in
Jerusalem.
	   The grandson of former Israeli army general Matti Peled, who
became a staunch supporter of Palestinian rights, Elhanan's family
blamed Smadar's death on years of Israeli occupation of the
Palestinian people.
	   Monday, Elhanan, a 20-year-old soldier in the Israeli army,
watched in his family's Jerusalem's home as U.S. President Bill
Clinton told the Palestinian leadership they are free to
``determine their own destiny on their own land.''
	   ``It's definitely a positive boost for Palestinian statehood,''
Elhanan said.
	   ``When he spoke to them, he spoke to them as a nation and as a
people, which is more than Israel has ever done,'' he said.
	   In Jewish settlements on the West Bank, in posh cafe's in
downtown Jerusalem and in the office of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, many Israelis gathered to watch Clinton's visit to the
Gaza Strip, the first by a sitting U.S. president to autonomous
Palestinian land.
	   But not everyone embraced the visit.
	   Nissim Smoliansky, a member of the right-wing National Religious
Party in Netanyahu's coalition government said Clinton's remarks
were harmful for Israel.
	   ``The remarks can be interpreted in either way. For us it's not
good because there were times when the United States would firmly
say they were against Palestinian statehood and now they don't say
it, which is one of the terrible things which came out of today. We
lost alot,'' he said.
	    &UR; ____
	   RAFAH, Gaza Strip _ Palestinian school children who had
participated in a ceremony at Gaza International Airport with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton,
bobbed along in a rickety school bus with their teachers, clapping
and singing along to a celebration song that praised Arafat on
Voice of Palestine radio.
	   As they rode north from the airport to Gaza City, swarms of
other children _ little girls in green school uniform dresses and
boys in denim shirts _ ran along the roadside waving plastic
American and Palestinian flags and shouting ``hallo'' in English.
	   For miles (kilometers) the bus passed under banners stretched
across the road which read in English, ``The people of peace
welcome the leader of peace.''
	   They also passed by the Jewish settlement of Kfar Darom where a
giant Menora, the traditional candelabra used during the Jewish
holiday of Hanukkah joined a banner above a bridge which read, ``We
are here for ever.''
