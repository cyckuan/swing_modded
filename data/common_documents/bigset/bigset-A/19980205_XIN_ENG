WASHINGTON,February 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Defense Secretary William S. Cohen told the Congress gripped by
war fever that the United States would wage a "significant" military
campaign against Iraq's suspected nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons unless Iraq allowed international weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
-- A low-flying United States military jet on a training
flight over the craggy Dolomite mountains in Cavalese, Italy, cut
the cable of a ski lift Tuesday, sending a cable car plunging 260
feet into a snowy meadow and killing 20 on board.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton flew Wednesday to Los Alamos
National Laboratory to focus on gaining public support for a
global treaty banning nuclear weapons tests and for his new budget
plan, ignoring reporters' questions about the sex and perjury
scandal consuming Washington.
</P>
<P>
-- Secret Service logs show that Monica S. Lewinsky visisted
the White House some three dozen times after leaving her White
House job for a post at the Pentagon in the spring of
1996. Administrations officials offered no explanation for the
large number of visits she made to the White House and refused to
say whether she spent time with President Clinton on those
occasions.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Castro demanded an end to the U.S. embargo against Cuba in
his first speech since Pope John Paul II's visit. He criticized
plans by a U.S. exile group, and endorsed by Senator Helms, to
deliver 100 million dollars in food and medicine, but didn't
mention the pope's plea for the release of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
-- In an unusual alliance with Eastman Kodak Co., U.S. trade
officials have crafted a new strategy to pressure Japan to open
its film market. The U.S. move follows a defeat at the World
Trade Organization recently. The WTO broadly rejected a
U.S. case, brought on behalf of Kodak, alleging that the Japanese
government protected Fuji Photo Film Co.by blocking foreign
competition.

<HEADLINE> World Population to Stabilize at 11 Billion by 2200 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The world population
will stabilize at nearly 11 billion around 2200, according to the
medium fertility scenario of the new long-range projections by a
U.N unit.
</P>
<P>
Assuming fertility will stabilize at replacement levels of
slightly above two children per woman, the world population will
grow from 5.7 billion in 1995 to 9.4 billion in 2050, 10.4 billion
in 2100 and 10.8 billion by 2150 and will stabilize at slightly
under 11 billion around 2200.
</P>
<P>
The projections released by the Population Division of the
United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs today
said the growth in the size of the world population is matched by
a large shift in the age structure.
</P>
<P>
The median age of the world population will rise from 25.4
years in 1995 to 36.5 years in 2050 and 42.9 years by 2150.
</P>
<P>
The share of the world population under 15 years will fall from
31 percent in 1995 to 17 percent by 2150.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the percentage of the population aged 60 or above
will rise rapidly from 9 percent in 1995 to 30 percent in 2150,
while the number aged 80 or over will grow from 61 million in 1995
to 320 million in 2050 and 1,055 million by 2150, the division
said.

<HEADLINE> Aid Agencies Appeal for Assistance to Afghan People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Aid Agencies appealed here
Wednesday for 157 million U.S. dollars to help the Afghan people
whose life has been devastated by 18 years of war.
</P>
<P>
"The longer the war continues, the more desperate people become
and the more they depend on assistance from outside," Alfredo
Witschi-Cestari, U.N. coordinator for Afghanistan, said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
In the Afghan capital of Kabul, half the population relies on
the United Nations and its partners for food, medicines and other
basic services.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations estimates that conditions in Kabul and the
northern town of Mazar-i-Sharif and the remote rural areas of
Bamiyan and Badakhshan deteriorated in 1997, with many more people
becoming dependent on relief handouts.
</P>
<P>
Aid agencies are appealing for money so they can provide these
people with food and medicines while at the same time taking steps
to establish an environment in which the Afghan population is less
dependent on outside assistance, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
The most crucial of these steps are being taken to build peace
in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
"Only when there is peace throughout Afghanistan can we get to
grips with building a society in which parents can bring children
up to be self-sufficient," Witschi-Cestari said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, aid agencies will be working to create one single
common program with one single common objective: "lasting peace,"
the press release said.
</P>
<P>
To do this, agencies are asking donors for 157 million dollars
more than they appealed for last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, in 1997, donors contributed 56
million dollars through the appeal. The total sum that flowed into
the Afghan assistance effort, however, was more than 200 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The money provided food for more than 1 million hungry people,
helped 73,000 refugees go home and provided more than 800,000
individuals with mine awareness training.
</P>
<P>
Aid agencies hoped that this year money will be channeled
through the appeal to fund priority issues such as rehabilitation
of towns and rural areas. Other key sectors include the mine
action program, repatriation of refugees, agriculture, drug
control and programs to enhance the position of women.

<P>
KATHMANDU, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Nepal Telecommunications
Corporation (NTC) will strengthen telecommunication services
across the country for the benefit of Visit Nepal Year '98, the

Commission as saying an additional 300,000 telephone connections
will be provided during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1997-2002).

<HEADLINE> Pak Economy Pulled Out of Crisis: Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz
said Wednesday that Pakistan's economy has been pulled out of
crisis and is now on the way to recovery.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in crisis as we were in 1996 which is itself an
achievement because the economy was on the verge of default," Aziz
said in an interview with BBC.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said the government had massive problems
in the banking sector and various financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
"We have pulled the economy out of the crisis and we are now on
way to recovery which is significant," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the government led by Pakistan Muslim League has
launched far-reaching reforms in the banking sector, taxation
system, capital markets, agriculture and downsizing of the
government.
</P>
<P>
After introducing these reforms, the government has been able
to reach an agreement with International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the region as a whole, the stock markets are
down and exchange rates are rapidly deteriorating, but stock
markets and reserves in Pakistan are higher.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed his hope that the Pakistani government
will be able to achieve its economic target before the end of
1998.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the government is making fundamental changes in the
tax system but economic recovery will take time.
</P>
<P>
He said that last year, four provincial assemblies passed law
to start the process of agricultural taxation.
</P>
<P>
"The scale is very small but the process has been started which
is a major change and beginning of agriculture tax which never
existed for the last 50 years," he said.

<HEADLINE> British Farm Minister Sees Long Way for EU Farm Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Jack Cunningham, the British
agriculture minister, today said that the European Union (EU)
members still had a long way to go before they could reach
agreement on the thorny issue of farm reform.
</P>
<P>
The British minister made the remark when he addressed the
European Parliament agriculture committee here.
</P>
<P>
"I doubt we'll be able to conclude them within two
presidencies. They are going to be long and complicated -- I hope
not acrimonious -- but it's going to be tough," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the British presidency regarded the
agricultural reform as a priority but talks had to continue after
its current half-year stewardship.
</P>
<P>
"It will probably be well into 1999 before we reach any
conclusions on the matter," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Some European Parliament members voiced concern over recent
comments by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook over the level of spending under the annual
50 billion dollar Common Agricultural Policy.
</P>
<P>
However, Cunningham played down the United Kingdom's
free-market approach. "We don't expect CAP to be totally
dismantled, but we're not alone in wanting reform," he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that large and small farms needed to be
economically sustainable in order to be competitive to survive.
He added that he doubted this would happen without reform.
</P>
<P>
The British farm minister reiterated the UK's opposition to
modulation, the principle of capping support payments, noting that
modulation would discriminate against Britain, with generally
large and competitive farms.

<HEADLINE> Dodik Pledges Efforts for Return of Serb Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Milorad Dodik, leader of Bosnia's
Serb entity, today said his government would make every effort for
the quick return of the 150,000 Bosnian Serb refugees currently
living in Germany.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, economic difficulties would not ensure a
stablized situation which was prerequisite for the return of
refugees. He called for Germany's aid in refugee repatriation and
the economic rebuilding in the Republika Srpska, which is one of
his government's priorities.
</P>
<P>
He told a joint press conference after meeting with German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel that 70 percent of the workforce in
the Serb entity were currently unemployed and that the average
monthly wage there was about 70 marks (38 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Before talking with Kinkel, Dodik also called for the return of
Muslim and Croat refugees originated from the Republika Srpska in
an interview with Germany's General Anzeiger newspaper, noting
that no non-Serb returnees to the Serb entity had experienced any
security problems.
</P>
<P>
Dodik added, however, returnees would have to share the
economic hardships in the region.
</P>
<P>
Dodik, who is here on his first foreign trip since taking
office two weeks ago, told the newspaper that people in the
Republika Srpska all realized that only small improvement could be
expected in the near future.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "Our chances depend on whether we get concrete
aid."
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Kinkel reiterated the message from Germany
and the European Union that implementing the Dayton peace accord
would bring benefits.
</P>
<P>
According to Dodik, his government's priorities included the
overall implementation of the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
However, in reply to Kinkel's call for turning over suspected
war criminals, he stressed that the Republika Srpska still lacked
the necessary political stability to comply with the requirement.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb hardliners who reject the Dayton accord had been
dominating the Serb entity before Dodik's government took power.
The new government has announced it is moving the Serb entity's
capital to Banja Luka from Pale, which has been the hardliners'
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
Under Dodik's leadership, which enjoyed widespread political
support, the new parliament in the Republika Srpska has also
repealed 33 laws which blocked the return of Muslim and Croat
refugees.

<HEADLINE> British Business Still Fails IT Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A communication gap between IT
and business executives is stopping companies from fully
exploiting technology, and little progress has been made in the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
New research revealed a continuing obsession with cutting IT
costs and battling to align IT and company goals, while low
priority is given to using IT for competitive advantage and
measuring return on investment.
</P>
<P>
Aligning IT and company goals is once again the number one
issue for IT managers in Europe in an annual survey by IT services
giant CSC.
</P>
<P>
The research shows Europe is some way behind the US in business
understanding of IT, saying "the fact that the US is moving ahead
of us in exploitation of IT is very worrying."
</P>
<P>
This lack of understanding means business executives fall back
on viewing IT as a cost rather than an investment, CSC said.
</P>
<P>
"Unless they come to understand that IT is an enabler, they
will continue to see it as a cost," it added.

<HEADLINE> UK to Introduce Environment Indicators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- British Environment Minister
Michael Meacher said today the government would monitor the
environmental performance which would be as seriously as it
monitors the state of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Meacher said a series of environmental indices would be
introduced to be regarded as having the same importance as data on
economic growth or unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is that this impacts on the national
consciousness and makes people think, just as they do when
unemployment goes up or interest rates rise," he said.
</P>
<P>
The indicators would look at things like air quality,
biodiversity, pollution, energy efficiency, water conservation and
there would even be a measure reflecting the beauty of the
countryside, he told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Meacher said the new indicators, which may be introduced
towards the end of the year, had to be "drivers of economic and
social change" and to "rival economic statistics which at present
dominate the media."
</P>
<P>
"The real problem with this is that it is more like an archive
than something that is meant to drive political change," the
minister added.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Urged to Tackle Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Canadian businesses have been
urged to make more serious efforts to solve the Year 2000 computer
problem, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
A federal task force recommended that Canadian businesses
should be cut off from loans, insurance policies and government
financing unless they come up with a formal plan to deal with the
millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
In its report titled A Call for Action, the task force
suggested that "all lending institutions should require formal
Year 2000 action plans from all corporate borrowers as a
prerequisite for loans" beginning April 1.
</P>
<P>
And insurance companies should make issuing or renewing
insurance policies conditional on a formal action plan, it said.
</P>
<P>
It also proposed that the federal government allow smaller
firms to deduct the bulk of their Year 2000-related expenses this
year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the group said that the government should change
its immigration rules to speed up the entry into Canada of any
computer programmers or other immigrants with Year 2000 skills.
</P>
<P>
An Ottawa-based think tank, the Conference Board of Canada,
warned in a separate report issued Tuesday that failure to deal
immediately with the millennium bug could throw Canada into a
recession in the first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada reported recently that only 9 percent of
Canadian businesses had a formal plan for dealing with the bug,
even though 91 percent were aware of the problem.
</P>
<P>
The problem is with software written to read dates in two
digits, assuming the first two to be "19." In 2000, many programs
will read 1900, causing at least miscalculations, and at worst
outright failure.
</P>
<P>
The cost of fixing it is expected to cost Canada over 12
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Britons Ready to Pay More on Health Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Most people in Britain are
prepared to pay more tax to fund the National Health Service
(NHS), according to a national survey by the BBC.
</P>
<P>
In what is believed to be the biggest UK-wide survey of its
kind in recent times of attitudes towards the NHS, which was
released today, 72 percent of those questioned said they were
satisfied with the NHS, but 63 percent were prepared to pay an
extra 2 percent in income tax to boost NHS funding.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive survey on 4,500 across the country found 70
percent of people were confident of receiving high-quality
treatment, but worries about the amount of money spent on the NHS
were reflected in the fact that 68 percent thought the NHS was
seriously or inadequately funded, with 58 percent believing that
local hospitals were also underfunded.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that waiting for treatment in hospital
is the biggest problem faced by people in the regions.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300,000 people are waiting for operations in the
southeast. Three quarters of them have been waiting up to five
months, the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
The government has promised to pump an extra 1 billion pounds
(1.64 billion US dollars) into new hospitals and grassroots health
care which should help solve the problem.

HANNOVER, Germany, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany's dominant
telecom company, Deutsche Telekom, announced today that it would
launch new complete systems to enable the handling of electronic
business on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
According to Herbert May, a senior manager of Deutsche
Telekom's Global System unit, the so-called "Shop and Mall
Systems" to be launched by the company in a few months, would
offer its business customers, shopowners for example, the
opportunity to operate virtual shopping centers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Internet users will then be able to see and order certain
products presented in the online "shops" and pay the bill by
credit cards also through Internet.
</P>
<P>
Dr. May emphasized that the breakthrough for electronic
commerce on the Internet depended on the introduction of secure
payment systems.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason, our objective... is to support... online
payment systems that provide utmost security, anonymity and
user-friendliness," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. May also announced that Deutsche Telekom has entered into a
strategic cooperation with IBM to develop viable online payment
systems. As the first step, the two companies will conduct a pilot
project based on the SET (Secure Electronic Transaction) standard,
which currently meets highest security requirements.

<HEADLINE> Child Porn Grows on Internet: Professor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The number of Internet sites
devoted to pornography and child porn is growing despite laws
intended to limit them, said a report today.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the success of the online porn industry, virtually
the only Web sites that make money, is driving the development of
technology as consumers demand better monitors and faster Internet
access speeds.
</P>
<P>
"It's quite clear that the number of adult-oriented Web sites
is growing," Dr. Michael Mehta, professor of Canada's Queen's
University, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
There are perhaps 250,000 adult-oriented Web sites, which
constitute less than 2 percent of the total number of Web sites,
said the professor, who is researching the issue.
</P>
<P>
The current laws appear adequate and new laws won't help, he
said in an interview with the Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Internet industry needs to develop voluntary initiatives
and extend the use of filtering software, the professor said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports Indonesia's Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James D.
Wolfensohn Wednesday expressed the bank's support for Indonesia's
economic and financial reforms aimed at overcoming the current
monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the Indonesian government will make joint
efforts to push forward the country's economic reforms which have
obtained support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
other international monetary organizations, Wolfensohn told the
press this evening after meeting with Indonesian President
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
During a 90-minute meeting, they discussed financial
restructuring, problems in the private sector and the social
impact of the monetary crisis in Indonesia, the World Bank chief
said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has committed a 40 billion U.S. dollar bailout package
for Indonesia and 4.5 billion dollars will come from the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Indonesian
government have agreed on amendments to a series of loan
agreements to enhance social impacts, the World Bank chief said
earlier on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The changes include the reduction of requirements for
government matching funds and the authorization of a nationwide
program of emergency, labor-intensive jobs to provide employment
for workers affected by the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The labor-intensive program is intended to create more than 75
million man-days of low-wage jobs during the remainder of 1998.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the changes will accelerate the
disbursement of more than 150 million dollars during 1998, of
which approximately 100 million dollars will be from World Bank
loans, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn, who arrived here Tuesday evening for a three-day
visit, has also consulted with senior government officials and
leaders of the banking and business communities regarding World
Bank assistance in the structural adjustment reforms agreed by the
Indonesian government with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank chief is stressing the role of the bank in
helping the people of Indonesia, to minimize economic hardships
created by the crisis and adjustment process, and especially to
protect the poor," an official of the World Bank team said.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn will leave here Thursday for Manila, the
Philippines, to continue his Southeast Asia tour which has also
taken him to Thailand and Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Meguid: Arab States Against Strike on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said here Wednesday that all Arab
countries are against U.S. military strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving here for Baghdad Wednesday afternoon, the AL
chief told reporters that his mission to Baghdad at the request of
Arab leaders to seek a peaceful solution to the current standoff
between Iraq and the U.N. bears obvious testimony to that.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright that she had rallied enough support from within the
region to kick off a military attack against Iraq if diplomatic
efforts failed to end the crisis over U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has refused to grant inspectors of the U.N. Special
Commission in charge of dismantling Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction access to presidential sites, suspected of hiding
prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
After a brief meeting with Jordan's Foreign Minister Fayez
Tarawneh, Meguid told reporters that he did not believe what
Albright had said, because he was entrusted by the Arab world with
the task of finding a peaceful solution to the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the 22-member pan-Arab organization noted that the
Arab world wanted a peaceful solution to the current crisis and
they asked Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, head of the last Arab
summit, to request him to make such a visit to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
None of the Arab governments was against his mission to Baghdad
and it was impossible for any Arab country to agree with any
military action against Iraq, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Meguid described his mission in Baghdad as
"difficult" but worth the efforts exerted on the level of his
own, of the Arab League as well as of all the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Meguid said that while pressing for a peaceful solution, he
would also emphasized the necessity of Iraqi compliance with the
U.N. Security Council's resolutions during his meetings with
Iraqi leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is dangerous and concerns us greatly, therefore
I will put every possible effort into finding a peaceful
solution," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh described Meguid's mission as a basic one which
enjoyed the support of all member countries of the Arab League and
hoped the AL's efforts would lead to positive results.
</P>
<P>
Meguid's visit to Baghdad came right after that of special
envoys of Russian and French presidents in a bid to mediate a
diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meguid arrived here Wednesday morning en route to Iraq and was
greeted at the airport by Tarawneh, Egyptian Ambassador to Jordan
and Iraqi Charge D'Affaires to Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Informed of Iraqi Proposal to Ease Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Wednesday his Iraqi counterpart Mohammed al-Sahhaf has
briefed him that Iraq agreed to allow the international
inspectors' access into eight presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
Moussa declined to give more details, saying that the phone
call made by al-Sahhaf on Tuesday was "not clear in some of its
parts," the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from talks between President Hosni Mubarak and
visiting Argentine President Carlos Menem, Moussa said that all
details will be disclosed after the return of Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief is on his way to Baghdad for talks with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein in a bid to defuse the crisis over
U.N. arms inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Moussa noted that Iraq had also briefed France and Russia of
its agreement to let international inspectors visit eight
presidential sites without any restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister was due to arrive here Wednesday,
but has rescheduled his visit because of Meguid's visit to Iraq,
Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The American Cable News Network Wednesday reported Iraq would
ask each of the 15 members of the Security Council to appoint five
inspectors, and each of the 21 countries on the U.N. Special
Commission to appoint two more to enter the eight presidential
sites.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi move is largely considered a fresh basis for
resolving the current standoff between Iraq and the Security
Council over Iraq's refusal to give full access to all the sites
where biological and chemical weapons are suspected to be hidden.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi decision, which has not been officially affirmed,
came amid a flurry of diplomatic initiatives from Russia, France,
Turkey and the Arab League to stave off a possible military
confrontation with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Mubarak said Egypt will not join any
potential military action against Iraq if diplomacy fails to
resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is not ready to participate in a military action with
the U.S.. We do not have an aircraft carrier or any other
weapons," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, he urged Baghdad to comply with the U.N. resolutions
to avert a "very dangerous" situation.
</P>
<P>
In view of the current situation, Mubarak said, Egypt is
discussing the necessity of holding an urgent Arab summit with
Arab leaders.

<HEADLINE> New Armenian Parliament Chairman Elected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The deputies of the Armenian
parliament Wednesday elected Khosrov Arutyunian new parliamentary
chairman with 99 votes for, 56 against and 11 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Arutyuian, 50, was
Armenia's prime minister in 1992-1993. Prior to this election he
worked as the prime minister's main adviser.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Babken Ararktsina, the former chairman of
the parliament, resigned his position, saying he could not fulfill
his duties after the parliament accepted the resignation of
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who announced his resignation
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The political crisis in Armenia resulted from differences among
its leadership over ways to settle the Nargorno-Karabakh problem.
Ter-Petrosyan agreed to the plan of the Organization of Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group, which envisages
settling the conflict step by step.
</P>
<P>
But Prime Minister Rubert Kocharian, who is the former
president of Nargorno-Karabakh, disapproves of the OSCE Minsk
Group's plan.
</P>
<P>
Under the Armenian constitution, presidential election will be
held in 40 days after the president's resignation, and during the
vacant time, Arutyunian will be the acting president.

<HEADLINE> World Child Workers Amount to 250 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The total number of child
workers all over the world now stands at a quarter of a billion
and is on the increase, the Financial Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report by the International Labor Office, the
newspaper said that the problem of child labor is particularly
severe in Africa, where the number of child workers is estimated
to increase by a quarter to 100 million by 2015.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that at least 120 million young people
worldwide aged between five and 14 work full-time, and another 130
million children do significant amounts of work in addition to
going to school.
</P>
<P>
It said that 41.4 percent of African children aged between five
and 14 are economically active, compared with 21 percent in Asia,
16.5 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean and 10.4 percent
in the Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Of all the child laborers, just under three-quarters work in
agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that much of child labor is hidden, as they are
spread out in rural areas, small workshops, private enterprises
and domestic service.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for child labor is poverty and children in
Africa contribute between 20 and 25 percent of the family income.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) Ezeddine Laraki
arrived here Wednesday, continuing his efforts in finding ways to
end the current crisis between Iraq and the U.N. over arms
inspection.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Laraki said that his visit to Tehran was
aimed at studying ways to avert possible U.S. military strike on
Iraq, stressing that the resolutions of the United Nations should
be respected and any military action avoided.
</P>
<P>
Washington and London are still seeking support from Arab
countries for their possible military actions against Iraq if
diplomatic means fails to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iran and most Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, a main
U.S. ally in the region, have voiced opposition to any military
actions against Iraq, calling for diplomatic efforts to prevail.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, the present OIC chairman,
called on Laraki to continue efforts to find a peaceful solution
to the Iraqi crisis though coordination with leaders of the
Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
Tehran also urged the Iraqi government to comply with the
U.N. Security Council resolutions in order to prevent others from
abusing any excuses for launching military attacks.

<HEADLINE> UK Drinks Industry Remains Sport's Biggest Sponsor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- British official figures showed
that the value of sports sponsorship deals grew 7 percent last
year and the drinks industry was still the top sponsor of sport.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports Wednesday said that of the record 995
sponsorship deals recorded last year, 163 or 16 percent were
struck with drinks companies.
</P>
<P>
The second largest backer was the motor industry, which was
followed by the sportswear sector, and banking and finance, while
the number of contracts with tobacco firms fell from 34 to 29.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the UK government reiterated its promise
on releasing the figures that it would help sports replace tobacco
sponsorships as it is argued that sport should avoid taking money
from companies whose products might harm consumers' health.

<HEADLINE> UK to Introduce Environment Indicators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- British Environment Minister
Michael Meacher said today the government would monitor the
environmental performance which would be as seriously as it
monitors the state of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Meacher said a series of environmental indices would be
introduced to be regarded as having the same importance as data on
economic growth or unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is that this impacts on the national
consciousness and makes people think, just as they do when
unemployment goes up or interest rates rise," he said.
</P>
<P>
The indicators would look at things like air quality,
biodiversity, pollution, energy efficiency, water conservation and
there would even be a measure reflecting the beauty of the
countryside, he told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Meacher said the new indicators, which may be introduced
towards the end of the year, had to be "drivers of economic and
social change" and to "rival economic statistics which at present
dominate the media."
</P>
<P>
"The real problem with this is that it is more like an archive
than something that is meant to drive political change," the
minister added.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Urged to Tackle Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Canadian businesses have been
urged to make more serious efforts to solve the Year 2000 computer
problem, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
A federal task force recommended that Canadian businesses
should be cut off from loans, insurance policies and government
financing unless they come up with a formal plan to deal with the
millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
In its report titled A Call for Action, the task force
suggested that "all lending institutions should require formal
Year 2000 action plans from all corporate borrowers as a
prerequisite for loans" beginning April 1.
</P>
<P>
And insurance companies should make issuing or renewing
insurance policies conditional on a formal action plan, it said.
</P>
<P>
It also proposed that the federal government allow smaller
firms to deduct the bulk of their Year 2000-related expenses this
year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the group said that the government should change
its immigration rules to speed up the entry into Canada of any
computer programmers or other immigrants with Year 2000 skills.
</P>
<P>
An Ottawa-based think tank, the Conference Board of Canada,
warned in a separate report issued Tuesday that failure to deal
immediately with the millennium bug could throw Canada into a
recession in the first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada reported recently that only 9 percent of
Canadian businesses had a formal plan for dealing with the bug,
even though 91 percent were aware of the problem.
</P>
<P>
The problem is with software written to read dates in two
digits, assuming the first two to be "19." In 2000, many programs
will read 1900, causing at least miscalculations, and at worst
outright failure.
</P>
<P>
The cost of fixing it is expected to cost Canada over 12
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Britons Ready to Pay More on Health Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Most people in Britain are
prepared to pay more tax to fund the National Health Service
(NHS), according to a national survey by the BBC.
</P>
<P>
In what is believed to be the biggest UK-wide survey of its
kind in recent times of attitudes towards the NHS, which was
released today, 72 percent of those questioned said they were
satisfied with the NHS, but 63 percent were prepared to pay an
extra 2 percent in income tax to boost NHS funding.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive survey on 4,500 across the country found 70
percent of people were confident of receiving high-quality
treatment, but worries about the amount of money spent on the NHS
were reflected in the fact that 68 percent thought the NHS was
seriously or inadequately funded, with 58 percent believing that
local hospitals were also underfunded.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that waiting for treatment in hospital
is the biggest problem faced by people in the regions.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300,000 people are waiting for operations in the
southeast. Three quarters of them have been waiting up to five
months, the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
The government has promised to pump an extra 1 billion pounds
(1.64 billion US dollars) into new hospitals and grassroots health
care which should help solve the problem.

<HEADLINE> China Remains World's Biggest Zinc Producer in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- China's position as the world's
biggest zinc producer was reinforced last year as the country
increased its output of the metal by almost 19 percent, the
Financial Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing figures from the International Lead and Zinc Study
Group, the newspaper said that China's output of zinc increased to
1.41 million tons last year, equivalent to almost one-fifth of the
global total.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China boosted its exports of zinc by 158 percent,
and as a result, there was a slight supply surplus last year on
the global zinc market.
</P>
<P>
World consumption of zinc rose 2.8 percent last year to 7.73
million tons while production of refined zinc rose by 4 percent to
just over that level.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that after 12 years of continuous growth,
Asia's economic slowdown caused last year a 28 percent drop in
Thailand's zinc consumption and a 1.4 percent fall in South
Korea's.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls Upon All Nations to Promote Olympic Ideals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic ideals
resemble those of the United Nations in seeking peace and
understanding among nations and people, UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said today.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the XVIII Olympic Winter Games to be held in
Nagano, Japan, from February 7-22, 1998, Annan said the flying of
the United Nations flag at all Olympic events is a visible
remainder of the purpose shared between the United Nations and the
International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said the Olympic Truce, an ancient
tradition calling for all hostilities to cease during Olympic
Games, expresses mankind's perennial aspiration to peace, goodwill
and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said that the overwhelming reaffirmation of the
Olympic Truce by the 52nd General Assembly of the United Nations
recommitted member states to taking fresh steps towards the
promotion of human rights, constructive dialogue and the search
for durable and just solutions to contemporary problems.
</P>
<P>
Annan said this message is more than a symbol, and it expresses
the international community' real desire for a peace world united
against violence.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general called upon all nations to observe the
Olympic Truce and to promote the Olympic Ideals.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Oppose Use of Force Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
Wednesday expressed Palestine's rejection of the use of force
against Iraq, saying that the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
was seeking a solution to the crisis through diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency, Azzam Al-Ahmed, PNA
Minister of Public Works, said President Yasser Arafat had
informed U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright during her
recent visit to the region of Palestine's opposition to military
strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told Albright that the PNA supported all diplomatic
efforts to resolve the crisis, and Palestine welcomed the Russian
initiative to defuse the crisis, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahmed described the visit of Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid to Iraq as a "forceful" factor in the face of
U.S. threats, and that it reflected inter-Arab rejection of any
form of aggression against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to give any details about the Palestinian
initiative or his contacts with Iraqi officials, or whether he
would be meeting with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to convey
Arafat's letter. He just said he was in Baghdad to help seek a
solution to the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iraqi News Agency reported that Saadoun Hammadi,
Speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly, had received Al-Ahmed and
briefed him on Iraq's stance on the crisis, praising Palestinian
solidarity with Iraq in confronting the continued U.N. embargo and
U.S. threats.
</P>
<P>
The agency also reported that AL Chief Abdel-Meguid arrived at
the Iraqi borders Wednesday from Jordan on his first visit to
Baghdad since assuming taking office in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Meguid was on a mission entrusted to him by Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, current chairman of the Arab summit, to seek a
peaceful solution of the current Baghdad-Washington crisis to
avert a U.S. military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here say that the current developments
indicate that Iraq has responded to certain proposals submitted by
a number of mediators to end the crisis which was triggered off by
Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. weapons inspectors access to Iraqi
presidential palaces on ground of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi presidential palaces are suspected of hiding banned
weapons.

<HEADLINE> Feed Grains Outlook to Remain Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 4 (Xinhua) -- World demand for feed grains
is expected to rise in the next decade as the market for meat,
milk and egg products will remain strong, a U.S. study predicted.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide consumption of coarse grains may jump to 1.1 billion
tons by 2006 from 837 million tons in the early 1990s, the Journal
of Commerce today quoted a study by the U.S. Feed Grains Council
as saying.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the demand growth, the council said in its World
Feed Grains Demand Forecast, feed grains' share of the world's
major crop area harvested is expected to increase from 39.3
percent in 1997 to 40.2 percent by 2006.
</P>
<P>
The financial problems in Southeast Asia are expected to limit
feed grains imports from the United States this year and next, but
things would change in the years ahead, the council said.

<HEADLINE> mee020424hke - No Talks with Washington: Iran's Supreme Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 4 (Xinhua) - Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei Wednesday reiterated his rejection to any talks or
ties with the United States, stressing that Tehran would never bow
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
"Any retreat in front of the U.S. will encourage it to make
more aggressions," Khamenei told members of the Experts Assembly,
a body that determines the country's supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
According to Tehran radio, he cited a saying of Iran's late
spiritual leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini that "Our relations
with the U.S. are the kind of relations between wolf and sheep,
due to the wolf nature of the U.S."
</P>
<P>
Talks and ties with the U.S. as "harmful" for Iran, Khamenei
said, adding there is no benefit for Iran to hold talks and
establish relations with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Khamenei ruled out an Iranian-U.S. rapprochement,
following the country's president, Mohammad Khatami, called for
cultural dialogue between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton responded on January 29 that he
expected more exchanges between the two peoples and good relations
between the two countries in the future.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here saw signs of changes in the policies of both Iran
and the U.S., and some even claimed Iran has shown flexibility in
its stance on the Middle East peace process, which it repeatedly
announced to oppose to.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright recently announced a
"wait and watch" policy towards relations with Iran while her
Iranian counterpart, Kamal Kharrazi, stated "Iran is awaiting
changes of behaviors from the U.S."
</P>
<P>
It is believed there is going to be a long process of
bargaining before the two sides can somewhat improve their
relations strained since Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Central African
Republic has responded positively today to the recommendations by
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan concerning the establishment of a
peacekeeping operation in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Kofi Annan's recommendations for a peacekeeping operation
that would replace the Inter-African Mission to Monitor the
Implementation of the Bangui Agreement (MISAB) have my full
agreement," President Ange-Felix Patasse wrote in a letter to the
president of the Security Council released today.
</P>
<P>
The Bangui Agreement, signed in January 1997, constitutes the
framework for achieving national reconciliation in the Central
African Republic. They call, in part, for the formation of a
government of national union; the adoption of an amnesty law;
disarmament; and the organization of a national reconciliation
conference.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, the UN chief said the
primary purpose of the proposed United Nations force in the
Central African Republic would be to maintain the security
established by the MISAB and create an environment conducive to
holding elections in August or September.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Parliament Condemns Any Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's 80-member House of
Representatives Wednesday issued a statement denouncing any threat
to use force against Iraq .
</P>
<P>
The statement issued after a special session in presence of
cabinet members insisted that dialogue and diplomacy should be
adopted to end the current standoff between Iraq and the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating Iraqi
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered off by Iraqi refusal to allow
U.N. arms inspectors access to its presidential palaces where
prohibited weapons are suspected to be hidden.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives also called on the U.N. Security
Council and the Iraqi government to seek a reasonable and
acceptable solution that would guarantee the implementation of the
council's resolutions as well as the protection of Iraq's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Diplomacy to end the Iraqi-UNSCOM standoff is picking up steam
as special envoys of Russian and French presidents pay visits to
Baghdad. The Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid was
also on a mission to Baghdad in a bid to seek a peaceful solution
to the current Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has softened its stand by inviting members of the
U.S. Congress to accompany weapons experts on a visit to eight
presidential sites, but the U.S. still insisted on its decision to
start a military attack against Iraq in case diplomatic efforts
fail to end the crisis.

JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- King Mswati III of
Swaziland said Wednesday he will introduce multi-party elections
in the country, if the Constitutional Review Commission
recommends so.
</P>
<P>
The king made the remarks when he was speaking in an interview
with British journalists at his palace near the capital, Mbabane,
the Southern African Broadcasting Association reported.
</P>
<P>
He said Swaziland recognizes the need for political reforms
because the whole world is changing. However, he added, the move
must be initiated by the Swazi people themselves.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old monarch said Swaziland belongs to southern
Africa and cannot work in isolation. It needs assistance from its
neighbors, he said.
</P>
<P>
A constitutional review commission has been touring Swaziland
since last June to hear people's views on whether the country
should introduce a democratic system of government or continue as
a traditional monarchy.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland, with less than one million population, is the only
country in southern Africa which has not introduced multi-party
democratic system.

al-Assad, Nouri highlighted the necessity to activate resolutions
adopted by the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) summit
in Tehran in December.

MOSCOW, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States has no plan

</P>
<P>
The American embassy was authorized to make the statement in
view of some reports of mass media about that the United States

"If any country launched attack on the U.S., on our allied
countries or our military forces with chemical and biological
weapons, our answer to the attack would be instantly, strongly and
crushingly," said the American embassy in the statement.
</P>
<P>

ANKARA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said Wednesday that the current
Iraqi crisis should be solved through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
Sezgin made the remark to reporters aboard the plane on his
way home from visits to Bosnia and France, the Anatolia News
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
"We want the problem (between Iraq and the United States) be
solved by peaceful means," Sezgin said, adding that using force is
the last option when an issue can not be settled peacefully.
</P>
<P>
When asked how Turkey will react in case Israel is attacked by
Iraq, Sezgin said "our agreement with Israel is of military
training nature and is not directed on a third country."
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the weapons of mass destruction of
Iraq, if Iraq has, should be destroyed because they pose a threat
to the security of the regional countries, including Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"The removal of weapons (of mass destruction) will provide
peace and stability in the Middle East," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, accompanied by a group of
officials from his ministry and the military, left for Baghdad
Wednesday afternoon on a mission aimed at easing the
Iraqi-U.S. standoff.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press at the airport, Cem said the main
purpose of his trip is to try to find a solution to the current
crisis which may lead to a new war in the region.
</P>
<P>
Cem's departure was delayed for one hour as the small plane
had been replaced with a Boeing 737 jet.
</P>
<P>
This bigger aircraft will fly home Turkish diplomats and their
families in Baghdad when it returns to Ankara Thursday night,
informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. warplanes stationed in the Incirlik air base in
southern Turkey, including F-15s, F-16s as well as KC-15 tanker
aircraft, conducted frequent taking-off and landing flights on

</P>
<P>
Local private television stations said that these jets had
been loaded with air-to-ground missiles and bombs.
</P>
<P>
The Incirlik air base was used by the Western allies in their
missions against Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War following the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry, however, said that so far it had not
received request from the United States to use this air base in
case of a possible military strike against Iraq.

LAGOS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The situation of the 9,500
Sierra Leone refugees who fled to neighboring Liberia since the
country's civil war began in early 1990s is getting worse, with
growing rate of death from various diseases.
</P>
<P>
According to a refugee spokesman, between eight and 10
persons, mostly children, die every week during the Ramadan of
diseases including malaria, diarrhoea and respiratory infections.
</P>
<P>
The most serious problem for the refugees in a camp about 10
km northwest of the Liberian capital Monrovia is short of food,
he said, quoted by the British Broadcasting Corporation today.
</P>
<P>
A large number of the refugees slept on the bare floor because
of the lack of blankets.
</P>
<P>
Despite the poor conditions, high birth rate has been another
problem in the refugee camp, according to aid workers.
</P>
<P>
Between 20 and 25 babies are born each week, an aid worker
said, adding that they have recorded 3,000 successful births in
the camp since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Most of the refugees are longing for getting back home, the

DAR ES SALAAM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Shortage of blood has
posed serious threats to patients admitted to the Muhimbili
Medical Center (MMC), a major health institution in the Tanzanian
capital of Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The MMC's blood donor organizer, Bonface Mwarabu, revealed
that the center's blood bank has only six units (three litres) in
reserve by Wednesday, against a daily demand of 60 units on
average.
</P>
<P>
When natural disasters or serious motor vehicle accidents take
place, the average demand could shoot up by 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Mwarabu said that the center has used up all reserves
of blood of "O" species which is on the highest demand,
endangering accident victims, anaemic children, delivering
mothers and those undergoing operations.
</P>
<P>
The center has also run short of reserves of other blood
species, with only three units of "B" and one unit of "AB"
species, despite the fact that 31 relatives of the patients have
offered to donate blood since the beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
The health official has appealed to the public to make more
blood donations to save patients in critical condition.

criticizing the country's extension of the state of emergency,
saying Zambia will not accept foreign interference.
</P>
<P>
Zambia News Broadcasting Corporation Limited (ZNBC) quoted a
spokesman from Ministry of Foreign Affairs as saying in a
statement released in the capital that Zambia is a sovereign
state and will not allow the governments of donors to suspend the
on-going investigations into last October's abortive coup.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government will not accept directives from any
foreign government or any other cooperating partner to suspend
the investigations into the coup, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that while the government appreciates the concerns
raised about the prolonged investigations, the intention is to
enable the police to carry out a thorough job without
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
As for the state of emergency declared by President Frederick
Chiluba following the military coup attempt and renewed for
another three months by the parliament last week, the spokesman
said it is justified and not meant to victimize innocent people.
</P>
<P>
He assured concerned countries that since the state of
emergency was declared, no single citizen or foreign resident in
Zambia has had their human rights abused.
</P>
<P>
He described the criticisms by the U.S. and EU as "highly
regrettable" and "unacceptable", adding that "the approach is
likely to cause adverse effect on the majority of Zambians."
</P>
<P>
Last week, the U.S. and EU expressed their disappointment over
the extension of the state of emergency and called for a speedy
trial of the coup-related suspects.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Calls for Firm U.K.-Zimbabwe Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Industry and
Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira Wednesday urged Zimbabwe and
the United Kingdom to continue strengthening their economic
cooperation in order to boost trade and investment between them.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the first ever four-day U.K.-Zimbabwe
Cooperation Week, the minister said the trend of trade between
the two countries had continued to increase over the year.
</P>
<P>
"Exports to U.K. comprising of beef, tobacco, sugar and
minerals increased from 2.07 billion Zimbabwean Dollars in 1994
to 2.5 billion Zimbabwean Dollars last year," he said, adding it
was important to keep the strong trading relationship existing
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Currently one U.S. Dollar equals 18 Zimbabwean Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports from the U.K. amounted to 2.2 billion Zimbabwean
Dollars during the past year, and these included machinery, motor
vehicles and motor vehicle kits, electrical and pharmaceutical
products.
</P>
<P>
U.K. was Zimbabwe's largest foreign investor, and of late
there had been a lot of investments stimulated by, among others,
investment conferences.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 12 months, 122 projects had been approved by the
Zimbabwe Investment Center, out of which 29 percent were British
owned and the remainder were of mixed ownership.
</P>
<P>
The Cooperation Week with the theme "partnership for progress"
is designed to promote trade and cultural links between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> OAU's Peace-Preserving Makes Good Start, Official  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Ibrahim Dagash, Head of
Press and Information and spokesman of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), has said that the OAU has "a very good
start" in preserving peace in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Dagash said, "when it was
introduced in 1993 the OAU mechanism for conflict prevention,
management and resolution meant to help the continent to sustain
socio-economic development because you can not have development
without having peace, stability and security."
</P>
<P>
The OAU mechanism, in place for about four years, is having a
very good start in its endeavors to preserve peace in Africa,
Dagash said.
</P>
<P>
He described Liberia as "one story of success for the OAU" in
peace making in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Since Liberian civil war broke out in 1989, nearly 200,000
people have been killed and millions of people made homeless.
With the mediation of the Economic Community of West African
Countries (ECOWAS), the Liberian people held an election last
July and this was followed by the formation of an elected
government there.
</P>
<P>
On the Somali conflict, Dagash said "we see light at the
tunnel" because there is an agreement reached by the two main
factions, Aideed and Ali Mahdi.
</P>
<P>
According to Cairo Agreement reached by the conflicting Somali
factions, a national reconciliation conference will be held on
the coming February 15, 1998 at Baidoa to discuss the formation
of a national unity government long awaited by the Somali people.
</P>
<P>
Dagash said that Somali conflict is a concern of OAU. Since
the country had no central government after 1991, the OAU had
decided to keep the seat of Somalia in the OAU vacuum until the
parties to the conflict in Somali agree on the government of
national unity.
</P>
<P>
He recalled the efforts to peace making in Somalia since 1991
by the OAU and African countries. When President Babangida of
Nigeria was the executive chairman of the OAU in 1991-92, OAU
sent missions to Somalia, and OAU secretary general also sent
several envoys to that country.
</P>
<P>
The OAU head contacted with all factions particularly the two
main factions of Aideed and Ali Mahdi.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister of Ethiopia Meles Zenawi was also mandated
by African leaders to follow the Somalia question.
</P>
<P>
When he became the OAU executive chairman in 1995 and after,
he sent a team of elderly people of Ethiopia's Somali origin to
negotiate in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
This was followed again by the Sodere meeting here in Ethiopia
which was attended by 26 faction leaders with a view to finding a
solution to Somali conflict.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the southern Sudan civil war, which broke out
in 1983, he said that it could not be ended through military
means and that there should be a negotiable solution.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) took
the initiative to solve the problem in southern Sudan and the OAU
is very much supportive of that.
</P>
<P>
He said that the OAU secretary general will make every effort
possible to see that the IGAD initiative is workable.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the situation in Sierra Leone where some military
men took power with force on May 25, 1997, Dagash said that OAU
took a very firm stand of not recognizing the junta government
because it overthrew a legitimate and democratically elected
government.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS and countries of the region have agreed in Conakry,
to have a time table for the return of power to the
democratically elected president in April 1998.

<P>
HARARE, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Wednesday said his government upholds the "One China"
principle and stand on not having official political and
diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when outgoing Chinese ambassador to
Zimbabwe Liu Guijin bade farewell to him at his office in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe stressed, "we support the Chinese government's policy
on Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The president also told Liu that Hong Kong had returned to
China from the British colonial rule. "We support the China's
policy on Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe highly praised the traditional friendship between
Zimbabwe and China. He expressed his thanks over the support and
assistance China gave Zimbabwe during its liberation struggle and
after independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
He said, "China is Zimbabwe's reliable friend."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe added Zimbabwe and China share similar views on many
international issues. He hoped the two countries would further
promote cooperation in the international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who had been in Zimbabwe for the past two years, will
leave here for home Thursday. He told journalists after the
meeting that he would be taking a new post in the Chinese Foreign
Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Agreement Expected on Sawimbi's Bodyguards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- An agreement over the number of
the bodyguards of Jonas Savimbi, head of the former rebel -- the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), is
expected in a few days.
</P>
<P>
Artur Vinama, head of the delegation for the talks over
Savimbi's bodyguards revealed the news here Wednesday at the
Luanda airport, after negotiation with the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
Vinama said that UNITA is taking a flexible stand on this
question and wished the government could have similar attitude.
</P>
<P>
UNITA is working on the new procedures on other unsettled
issues, he said, adding that UNITA has made great effort to
materialize final peace in the country and the government should
do the same.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the two sides have reached in principle
over the issue of Savimbi's bodyguards, deciding to have his
squad of bodyguards limited at 400 people in the initial stage,
but still apart in the final number of 15 persons as outlined in
the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
While the government insists on cutting Savimbi's bodyguards
to 15 within three to four months, UNITA holds firmly that 18
months should be the proper length for the cut-down, saying that
UNITA could shorten the time in accordance with the development
of the situation.

<HEADLINE> Japan Retracts Proposing Kigali's Talks with Hutu Militia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Government has
retracted the proposal made by its Ambassador to Rwanda with
residence in Nairobi, Shinsuke Hariuchi, of Kigali's opening
talks with Hutu extremists.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made last week at the occasion of the
exchange of notes for food aid to Rwanda, according to a
dispatch sent by Rwanda News Agency to Xinhua Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Ambassador urged the Rwandan government to sit
down and talk with Hutu militia behind the wave of violence in
its northwest.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government had immediately reacted and protested
against the call for its negotiations with extremist groups which
it accuses of perpetuating the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
"Some expressions such as `negotiations' were not appropriate,
and it was regrettable that they brought about misunderstanding,"
a statement by the government of Japan that said Wednesday,
according to news reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The statement further corrects the Japanese Envoy's speech,
saying that his real intention was to convey the position of the
Japanese government that "it hopes that the government of Rwanda
takes further efforts toward national reconciliation and other
measures toward stabilization of its domestic situation."
</P>
<P>
According to the new statement, the Japanese government
considers Rwanda's stability crucial to the peace and stability
in the whole Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
However, the Japanese government never took the position that
Rwandan authorities should negotiate with Hutu rebels, the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Trying to Curb Vine Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Department
of Agriculture and Land Affairs said Wednesday it was trying to
find out a solution to the "slow-die-back" disease threatening
vines in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Slow-die-back is a phenomenon that the Agricultural Research
Council is aware of, and continues to research to conclusively
identify causes and remedial action," Minister Derek Hanekom said
in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The disease, caused by a fungus known as black goo, was not
new, agricultural experts said, saying that factors such as
environmental conditions, horticultural practices and harmful
organism, contributed to slow-die-back.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is well-known for its grape production and wine
industry.
</P>
<P>
Hanekom cautioned farmers not to blame the disease on the
fungus alone, as this could lead to dangerous and costly
assumptions being made.
</P>
<P>
Affected farmers should contact the agricultural department or
the research council concerned for technical assistance in
identifying the cause of the disease, and possible remedial
action, he said.
</P>
<P>
The wine and vine industries can rest assured that the
department and the council are committed to finding solutions to
the problems they encounter in the industry," Hanekom noted.

MOGADISHU, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The people of Mogadishu
walked from every corner of the capital Wednesday to the main
soccer stadium to attend the largest gathering with all the main
faction leaders and politicians.
</P>
<P>
Since Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning, vehicles with
loud speakers have been circulating in every street of the
capital, urging the people to attend the big gathering as lorries
were also made ready to pick up people and send them to the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60,000 people have gathered at the stadium and its
surrounding areas to witness and listen to the speeches.
</P>
<P>
Somalia's most prominent religious leader, Sheikh Mohamed
Moallim Hassan, who spoke on behalf of Somalia's religious
communities read versus from the Koran telling people not to miss
this great opportunity in making peace to Mogadishu and Somalia
in general.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Mohamed Aidid who spoke on behalf of the chairpersons
of the Committee for Coordinating the Nation also made a short
speech at the rally.
</P>
<P>
Aidid has called on the Somalis to follow the footsteps of the
Hawiye people in reconciling and forget all the former grudges
and differences.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the people to double their efforts in
establishing Mogadishu's administration body and opening the sea
port and airport in the capital soon.
</P>
<P>
Aidid has also reiterated the need to make good preparations
for the Baidoa conference in mid February in which a government
of national unity will be formed.
</P>
<P>
During the speeches, all fellow politicians and former rivals
including Ali Mahdi Mohamed, Osman Sli Atto, Mohamed Qanyare
Afrah, Abdi Osman Farah and Abdulkadir Aden Zoppo many of whom
had not been to this stadium for more than seven years now were
present at the peace gathering today.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of battle wagons and thousands of militiamen were
also there for the security of their leaders and the people.
</P>
<P>
As the gathering ended, the faction leaders got onto their
technical wagons to tour together the capital's main streets.
</P>
<P>
These roads, including Makah Al-Mukarramah street in the war
ravaged area of Bernuda, have not been used for years.
</P>
<P>
Along the streets, hundreds of people, waving green leaves,
white flags and the nations emblems, were lined up to greet the
politicians. The convoy of these technical wagons with the main
faction leaders has ended up at the residence of Ali Mahdi
Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's gathering has been the largest since the down fall
of the late regime Siad Barre in 1991 and so has the event today
in which militiamen and battle wagons of all factions in the
capital have intermingled with one and another.
</P>
<P>
According to top aids of the politicians, serious work will
begin from Thursday on to establish Mogadishu's administration
and the modalities in which the airport and sea port would reopen
and operate.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Iran to Resume Direct Flights: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Iran are expected to
resume direct flights between the two capitals this summer for
the first time in 18 years, a Jordanian official said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Royal Jordanian (RJ), the national air carrier, and the
Iranian Airlines (IA) has signed an agreement in Tehran on air
transport cooperation, which paved the way for resumption of
direct flights between Amman and Tehran, RJ Deputy Director of
Commercial Affairs Majdi Sabri told Jordan's official news agency.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of direct flights between Amman and Tehran would
further enhance bilateral cooperation between the two countries,
said Sabri, who earlier led a delegation to Tehran for talks on
air transportation cooperation and just returned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Once direct flights are resumed, said Sabri, the RJ would be
able to operate two regular flights a week from Amman to Tehran
and IA would operate the same number from Tehran to Amman.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of flights was expected to increase the number
of tourists to religious sites in Jordan and boost the exchange of
goods between Jordan and Iran, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two sides first agreed to restore flights between their
capitals on the sideline of the annual meeting of the
International Air Transport Association (IATA) in Amman last
November.
</P>
<P>
Direct flights between the two countries were suspended in 1980
when bilateral ties were severed after Jordan announced its
support to Iraq in its war against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian-Iranian ties were resumed in 1991 and improved when
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan participated in the Islamic summit
in Tehran last December. This has been the first visit by a
Jordanian leader to Iran since the Iranian Islamic revolution in
1979.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans to Set up New Defense Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
is planning to set up a new defense fund to pay millions of
dollars in lawyer fees being run up by the Monica Lewinsky scandal
and other legal issues, the White House said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry told reporters the
fund proposal was being reviewed by White House lawyers before
being sent to Clinton for his approval.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had 3 million
dollars in legal bills as of late December, when he agreed to
dissolve a previous fund that had failed to attract sufficient
contributions.
</P>
<P>
The expenses have grown even larger in the last two weeks as
special prosecutor Kenneth Starr began investigation charges
Clinton had an affair with former White House intern Lewinsky and
encouraged her to deny it under oath -- allegations that Clinton
has repeatedly denied.
</P>
<P>
Starr's grand jury met again on Wednesday, but it was not
immediately known whether the panel would hear from a witness or
review documents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the Secret Service, which guards
the president, declined to comment on a CBS television report that
Starr was seeking a list of agents who were on duty on specific
dates, apparently to question any agents who might have
information related to Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
A review by the agency found no agent who had witnessed any
impropriety between Clinton and Lewinsky, and the Secret Service
spokeswoman again declined to comment, CBS said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed Maintains Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The policy-makers of the
U.S. Federal Reserve Wednesday decided to leave short-term
interest rates unchanged, waiting and watching how much Asian
financial crisis would affect U.S. economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Open Market Committee concluded its two-day meeting
by leaving the benchmark rate on overnight loans between banks at
5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The interest rates have maintained steady at the level since
last March, when the body raised it a quarter percentage point
higher, expressing concern that the rapid economic expansion at
the time would result in increased inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's decision was widely anticipated and financial markets
showed little reaction.
</P>
<P>
However, in early October, the Fed seemed to be considering an
additional rate increase to prevent labor shortages and
accelerating wage gains from pushing up prices. But since then,
the prospect of a flood of cheap imports from East Asia has put
the Fed firmly on hold.
</P>
<P>
On October 8, last year, the Fed Chairman Greenspan told
Congress tight labor markets suggested the economy was on an
"unsustainable track" and that re-emerging inflation was "without
question the greatest threat to... a balanced economic expansion."
</P>
<P>
But, last Thursday, he said policy-makers must be vigilant both
for higher inflation and for "shortfalls in demand... that would
press the disinflation process too far, too fast."

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday dismissed as "short of the standard" a reported proposal
by Iraq to end the crisis over weapons inspections by opening up
eight sites for monitoring.
</P>
<P>
The CNN said earlier on Wednesday that Iraq had proposed to
open up eight presidential sites to inspections by U.N.
representatives for one month.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Iraq seemed
to be moving toward accepting that its ban on visits to some
sites was untenable.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis seem to be moving towards some recognition that
the blocking of so-called 'presidential sites' is untenable," he
said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed the proposal would "fall short of the
standard of full and unfettered access for the U.N. ... and that
is the standard which must be met."

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Sends Letters to UN, UK, US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides has sent letters to U.N. chief, U.S. and British leaders
and asked them to persuade Turkey to change its negative stance on
Cyprus problem before new efforts for a settlement begin.
</P>
<P>
The letters were addressed to U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan, U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, Clerides said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Clerides said he reiterated in his
letters that before the new round of talks begins, they (Annan,
Clinton and Blair) have to strongly encourage Turkey to change its
positions on the Cyprus problem in order to make the negotiations
fruitful.
</P>
<P>
A new round of negotiations to solve the protracted Cyprus
problem is expected to begin after Cyprus' presidential elections
this month.
</P>
<P>
Clerides described the letters as a "preemptive move" he
considered necessary because of the Turkish Cypriots' refusal to
participate in the new round of Cyprus peace talks. The Turkish
Cypriots demanded for recognition of their breakaway Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus declared in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Clerides disclosed that Annan had told British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook in a recent meeting in London that he would
send his special envoy Diego Cordovez to Cyprus after the
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez had chaired two rounds of direct talks between the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides in the summer of 1997, but the
talks deadlocked after the European Union decided to open
accession talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the divided
island as a bizonal, bicommunal federation through peace talks,
but so far no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Financial Body Saddened by Mandela's Failure to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The South African Society
of Banking Officials (SASBO), a union representing all big banks
in the country, was saddened Wednesday by President Nelson
Mandela's failure to respond to its appeal for his personal
intervention in rampant cash-in-transit robberies.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Mandela on Monday, SASBO General Secretary
Graeme Rowan said the cash-in-transit industry was in a "crisis
situation" and the president should lend his personal help to the
uphill combat against the increasingly rampant cash robberies.
</P>
<P>
As a reply, the ruling African National Congress (ANC) said
Wednesday that SASBO's call was "rather misdirected", indicating
that the responsibility for cash losses rested with security
companies which did not take adequate security measures.
</P>
<P>
"It would be unfortunate if a perception were to develop that
these security companies appear to attempt to maximize profits by
cutting on costs including sacrificing security measures around
their personnel," the ANC statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It is rather disturbing that despite the number of robberies
of cash-in-transit, the security companies continue to transport
cash in vehicles which are not secured or not even made to resist
the kind of attacks that they have been subjected to before."
</P>
<P>
Responding to the ANC statement, Rowan said security companies
and their owners, which pay billions of Rand of taxes to the
government annually, "deserve some presidential help in their
hour of need."
</P>
<P>
"This is a life and death situation. The government cannot run
away from their responsibilities to protect businesses and the
public at large from the rampant crime and bloody massacres that
are plaguing our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to SASBO, the joint bank security company, SBV,
which is South Africa's largest cash transporter and delivers
money across the country, had been robbed of 70 million Rand
(about 14 million U.S. Dollars) in 23 hijackings last year.
</P>
<P>
Eleven security guards lost their lives and several others
were injured in the heists.
</P>
<P>
Rowan said SBV security employees were so traumatized -- also
under pressure from their families -- that they were on the brink
of refusing to deliver cash.
</P>
<P>
SASBO blamed the Safety and Security Ministry, the police and
other government agencies for "wrongly inadequate" efforts to
curb the heists.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Propose "Soft Money" Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers at the Federal
Election Commission (FEC) have proposed barring political parties
from raising huge unregulated "soft money" donations, a step that
could greatly affect current campaign financing system in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The fast-growing "soft money," accounted for a record 262
million dollars for Democrats and Republicans in 1996. It is the
most controversial issue in the campaign funding overhaul drive.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal issued by the FEC general counsel's office,
national committees of both parties could no longer take five- and
six-figure checks from wealthy supporters, denying them millions
of dollars that they now use to pay for television ads, voter
drives and administrative expenses.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and several lawmakers urged the FEC
last summer to prohibit soft money as a bipartisan campaign
finance bill banning soft money languished in Congress.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, released in late January, is the agency's first
response to the requests.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has praised the lawyers' proposal Tuesday and urged the
FEC to approve it.
</P>
<P>
Though he opposes soft money, Clinton has helped the Democratic
Party raise millions of dollars in donations, saying the party
must compete with Republican fund raising.
</P>
<P>
"I ask the members of the commission to step up to their
responsibility and act, within their legal authority, to end the
soft- money system," the president said.
</P>
<P>
There is no certainty, however, the commission will act -- or
even has authority to do so.
</P>
<P>
The FEC will decide on later this month whether to put the
proposal out for public comment, change it or study it further.
</P>
<P>
"They don't have the authority, and it would be
unconstitutional," said Cliff May, spokesman for the Republican
National Committee, which opposes a soft money ban.
</P>
<P>
But campaign finance experts reportedly called the proposal "a
significant first step" towards dealing with the question of
whether soft money, viewed by critics as a way special interest
groups influence politics, should be allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
Election laws permit soft money to be used for party building
activities that foster grass-roots participation in politics, such
as local get-out-the-vote drives and voter registration programs.
It can't be used to pay for campaigns or to influence federal
elections.
</P>
<P>
But FEC lawyers said national party committees have employed
various techniques and exploited loopholes in the agency's own
rules to use soft money to help federal candidates.
</P>
<P>
FEC lawyers proposed that political parties pay all their
expenses with "hard money" raised from donors whose contributions
are regulated by federal law. Individuals are allowed to give up
to 25,000 dollars a year to parties and up to 2,000 dollars to
candidates each election cycle.

<HEADLINE> Greece Calls for Peaceful Solution to Crisis With Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece hoped to see a peaceful
solution to the crisis with Iraq over arms inspection by the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), Greek government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the visit by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
for European Affairs Mark Grossman, Reppas said that Grossman had
not requested Greece's assistance in any possible military actions
which might be conducted against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Athens favored the implementation of the U.N.
Security Council resolutions and opposed the use of weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, Grossman discussed here on Tuesday
with Greece's Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos the recent
crisis with Iraq, and the later said that all diplomatic efforts
must be exhausted for a peaceful settlement of the Iraqi problem.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred the arms inspectors of the UNSCOM in charge of
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction from searching
presidential palaces suspected of hiding banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have threatened to launch
military strikes at Baghdad to force Iraq to comply with U.N.
resolutions and to allow arms inspectors free access to any
suspected sites including those presidential palaces in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> EU Sets Conditions for Eastern European Applicants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, today adopted a list of
musts for its 10 eastern European applicant countries to become EU
members.
</P>
<P>
The proposed "accession partnerships" (AP) include things the
EU hopefuls have to do by the end of 1998 and in the longer term
to stay on track for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
The Commission told the applicants that they would be expected
to submit detailed plans by the end of March about exactly how
they are going to meet the demands and indicate the staff and
financial resources they are going to make available.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive noted in a statement that the AP were a key
element of the EU's enhanced pre-accession strategy and covered
"for each applicant the priorities to be observed in adopting the
Union's and also the financial resources available for that
purpose."
</P>
<P>
The AP, tailored to each eastern applicant, will underpin the
EU membership process and condition financial aid the EU will make
available to help the 10 meet the many difficult demands of EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders agreed in Luxembourg in December to put Poland, the
Czech Republic, Hungary, Estonia and Slovenia and the
Mediterranean island of Cyprus on the fast track to EU membership.
</P>
<P>
They also decided that Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria, the other five considered to be on the slow track, could
join the EU expansion process when it is launched on March 30, but
at their own pace.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's remarks on Iraqi crisis had been "distorted", Russian
Envoy to the United Nations Sergei Lavrov said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov was responding to a a question about earlier reports
that Russian President Yeltsin had said any U.S. military strike
against Iraq could lead to a world war.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very unfortunate distortion of the entire
exchange. He was reacting to the reports in the media here that
officials here do not exclude the use of tactical nuclear weapons
against Iraq," Lavrov told the press.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov said talk of possible use of nuclear weapons was the
"some kind of unfortunate public media diplomacy which had
already caused emotions in Israel, and everybody should avoid
making such speculative statements.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov's remarks were obviously referring to the comments by
Richard Butler, the Executive Chairman of the United Nations
Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction. Butler said Iraq had enough
biological material to blow away Tel Aviv.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Announces New Proposal to End Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
made new proposals Wednesday to end the Iraq-U.N. crisis by
allowing U.N. arms inspectors to "visit" the suspected
presidential palaces conditionally.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with a French envoy Bertrand Dufourcq, the
secretary-general of the French Foreign Ministry, Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein apparently made a compromise by proposing to set up
a team including five inspectors from each of the 15 members of
the Security Council and two from each of 21 countries represented
on the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), according to reports
available here.
</P>
<P>
The proposal said that these 117 experts would make "visits"
to the suspected presidential palaces and would report their
findings to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The reports have not been confirmed officially here, but it is
similar to an offer Iraq made last November and the the official
Iraqi News Agency said that Iraq has called for "a balanced political
solution" to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been rejecting UNSCOM inspections to presidential
palaces and other "sovereign sites" for weeks, triggering a
standoff between Iraq and the U.S. which has threatened to take
military actions to force Iraq to comply with the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the Iraqi parliament is to hold an emergency
meeting on Thursday on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with the French envoy, Saddam said that "Iraq's
sovereignty, dignity and security should be respected."
</P>
<P>
He repeated his demand that U.N. sanctions, imposed after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait more than seven years ago, be lifted,
starting with the ban on oil sales, the Iraqi agency said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions would not be lifted until U.N. inspectors
certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq says it has done so. But U.N. inspectors say Iraq still
is hiding information and material related to biological and
chemical weapons.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plays down Yeltsins's "World War" Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The White House on Wednesday
played down Russian President Boris Yeltsin's warning that U.S.
military action against Iraq could lead to a "world war."
</P>
<P>
"The interpretation of that remark by American journalists was
ridiculous and absurd and due to their less than proficient skills
in the Russian language," White House spokesman Mike McCurry said
at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Yeltsin said at a televised meeting in the Kremlin
that many countries had sent envoys to negotiate with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to defuse the standoff over weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
"We must try at the same time to make (U.S. President Bill)
Clinton feel that with his actions in Iraq he can lead to a world
war," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
But McCurry believed that Yeltsin was seeking diplomatic ways
to defuse the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the purpose of Russian diplomacy is to
pursue a diplomatic solution to this matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry repeated the U.S. warning that time was "running out"
to find a diplomatic solution to avert a military action in order
to force Iraq to comply with U.N. resolutions on weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
He said President Clinton was assessing the situation in the
Gulf with his foreign policy advisers. Reports said the Clinton
administration proceeding with planning for a possible military
action if Saddam insisted on his stand not to allow U.N.
inspectors to monitor presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
"Our view is very simple, there needs to be unconditional,
unfettered access to the sites that the U.N. Special commission
(UNSCOM) needs to see in order to carry out its work," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have very disciplined, prudent, careful diplomacy at work
and time is running out for a diplomatic solution but the
president's responsibility is to protect U.S. interests and
national security and he will do what it takes."
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, spokesman James Rubin rejected a
proposal from Iraq to open up eight presidential sites to U.N.
representatives for one month as a way to solve the crisis over
the weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
The offer "falls short of the standard of full and unfettered
access for the U.N., that is UNSCOM, and that is the standard
which must be met," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq seemed to be moving toward accepting the fact
that its ban on visits to some sites was "untenable".

<HEADLINE> ROUNDUP: Armenia Plunged Into Deeper Political Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The resignation of Armenian
President Levon Ter-Petrosian Wednesday has plunged the Caucasus
country into a deeper political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosian decided to step down on Tuesday after finding
himself robbed of support from the "power" leaders, who held
different views on the question of the Armenian enclave
Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over
Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave located inside
Azerbaijan, has lasted 10 years and remains the most explosive
issue in the two former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
Although a tense ceasefire has been holding in the enclave
since 1994, peace efforts have made little progress.
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosian was criticized this autumn for cooperating with
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in
seeking a gradual settlement of the Karabakh problem.
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition led by Defense Minister Vazgen
Sarkisian stands for full independence of the region.
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosian said in his televised resignation speech that the
question of Nagorno-Karabakh had been fanned as a mere pretext for
a crisis of power. The problem is much deeper and is closely
associated with the concept of state, peace and war, he said.
</P>
<P>
Armenian parliament on Wednesday accepted the president's
resignation by a simple majority and then the resignation of
Assembly speaker Babken Araktsyan. Other high officials close to
the president also resigned, including Yerevan city mayor and
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Under the Armenian constitution, new presidential elections
will be held on the 40th day after the president's
resignation. But as of today there has been no official decision
on the election date.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Hospital Leads In Remote Medical Diagnosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zhongshan Hospital in east
China has taken the lead, domestically and internationally, in
making remote medical diagnoses with the help of computer networks.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the hospital had diagnosed 1,070 difficult
cases through its 70 remote diagnosis locations in underdeveloped
areas such as Tibet and the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
On the computer networks, doctors at the hospital "talk" with
the patients and direct local medical staff members in how to
conduct sophisticated operations.
</P>
<P>
The computer system can provide doctors at both ends with
static, synchronous photos, as well as dynamic videos such as
X-ray motion pictures.
</P>
<P>
The remote diagnosis system has helped save 3 million yuan in
travel costs for patients living in remote regions.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the hospital plans to initiate remote medical
education programs for other areas. Ten remote education centers
have been set up by the hospital in Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu and
Jiangxi provinces.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian State Duma (lower house)
speaker Gennady Seleznev urged the International Olympic President
to persuade the United States from attempting to use force against
Iraq, the Interfax news agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a message to International Olympic Committee President Juan
Antonio Samaranch, Selezmev hoped Samaranch will use all his
influence and the Olympic forum to persuade U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The speaker stressed that it is a tradition that hostilities
should be stopped and holy peace be made during the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The speaker warned that using force against Iraq may have an
extremely serious impact on the world situation.
</P>
<P>
Such action will seriously harm the authority of the United
Nations and make all the work done by the U.N. Special Commission
Supervising the Destruction of Iraq's Chemical Biological and
Nuclear Weapons (UNSCOM) become nothing, he added.
</P>
<P>
Washington said on Tuesday that it could not pledge that it
would not use force against Baghdad during the winter Olympics,
which will be on from February 7 to 22.
</P>
<P>
The Russian State Duma suggested in a resolution on Wednesday
that the Russian government lift sanctions against Iraq if
non-U.N.-backed military attack against Iraq occurs.

CAIRO, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan will increase the number of its flights from
Amman to Tel Aviv from six to seven every week as of February 15,
1998.
</P>
<P>
Israel agreed with the increase of Jordanian flights as part of
the efforts to strengthen cooperation with the kingdom in the
field of aviation transportation, said director General of the
Jordanian Civil Aviation Authority Jasir Ziyad.
</P>
<P>
Israel has the right to operate the same number of its flights
from Tel Aviv to Amman every week, he said. Israel now has five
such flights every week.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The General Mobilization and Statistics Agency (GMSA)
put the total number of Egyptians abroad on temporary emigration
at 2,280,000.
</P>
<P>
According to GMSA, those on permanent emigration number 720,000.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the agency showed that large numbers of
Egyptian expatriates, particularly in the United States, Canada,
Australia, and some European countries, are scientists in
different fields, including the atomic field and spheres which
require high and complicated technology.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait announced to reduce the prices of butane
and propane gases by 40 U.S. dollars per tonne in February.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by Kuwaiti state-owned umbrella oil
complex Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, Kuwait said the new prices
for both the gases would be 140 dollars per tonne compared with
180 dollars in January.
</P>
<P>
The prices have witnessed a retreat in international oil
markets recently due to the decreasing international demand on
those products mainly in Europe, the Far East and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The low demand was also due to the warm weather in winter, the
plenty oil supply to the international markets and the increase of
storages.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The government will allocate some 200,000 tonnes of
cement every six months to meet the needs of a series of long-term
mega-projects for developing the New Valley, in Egypt's
southwestern desert area.
</P>
<P>
The cement will be used in lining Sheikh Zayed Canal whose
construction is expected to last 30 years, together with laying
down the bases of the proposed giant irrigation station whose
costs stand at 1.5 billion Egyptian pounds (about 440 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Assiut Cement Company Mohammad Shafea said that
one of the three factories, affiliated to the company, will be
assigned for producing the allocated cement quantities.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Unemployment Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of jobless Germans
surged by 301,600 in January to a record high of more than 4.823
million over the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Official data released Thursday said the jobless rate in
January was 12.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Nuremberg-based Federal Labour Office said, however, that
the seasonally-adjusted unemployment dropped by 72,000 to 4.46
million.
</P>
<P>
Office chief Bernhard Jagoda, however, blamed the January
increase on seasonal factors, saying that there were signs that
job market in western part of the country was being stabilized.
</P>
<P>
In January, the gap in unemployment continued to widen between
the western and eastern parts of Germany, with a rate at 10.5
percent in the west and 21.1 percent in the east.
</P>
<P>
The jobless situation is expected to cause protests Thursday in
some 200 German cities, which would be joined by unemployed people
and supported by trade unions, churches and the opposition Greens
Party.
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, heated debates occurred in the parliament over the
causes and cures for Germany's mass unemployment. The main
opposition Social Democrats (SPD) held the ruling center-right
coalition responsible for the current situation.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of applications
filed for unemployment benefits moved up to 303,000 last week, an
increase of 3,000 from the week earlier, the Labor Department
reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The last two weeks of relatively low claims, on a seasonally
adjusted basis, followed three weeks at a somewhat higher level,
ranging between 327,000 and 339,000.
</P>
<P>
The increase earlier in January had caused some economists'
concern for possible unemployment pickup. But the subsequent drop
is a sign that the nation's unemployment rate will remain near the
24-year low of 4.6 percent it hit in November last year.

</P>
<P>
Zhang, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's
Procuratorate, made his comments at a Wednesday work conference.

effectively controlled and that "in some localities and fields,
corruption is still growing."
</P>

Zhang reminded the procurators to pay special attention to
corruption in the judicial and law-enforcement departments,
followed by financial crimes, seeking promotion through
embezzlement, diversion of public funds in state-owned enterprises
and officials' encroachment on the rights and interests of the
ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
For accuracy's sake, the official urged procurators to be
resolute and cautious in dealing with corruption cases.

Meanwhile, he called on procurators to often check themselves

HANOI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
decided that rice, coffee, rubber, pork, tea, fruit and vegetable
are the six main farm product export items in 1998, Vietnam News
Agency (vna) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Cong Tan predicted that
Vietnam will achieve a food output of 31 million tonnes in 1998,
up 400,000 tonnes from the 1997 figure, and export four million
tonnes of rice, an increase of 400,000 tonnes from last year's
figure.
</P>
<P>
To meet the targets, the government has, since the start of

unprocessed rice from farmers and allocation of rice export quotas
to enterprises. The government has also instructed the Finance
Ministry and other relevant agencies to establish a rice export
insurance fund.
</P>

Vietnam earned around 2.5 billion u.s. dollars from exports of

<P>
SHANGHAI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
industrial city, maintained double digit economic growth for the
past year, with an overall growth in all industrial and service
sectors.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the city's inflation declined, the macro-economy
stabilized and living standards improved, according to officials
from the municipal statistical department.
</P>
<P>
Last year Shanghai produced 336 billion yuan in gross domestic
product (GDP), up 12.7 percent. The per-capita GDP topped 25,700
yuan to reach the strategic goal of quadrupling the figure of 1980
by 2000 -- three years ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 the city's revenue went up to 73.39 billion yuan, a
sharp increase of 32 percent over the previous year. However, its
retail price index and consumer goods price index were 98.8 and
102.8 percent, both down more than 6 percent compared with that of
1996.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 was good for the city's agriculture, with its
output value reaching 21 billion yuan, up 9.5 percent
year-on-year. The year's grain output topped 2.3 million tons, up
by 1.8 percent over the previous year.
</P>

percent production-sales ratio, and an integrated performance
index of 130.4 percent, up 4 percent year-on-year.

MANILA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have not yet agreed
on the withdrawal of government troops from the southern city of
Buldon during their ongoing peace talks, the Philippine News
Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for military affairs, said the
two parties have "an understanding" that the government troops
would reposition from their present bunkers from the perimeter of
Camp Abubakar, the biggest MILF camp in Buldon, Maguindanao
Province.
</P>
<P>
But government and MILF negotiators have not yet reached an
agreement on the distance and time-frame for the repositioning.
</P>
<P>
The government technical committee said the troops would pull
out only if peace and order are assured in Buldon.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Fortunato Abat supports this stand of the
government panel, headed by Orlando Soriano, the National
Irrigation Administration chief.
</P>
<P>
But the MILF technical committee claimed that the peace and
order situation in Buldon would only stabilize if the government
troops move away from the perimeter of Camp Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The government and MILF technical committees resumed their
low-level talks in the southern city of Marawi on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF) but more radical, refuses to be part of the peace
treaty signed last year by the MNLF and the government and wants
its own peace accord with Manila.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Booming in Quake-Devastated City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Ruili, an ancient town in
highland Yunnan Province in southwest China, has emerged from the
ruins left by a strong earthquake a year ago to become a hot spot
for both domestic and international tourists.
</P>
<P>
Ruili, located 600 kilometers from the provincial capital of
Kunming, is home to the Naxi Dongba Culture which is widely known
for its pictographic characters. Tourists also are attracted by
its ancient Taoist music and beautiful scenery.
</P>
<P>
In early 1996, an earthquake measuring 7.0 at the Richter scale
rocked the city. Fortunately, all major historic sites survived
the earthquake unscathed.
</P>
<P>
Local government has attached great importance to maintaining
the old style and appearance of the town during its post-quake
rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, more than 1.7 million domestic and international
tourists visited Ruili, which earned more than 1 billion yuan from
tourism. Ruili has become the second largest tourist city in the
province after Kunming.
</P>
<P>
Local tourism officials said today that, in the past eight days
of the Spring Festival period, more than 500 tourist groups, and
nearly 10,000 local and foreign travelers visited the
city. Ruili's population is only 60,000.
</P>
<P>
Originally, 750 tourist groups planned to make the trip, but
more than 200 were canceled because of insufficient transportation
and dwelling space.
</P>
<P>
Currently, all 27 hotels with more than 6,000 beds have been
occupied. Some tourists are staying in hotels in neighboring areas
such as Heqing County, 30 kilometers from Ruili.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen in south China's
Guangdong Province, the first special economic zone in the
country, plans to issue its Regulations on Bidding and Auction for
Rights of Land-Use.
</P>
<P>
The law is designed to standardize activities involved in land
leases and auctions to reinforce the city's efforts at clean
government.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago Shenzhen auctioned commercial sites for the first
time in China, which had a profound impact on the country's
administrative reform of land management.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed new rules concerning bidding and auctions,
Shenzhen will adopt the public notice system, a one-time payment
of land rents, the integrated tender-appraisal system, and the
setting-up of a leasing and auction board.
</P>
<P>
Unless consented by the city government, all the plots for
commercial use -- including lands for building housing, shops, gas
stations and warehouses -- will be brought under public bidding
and auction, according to the new law.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Stresses Importance of Anti-Corruption Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Government officials at all
levels should understand the importance, urgency and hardship of
the current anti-corruption campaign, Premier Li Peng said today.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng addressed his remarks to the Sixth Work Conference on
Anti-Corruption of the State Council, China's top administrative
body.
</P>
<P>
The work conference has been held by the State Council yearly
for the last six years.
</P>
<P>
After hearing reports by several ministers on corruption and
other illegal activities conducted by government officials, the
premier made a keynote speech to sum up the achievements and
experience in the country's anti-corruption drive.
</P>
<P>
"We must be clear that there are certain problems that cannot
be neglected in the current anti-corruption work," Li said. The
regulations on self-discipline of leading government officials
have not been completely implemented, the premier said, and the
number of major criminal cases involving government officials has
been on the rise. He added that the work of rectifying government
work styles still needs to be consolidated.
</P>
<P>
He called on governments at all levels to follow the central
policies to further unify their thinking and strengthen
anti-corruption efforts.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials in administrative bodies at all levels should
personally take charge of the anti-corruption work, Li said.
Leading officials should discipline themselves as well as their
relatives, he added.
</P>
<P>
This year, governments at all levels should focus their
anti-corruption efforts on halting the waste of public money,
investigating and punishing leading government and state-owned
company leaders, and dealing with illegal levies on farmers,
enterprises and school children, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to battling against formalism and bureaucracy, Li
said other steps that need to be taken include quickening the pace
of legislation, stepping up supervision over government officials,
strengthening internal management, strengthening supervision on
government and making government work more transparent.
</P>
<P>
"The key to the fight against corruption is to deepen the
reform in order to eliminate the soil and conditions to cultivate
corruption," Li stressed. He urged officials to tackle the problem
of excessively concentrated power in some departments.
</P>
<P>
Also attending today's conference were vice-premiers Zhu
Rongji, Qian Qichen, Wu Bangguo and Jiang Chunyun; and state
councillors Li Tieying, Song Jian, Li Guixian, Chen Junsheng and
Luo Gan.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, a member of the Standing Committee of the
Politburo of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee
and Secretary of the CPC's Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection, was invited to attend the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Southern Chinese City Sees Booming High-Tech Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Zhongshan City, the native
home of Sun Yatsen, the forerunner of China's Democratic
Revolution, is home to flourishing high-tech ventures with an
annual industrial output value of eight billion yuan (960 million
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
More than 200 ventures, including 45 high-tech ventures, have
been established in the Zhongshan Torch Development Zone located
in the Pearl River Delta in southern China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
A local official noted that 18 high-tech ventures have annual
industrial output values of 100 million yuan each. The high-tech
ventures come from a number of industries, including the
information, new energy and material, bioengineering,
pharmaceuticals and packaging sectors.
</P>
<P>
The zone, established seven years ago, has attracted foreign
investments of well over 300 million US dollars. The official
attributed the high volume of foreign investment to the fame of
Sun Yatsen and the good local environment.
</P>
<P>
The zone has established cooperative economic and scientific
ties with more than 40 universities and research institutions
nationwide, and is home to a large number of large ventures.
</P>
<P>
The development zone introduced the shareholding system in
early 1993 as a means of attracting more investment for high-tech
ventures, and currently leads the nation's 50-odd high-tech
development zones in related efforts.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that Acer, the world's seventh largest
computer manufacturer, has established a venture at cost of over
100 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Exempt 80% of Its Debt to Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia has promised to exempt
80 percent of its total debt of about 2.5 billion U.S. Dollars to
Mozambique, a communique released by the Planning and Finance
Ministry said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The remaining one fifth of the debt, which totaled about 509
million U.S. Dollars, would be repaid to Russia at an annual
interest rate of 0.8 percent in a period of 33 years, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Delegations from Russia and Mozambique had technical
discussions on the latter's debt to the former from January 28 to
30, a source here told Xinhua Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Maputo owed the 2.5 billion Dollars' debt to the former Soviet
Union when it bought weapons to back its 16-year civil war, and
Russia inherited the debt after the collapse of the Soviet Union
in the late 80s.
</P>
<P>
Russia's decision to exempt the debt has reduced Mozambique's
debt burden from 5.6 billion U.S. Dollars to about 3.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will start another round of talks over the
debt issue in the second quarter of the year.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Air Freight Up Slightly in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The quantity of cargo
shipped through Ben-Gurion Airport, the sole international airport
of Israel, increased by only 2 percent in 1997, local reports said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Some 275,000 tonnes were shipped last year through the airport,
making Israel the 30th internationally in countries sending air
freight.
</P>
<P>
The reports noted that the 2 percent growth was far below the
previous annual increase at the airport and below the rise in the
amount of freight flown around the world.
</P>
<P>
Almost 78 percent of the cargo, some 214,000 tonnes, went
through the Israeli airlines El Al and CAL. And the leading
foreign cargo carrier was Lufthansa, with almost 7,000 tons or 2.5
percent, followed by British Airways with 6,500 tons or 2.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics
reported Tuesday that in 1997 there were a total of 2,745,800
trips abroad by Israelis, a 10 percent increase over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Some 79 percent of the travelers left by air, 11 percent more
than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In a survey of those exiting the country, the bureau found that
17 percent were going to the United States, 14 percent to Turkey,
10 percent to France and 9 percent to the United Kingdom.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Sets Out to Smash Textile Spindles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Two weeks after Shanghai melted
down 120,000 spindles, Shandong Province in eastern China followed
suit to embark on a plan to smash one million spindles within
three years.
</P>
<P>
The move marks the start of a strategic reform in the province
to ensure its debt-ridden textile industry turns a profit by year
2000.
</P>
<P>
To that end, 810,000 spindles from state-owned enterprises and
92,000 obsolete spindles will be scrapped this year.
</P>
<P>
All the spinning frames manufactured before the founding of the
country in 1949, and those without a production license, will be
eliminated, according to the program. By 2000, the number of
spindles in Shandong will be controlled under 4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
A special team composed of officials from the provincial
government, foreign economic and trade commission, textile chamber
and some other related departments has been formed to oversee the
work.
</P>
<P>
Government compensation of 3 million yuan and interest-deducted
loans of 2 million yuan is being provided for every 10,000
eliminated spindles.
</P>
<P>
Shandong's textile reform will focus on renovating small cotton
spinning mills with a capacity under 10,000 spindles with a goal
of mergers or production shifts by 2000.
</P>
<P>
All the spinning factories in Shandong are expected to be
mid-size or large enterprises, each with a capacity of more than
30,000 spindles by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Measures to improve social security services for textile
workers have also been worked out, since the reduction of every
10,000 spindles results in an average of 600 laid-off
workers.

GUANGZHOU, February 5 (Xinhua) -- "Electronic books" were high

PHNOM PENH, February (Xinhua) -- Cambodian King Norodom
Sihanouk has asked Prominent opposition politician Sam Rainsy not
to hold a demonstration for his sake.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to ask your excellency not to hold a
demonstration on February 22," said Sihanouk in a letter to Sam
Rainsy on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Please be pity on me by not using my name and my serious
affairs for political game which is the crisis among the
politicians," he said.
</P>
<P>
The king's request is made one day after Rainsy made an appeal
Wednesday to all political parties to make a joint request for his
return.
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk left Cambodia suddenly last month without explanation
after being harshly criticized in the Cambodian press.
</P>
<P>
He said in a message that he would not return to Cambodia
because republicans had committed serious injustices against him.
</P>
<P>
"I always pray for peace but unfortunately the newspapers and
television stations of some political parties and individuals do
not let me have peace," he said in the message released Sunday
from his residence in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Some political analysts said that during the king's stay,
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen had orchestrated a campaign of
criticism against him for saying he would automatically pardon his
son Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who is facing a possible trial
following his ouster in a bloody event last July.

<HEADLINE> Africans Urged to Curb Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) Thursday urged African countries here to take
immediate action to reverse the growing trend of using child
labor in which 80 million African children are involved.
</P>
<P>
Michel Hansenne, the Director-General of ILO, predicted at the
Africa Conference on Child Labor which opened here that the child
laborers under age of 14 may increase to 100 million by 2015 if
the current political and economic trends continue, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Haggag, the Assistant Secretary-General of the
Organization for African Unity (OAU), said Africa's future will
and must depend on the measures for survival, protection and
development of African children in their formative years.
</P>
<P>
Africa, with its 41 percent of child labor proportion, has the
most serious forms of child labor including high percentage of
working girls, according to an ILO report.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the conference on behalf of Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni, Ugandan Prime Minister Kintu Musoke said, "child
labor has become a reality in Africa and if the situation remains
unchecked, Africa risks losing her efforts toward lasting
development."
</P>
<P>
The delegates from 23 African countries will discuss an
African common position to the drafting of a convention on
international standards in child labor in their three-day
meeting, organized by the OAU, the ILO and U.N. Children's Fund
(UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan president urged the delegates from governments,
employers and workers organizations to reach common understanding
on economic exploitation of children, work out a system of safety
nets to protect children in the poorest communities and recommend
to African governments a clear, time-bound program of action
against child labor.
</P>
<P>
Hansenne said the ILO intends to pursue the development of
effective legal tools to fight against extreme forms of child
labor and has embarked on the preparation of new international
standards for 1998 international labor conference to be held in
Geneva in June this year.

Because of the whales' huge size, returning them to the deep
sea waters was difficult. Many of them died of hunger, but local
people successfully helped three stranded grey whales return to
the sea.
</P>
<P>
Marine experts said the whales' locator system malfunctioned
because of the sudden weather change.
</P>
<P>
They said the dolphins also were affected by the abnormal ocean
currents.
</P>
<P>
Though whales are stranded every year off Hainan, the number is
usually much smaller than this year, marine experts said.

<HEADLINE> British, Saudi Ministers Hold Talks on Defusing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 5 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook held talks with his Saudi counterpart Prince Saud
Al-Faisal Thursday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on means to defuse
the on-going crisis over arms inspections in Iraq, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency reported that Cook, who is on a visit to
Saudi Arabia, and Al-Faisal asserted in their talks keenness on
ending the crisis with diplomatic means to alleviate hardships of
the Iraqi people who have been suffering under a UN-imposed
sanction since 1990.
</P>
<P>
British diplomatic sources were quoted as saying that Riyadh
and London believe that Iraq must comply with the UN resolutions,
particularly those related to UNSCOM's arms inspection mission to
avert a possible military strike.
</P>
<P>
The two sides held Baghdad responsible for the current crisis
as it bars UN arms inspectors from entering the presidential
palaces in search of mass destruction weapons. Iraq has refused to
allow UN inspectors to enter the palace unfettered, saying it
infringes its state sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Cook briefed Al-Faisal on efforts exerted
by London to find a peace settlement to the crisis and
make sure that Iraq would not threaten neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
Cook also informed his Saudi counterpart about a plan to issue
a new Security Council resolution addressing a strong message to
Baghdad to demonstrate the world's community resolve to coerce
Baghdad into respecting the UN resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the latest Iraqi offer to allow
U.N. inspectors entry to eight disputed sites does not go far
enough.
</P>
<P>
But he said "it is a welcome sign, it may be a sign that he
(Saddam Hussein) will indeed come up with a more satisfactory
package before it is necessary for us to take military action."
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the Iraqi leader "should not doubt our
resolve. If he thinks we are not prepared to do that, he could be
making a big mistake."
</P>
<P>
Cook arrived in Riyadh late Wednesday on a regional tour. Cook
is scheduled to arrive in Kuwait Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
British Embassy in Kuwait said in a press release Wednesday
that the purpose of the Foreign Secretary's visit would be to
consult key regional partners and to brief them on British efforts
to achieve a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Cook said "we intend to work very closely with our Gulf
partners in the weeks ahead."
</P>
<P>
Britain also warned that it would join any U.S. military
strike against Iraq if the diplomatic efforts fail to pressure
Baghdad back down from its position to let the UN inspectors
check wherever they suspect hiding chemical and biological
weapons.

<HEADLINE> Iran Blasts Nuclear Threats Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran Thursday strongly blasted
threatening statements to use nuclear weapons against Iraq, Tehran
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
"Such statements are against the whole region (of Middle East)
and none of the regional countries will remain indifferent to such
ill-considered statements," Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi said.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman did not mention who have made the threats.
And no reports were available here about the threats.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Iran is opposed to any military strike against
Iraq, he said military operations would only escalate tensions in
the region and worsen its situations, according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran is also gearing up efforts to seek a peaceful
solution to the crisis of arms inspection between Iraq and the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
eliminating Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi Thursday met visiting
Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC) Ezeddine Laraki, exploring ways to prevent military actions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Both sides stressed that political efforts should continue in a
bid to solve the Iraq crisis, Tehran radio said.
</P>
<P>
Laraki arrived here Wednesday to exchange views with Iranian
officials after OIC chairman, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
asked him to coordinate with regional leaders for a peaceful
solution to the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
The United States, staunchly supported by Britain, has
threatened to take military actions to force Iraq to grant free
access to the UNSCOM to any sites, including presidential palaces,
suspected of hiding the banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
In response to the U.S. threat to Iraq, the local daily Tehran
Times Thursday strongly condemned U.S. policies towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It said the U.S. has no justification to launch a military
attack against a country which has been subjected to harsh
international sanctions for more than seven years.
</P>
<P>
It added that the U.S. should act within the framework of the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed economic sanctions on Iraq, banning the export
of oil, Iraq's main revenue earner, in 1990 after its invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions can only be lifted when the UNSCOM certifies that
Iraq has dismantled all the weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Africans Urged to Curb Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) Thursday urged African countries here to take
immediate action to reverse the growing trend of using child
labor in which 80 million African children are involved.
</P>
<P>
Michel Hansenne, the Director-General of ILO, predicted at the
Africa Conference on Child Labor which opened here that the child
laborers under age of 14 may increase to 100 million by 2015 if
the current political and economic trends continue, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Haggag, the Assistant Secretary-General of the
Organization for African Unity (OAU), said Africa's future will
and must depend on the measures for survival, protection and
development of African children in their formative years.
</P>
<P>
Africa, with its 41 percent of child labor proportion, has the
most serious forms of child labor including high percentage of
working girls, according to an ILO report.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the conference on behalf of Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni, Ugandan Prime Minister Kintu Musoke said, "child
labor has become a reality in Africa and if the situation remains
unchecked, Africa risks losing her efforts toward lasting
development."
</P>
<P>
The delegates from 23 African countries will discuss an
African common position to the drafting of a convention on
international standards in child labor in their three-day
meeting, organized by the OAU, the ILO and U.N. Children's Fund
(UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan president urged the delegates from governments,
employers and workers organizations to reach common understanding
on economic exploitation of children, work out a system of safety
nets to protect children in the poorest communities and recommend
to African governments a clear, time-bound program of action
against child labor.
</P>
<P>
Hansenne said the ILO intends to pursue the development of
effective legal tools to fight against extreme forms of child
labor and has embarked on the preparation of new international
standards for 1998 international labor conference to be held in
Geneva in June this year.

<HEADLINE> France Optimistic About Diplomatic Solution to Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- France Thursday expressed optimism
over a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis, as the French envoy
Bertrand Dufourcq is winding up a visit to Baghdad and going ahead
to visit several other Arabian countries.
</P>
<P>
``It is time for diplomacy'' for solving the Iraqi crisis, said
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
He said that progress has been made in the talks in Baghdad
between Iraqi leaders and the envoys from France and Russia over the
issue of opening presidential sites to United Nations inspectors.
</P>
<P>
But he estimated the concession made by Iraq so far as
insufficient for an overall solution to the dispute between Iraq and
the United Nations over access to presidential sites by arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has agreed to open nine presidential sites to U.N. arms
inspectors, and has accepted ``essential elements'' in a French
compromise proposal on solving the dispute over presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
The French envoy, Dufourcq, will leave Baghdad Thursday for Cairo
to discuss with Egyptian leaders the crisis, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Dufourcq will also go to Syria, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to inform
the leaders of these countries the position of France in this
crisis, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province,
home to vast stretches of hilly areas, has controlled soil erosion
on 63 percent of its affected land.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive treatment of small river valleys has enabled
the province to control erosion in an area of 5,700 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The province accelerated efforts to battle soil erosion in the
early 1990s in order to solve problems of worsening environment
and increasing poverty in hilly areas.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has allocated some 15 million yuan
annually over the past two years for the control of soil erosion
in hilly areas. Forty-three small rivers were harnessed and soil
erosion in an area of 230 square kilometers was curbed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have been rewarded with improving environmental
conditions. Lianyungang city, for example, has witnessed a
50-percent increase in the output of grain and edible oil, with a
six-fold rise in per-capita income of farmers in 24 small river
valleys.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) Thursday held an emergency session to discuss
U.S. military threats against Iraq, but no decision was taken, the
Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Saadoun Hammadi told reporters after the
session that the assembly would reconvene next week, saying that
the general tendency at the meeting is against U.S. "arrogance and
intransigence" and for an end to Iraqi people's sufferings.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Iraq's readiness for cooperation to explain the
facts to the world, stressing its keenness to defuse the crisis
through diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The parliament convened an emergency session Monday and
reviewed the crisis between Iraq and the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the assembly suggested the government stop
cooperation with the UNSCOM if the latter could not finish its
mission within six months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the parliament Thursday formally invited members of
the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament) to visit
presidential sites in Iraq and see for themselves what they
contain.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to his Russian counterpart Gennady Seleznev,
Hammadi said the U.S. administration claimed that Iraq was
producing and hiding chemical and biological weapons at the
presidential sites, adding that the invitation was intended to
establish the truth.
</P>
<P>
The same invitation was extended two days ago to U.S.
Congress, but it has been turned down angrily by U.S. congress
leaders, who have been calling on their government to take
military actions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred inspectors of the UNSCOM from searching
presidential palaces suspected of hiding banned weapons,
triggering its current stand-off with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to take military actions to
force Iraq to grant free access to the UNSCOM.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Oil Companies to Explore for Offshore Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Several Israeli oil companies
are intended to explore for oil in waters offshore Israel's coast,
local newspaper the Jerusalem Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted an estimation of Israel's National Infrastructure
Ministry as saying that the Jewish state may have an oil reserve
of 5-5.5 billion barrels, including the offshore 2.1-2.7 billion
barrels.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Avner Oil and Gas Company has decided to carry out
exploratory offshore drilling to a depth of 5,000 meters under
water during the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
David Cohen, joint managing director of the company, told the
paper that the exploration will take place in 1000-meter-deep
water.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Givot Olam Oil Company Tovia Luskin also said
that his company is currently building up finances to drill for
oil in the north of Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
He expressed belief that there is a potential oil reserve of
millions of barrels in the area, which he said is attached to the
Paleozoic petroleum system prevalent throughout the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The executives of Israel's oil company Isramco are convinced
that they can make significant returns from exploration in the
shallower waters off the central Ashdod area.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1994, the company drilled in the area three
times. And the oil it found is of exceptionally high quality and
in copious amount, an Isramco official said.

</P>
<P>
But after most of the Olympic family members arrived, some problems
surfaced and the transportation is in the leading place.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese journalist complained on Thursday that it took her more
than one hour from the Main Press Center to the Olympic Village when
she went to covered the flag raising ceremony of the Chinese sports
delegation.
</P>
<P>
"We goosed our necks for the shuttle bus, but it was almost 30
minutes late of the scheduled time," she said. "The traffic jam spent
us another 30 minutes to get there."
</P>
<P>
When the organizers arranged the location of competition venues
several years ago, some expressed their concerns about the
transportation. International Ski Federation president Marc Hodler
once said that there would be a traffic problem for the skiiers and
journalists to get to the Alpine competition at Hakuba and
unfortuntely his worry found proof on Thursday when journalists took
almost three hours to travel the 50 kilometer distance from Nagano for
the men's downhill training.
</P>
<P>
Those were not the only cases in transportation. Journalists
staying in Asahi Media Village would spend 40 minutes to arrive in the
MPC. The distance between the two places is only seven kilometers.
</P>
<P>
"It seems door to door for us, but it take too long time to get
from this door to another door," a French journalist said under the
clear sky in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
Many worry that the traffic would be even worse on bad weather
days. Japan's team chief Yushiro Yagi uttered:"Transporting
competitors, starting with the opening ceremony, has been weighing
heavily on my mind."
</P>
<P>
Even the organizers were not satisfied with the transportation.
NAOC media director Ko Yamaguchi said on Thursday:"we are not
satisfied with total transportation. We hope for better
transportation in the coming days."
</P>
<P>
Transportation is not the only problem existed in the organizing
work. Language had been a headache for many journalists who could not
speak Japanese.
</P>
<P>
Those foreign journalists could not read menus in restaurants,
could not communicate with most volunteers.
</P>
<P>
"They act politely, but could it help with my job?" one American
journalist said angrily.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers are really very polite. A shuttle bus stop notice
board in front of the Asahi Village has a message from the
volunteers:"Are you angry? I don't speak English well. Pardon me."

<HEADLINE> Gas Monitoring System in Railway Tunnels Developed in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- After two months of trial use
in the Jiazhuqing tunnel on southwest China's Nanning-Kunming
railway line, a monitoring system to protect against gas in
railway tunnels has proven successful.
</P>
<P>
The 4,990-meter tunnel passes through 26 coal beds and has a
problem with coal gas, experts say. So Chinese engineers invented
a kind of airtight concrete for use in the tunnel. However, the
gas pressure is so great that there were still leaks.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Chinese Railway Ministry decided to set up a
monitoring system and its efforts have paid off. The new
computerized system is equipped with sensors, signal equipment,
large fans, and other advanced facilities. It monitors gas
density and wind velocity and limits electromagnetic problems
caused by passing trains.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the development of the system has created
conditions for the construction of the Baiguo-Shuicheng and
Neijiang-Kunming railways in the mountainous areas in southwest
China. The two railways require construction of many tunnels with
greater gas pressures.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Trade with Southern Africa Goes up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 5 (Xinhua) - Nigeria's trade with countries of
the South Africa Customs Union (SACU) amounted to 57.47 million
U.S. Dollars in the first six months of 1997, compared to 48.4
million Dollars in 1996 and 47 million Dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's exports in the six months is estimated at 37 million
Dollars, which is more than nine times over the 3.82 million
Dollars recorded in the corresponding period of 1996, according
to a release by the South African Foreign Trade Organization
(SAFTO).
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's imports from the SACU, which comprises Lesotho,
Namibia, Botswana and South Africa, rose from 13.2 million
Dollars to 19.7 million Dollars in the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria exports plastics and rubber products to SACU and
imports mainly chemicals, machinery, mechanical and electrical
equipment, said the SAFTO.
</P>
<P>
Rob Parkin, a SAFTO official, was quoted by local media as
saying that activities of fraudsters is a major factor militating
against southern African investors' confidence in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He called on Nigeria to embark on an awareness program to
enlighten foreign investors on the tricks of the fraudsters and on
what the government has done to stem their activities.

<HEADLINE> Fuzhou Development Zone in East China Grows Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Fuzhou Development Zone has
emerged as a new force driving economic development in east
China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The zone generated a gross domestic product (GDP) of 5.6
billion yuan last year, with its export value soaring to 480
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The zone, which covers 10 sq.km., has attracted foreign
investments totalling 2.1 billion US dollars for the construction
of 609 projects.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive high-tech zone, located in the provincial
capital of Fuzhou, has attracted a substantial investment from
Taiwan, whose investment accounts for over half of the total.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, when the zone was established, the zone has issued
32 regulations to improve its investment environment and
strengthen supervision and management.
</P>
<P>
The zone places priorities on the development of high-tech
industries, including the electronics, machine-building and
bioengineering sectors. The zone is home to 78 high-tech firms
which have developed over 400 varieties of high-tech products.
</P>
<P>
The bonded area in the zone is yet another trump card for the
zone's development, according to the local government. The area,
established five years ago, has approved 392 projects involving
total investments of 420 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The zone will continue to focus on cooperation with Taiwan and
will at the same time accelerate infrastructure construction to
attract more overseas investment, according to government officials.

<HEADLINE> Former Battleground Becomes Commercial Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Friendship Pass, which
separates south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region from
Viet Nam, has evolved from a former battleground into a commercial
center.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government used the pass to transport large
quantities of military supplies to Viet Nam in the 1950s and
1960s. The pass later became a forbidden zone when war erupted
between China and Viet Nam.
</P>
<P>
Today, however, 25 border trade centers have been opened along
the 637-km section of the border. The centers offer over 1,000
varieties of commodities from both China and Viet Nam, with a
combined annual trade volume of three billion yuan (361.4
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, the governments of the two countries have
strengthened management of the trade centers by formaulating a
series of policies governing them.
</P>
<P>
While the trade centers are all located on the Chinese
side, Viet Nam has also opened a special economic zone
near the border.

<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- People's mediation committees
in China handled more than 5.4 million people-to-people
disputes last year, with 94 percent of those cases successfully
resolved, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
Those committees also prevented more than 60,000 civil cases
from turning into criminal cases, and are credited with saving
40,000 lives, the statistics said.
</P>
<P>
Last year 382 counties or county-level cities in China had no
dispute-induced suicides, criminal or group fighting because of
the mediation, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that mediation committees have become "the first
line of defense" to ensure social stability in China.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese Constitution, people's mediation
committees are necessary non-governmental self-governing
organizations established at the grass-roots administrative level,
whose duties are to prevent and solve all kinds of disputes among
family members, within neighborhoods and between co-workers.
</P>
<P>
So far, with more than 10 million staff members, China has
established more than one million mediation committees in its
villages, towns, communities and various units.

<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China is planning an exhibition
on Tibetan culture and arts for display in Asia, Europe and North
America.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the Ministry of Culture announced here today
that the exhibition is aimed at helping foreigners gain a better
understanding of the region, which is an inseparable part of China.
</P>
<P>
The first destinations for the exhibition are India and several
Asian countries, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The show will display 300 relics and many photos to reflect the
changes in Tibetan culture and arts during the last 1,000 years,
and delineates relations between the Tibetan local governments and
the Chinese central government.
</P>
<P>
Masks, silk and oil paintings, religious items and handicrafts
with explicit Tibetan characteristics will be on display. The
exhibition will show that Tibetan traditions are being respected
and protected, and people's living conditions are improving and
different ethnic groups are living in harmony, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan culture began in the seventh century when the Tubo
Dynasty united tribes on the plateau. In the 15th century, the
traditional Tibetan culture with Buddhism at its core began a
period of great prosperity.
</P>
<P>
After the region was peacefully liberated in the 1950s, great
changes have taken place and unprecedented achievements have been

<HEADLINE> Macao Foreign Trade Surges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Macao reported an unprecedented
booming foreign trade in the first 11 months of 1997, despite an
overall economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics Department
Thursday show that exports between January and November last year
reached 15.5 billion patacas (1.9375 billion U.S. dollars), up 8.7
percent from the same period the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The value of imported goods added up to 15.1 billion patacas
(1.8875 billion dollars), up 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Macao recorded a trade surplus of 392 million
patacas (49 million dollars), the first trade surplus since 1991.
</P>
<P>
That was against an economic slowdown since 1993. The economic
growth rate was estimated at less than one percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Garments and textiles accounted for 84.9 percent of all exports
during the period. Its export value rose 16.1 percent. The exports
of non-textile goods dropped 19.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The United States and European Union bought 77.7 percent of
Macao's exported goods. Compared with the same period in 1996,
exports to both places increased.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, among all imported goods Macao bought 6.9 percent
more fuel and lubricant oil, 5.6 percent more capital goods and
4.5 percent more raw materials and semi-finished goods. The
imports of consumer goods, however, dropped 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of Macao's imported goods came from the Asian Pacific
region, which accounted for 80.9 percent. Imports from China's
inland, Taiwan, the Republic of Korea and Japan all grew but those
from Hong Kong and Australia dropped.

<HEADLINE> Mindanao Becomes Major Force in Philippine Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Mindanao, the second largest
island of the Philippines, has become a major force in the
country's economy, with its gross domestic product (GDP) having
grown 3.9 percent annually from 1993 to 1997, the Philippine News
Agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The island has generated 106,000 new registered businesses and
close to a million jobs in the past five years, said the news
agency, citing a report from Eufemia Calderon, executive director
of the Mindanao Economic and Development Council.
</P>
<P>
In her report, Calderon cited the quickening pace of
investments with favorable changes in Mindanao business
environment.
</P>
<P>
Calderon said Mindanao now enjoys highest priority from the
national government, increased infrastructure allocations, better
telecommunications services, and increased support from
international donor communities.
</P>
<P>
She said the island has become the country's frontdoor to the
market of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as it
is located within the Eastern ASEAN Growth Triangle.
</P>
<P>
But she admitted that Mindanao's thriving economy was also
disturbed by the currency crunch besetting Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
She said the crisis caused deferred and delayed project
implementation, price increases in basic commodities, high
interest and lending rates, temporary shutdowns and retrenchments.
</P>
<P>
Mindanao has been the poorest part of the Philippines because
of more than three decades of war between the government and
Muslim rebels who wanted a separate Islamic state on the island.
</P>
<P>
Investors have been flocking to the island to seek
opportunities after the government forged a peace treaty in 1996
with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), a major Muslim
rebel group.
</P>
<P>
The government is now undergoing peace talks with a smaller
separatist force, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), with
the aim of concluding a similar peace agreement to bring a lasting
peace to the island.

by Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, is now in New York to
brief the United Nations Security Council on the situation in
S. Leone.
</P>
<P>
During the trip, Nigerian head of state General Sani Abacha,
who is also ECOWAS chairman, and the committee will brief the
council on the progress made so far for a peaceful resolution of
the crisis in S. Leone.
</P>
<P>
The committee, composed of Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Cote
d'Ivoire and Liberia, will be joined in New York by
representatives of the Organization of African Unity and ECOWAS
secretariat.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to discuss with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and the Security Council on the need for the deployment of
a U.N. observer mission to facilitate the disarmament of
combatants as outlined in the peace plan signed last October in
Conakry, Guinea.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry statement disclosed on Wednesday that the
discussions will also focus on strategies for harmonizing the
efforts of some members of the international community which have
pledged cooperation with ECOWAS and the council with a view to
restoring constitutional order in Sierra Leone.
</P>

Under the Conakry peace plan, the ruling military junta, which
seized power in a coup on May 25 last year, will hand over power
to ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah on April 22 this year.
</P>

The junta, which signed the peace accord, said later, however,
the timetable was unrealistic due to the delay in the disarmament
exercise scheduled to begin last December.
</P>

<P>
SINGAPORE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has decided to
impose an indefinite ban on the exports of all types of
anti-personnel landmines, a Foreign Ministry statement said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The move is an extension of a moratorium imposed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
On May 7, 1996, Singapore imposed a two-year moratorium on the
export of anti-personnel landmines which do not have
self-destructing or self-neutralizing mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
"The Singapore government has now decided, with immediate
effect, to extend the moratorium to the export of all types of
anti-personnel landmines. The moratorium will be in force
indefinitely," the Ministry said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said that Singapore shares the
humanitarian concerns which underpin the Ottawa treaty on
anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
The moratorium would complement existing international
de-mining efforts and mine victims assistance programs.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry statement said that the Singapore
government supports the efforts of the international community to
find a lasting and effective solution to the landmines problem.

<HEADLINE> Tea, Coffee Prices Rise at Kenya Auctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Prices for tea and coffee have
increased to higher level at Mombasa and Nairobi auctions owing
to the short supply of the goods, the East African Standard
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tea price at the weekly auction in the port city of Mombasa
hit the 3.2-U.S.-Dollar mark a kilogram of black tea in the best
PF1 grade, which is the highest offer so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the tea sector was quoted as saying that dealers
had resorted to panic buying to stock-pile for the overseas
market after the Mombasa-Nairobi highway was partially cut off by
floods last week.
</P>
<P>
The situation may have been aggravated by the call for a tea
picking boycott by officials of the unregistered Kenya Union of
Small Scale Tea Owners starting this week.
</P>
<P>
The boycott paralyzed some tea factories in Meru and Embu
districts which have been closed down, according to a Daily
Nation report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The coffee auction in the capital Nairobi "was good and prices
were high" as a result of good demand for coffee, a senior
official at the Coffee Board of Kenya was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Premium grades PB averaged 381.35 U.S. Dollars per 50-kg at
Tuesday auction, compared to 375.32 Dollars at the last auction
on January 20.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Ministry of Agriculture estimates that coffee
production will fall to 65,000 tons in 1997/98 crop year from
68,000 tons in 1996/97 because of the bad weather in the past
several months.
</P>
<P>
Abnormal rains which began in October and intensified in
January flooded coffee fields and hampered harvesting and drying
of the crop.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Thursday
announced donation of medicines worth 200,000 ringgit (about
50,000 U.S. dollars) to El Nino weather phenomenon-struck Ecuador
and famine-hit Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi presented the medicines,
contributed by a local company -- Remedi Pharmaceutical Sdn Bhd,
to DPRK Ambassador Kim Jin Ok and Ecuador's Charge D'affaires
Marco Tulio Cordero here.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said it was heart-warming that despite the financial
and economic woes, Malaysians continued to show concern towards
others faced by calamities wherever they might be.
</P>
<P>
He said that such contribution augurs well in enhancing
people-to-people understanding as well as in strengthening
relations between Malaysia and the two countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino phenomenon which struck Ecuador and other coastal
areas of Latin America last October and the worst famine
experienced by the DPRK have touched the feelings of Malaysians,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are saddened by the sufferings that the peoples of the two
countries have had to experience," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government donated 200,000 U.S. dollars in
addition to 100 tons of powdered milk to the DPRK early last year.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by the contribution of 5,000 tons of various
relief items from non-governmental organizations last November.
</P>
<P>
Both the DPRK ambassador and the Ecuadoran charge d'affaires
expressed their gratitude for the assistance.
</P>
<P>
Kim said the aid was significant and reflected the sincerity of
Malaysians while Cordero said Ecuador appreciated the assistance
as it would reduce the sufferings of its people in this time of
need.

PARIS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Four Frenchmen were kidnapped in Chad on Tuesday by an armed
group in a natural park. The opposition Front National du Tchad
said the kidnapping was "the direct consequence of military and
finance support of France to the regime of President Idriss Deby."
Some 850 French soldiers are permanently based in Chad under a
defense treaty.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- After Baghdad gave its agreement of principle to open eight
presidential sites to inspectors, U.S. President Bill Clinton said
he preferred "a real diplomatic solution" to the crisis with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
-- The French government announced Wednesday the decision to
construct a high speed train railway line linking Paris with
Lorraine, which will begin in 1999. Once completed in 2005, the
line will allow one to go from Paris to Strasbourg in two and a
half hours.

<HEADLINE> Angola Seeks Direct Trade Link With Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Angola has proposed to
establish a Malaysian Honorary Consulate and a commercial
Angola/Malaysia foundation in that country to promote a long
lasting relationship in commercial and trade exchanges between the
businessmen and governments of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have already submitted our proposals to the Malaysian
government on our intention to have a proper trade link through
the Malaysian High Commission in Harare, and we understand that
the proposals have been received," an Angolan businessmen
delegation leader said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Angola is seriously looking at establishing a direct trade and
economic link with Asian countries, particularly Malaysia, in an
effort to enhance its relationship in the region, Joao Rebelo
Kanjila, leader of the Angolan businessmen group which is on a
two-week business trip since January 27, told reporters at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Without a direct trade link, the two countries will fail to
benefit from each other, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that currently 90 percent of the products consumed by
the Angolans are from Malaysia or some other Asian countries but,
unfortunately, most dealers are mainly based in Europe or the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"We will gain more profit without these middlemen as we think
that it is more appropriate to deal directly with countries where
the products come from," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Angola is expected to sign a few memoranda of
understanding with Malaysian businessmen Friday, but he did not
spell out details.
</P>
<P>
According to Kanjila, some of the areas that have yet to be
fully untapped and have the potential to grow are textiles, civil
construction, hotels and recreation-related activities,
agriculture, mining and trading.
</P>
<P>
He said that Malaysian businessmen had expressed great interest
in investing in these areas.

<HEADLINE> Appointment of Arafat's Successor Denied: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Senior Palestinian officials
have denied the report that Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat will name his deputy Mahmoud Abbas (Abu
Mazen) as his successor, The Jerusalem Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, Arafat confided to U.S. President
Bill Clinton during his visit in Washington last month that his
chosen successor is Abbas, the incumbent PNA's second-in-command.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was quoted as telling Clinton: "We can never give
up. The Palestinian struggle will continue and the struggle will
carry on for generations if it will be needed. When my time will
come, I will be replaced by my brother, Abu Mazen."
</P>
<P>
"As far as I am concerned, the end of the process will be the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state, and in order
to achieve this goal, I am willing to be flexible here or there,
as long as I know that the result will be this one, " Arafat
said.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that although Arafat received a clean bill of
health from a recent check-up in a U.S. hospital, his aides said
his mood is bleak.
</P>
<P>
The reports drew sharp denial from Palestinian officials. PNA
top negotiator Saeb Erekat declared Wednesday that he was present
when Arafat met with Clinton last month. He denied that Arafat
had made such statements, noting that "this issue was never
discussed."
</P>
<P>
Arafat's spokesman Marwan Kanafani also said the reports were
untrue and denied that Arafat had suggested the appointment.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat's adviser Ahmed Tibi and PNA Cabinet Secretary
Tayeb Abdel Rahim refused to comment.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Calls for Speedy Creation of Jobs for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
has instructed the Manpower Ministry to speed up the creation of
jobs, both in urban and rural areas, to deal with rising
unemployment that resulted from the monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The president said that those who had been laid off would run
out of money in three to six months," Manpower Minister Abdul
Latief said here Thursday after meeting with the president.
</P>
<P>
Latief said the president is optimistic that the country will
"overcome its unemployment problems because for the first time,
the government allotted 1.8 trillion rupiah (one U.S. dollar
equals 8,500 rupiah Thursday) in the budget for a program to
alleviate unemployment and the World Bank will provide one billion
U.S. dollars for fiscal year 1998/99 (starting from April 1)."
</P>
<P>
He said if the fund is properly used, some 70-80 percent of the
8 million workers who were displaced would be absorbed in the
upcoming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the zero economic growth ... more than 8 million will
become unemployed," he added.
</P>
<P>
The figure, which does not include underemployment, represents
about 10 percent of the country's 90 million workforce.
</P>
<P>
He said the unemployment figure included the 2.7 million who
will work for the first time, the 4.4 million who were officially
listed as unemployed last year, and the 1 to 1.5 million expected
to lose their jobs this year.

<HEADLINE> 13th India International Leather Fair Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The 13th India International
Leather Fair opened Thursday in Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu,
about 2,157 km southwest of New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 companies including 100 companies from 30 countries
participated in the fair.
</P>
<P>
The fair, organized by India Trade Promotion Organization, will
project India's capabilities in leather industry, facilitate
technology upgradation and provide a forum for exchange of ideas
among various sectors of the leather industry.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the five-day fair, Indian Industry Minister
Murasoli Maran said that the Indian leather industry was one of
the major foreign exchange earners, next to textiles, gems and
jewelry and engineering products.
</P>
<P>
The share of value-added finished leather products in the total
exports from India has gone up from a mere 20 percent in the 1970s
to a staggering 80 percent now.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two decades, India has been slowly but steadily
transforming her traditional leather industry. From a mere major
exporter of hides and skins, the country has emerged as an
exporter of value-added products, he said.

<HEADLINE> Solar Energy Helping Northwestern Chinese Herdsmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- In northwest China's Qinghai
Province, herdsmen, who used to use candles or butter lamps for
lighting at night, are now able to watch television or use washing
machines at home thanks to solar energy.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30,000 families of herdsmen, or 30 percent of Qinghai's
total, are now using solar energy for electricity.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai is one of China's four pastoral areas and has an
average of nine hours of sunlight every day, almost the same
resource as the neighboring Tibet, which ranks second in the world.
</P>
<P>
The 17 kilograms of equipment, which herdsmen call a "magic
lamp", can provide an unlimited power supply and is portable, an
important thing for nomadic people.
</P>
<P>
Because more than 95 percent of the households have an annual
income of at least 7,000 yuan (about 850 US dollars), most can
afford the equipment, which costs 1,700 yuan, according to Wu
Dacheng, deputy director of the province's new power institute.
</P>
<P>
The local government has spent over 1.5 million yuan acquiring
the equipment and plans to use as much as a million yuan annually
to help some 5,000 herdsmen get the devices.
</P>
<P>
The province has built nine solar energy power stations to
increase its use, and the Global Environment Foundation (GEF) says
it believes the province is leading the country in developing
solar energy.
</P>
<P>
GEF is planning to provide 20 million US dollars for 200,000
solar energy devices in Qinghai, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, Gansu Province, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
where most Chinese herdsmen live.
</P>
<P>
China could provide 253 million kilowatts-hour of wind energy,
and two-thirds of the country has 2,000 hours of sunshine
annually. China's "Brightness Project" is an attempt to make
better use of these resources to help eight million people who
still live without electricity.

<HEADLINE> All DC-9 Planes of Philippine Airways Grounded With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The remaining seven DC-9
aircraft of the Philippines' Cebu Pacific Air will be grounded
starting midnight Thursday, four days after one DC-9 plane of the
airways crashed on a domestic flight, an aviation official said.
</P>
<P>
General Carlos Tanega, assistant secretary of the Air
Transportation Office (ATO), told reporters that in its initial
reports, Cebu Pacific Air has committed lapses in the rules and
regulations laid by the ATO.
</P>
<P>
But Tanega did not specify what these lapses were.
</P>
<P>
Monday morning, the Cebu Pacific Flight 387 with 104 onboard
slammed into a mountain when approaching its destination Cagayan
de Oro City on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers are now combing the crash site, a one-square-kilometer
radius, on the jungle-covered mountain to search for bodies of the
victims and possible survivors.
</P>
<P>
According to Tanega, representatives of the U.S. Federal
Aviation Authority (FAA) and the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) have arrived in Manila and will start the
investigation of the accident.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Diego Garrido, senior vice president of Cebu
Pacific Air, said that the company will comply on whatever
decision the ATO will give.
</P>
<P>
The order to ground the DC-9 planes came one day after
President Fidel Ramos criticized the ATO for not immediately
grounding the entire fleet of Cebu Pacific after Monday's air
disaster.
</P>
<P>
The ATO earlier ruled out the immediate grounding of Cebu
Pacific's remaining DC-9 planes, pending the results of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, Transportation and Communications Secretary
Josefina Lichauco said that professional and other pilots who hold
license to fly should undergo re-training to ensure they are fit
to steer a plane safely.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Lichauco in the wake of speculations that
the pilot of the ill-fated Cebu Pacific plane might have committed
the error that caused the accident, the worst ever in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lichauco pointed out that measures will be
undertaken by the government to promote air safety.
</P>
<P>
These measures will involve improvement of human skills on
pilotage and imposing an age limit on applications for
airworthiness certificate required of planes engaged in commercial
operations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese National Flag Hoisted in Olympic Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The national flag of China
was hoisted at the Olympic Village here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
China has sent a total of 61 athletes for the forthcoming Olympic
Winter Games, which will open on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese skiiers and skaters will take part in the sports of speed
skating, short track speed skating, figuere skating, women's ice
hockey, biathlon, free style skiing and cross country skiing.
</P>
<P>
It is the sixth time that Chinese athletes took part in the
winter Olympics. In the previous meet in Lillehammer, Norway in
1994, China collected one silver and two bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
"We will try our best at the games, but it would be hard for us to
win a gold here in Nagano," said Chinese delegation Chief-de-Mission
Xu Yinsheng after the flag-raising ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"As I have said before, we would take this opportunity to learn
from others," he added.
</P>
<P>
China made its depute in winter Olympics in Placid Lake in 1980 and
made a breathrough to win a medal after 12 years when Ye Qiaobo
collected two silvers in women's speed skating in Albertville, France
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
With the retirement of Ye, Xue Ruihong was the only skater who had
a slim hope to win a medal in speed skating.
</P>
<P>
Xue Ruihong, 27, claimed the women's 500m title in a World Cup
competition in 1996 and finished first in the distance at the World
Short-Distance Championships last year.
</P>
<P>
"I hope I could win a medal here," said the skater, who finished
fourth in the event four years ago.

<HEADLINE> New Technique to Diagnose Mediterranean Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A new technique for
diagnosing familial Mediterranean fever in a day has been devised
by a doctoral student in Jerusalem's Hadassah-University
Hospital, The Jerusalem Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The gene responsible for the disease was discovered
simultaneously in an American and French laboratory a few months
ago, in cooperation with a number of Israeli labs. A number
of genetic mutations that cause the attacks of high fever
and severe abdominal pain, sometimes rheumatic inflammation and
pleurisy, were also defined.
</P>
<P>
Shlomit Eisenberg, a 30-year-old doctoral student at the
Hadassah-University Hospital, has now developed a lab test to
identify patients with the defective genes. It is built on the
acceptable molecular biology technique, polymerase chain reaction,
but includes a unique way to identify a single error in the base
pairs that make up genes, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Yaacov Matzner, for whom Eisenberg is working, said
the method has been found extremely accurate, with no
false-positive or false-negative results so far, and relatively
easy to carry out.
</P>
<P>
The hospital's Hematology Department is now offering such
tests.
</P>
<P>
Mediterranean fever is a common hereditary disease in Israel,
with over 4,000 diagnosed patients, most of them are of Northern
African and Iraqi origin, and many more diagnosed in the rest of
the Mediterranean basin.
</P>
<P>
The bodily changes from the attacks, which appear without
warning, are usually reversible, causing no permanent damage. But
some patients are at risk of developing kidney insufficiency
because of amyloidosis, in which a waxy protein accumulates in
the tissues.

<HEADLINE> Unemployed Chinese Women Find New Life In Housework </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Deng Taoxiu, a 40-year-old
women living in Nanchang, capital of east China's Jiangxi Province,
didn't sit around at home when she lost her job, but enrolled in a
home economics training class, joined a household-service team,
and now bikes downtown every morning to pick up another family's
child as part of her new job.
</P>
<P>
These household services are new to Nanchang, a city with 1.3
million people, some of whom find the service odd. Deng herself
thought that it was shameful at first, but changed her mind when
she saw the example of another hourly worker, Li Jiamei, and found
that earning money by oneself wasn't shameful.
</P>
<P>
She can now earn 600 to 700 yuan each month and no longer has
to worry about her daily life and said the work has given her
confidence as well.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 100 women who were laid off their jobs,
like Deng, who has found new jobs in the city in household
services like baby-sitting, cleaning, tutoring, and care of the
sick and elderly.
</P>
<P>
Li Meizhen, a vice-chairwoman of the city's trade union
federation, said the women were encouraged to join the household
services team and her federation invited experts and scholars to
give lectures on home economics.
</P>
<P>
The team was established by the federation after a poll of
unemployed women was taken. And the federation takes
responsibility for introducing members of the team to employers
and clients.
</P>
<P>
Household services are becoming more popular and one result has
been that a tenth of the city's laid-off workers have found
employment in this way.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Statistics Bureau, there are about eight
million jobless people in China, four percent of its labor
force. Six million of those have been laid off their jobs.
</P>
<P>
China plans to continue its re-employment project this year,
while the economic reforms continue, and the government will take
steps to prevent workers' income from falling below a minimum
wage.

<HEADLINE> Bill Gates Carries Microsoft's Message Directly to Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft chairman Bill
Gates Tuesday sent a 2,000-word letter to 25,700 employees, by
e-mail, and one million shareholders, by mail, around the world.
</P>
<P>
"A vital principle is at stake: whether Microsoft and thousands
of other American software companies will continue to be free to
create software that benefits consumers," Gates explained in the
letter Microsoft's strong stand in the ongoing antitrust lawsuit
against the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft says its 1994 consent decree with the Justice
Department allows integrating the browser with Windows, while some
critics accused it of violating antitrust laws by "tying" the two
softwares.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a federal judge ordered Microsoft to stop requiring
computer makers to install its Internet Explorer Web browser
software in their computers before they could get the new Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
But Gates insisted that the ability to innovate and put new
features in the operating system is the principle and that his
company needs to innovate free from government interference.
</P>
<P>
"The government is trying to block exactly these kinds of
improvements," he said in the letter, suggesting that his company
has the right to develop integrated products.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft's stock leaped 3.7 percent on the day when the letter
was released.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Gates and his company's public-relations group
have been focused on carrying Microsoft's message directly to the
public.
</P>
<P>
Gates discussed his company's situation at a world economic
conference in Switzerland as well as on TV programs, before he
would launch a personal lobbying in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
The company's senior executives also are mulling a Microsoft
television ad campaign.

<HEADLINE> China Appeals to Work Together Against Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Drugs abuse is a global
problem caused by individuals and it needs the cooperation of sports
authorities around the world to fight against it, Tu Mingde, Secretary
General of the Chinese Olympic Committee said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tu said that China has been very firm in the fight against drug
abuse in sports. "We have introduced a three stricts system to combat
it. That is strict stipulation, strict testing and strict penalty," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this was a problem with commercialization in sport.
"Some individuals might take some risks to improve their performance.
But these are only individual incidents and events," stressed Tu, who
was also assistant Chief-de-Mission of the Chinese delegation for the
Olympic Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
"Doping is a global phenomena. We sports people have to work
together, hand in hand, to fight against this problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to work together to promote the best interests of the
athletes," Tu stressed.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Issues Warrants to Arrest Rebel Cleric </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese military prosecutor
Nasri Lahoud has issued formal warrants for the arrest of rebel
cleric Sobhi Foufeili and 22 of his followers on charges of
forming an armed group advocating attacks on citizens and
government troops.
</P>
<P>
In his memorandum issued on Wednesday, Lahoud said preliminary
investigations "showed that this gang aimed to attack citizens and
undertake other practices to undermine the authority of civilian
and military state institutions," local newspaper Daily Star
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He accused Toufeili, former secretary general of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah (Party of God), and his group of
"provoking the armed clash with security forces" that claimed
eight lives, including three government army personnel.
</P>
<P>
The recent fighting pitted Toufeili's supporters against
govenrment troops in the eastern city of Baalbek. Toufeili and his
armed followers occupied a Hezbollah seminary in Baalbek and
clashed with government troops which arrived at the request of
Hezbollah to persuade them to leave.
</P>
<P>
Since the clash, the fundamentalist cleric has been reportedly
hiding in the hills near his hometown of Brital in Baalbek.
</P>
<P>
Toufeili was stripped out of any official position in the
Hezbollah because he opposed the party leadership's decision to
take part in the 1992 state election.

<HEADLINE> Kampala to Launch City Buses to Ease Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Kampala City Council (KCC)
plans to launch city buses to replace minibuses in a new attempt
to fight traffic congestion, ''The New Vision'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Mwesigye, Town Clerk of the city, told parliamentary
committee on transport Wednesday that KCC is negotiating with an
Israeli firm on introducing buses to out-compete minibuses.
</P>
<P>
Minibuses, which are the main civilian transport for one
million of the citizens in Kampala, have been considerred as one
of the factors resulting in traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli delegation will visit the capital later this month
to carry out studies concerned, Mwesigye said. ''We are also
looking for joint ventures in introducing mass transport in the
city,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
KCC will start its works to ease human traffic congestion on
the streets later this month, he said. Rotary International had
pledged to donate funds for the construction of fly-overs on
various roads in the city, the official said.
</P>
<P>
KCC also planned to introduce parking fee to reduce redundant
parking in the city.
</P>
<P>
Parking at will also causes traffic jam, especially in city
center.
</P>
<P>
With the rapidly increasing number of vehicles, the traffic
condition in the city is worsening in recent years. KCC and
police in the city and other authorities introduced series of
measures to relief pressure on the traffic in the city.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Down as Asia Reclaims Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar weakened
slightly Thursday as the fall-out from the Asian financial
contagion returned to center-stage.
</P>
<P>
Also economists cast a shadow over the local currency's
recovery, saying Australia's tourism crisis could prevent it from
reaching 70 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar slipped to 67.83, from 67.92 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Local markets were focused on Asian equity and currency
markets, in particular the direction of the Japanese yen, a
foreign exchange trader with Westpac Banking Corporation said.
</P>
<P>
"It's really following the fortunes of the dollar/yen at the
moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank chief economist Craig James said the sharp
drop in tourists visiting Australia was a concrete sign that the
Asian currency crisis was already having a marked impact on the
domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
New figures released Thursday revealed that short term visitor
arrivals fell by six percent, or 20,000, in December alone.
</P>
<P>
Since last July, the number of tourists has dropped by 17
percent - the most severe decline for nine years.
</P>
<P>
James said about 30 percent of short-term visitors to Australia
were from Asian countries other than Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the travel industry is successful in attracting more
tourists from North America and Europe, Australia could lose 1-1.5
billion Australian dollars (0.68-1.02 billion U.S. dollars) from a
downturn in Asian visitor arrivals," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the day at 84.06 Japanese yen,
from 85.23 Wednesday and at 1.2231 German marks, from 1.2338.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Officials in Contact With Hawk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Senior Palestinian officials
have held secret talks with Israel's National Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon in a bid to break the stalemate in peace
talks, Israel Radio reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian source, who declined to give his name, told the
radio that the meetings were held in Israel. But he did not give
details of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, a leading hawk and the most influential minister of the
hardline Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, plays a crucial role in deciding the scope of the
second troop pullback of the three-phase Israeli redeployment in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been bogged down in
the dispute over Israel's prolonged delay in carrying out the
pullback.
</P>
<P>
Sharon has proposed a 9 percent pullout and intergrading the
third pullback into the final-status talks, which has been
rejected by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The secret contacts with Sharon seem to signal possible
flexibility that the PNA is willing to exercise in coming peace
talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Following the mediation by United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright last week, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
will travel to Washington in the coming week to continue talks on
breaking the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the Washington talks, the PNA is gearing up efforts to
drum up support in its standoff with Israel. Meeting with European
Union (EU) peace envoy Miguel Moratinos in Gaza Wednesday, Arafat
called for a greater EU role in pushing forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos, who has traveled to Syria before visiting here,
also met with Netanyahu's diplomatic adviser Uzi Arad Wednesday
night to brief the latter on his meetings with Syrian and
Palestinian officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- An afternoon surge in News

index up 7.9 points to 4520.9.

<HEADLINE> Risk Perception Dulls Africa's Investment Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Africa's low share of
mining exploration investment might be largely due to the risks
perceived to be more prevalent in the continent than elsewhere,
experts said Wednesdayy in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Martin Rosser, Deputy Managing
Director of London-based mining analyst David Williamson
Associates, when he was speaking to the mining investment
conference in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the equivalent of only 16 percent of the exploration
money spent in Latin America was spent in Africa, local press
quoted Rosser as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said political climate, security, corruption and
geographical conditions gave a clue to Africa's
disproportionately low share of world exploration dollars, as few
would dispute its superior geological prospectivity.
posing a low investment risk, all were from the SADC: Botswana,
South Africa and Namibia. The other country was Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya and Zambia drew "medium to
high risk" ratings.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique, Angola and Democratic Congo were "high risk" and
Zimbabwe was "medium to low", Rosser told delegates which
included mining ministers from 24 countries in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mining companies and investors were concerned with ownership
tenure, mining codes, the speed of doing business, government
interference in doing business, and the legal and fiscal regimes,
Rosser said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted the Mining Journal Listings, which reflected the
opinions of 100 chairmen of mining companies on the best
countries in which to invest, saying that for the last two
years, the top four countries had been in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
From Africa, only two countries featured. Ghana had been
listed for two years as the seventh and South Africa entered the
list in 1997 in the ninth place.
</P>
<P>
Five SADC states featured in the top seven ranking of African
countries by mineral wealth, they are South Africa, Botswana,
Democratic Congo, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The others were Guinea and
Ghana.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's University of
Finance and Economics and the Eagle Star Life Insurance Corp. of
Britain have signed an agreement to set up an insurance actuary
data center in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
They have also held an international symposium on developing
China's insurance business.
</P>
<P>
Chen Debin, secretary-general of the Shanghai Insurance
Association, said that China will need at least 5,000 actuaries
for the insurance business, but that it is still not a member of
the International Actuarial Society, and none of the Chinese is
up to international standards.
</P>
<P>
Setting up an actuary system and training programs will be a
key link with the rest of the world, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Eagle is one of Britain's major insurers and has spent more
than 10 million yuan helping the Shanghai university establish
post-graduate actuary program and publish the country's first
academic journal in the field.
</P>
<P>
It has also held a number of training courses for personnel of
the People's Bank of China and People's Insurance Company of China
since 1993.

<HEADLINE> Achievements in Oil Exploration in China's Qaidam Basin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Qaidam Basin Oilfield in
northwest China's Qinghai Province had sales of more than two
billion yuan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Oil output of the oilfield has increased by an average 10
percent in recent years, and it reached 1.6 million tons last
year, compared with a total 15.5 million tons in the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas explorations in the basin started in the mid-1950s,
but there were no results until recent years. In the past four
years, explorers have discovered 100 million tons of proven oil
reserves and 150 billion cubic meters of proven gas reserves. Now
it is the fourth largest gas-field in China.
</P>
<P>
A gas-field with an annual production capacity of 300 million
cubic meters has been built at Sebei and a 190-km pipeline
constructed to supply 800 cubic meters of natrual gas a year from
Sebei to the city of Golmud.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,500 households in Golmud now have the convenience of
clean gas, sources say.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the first phase of the Golmud refinery went into
operation, processing one million tons of crude oil a year. The
refinery started processing quality gasoline and diesel oil
since last October, when its second phase project was completed.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield plans to produce five million tons of oil and five
billion cubic meters of natural gas annually by the year 2005.

<HEADLINE> Annual Inflation Rises to 11 Percent in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's overall annual
inflation rate increased to 11.27 percent in January from 8.34
percent in December, according to a monthly Economic
Review by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).
</P>
<P>
On a three-month annualized basis, the eoconomic review said,
overall inflation rose to 19.9 percent in the three months to
January from 12.27 percent in the three months to December.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the rise in inflation to seasonal
increases in consumer demands during the festive season and a
rise in the price of food and transport due to heavy rains blamed
on the El Nino weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The CBK said the rise in inflation was temporary as the bank
has kept monetary policy tight in a bid to keep inflation at a
single digit.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the bank said that it sought to reduce
inflation to five percent by June this year.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here said that it would be difficult to
achieve the target in the wake of on-going ethnic violence, flood
damages on agriculture and infrastructure caused by
three-month-long rains.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that sharp salary increases for teachers,
Kenyan army and civil servants late last year would bring
pressure on the government budget deficit.

<HEADLINE> Returned Farmers Start Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The exodus of rural laborers from
Wuwei County in China's Anhui Province has begun to reverse, with
farmers returning home to start businesses, making use of things
they learned elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The county has seen more than 5,000 of its 200,000 transient
workers, come back to open 900 businesses that employ 40,000
people. These companies had about 300 million yuan in output value
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The county government regards these workers, who bring back
home 600 million yuan annually, as good for local economic
development, and government officials pay visits to them in
Beijing, Shanghai and other provinces and cities, and acquaint
them with changes and investment opportunities in their hometown,
and inquire them about their plans. The government also sends
greeting cards during festivals and is encouraging them to start
businesses at home.
</P>
<P>
The Lida Die Factory in Yongnan was running in the red, when
local officials asked one of these workers who was in Fujian
Province and who was an expert in this field to sign a contract
with the factory. The returned itinerant farmer has gotten the
plant to show a profit.
</P>
<P>
Ren Shichun is another example. He raised 500,000 yuan to
invest in a plywood factory in Hedian township, and concerned
government departments gave him the green light. In half a year
the factory was operating and had an annual output value of
approximately 20 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Develop Indigenous Manufacturing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Africa has been urged to
develop indigenous research and manufacturing capacity in the
field of telecommunications to avoid losing millions of Dollars
on importing technology.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Dierks, Namibian Deputy Minister of Works, Transport and
Communication made the call when addressing participants to the
regional internet seminar in Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The four-day seminar which began on Tuesday, is sponsored by
the United Nations Development Program and is coordinated by
Andrew Magirazi of Macmag Services.
</P>
<P>
Dierks said the continent was losing more than one million
U.S. Dollars importing telecommunications equipment, some of
which could be manufactured locally.
</P>
<P>
According to Dierks, Africa was becoming a "dumping ground"
and there was need to put conditions on contracts with western
companies which supplied telecommunications technology.
</P>
<P>
"We must unite and set conditions in contracts so that we have
some of the functions done within Africa so as to develop
indigenous capabilities. Otherwise Africa will remain a lost
continent," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels to Join Plane Crash Rescue Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A major Philippine Muslim rebel
force and a leftist rebel group have signified their intention to
join the government's rescue efforts in the plane crash accident
in a southern mountain area, local television reports said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al Haj Murad, a leader of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF), was quoted as saying the MILF has a camp near Mount
Sumagaya, in the southern island of Mindanao, where the Cebu
Pacific Flight 387 crashed Monday with 104 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
Murad said he had instructed his men to help search for bodies
of the victims and possible survivors near the crash site, a steep
ridge of the jungle-covered Mt. Sumagaya.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader hoped that the rescue authorities would
provide them with necessary information.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the New People's Army (NPA), led by the leftist
National Democratic Front and operating in the mountain area, also
expressed their willingness to join the search efforts.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the NPA might sabotage the rescue
operation. But the reports have been denied by the NPA.
</P>
<P>
Rescue officials said the MILF and the NPA could join the
rescue operation if they were unarmed.
</P>
<P>
About 200 rescuers already reached the crash site and reported
the recovery of several dismembered bodies and pieces of the
wreckage of the ill-fated plane. But there is no immediate report
on whether there are survivors.
</P>
<P>
The Cebu Pacific plane smashed into the 2,200-meter Mt.
Sumagaya Monday morning, barely 12 minutes before landing at
Cagayan de Oro City airport, some 800 kilometers south of its
departure place Manila.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Show In Downtown Shanghai Sparks Hot Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- When the Meilongzheng Shopping
Mall on Shanghai's bustling Nanjing Road put a tiger cub from the
Shanghai safari park on display it triggered a debate among the
city's residents.
</P>
<P>
The tiger and cage were placed upon a temporary stage
decorated with shrubs, flowers, and rockeries in full view of the
public. Because it was not accustomed to so much attention, the
six-month old tiger would retreat to the corner, or pace up and
down the cage, tearing a rug to shred.
</P>
<P>
Some people criticized the mall for using a wild animal to
promote sales, but the management claimed that they put on the
show to increase public awareness of the need to protect tigers in
the year of the tiger.
</P>
<P>
It was also asking for donations, and the mall management has
donated 100,000 yuan (about 8,200 US dollars). All donations will
go to the safari park.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, shops are complaining about a drop in business
because people are looking at the tiger instead of the shops,
according to Lu Qinghong, the mall's deputy-general manager.
</P>
<P>
Some people are still not satisfied. "No matter what the
reason, I don't think it's proper to hold a tiger show here," said
one woman who had made a donation, "the tiger looks lonely and it
should be released."
</P>
<P>
One young man, who insisted that the organizers were just
luring customers under the pretext of protecting wildlife, said,
"The tiger show in the city zoo is healthy and interesting, but
not this one."
</P>
<P>
Still, one Shanghai wildlife protection official described the
show as an attempt to find more means to raise funds because
they're plagued by a chronic lack of funds.

young promising athletes, said the Japanese delegation head on

</P>
<P>
"They are relaxed now," Yushiro Yagi, Chef de Mission of the
Japanese delegation, said in response to a question in the press
conference about Japanese athletes' pressure competing in
the home country.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday, I noticed they were a little nervous but they are in
good health condition and ready to go into action," Yagi said.

by the United States Wednesday in the final tune-up match, caught a

"We have not had any accident so far," Yagi added. "I think our
athletes are well prepared for the Winter Games."

in 1928 and Chiharu Igaya won a silver medal in the slalom at the
seventh Games in 1956 to become the first Japanese medalist.
</P>
<P>
In 1972 the Winter Olympics were held in Sapporo, which was the
first time for them to come to Asia. Japan's "flying squadron"
collected the gold, silver and bronze medals in the 70-meter ski
jumping.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials believe it is not unrealistic to hope that three
medals could once again be gained, in Nagano, but expect a recored
medals haul to beat previous best tally of seven, achieved in 1992 at
Albertville.
</P>
<P>
Kazuyoshi Funaki, current World Cup leader and winner of the
prestigious Four Hills competition, Masahiko Harada, third in the
World Cup standings and Hiroya Saitoh will at all take some stopping.
They have already stood together on the podium three times this
season.

<P>
Japan also expects success on the ice with the speed skaters.
</P>
<P>
World record-holder Hiroyash Shimizu and Manabu Horii, bronze
medalist in the 1994 Lillehammer Games, are Japanese hopes for an
Olympic gold in the men's 500 meters.

Ugandan cabinet decided on Wednesday at a meeting scrutinizing
the epidemic situation that all schools will reopen as government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
This was the second cabinet meeting within three days to
assess the possible effect of the epidemic. Ministries of health,
education as well as local government have submitted their
independent reports separately to the meetings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, special attention was paid on sanitation in and around
schools. The schools were asked to establish latrines and provide
water for the students after using latrines and before taking
food.
</P>
<P>
Kiyonga said district director of health services must check
hygienic condition of schools in 26 cholera affected districts
before February 9.
</P>
<P>
According to Uganda's laws, the district director of health
services is empowered to close any school which is considered a
potential danger to children and the public.
</P>
<P>
Kiyonga said the epidemic has killed 461 Ugandans and infected
10,000 others since late last November.

<HEADLINE> IBM Enjoys Significant Growth in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- IBM China recorded 50 percent
growth in 1997 sales when compared to the previous year, according
to Henry Chow, chairman and chief executive officer of the IBM
Greater China Group.
</P>
<P>
Chow made the comment during a ceremony marking publication of
a book on IBM's development in China during 1997. He noted that
both production and sales of IBM products, from personal
computers to mainframes, enjoyed varying degrees of growth.
</P>
<P>
The IBM China Research Center, one of the parent company's
seven major research and development centers worldwide, developed
the Chinese Phonetics Recognition System in August last
year.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, IBM China established a new joint venture in the south
China city of Shenzhen to manufacture hard disc magnetic heads, as
well as branches in Fuzhou, capital of east China's Fujian
Province, and Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Chow said that IBM China employs some 1,600 people, including
over 1,400 Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
The book -- Big Blue-IBM in China -- provides a detailed
description of IBM China's development history, modes of
operation, principles and marketing strategies.

<HEADLINE> Studies Predict Greater Consumption from the Aged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scholar who studies
the country's aging problem has pointed out that the rapidly
growing number of elderly could bring great opportunities for
domestic and overseas enterpreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Xiong Bijun, of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, says
that a study he did recently found that senior citizens in China
could spend at least 300 billion yuan (about 36 billion US
dollars) each year on consumer goods and various services.
</P>
<P>
China's National Aging Society says that China now has 120
million people above the age of 60,and that number is growing
three percent annually. By 2030, the number of elderly in China is
expected to exceed the population of the whole of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Demographers say that China's family support for the elderly
has been declining since the one-child policy started in the early
1980s and Xiong's study found that as a result of family planning
most of the 35 million elderly living in cities have only one
child to support them.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Affairs Ministry has found that 33.4 percent of
China's senior citizens have lost their spouses, and 25 percent do
not live with their children, so they have to look to society for
medical care, nursing services, and other help, Xiong explains.
</P>
<P>
Chinese society is aging faster than its economy is growing,
and this is exacerbated by the fact that life expectancy has been
increasing over the past few decades.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals report that average medical expenditures of the
elderly are three to four times higher than those of younger
people.
</P>
<P>
As the nuclear family shrinks, by the end of the century, the
army of elderly in China will have to depend on the service sector
for their daily necessities, Xiong predicts. And, society should
find a way to provide more services like home deliveries, nursing,
and psychological counseling for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
This problem has also caught the government's attention,
according to Zou Ping, a State Council official, who says that
the government will offer preferential treatment in the form of
tax breaks to businesses that provide special products and
services for the elderly.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Enjoys Safe, Happy Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Millions of Chinese are
returning to work after the week-long Spring Festival holiday
which an official with the Ministry of Public Security described
as "safe and happy."
</P>
<P>
"People throughout the nation enjoyed stable social order
during the holiday period, with all celebrations proceeding
smoothly," according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Public security bureaus intensified both patrol and security
activities during the period, with millions of police officers,
armed police officers and security personnel remaining at their
posts.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of public security officers in Beijing, the Chinese
capital, patrolled temple fairs, lantern festivals and flower
markets.
</P>
<P>
A random Xinhua survey in Beijing and Shanghai showed that the
overwhelming majority of the residents were satisfied with
security work over the holidays.
</P>
<P>
Some 89.7 percent of Beijing respondents think that public
security will offer even better protection during 1998.

<HEADLINE> Dar es Salaam Wants Commercial Toilets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Dar es Salaam City
Commission has been urged to allow private investors to build pay
toilets at public places so as to check the spread of diseases,
The Guardian said today.
</P>
<P>
Reginald Mengi, Board Chairman of the National Environment
Management Council (NEMC), said on Tuesday if the city commission
can not run the toilets, it should allow investors to undertake
the job.
</P>
<P>
Mengi made the remarks while inspecting the hygiene of the
Ilala market in the city where toilets are found in a dreadful
condition.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen in the market told the NEMC delegation that the
city commission has not paid due attention to the cleanliness of
the toilets there.
</P>
<P>
In response, the NEMC board chairman said cholera and other
diseases can be prevented easily if the environment is kept
clean.
</P>
<P>
The delegation also visited the Muhimbi Medical Center, a
leading hospital in Tanzania, and urged its medical staff to
dispose waste properly.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Leaves for Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad left for Thailand Thursday afternoon for an
overnight trip as part of his regional tour to discuss the
financial crisis with fellow ASEAN leaders.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir will meet Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai soon after
his arrival in Bangkok from which he will fly to Manila Friday for
another overnight stay for similar discussions with Philippine
President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader will wrap up his tour with a meeting
Saturday in Singapore with Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that apart from the financial crisis, the
leaders are also likely to take up the question of enhancing
intra-ASEAN trade using their own currencies which they agreed to
do during the Informal ASEAN Summit held here last December to
offset the impact to their economies by the sharp fall of the
currencies of Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia against the U.S.
dollar since the currency crisis began last July.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir already visited Jakarta last month for talks with
President Soeharto on the regional crisis and also met Goh Chok
Tong in Johor, Malaysia, for similar purpose on January 20.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Continues Artificial Rainfall Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai
Province will finance a new round of projects to use artificial
methods to increase rainfall in the upper reaches of the Yellow
River.
</P>
<P>
Between April-September last year, the province spent one
million yuan to carry out cloud seeding experiments using aircraft
and artillery pieces in the upper reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Surveys indicate that the experiments raised the rainfall
volume in the Yellow River from 180 million to 280 million cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, China's second longest river, stretches 5,464
kilometers. The river finds its source in the northern foothills
of the Bayanhar Mountains in Qinghai Province, meanders through
Gansu Province, the Ningxia Hui and Inner Mongolia autonomous
regions, Shaanxi, Shanxi and Henan provinces, and finally empties
into Bohai Bay in Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Water levels in the upper reaches of the river have
dropped since 1990 due to prolonged droughts. This has in turn
depleted water in various sections of the lower reaches and has
severely impeded economic construction and development in
provinces and autonomous regions in the river valley.
</P>
<P>
Local meteorologists note that first-hand experience gained
from last year's experiments laid a solid foundation for this
year's efforts.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, operations will be carried out in a 1,500-km section
in the upper reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
The central government fully supports and will provide
assitance for the new round of experiments which will be carried
out at a cost of some two million yuan, according to local
officials.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Further Isolated on Republic Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister John Howard
became further isolated in his support for the constitutional
monarchy Thursday when his Communications Minister Richard Alston,
a member of the Liberal Party's four-member leadership team,
declared himself in favor of a republic.
</P>
<P>
Alston said it was time for an Australian head of state.
</P>
<P>
"My position is that the current constitution has served us
very well," he said. However, "the current arrangements in
relation to the head of state are anachronistic and I therefore
regard a move to an Australian head as both inevitable and
desirable."
</P>
<P>
Alston joined leadership team members Environment Minister
Robert Hill and Treasurer Peter Costello in supporting a republic,
leaving Howard the only team member supporting the status quo.
</P>
<P>
Since the Constitutional Convention started Monday five cabinet
ministers declared themselves were republicans, three regarded a
republic as inevitable and three remain undeclared.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Howard Thursday warned republicans they
would need to agree on one model for a republic before he would
put the question to a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Howard has consistently said he would call a referendum on the
issue next year if the Constitutional Convention agreed to support
a republic.
</P>
<P>
But Thursday he said the convention's final vote should agree
on a specific model defining how any new head of state should be
appointed.
</P>
<P>
"The one that receives the most support could then be pitted
against the status quo," he said.
</P>
<P>
"My view at this stage is that the final question could be, let
us assume that there is a majority support for the Australian
Republican Movement's proposal, I would have thought the final
question should be: 'Do you favor Australia becoming a Republic on
the basis that the head of state would be chosen by a vote of
two-thirds of the Commonwealth parliament - yes or no?'"

<HEADLINE> China's Major Policy-Oriented Bank Reports Good Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank of
China (SDB), a major government policy-oriented bank, was
successful both in its policy work and in its business last year,
its president, Yao Zhenyan, told a meeting today.
</P>
<P>
SDB, one of China's three policy-oriented banks, was set up in
1994, and last year had 107.7 billion yuan in loans and profits of
760 million yuan from 31.6 billion yuan in turnover.
</P>
<P>
There was 75.5 billion yuan in loans to less-developed interior
parts of central and western China, about 70.1 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
It reports that 102.8 billion yuan, or 95.5 percent of its
loans, went to large and medium-sized or technological upgrading
projects in 1997, three percentage points higher than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The loans to large projects and to underdeveloped areas caused
a decrease in loans to small construction projects.
</P>
<P>
SDB exercises macro-economic controls over distribution of
investment to key national projects selected by the State
Council. For the past few years, it has accounted for a third of
the state bank loans for fixed-assets investment and 70 percent of
the state loan quota for basic construction.
</P>
<P>
Yao said that this year his bank will continue to increase
loans for infrastructure, basic industries and the less-developed
areas in the interior.
</P>
<P>
The bank's business this year will include raising 120.8
billion yuan in funds, extending 95 billion yuan in loans, writing
off 800 million yuan in bad loans, and making a net profit of 450
to 500 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> More Beijingers Purchase Insurance Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Municipal Insurance
Association (BMIA) reports that an increasing number of Beijingers
purchased insurance policies in 1997, with the per-capita premium
hitting 818 yuan (99 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
BMIA Secretary-General Pu Ying noted that the per-capita
premium was ten times the national average of 85 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The city's total insurance premiums last year skyrocketed by 90
percent over 1996 to some nine billion yuan (one billion US
dollars), accounting for five percent of its gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's insurance industry has developed at an annual average
rate of over 50 percent in recent years, Pu said.
</P>
<P>
Pu noted that most of the policyholders opted for life
insurance, with the average premium reaching 578 yuan. "The trend
indicates that improved living standards have been accompanied by
an increased sense of self-preservation," said Pu.
</P>
<P>
China is in the process of replacing the former welfare system
with a social security system adapted to the rules of the
socialist market economy. As a result, an increasing number of the
Chinese people have turned to insurance companies for medical,
accloped at an annual average rate of over 50 percent in recent
years.

<HEADLINE> Blair: Britain Strongly Supports IMF Role in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said here Wednesday that Britain "strongly supports" the
International Monetary Fund's role in resolving Asia's financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Blair was quoted by his spokesman as saying this to IMF
Managing Director Michel Camdessus shortly after arriving here for
a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Blair told Camdessus that Britain "strongly
disagreed with recent criticisms of the IMF from some quarters in
the United States."
</P>
<P>
Some politicians argued in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal that
the IMF was "ineffective, unnecessary and obsolete" and should be
abolished once the Asian crisis was over.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the IMF bailout program for some Asian countries was
necessary for preventing a market collapse that would have severe
impacts on the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
He described Clinton's efforts to secure additional funds for
the IMF as "hugely important" for restoring market confidence and
preventing any further shocks in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he planned to invite Camdessus, World Bank President
James Wolfensohn and World Trade Organization President Renato
Ruggiero to a G8 finance and foreign ministers meeting before the
Birmingham G8 summit in May.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the European Union's current president, will also host
an Asia-Europe summit in London in early April.
</P>
<P>
Blair later dined at his guest residence with leading
U.S. economic decision-makers including Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister would also meet with President Bill
Clinton on issues including the crisis over the U.N. weapons
inspections in Iraq.

Qian went on to say that the state sovereignty, national
dignity and security concerns of Iraq, a member country of the
United Nations, should also be respected.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment seven years ago, the UN Special
Commission has made much progress in the weapons inspection work
in Iraq, Qian said, adding that the Special Commission should, on
the basis of the progress, make an objective, comprehensive and
fair assessment of the general cooperation of Iraq and close as
soon as possible its file on certain inspection areas that require
no further investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side hopes that the parties concerned would adopt
restraint and flexible attitude and continue seeking the settlement
of differences through dialogues, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
Qian told Albright that he had given an oral message today to
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz, asking the Iraqi side to
agree to discuss with the UN Special Commission on the entry of
the inspection team.
</P>
<P>
Albright elaborated the US stance, saying that the US is
consulting with many countries on the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Albright told Qian that she had recently visited France, Saudi
Arabia, Egypt and other countries. The United States demands that
Iraq implement the related resolutions of the UN Security Council
unconditionally, she said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is willing to continue to keep in contact
with the Chinese side on the Iraqi crisis, Albright said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Protests US Human Rights Report on Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has strongly protested
against the U.S. Human Rights Report for 1997 on the South Asian
nation for "baseless allegations," the national news agency BSS
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report contained "inaccuracies, half-truths and
unsubstantiated allegations," Foreign Secretary M. M. Rahman was
quoted as telling U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh John C. Holzman
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The report was a "compilation of hearsay and misinformation
that badly lacked objectivity," as most of its content was
"gathered from the local press as if the press reports were gospel
truth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rahman refuted observations that the Bangladeshi government
infringed on citizens' private rights, limited freedom of assembly
and the workers' rights, discriminated against women, minority
groups, religious minorities and indigenous groups, and that child
labor was a widespread and serious problem in the country, as
"vague and unsubstantiated allegations."
</P>
<P>
There was no infringement of citizens' rights, no limitation on
freedom of assembly and discrimination against any particular
group of citizens in Bangladesh, while on the contrary, there had
been considerable progress on women's rights, child labor, and
freedom of religion in the country, the foreign secretary said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the very fact that a foreign diplomat could
address the media on a matter critical of the government belied
the suggestion in the report that the media in Bangladesh was not
free and that journalists were harassed and intimidated.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in Dhaka held a press conference here Tuesday,
without prior permission from the government, to release the
Bangladesh portion of the human rights report for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report depicting Bangladesh as a lawless, violent and
crime-ridden country with no security of life was a highly
misleading portrayal, he said, as the crime in the country was
only a fraction of that in many states of the United States.
</P>
<P>
This was the initial reaction of the Bangladeshi government to
the U.S. report, and a detailed comment would be prepared after
accurate information was gathered, the foreign secretary added.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Health Ministry Warns of Malaria Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Ministry of Health has
issued an alert over an expected increase in malaria cases
following three-month rains caused by the El Nino phenomenon,
the Kenya Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted James Mwanzia, Director of Medical Service,
as saying Wednesday that the highland malaria was reported in
Kisii and Nyamira districts where about 224 people were killed by
the disease.
</P>
<P>
The worst-hit districts are Nandi, Nyamira, Kisii, Trans Mara
and parts of Kericho, he said, adding that the disease was
expected to spread in most parts of the East African country.
</P>
<P>
The medical official noted that the cases of highland malaria
had been aggravated by the adverse weather conditions created by
the El Nino phenomenon during the past three months.
</P>
<P>
The ministry recommends immediate clearing of bushes around
houses and draining of all pools of stagnant water all over the
country to eradicate all possible mosquito breeding sites.
</P>
<P>
As highland malaria outbreak continues to ravage Kisii and
Nyamira districts, Kenyan Finance Minister Semon Nyachae has
donated anti-malaria drugs worth 500,000 Kenyan Shillings (about
9,000 U.S. Dollars) to fight the epidemic disease.

<HEADLINE> East China Power Network Generates More Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- In 1997 the East China Power
Network generated 205.8 billion kilowatts-hour (kwh) of
electricity, up 4.9 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
The power output, surpassing 200 billion kwh for the first time
last year, had guaranteed supply for Shanghai as well as the
provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Qian Zhongwei, general manager of the
East China Electricity Group, at a recent work conference of the
utility, which is headquartered in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997 the network had a total power-generating
capacity of 44.77 million kilowatts (kw), 3,327 kilometers (km) of
500 kilovolt (kv) cables, and a transformation capacity of 11.39
million kilovolt amperage (kva).
</P>
<P>
Last year, the network installed 12 large- and medium-sized
generators, with a total capacity of 2.41 million kw, laid 142 km
of 500 kv-cables, and increased its transformation capacity by 1.5
million kva.
</P>
<P>
The network, with total assets worth more than 120 billion
yuan, topped 56 billion yuan in sales and 8.2 billion yuan in
pre-tax profits, up 15.7 percent and 9.3 percent from the previous
year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
This year, the group plans to increase its power output by 6.4
percent to reach 219 billion kwh, install seven large- and
medium-sized generating sets with a total capacity of 2.1 million
kw, earn 60 billion yuan from its power sales and make 8.6 billion
yuan in pre-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 99 percent of rural households in the area are
expected to be electrified, according to the plan.

<HEADLINE> WHO Office to Be in Harare for Two Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The African regional office of
the World Health Organisation (WHO) which is temporarily based in
Zimbabwe will remain here for at least two more years before
considering a move back to Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
WHO regional director Ebrahim Samba made the statement here on
Wednesday following his return from meetings of the WHO
development committee and the executive board held in Geneva from
January 14 to 28.
</P>
<P>
Samba said the decision was made based on the recent
announcement by the new authorities in Brazzaville that the
transition period leading to free elections would take at least
three years.
</P>
<P>
"Our advice at the moment is to wait and see until after the
transition period. We will probably be here for at least two
years, but we will be sending staff to Brazzaville on a regular
basis to evaluate the situation," said Samba.
</P>
<P>
At the regional committee meeting held in Sun City, South
Africa last September, members decided that Brazzaville was the
substantive base, he added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided that until the situation was
sufficiently settled in Brazzaville, Harare would be hosting the
African regional office.

<HEADLINE> Scattered Bodies Found at Philippine Plane Crash Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Scattered bodies and debris of
the ill-fated Cebu Pacific flight 387 were found Thursday morning
in a one-square-kilometer radius within the crash site in Mt.
Sumagaya, Mindanao, the official Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
According to the agency, Gerald Navarro, member of the De Oro
Mountaineering Explorer (Dome), reported to the search and rescue
base in Mt. Haruhay in Claveria, Mindanao, that his group found a
headless and dismembered body of a female passenger wearing a
black skirt and padded blouse printed with flower designs.
</P>
<P>
Navarro, however, said that what they had found was only in
part of the one-square-kilometer radius now being scoured by at
least four search and rescue teams in the area.
</P>
<P>
He said apart from the woman's body, a number of scattered
flesh had been also found in the area, 6,500 feet above sea level,
located 240-degrees West of Mt. Lumot, one of the four mountains
surrounding Mt. Sumagaya.
</P>
<P>
Navarro said mountaineers also found wall and window parts of
the Mcdonell Douglas DC-9 cockpit scattered in Mt. Lumot along
with the bodies.
</P>
<P>
There were 99 passengers and five crew members aboard the plane
when it left Manila for Cagayan de Oro Monday Morning.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that Jacinto Ligot, ground commander of the
search and rescue team now combing the crash site, immediately
dispatched support teams bringing along with them food, cadaver
bags, powder deodorizer and gloves for the retrieval of the
bodies.
</P>
<P>
The agency also said that Pedro Tabanggay, head of the special
forces, reported almost simultaneously that ground search and
rescue team spotted scattered bodies on their way to Mt. Sumagaya.
</P>
<P>
Tabanggay said that his team is now nearing the crash site in
Mt. Sumagaya believed to be the impact site of the main fuselage
of the DC-9 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the morning, 200 rescuers, who are combing the
one-square-kilometer radius crash site, reported that they
recovered bags, wallets, tattered documents, underwear, raffle
tickets, aircraft foams and writing pads in Sitio Magba-is, a
village near the summit of Mt. Sumagaya.

<HEADLINE> Australia Refuses to Rule out WTO Challenge to US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Thursday refused to rule out a World Trade Organization
(WTO) challenge to a United States export push into Asia which
could threaten some of Australia's key markets.
</P>
<P>
Howard cited a case in which the U.S. threatened to go to the
international trade umpire in an attempt to force Australia to
abandon subsidies paid to textiles, clothing and footwear
manufacturers as justification for taking a tough stand on the
U.S. behavior in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Since the financial turmoil swept East Asia last year, the U.S.
has offered cash-strapped nations such as South Korea and
Indonesia billion-dollar credit guarantees in a bid to bolster
exports of U.S. agricultural commodities.
</P>
<P>
Asked in a press conference here whether Australia was
considering taking a case to the WTO, Howard told reporters: "I
don't rule anything out."
</P>
<P>
"The Americans have not been reluctant to take us to the World
Trade Organization, the Americans played hard ball over Howe
leather and the Australian government's first responsibility is to
protect the interests of Australian jobs and Australian
exporters," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the Howe Leather case, the U.S. complained that subsidies
paid to Australian manufacturers of leather upholstery for
automobiles discriminated against U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
Howard Wednesday accused U.S. exporters of being actively
avaricious in trying to steal Australian markets in nations such
as Indonesia and South Korea which were still reeling from
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He told the news conference that the government was still
gathering evidence of the U.S. trade behavior in the region and
would assess that information before deciding on a response.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: No Big Difference in Manifestos of India's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- As the date of the 12th
Parliamentary general elections is approaching, the election
campaigns of various political parties in India are gaining
momentum.
</P>
<P>
Yet there is no big difference in manifestos issued
respectively by India's three major political forces - the
Congress, the United Front and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
</P>
<P>
The three major forces in their manifestos have attached great
importance to stability and good governance in the country, but
all of them are soft peddling on economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Promising stability, the Congress manifesto issued on January
24 said that the party's concept on the issue is the "stability of
ideas, policies and programs".
</P>
<P>
"Stability is not a cover for maintaining status quo or
justifying a policy of cautions. It means change that improves the
living conditions of all. To Congress, stability is resilience and
a tenacity of purpose."
</P>
<P>
The party claimed that the Congress alone could give a
development-oriented stable government based on experience.
</P>
<P>
The United Front in its manifesto issued on January 30 said
that it would offer a "government that will provide stability and
security for the Indian people."
</P>
<P>
It promised to provide a stable government and a
corruption-free, clean and accountable administration in the event
of its coming to power.
</P>
<P>
The BJP manifesto issued on February 3 also appealed to the
electorate to vote for it and its allies for "stability and an
able prime minister."
</P>
<P>
As in the past, all the three political forces in their
manifestos have promised a lot of welfare programs so as to win
the heart of electorate.
</P>
<P>
Though all the Congress, the United Front and the BJP have
given assurances to liberalize the economy, they are cautious in
furthering economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Congress manifesto, while talking of liberalization, does
not mention the word "globalizatin" even once. There is no mention
of the need to privatize the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The United Front in its manifesto made no mention of its plans
on furthering economic reforms and was against large-scale opening
up of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The BJP in its manifesto said that it would allow foreign
direct investment only into priority areas like infrastructure,
export promotion and hi-tech industries, but restrict the flow of
foreign direct investment in non-priority areas and areas where
the domestic industry was performing well.
</P>
<P>
It said that national development would be largely funded by
the capital generated within the country and foreign investment
would play only a small role.
</P>
<P>
Promising to protect the domestic industry, the BJP manifesto
said that until the Indian economy reached a level of global
strength, existing Indian companies will be safeguarded against
takeovers by foreign companies through suitable and transparent
rules.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rescuers Find Female Body Near Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine rescuers recovered
Thursday morning a headless female body near the crash site of a
Cebu Pacific passenger plane in Mt. Sumagaya, Mindanao, reports
reaching the Philippine Air Force in Manila said.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the female passenger, whose legs were
also missing, was the first victim found by rescuers since they
reached at the crash site Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There were 104 people, including five crew members, aboard the
DC-9 plane when it left Manila to Cagayan de Oro city in Mindanao
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the female body will be flown to Cagayan
de Oro for examination and identification.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, unconfirmed reports said that six survivors were
found inside the broken cockpit of the plane lying on the floor of
a deep ravine. Details for confirmation were not yet available.
</P>
<P>
But the Cebu Pacific Air, the owner of the plane, earlier
suggested prospects for any survivors are dim.
</P>
<P>
The bodies to be retrieved will be brought to Oro Garden in
Cagayan de Oro city for identification by their relatives.
Survivors, if there are any, will airlifted to hospitals in the
city.
</P>
<P>
The latest local television reports also said that all planes
of the Cebu Pacific Air were grounded Thursday morning after

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Three-Year EFF Credit for Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) approved on Wednesday a three-year credit of Argentina
equivalent to about 2.8 billion U.S. dollars under the Extended
Fund Facility (EFF) for Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The credit is provided in support of the government's
medium-term economic reform program for 1998 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine government attaches importance to the IMF's
approval of its policy framework. But it intends to treat the EFF
credit as precautionary, and will only draw under it if adverse
external circumstances make it necessary.
</P>
<P>
According to Argentina's 1998-2000 program, the expected
slowdown in the growth of world trade caused by the crisis in some
parts of Asia will result in a deceleration of Argentina's real
GDP growth in 1998, but that real GDP growth should recover to
potential output by 2000. The rate of unemployment should continue
to decline gradually, inflation should remain around one percent in
1998, and the current account deficit, as a result of an expected
upturn in exports, should decline to about 3.5 percent of GDP by
2000.
</P>
<P>
The EFF is an IMF financing facility that backs medium-term
programs that seek to overcome balance of payments difficulties
stemming from macroeconomic imbalances and structural problems.
</P>
<P>
Argentina joined the IMF in September 1956. Its quota is about
2,078 million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF credit
currently totals some 5,739 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rises Slightly in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Inflation rate in the
Philippines moved up to 6.4 percent in January from 6.1 percent in
December 1997 due to the lingering effects of the currency crisis
on prices of basic commodities, the National Statistics Office
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The latest year-on-year inflation rate was well within the
target of the government, although it was also higher than the
average inflation of 5.8 percent for the entire 1997.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier expected inflation to have increased by
slightly below 7 percent in January mainly due to the sharp
depreciation of the Philippine peso in the past seven months.
</P>
<P>
On a month-on-month basis, prices were up by 1 percent in
January from 0.4 percent last month, the statistics office said in
a report.
</P>
<P>
All the commodity groups registered higher inflation rates
except for housing and repairs whose inflation rate slowed down to
10.3 percent from 10.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite the uptrend of inflation, Socio-economic Planning
Secretary Cielito Habito said Wednesday that no other factors are
seen to drive up prices as there are enough supply of food and oil
products.
</P>
<P>
Habito said there is no cause for worry that inflation for 1998
will zoom to double digit.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter is seen to be a difficult time for the
economy due to the present currency crisis, and economic planners
are working hard at keeping inflation at projected 7.5 to 8.5
percent, Habito said.

<HEADLINE> Rescuers Continue Search for Bodies, Survivors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine military teams and
volunteer rescuers on Thursday continued their search for bodies
and survivors on a southern densely-forested mountain where a
domestic plane crashed Monday with 104 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
They continued to penetrate thick jungle on Mount Sumagaya in
Misamis Oriental province in Mindanao to reach the earlier-spotted
crash site of the Cebu Pacific Air Flight 387.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated flight, a DC-9 McDonell Douglas plane, slammed
into Mt. Sumagaya Monday morning, when landing in its destination,
Cagayan de Oro City, capital of Misamis Oriental, some 800
kilometers away from its departure place Manila.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers reached the general area of the crash site Wednesday
afternoon and reported retrieving blankets, name cards and some
other personal belongings of passengers.
</P>
<P>
The rescuers, who camped in the jungle, were about four to six
kilometers away from the spotted flat crater presumably made by
the plane when it smashed into the range of the 2,200-meter
mountain.
</P>
<P>
They have yet to find the wreckage of the plane, the bodies of
the victims and any survivors. Estimates were that because of
thick jungle, rains and snakes, it will take them several days
more to complete the search operation.
</P>
<P>
Local television reports said more and more volunteer teams,
including some anguished relatives of the passengers, joined the
rescue efforts Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Search operations were canceled at about 4 p.m. Wednesday due
to bad weather and darkness.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Air Force officials participating in the rescue
operation said earlier the chances of finding survivors were dim
as the plane apparently exploded on impact.
</P>
<P>
The crash could be the worst in Philippine aviation history. In
the last major air accident in the country, 50 people died when a
Philippine Airlines plane crashed into a mountain in the northern
resort city of Baguio in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Records from the Air Transportation Office show that the
ill-fated DC-9 plane was over 30 years old and had flown for more
than 70,000 hours. It was built by McDonell Douglas in the United
States and put into service by Air Canada in March 1967. Cebu
Pacific acquired it in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
McDonell Douglas representatives already arrived here Wednesday
together with officials of the U.S. National Transport and Safety
Board to assist in the investigation of the air disaster.

reforms and to assist Ukraine's closer integration with Europe.
</P>
<P>
Herzog, who arrived here late Tuesday for his first state visit
to the former Soviet republic, said that the pace of reforms in
Ukraine is not fast enough. He said Ukraine's goal for closer
integration with Europe will require faster reform.

Ukraine will have to tackle structural reforms needed to
attract direct foreign investment, and to ease the need for
foreign aid and internal borrowing, the German president said in
talks with his Ukrainian counterpart, Leonid Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
"As long as Ukraine leaves market economic reforms unchanged,
Germany will continue to assist it in developing its economy,"
Herzog said.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma reiterated that the guidelines for Ukraine's economic
reforms will never be altered. He expressed the hope that Germany
would increase investment in Ukraine, especially in the weapons,
metallurgical and chemical industry.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma hoped Germany would continue to back its European
integration efforts, while stressing that Ukraine constitutes a
major factor in European stability and security.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Carlos Westendorp, the
representative in charge of implementing the Dayton peace
agreement, decided on Wednesday that the new Bosnian flag should
have a dark blue background with yellow lines and a yellow
triangle.
</P>
<P>
On the flag there will also be white, five-pointed stars
running along the triangle's hypotenuse forming the outline of the
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp made the decision after the Bosnian Parliament
Tuesday failed to reach agreement on the design of the new flag.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian MPs were offered three models, designed by an
independent expert commission appointed by the office of the high
representative. The House of Representatives on Tuesday, however,
rejected all three proposals.
</P>
<P>
According to Duncan Bullivant, a spokesman for the office, the
dark blue color and white stars on the new Bosnian flag symbolize
the connection between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the European Union
and the fact that the country belongs to Europe.
</P>
<P>
The triangle stands for the three constituent peoples in Bosnia
and Herzegovina and the golden yellow is the color of the sun, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The office of the high representative had decided that the new
flag should be adopted at the beginning of February so that it
could represent the country at the next Winter Olympic Games in
Nagano, Japan.

<P>
HAIKOU, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Hainan, China's southernmost
island province, hosted over 250,000 tourists during the Spring
Festival period from January 27 to February 3, including 50,000
visitors from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Hainan's tropical climate contrasts sharply with temperate
zones found in most parts of China. One local official
noted that "Hainan's abundant sunshine" served as a magnet
attracting large numbers of tourists during the period.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has emerged as the primary choice of tourists from major
cities, including Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai, with some
40,000 Shanghainese visited the island during the festival period.
</P>
<P>
The provincial tourism department operated over 800 tour buses,
and the daily volume of the Haikou Airport doubled to over 200
aircraft. Hainan also increased the number of tour boats during
the period.

The president of the National Infancy Foundation, Mario Viquez
exposed the complicity of families, many times it was the mother
who hid the abuse and rapes, mainly when the offender was a family
member.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, it is true that the number of exposures has
increased.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- World number one Pete
Sampras said in a teleconference call on Wednesday that he would
not play the United States' opening-round Davis Cup tie against
Russia in April.
</P>
<P>
"I just talked to (U.S. team captain) Tom Gullikson and told
him I wasn't playing," Sampras said. "In the past I haven't
played the first two rounds very much and I won't this year."
</P>
<P>
The 1997 runner-up United States will play their opening World
Group tie against Russia from April 3-5 in Stone Mountain,
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Sampras said the decision was made partly due to the fear of
receiving another injury after he suffered a calf injury in last
December's Davis Cup final.
</P>
<P>
Sampras was eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Australian
Open by unseeded Karol Kucera of Slovakia last month.

<HEADLINE> EU Executive Adopts Farm Prices Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, Wednesday adopted the farm
prices package for the next marketing year.
</P>
<P>
Under the package, the Commission decided to keep the prices
unchanged under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which
has a budget of 50 billion U.S. dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive adopted the proposal on an initiative from
Franz Fischler, European commissioner for agriculture and rural
development, noting that it was in line with its desire to freeze
agricultural spending in 1999 compared to 1998.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural budget for 1998 has been set at 40.44 billion
ECUs (48.5 billion U.S.dollars), about 50 percent of the whole EU
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
"The proposals largely amount to a rollover of existing
arrangements," the EU executive said in a statement issued here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
EU farm ministers are scheduled to discuss the farm price
proposals later this month. But the meeting will only act as an
initial debate.
</P>
<P>
The impending reform of the CAP, which has been proposed by
Fischler, has outshadowed the annual price-fixing round this year,
a traditional controversial issue between EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the proposals, Fischler said one should not
conclude from the content of these proposals that all was well in
the agricultural sector and that the status quo could continue.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite clear that serious problems lie ahead which
require a well thought out, coherent strategy if we are to avoid
them and not annual piecemeal policy adjustments," said the
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
He added that the future of the EU's agricultural sector
depended on the outcome of the Agenda 2000 discussion and it was
on this package of measures which the Commission would bring
forward in March that EU members must concentrate their attention
this year.
</P>
<P>
The proposals, unveiled last Summer, formed part of the Agenda
2000 package of wide-ranging institutional reforms. They are
still the subject of fierce ministerial debate, and more details
from the Commission are expected next month.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Leaders Urge to Remove Saddam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Congress leaders on
Wednesday urged to remove Iraq President Saddam Hussein once the
United States decided to take military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich said any U.S. military attack on
Iraq must either remove Saddam from power or end his weapons
program once for all.
</P>
<P>
"We have to adopt a position that he will either agree to
unlimited U.N. inspections or we will have to replace him with a
regime that will agree to end this kind of (weapons) program,"
Gingrich told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said any military planning for the possible attack should

replace him," he added.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority leader Trent Lott also said the end result of
any military action on Iraq should be to remove Saddam from power.
</P>
<P>
"We should do everything we can to get this resolved and find
a way to have him removed from office one way or the other,"
Lott told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Poland Calls for More German Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Polish Prime Minister
Jerzy Buzek Wednesday called on German companies to increase
investment in Poland, saying Germany is Poland's most important
trading partner.
</P>
<P>
Buzek, who is to wind up a two-day visit to Germany today, told
German business figures at a meeting that one of his government's
priorities was to speed up privatization in Poland, and the
structural overhaul in Poland's heavy industry.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to continue the reform in Poland and to make Poland
a "good and stable" partner in economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Buzek also voiced concern over Poland's trade deficit with
Germany, adding that the gap would widen further as a result of
Germany's limit on market access for Poland's building industry.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Buzek held talks with German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel, who reiterated Germany's support for Poland's efforts for
the European Union (E.U.) membership.
</P>
<P>
"We feel a special historic responsibility for Poland", said
Kinkel in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to Kinkel, negotiations on Poland's E.U. membership
would be complex despite the fact that Poland has been selected by
both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the E.U. as
top candidate among the East European countries which applied for
admission.
</P>
<P>
The German Foreign Minister also stressed Bonn's hope for
closer cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Buzek had talks with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
expressing the hope that the slow-moving E.U. internal reforms
would not hinder the bloc's enlargement into eastern Europe.

<HEADLINE> Most Greek Children Suffer from Tooth Decay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Some 60 to 65 percent of
children in Greece were now suffering from tooth decay, one of the
highest rates in Europe, according to figures released by Athens
University's laboratory of preventive dentistry Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline in the number of tooth decay in recent
years, gum disease still affected six out of ten Greek children.
</P>
<P>
The laboratory attributed this to the improvement of people's
living standard which resulted in the more consumption of sugar
annually.
</P>
<P>
To inform children of the importance of dental care, Greek
dentists will soon tour primary schools in Attica during a
"Preventive Dentistry Week" which was jointly organized by Athens
University and the Dental Association of Attica.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, a similar program had achieved good results with more
and more children aged between 6 and 12 often going to see
dentists.

<HEADLINE> UN Seeks 157 Million Dollars for Humanitarian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations today
appealed for 157 million U.S. dollars to ensure the continuation
of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, a war-afflicted country
that has the highest rates of infant, childhood and maternal
mortality in Asia.
</P>
<P>
People of Afghanistan are now facing their nineteenth winter at
war. Half the population in the capital of Kabul alone are
dependent in the United Nations and its partners for food,
medicine and basic services.
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian situation in the country has been deteriorating,
with the concomitant increase in the need for urgent humanitarian
assistance. The presence of some 10 million landmines pose a
impediment to the return of Afghan refugees.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, non-governmental organizations and donor
governments have developed a common assistance strategy for
Afghanistan, which is aimed at forging closer links between
peacemaking efforts and relief and development activities.
</P>
<P>
According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs, the 1998 consolidated appeal for the country has
identified priority needs in the areas of food security and food
aid, support for the voluntary repatriation of refugees, primary
health-care services, rural and urban rehabilitation, mine action
and drug control.
</P>
<P>
The international community is requested to respond generously
to this appeal, to relieve the protracted suffering of the Afghan
people and to provide a basis for the long-term rehabilitation and
reconstruction of the country.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vows to Deny Iraq any Weapons of Mass Destruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Wednesday vowed to deny Iraq any weapons of mass destruction and
called on for a genuine diplomatic solution to the weapons
inspections crisis.
</P>
<P>
"I will say again, one way or the other we are determined to
deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and
the missiles to deliver them," Clinton said at a White House event
on funding a program for mentors."That is our bottom line," he
added.
</P>
<P>
When asked about an international diplomacy to defuse the
crisis in order to avoid a possible military strikes against Iraq
as the United States had repeatedly threatened, Clinton said that
"all of us would prefer a genuine diplomatic solution." He made
clear that he will take military action against Iraq if it refuses
to permit weapons inspections to resume.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was encouraged by a "strong consensus"
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright found on her trip to Europe
and the Middle East that Iraq must fulfill all U.N. Security
Council resolutions and allow the weapons inspectors "full and
unfettered access" to all sites they deem necessary.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would meet at the White House later in the day
with Albright on her just completed trip. The secretary of state
conferred earlier on Wednesday with Democrats in Congress over her
trip for support from U.S. allies and friends in U.S. military
action against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition "China: 5,000 Years" to be Held in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 4 (Xinhua)-- The exhibition "China: 5,000
Years" is ready and will be open to the public on Friday, the
Guggenheim Museum of New York said today.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is a collaboration of Guggenheim, the third
largest museum in New York, with the Ministry of Culture and the
National Administration for Cultural Heritage of China.
</P>
<P>
Comprised of approximately 500 works of art spanning the
Neolithic period to the present day, this exhibition is the first
major museum presentation that unites traditional and modern Chinese
art in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The works, many of which have never been seen outside China,
have been brought together from over 50 lenders in 17 provinces
and autonomous regions in China to create an exhibition of
unprecedented scope and magnitude.
</P>
<P>
The traditional section of the exhibition features important

<HEADLINE> Congress Urged to OK Peaceful Nuclear Accord with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior State Department
official urged here Wednesday Congress to give the green light to
the projected peaceful nuclear cooperation with China in line with
an agreement signed over a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Robert J. Einhorn, assistant secretary for nonproliferation,
told the House International Relations Committee that China's
efforts to establish an effective export control system for
nuclear-related materials, and participate in international
nuclear export control are "marked, positive" in policies and
practices.
</P>
<P>
"The recent steps the Chinese have taken...satisfy the demand
set by the Congress for implementing the 1985 agreement," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on peaceful nuclear cooperation has remained in
paper for about 12 years. The United States accused China of
exporting nuclear materials and technology to some countries, but
China denied the charges, stressing its commitment to
nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
Presidents Jiang Zemin of China and Bill Clinton of the U.S.
agreed in October in Washington that obstacles should be removed
to implement the long-delayed accord.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton certified on January 12 that it is in
America's interests to promote peaceful nuclear cooperation with
China. However, he has to get the approval from the legislators.
</P>
<P>
If it is ratified by Congress, American companies would be able
to sell billions of dollars worth of reactors and other
nuclear-related equipment to China. Such big companies like
Westinghouse Electric Corp. and ABB Combustion engineering Nuclear
Systems were poised to submit bids to build nuclear power plants
in China.
</P>
<P>
"A variety of foreign nuclear reactor vendors are eager to sell
their products," noted Einhorn, who believed the accord with China
would help narrow the imbalance of trade between the two countries
and create more jobs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants to export more products to China to
balance the bilateral trade. However it is not yet ready to lift a
ban on high-tech export to the Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Congress is set to pick up the issue for debate in the months
to come.
