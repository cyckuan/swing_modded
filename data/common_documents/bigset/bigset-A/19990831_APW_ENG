<HEADLINE> Otis, Ore. On Sale for $3 million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTIS, Ore. (AP) -- A northwest Oregon town that doesn't have a  
stoplight, a bank or even a drugstore is for sale. The price: $3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Some folks wonder whether this blip on the map where beach-bound  
travelers can fill their tanks is really worth that much. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not exactly an exciting place for things to happen,''  
said 57-year-old Ben Noland, who pumps gas at the BP station. ``The 
only excitement on this corner is when the ambulance goes by and 
everyone gets on the horn to see what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not excitement, but vanity that owner Vivian Lematta is  
selling as she tries to unload the 193-acre town that her 
grandfather bought from descendants of the Siletz Indians for $800 
back in 1910. 
</P>
<P>
	``How would you like to buy a town that you could rename after  
yourself?'' said real estate agent Tamaris Courter. 
</P>
<P>
	She has shown the town to two parties so far, one who was  
looking to put in time-share condos and another who wanted to 
develop a golf course community. Neither showed much interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The handful of businesses and buildings included in the  
$2,995,000 asking price make up most of the town. They include the 
gas station and its mini grocery, the Pronto Pup hot dog stand, two 
houses, an empty 25-stall horse barn. 
</P>
<P>
	How many people live in Otis is unclear, since it is  
unincorporated and keeps no exact records. 
</P>
<P>
	Lematta doesn't get too sentimental when she talks about selling  
the town. After all, she lives in Seattle now and hasn't lived in 
Otis since the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's anything special because I grew up here,''  
she said in a matter-of-fact tone. ``In fact, sometimes I think 
it'd be nice to get rid of it.''

<HEADLINE> White Sox Put Scott Eyre on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP)-- The Chicago White Sox placed reliever Scott Eyre  
on the 15-day disabled list Tuesday, and recalled infielder Liu 
Rodriguez from Double-A Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	Eyre left in sixth inning of the second game of Chicago's  
doubleheader loss Monday against the Seattle Mariners, with pain in 
his left shoulder. White Sox trainer Herm Schneider said Eyre has 
an impingement of his rotator cuff, and the extent of the injury 
won't be known until the inflammation subsides. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, 22, was with the White Sox from June 6 to August 11,  
hitting .188 in 24 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Eyre, 27, was recalled June 20 and went 1-1 with a 7.56 ERA in  
21 games for Chicago.

<HEADLINE> House Subpoenas Waco Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee has subpoenaed records for  
its investigation of the FBI's admission that incendiary tear gas 
canisters were used in the government's fiery 1993 standoff with 
the Branch Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Government Reform Committee on Monday subpoenaed the  
Texas Rangers for evidence sifted from the charred remains of the 
Davidians' compound. Also subpoenaed was an assistant U.S. attorney 
in Waco who prosecuted criminal cases against surviving Davidian 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno and the FBI have said there is no  
evidence that the incendiary devices lobbed at a concrete bunker 40 
yards from the Davidians' compound ignited the fire that later 
raced through the wooden structure. But Reno has pledged a full 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., whose panel will hold  
hearings in the fall, sent two investigators to Austin last week to 
review evidence. Monday's subpoenas will be followed by others, 
including to agencies involved in the siege, said committee 
spokesman Mark Corallo. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them is the Defense Department, whose secretive Delta  
Force had members at the scene -- a point of controversy for some 
who contend the military played more than an observer's role. Only 
under tightly proscribed rules is the military allowed to 
participate in domestic law enforcement operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials have said three Army special forces officers  
were present outside Waco, Texas, on April 19, 1993, but were not 
involved in the FBI operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena to the Texas Rangers seeks all documents relating  
to the use of the pyrotechnic tear gas devices as well as the 
Rangers' final report on the incident, Corallo said. The 
information requested must be provided by Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, The Dallas Morning News said Assistant U.S. Attorney  
Bill Johnston, the prosecutor subpoenaed by Burton's committee, 
wrote Reno on Monday that last week he received a 5-year-old 
document that discusses the use of ``military gas'' by the FBI on 
the last day of the siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston said he was concerned because the three-page document,  
a set of notes on interviews with the FBI hostage rescue team, 
included handwritten notations suggesting it be kept from anyone 
outside the Justice Department's legal staff, the newspaper said in 
today's editions.

<HEADLINE> One-Sided Dispute for Notre Dame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Nobody ever told Bob Davie about a  
gentleman's agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Mike Wadsworth said he never agreed with  
anybody that Notre Dame would play Michigan in its season opener 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	So why are the Wolverines so upset the Irish played Kansas at  
home last Saturday instead of opening the season on the road in 
Michigan Stadium? 
</P>
<P>
	And why haven't they bothered to tell the Irish in person?  
</P>
<P>
	``Usually when there's a gentleman's agreement, gentlemen tell  
one another about it,'' Wadsworth said Tuesday. ``And I've never 
heard from anyone about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Wolverines coach Lloyd Carr hasn't been shy in griping  
about the 16th-ranked Irish scheduling Kansas for their season 
opener before playing No. 7 Michigan. He's even claimed he thought 
the schools had a verbal agreement to open their season against 
each other rather than in any of the preseason classics. 
</P>
<P>
	But he apparently forgot to tell Davie.  
</P>
<P>
	Davie, who said he hadn't heard anything of this supposed  
gentleman's agreement until after the Irish scheduled the Eddie 
Robinson Classic, said he's puzzled why nobody from Michigan has 
called to complain, rather than popping off through the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't heard from Lloyd. I asked Mike Wadsworth if anyone  
in our athletic department had heard anything from Michigan on the 
so-called verbal agreement, and no one had,'' Davie said. ``It 
seems a little strange to me, but I don't want to comment on 
something that I haven't heard directly from someone at Michigan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season's matchup between Notre Dame and Michigan has been  
particularly snippy since the Irish added a 12th game so their 11 
new starters could have their baptism at home rather than in front 
of 105,000 fans at Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr is even holding back on publicly naming his starting  
quarterback for Saturday's game, something he hinted is a swipe at 
Notre Dame for playing Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Davie doesn't seem to care.  
</P>
<P>
	He said there isn't much difference between fifth-year senior  
Tom Brady and sophomore Drew Henson, even though Henson is 
considered more mobile and Brady a better drop-back passer. The 
Irish saw both in their 36-20 win over Michigan in last year's 
season opener, and Davie said there's no reason to alter his 
preparations because of who's taking the snaps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he doesn't know. Maybe it's that close,'' Davie said of  
Carr's decision. ``I wouldn't think that it would be a huge 
advantage to not disclose which one it was if the two are that 
close and that similar in their styles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, maybe Carr should be happy the Irish have their season  
opener out of the way with the 48-13 win over Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	In Davie's first two seasons, the Irish won their season openers  
at home, only to get spanked the following week on the road. In 
1997, they squeaked by Georgia Tech, only to lose at Purdue the 
following week. After last year's win over Michigan, Notre Dame was 
humiliated 45-23 at Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	And Davie still doesn't know why that happened.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could tell you exactly what caused that,'' he said.  
``Part of it had to do with Purdue and part of it had to do with 
Michigan State playing pretty well. All I can tell you is that our 
emphasis and our focus from the time the Kansas game was over in 
the locker room was to prepare for Michigan.''

<HEADLINE> SAT Math Scores Drop Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Following recent gains, high school seniors  
turned in slightly lower SAT math scores this year. They scored the 
same on the verbal portion of the test for the fourth straight 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, scores on the college entrance exams remain below peak  
levels of 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	National average math scores for the 1.2 million graduates in  
the class of 1999 fell one point to 511, out of a possible 800, 
according to results released today by the College Board. Average 
scores on reading and vocabulary, the verbal portion of the test, 
didn't budge from 505. 
</P>
<P>
	Of states where at least 60 percent of high school graduates  
took the test, the highest average verbal scores were in New 
Hampshire (520), Vermont (514) and Massachusetts (511). The highest 
math scores were in New Hampshire (518), Massachusetts (511) and 
Maryland (511). In New Hampshire, 72 percent of high school 
graduates took the SAT; in Massachusetts, 78 percent; in Maryland, 
65 percent; and in Vermont, 70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The College Board, which administers the test, said the  
high-schoolers who graduated this year gained nine points in math 
and one in verbal over 1989 test-takers. But the 1999 class still 
lags six points in math and 35 points in reading and vocabulary 
behind the class of 1969, long before the Internet and scholastic 
tools like graphing calculators were readily available to students. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not good news,'' College Board President Gaston  
Caperton said. The disparity proves the board must ``do more to 
support public school systems so those scores will get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among its projects will be an ``online learning center''  
available next month that will provide test-taking tips, discussion 
groups and other resources to students. The center is not intended 
to provide a ``quick fix'' to low test scores. Rather, it should 
help students develop verbal and mathematical reasoning skills that 
students can use in ``real-life situations,'' said Gretchen Rigol, 
the board's vice president of special projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to try to teach tricks to help students  
figure out some quick way to get a high score on the test,'' Rigol 
said. ``What we're teaching are things that will be able to help 
students in school, in college and thereafter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After rising for seven straight years, the average math score  
fell to 511 from 512 last year. Scores had fallen below 500 in the 
late 1970s and early 1980s, and then fluctuated before starting to 
climb in 1991. The math score peaked at 517 in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The verbal score also was 505 last year and has risen above that  
only four times in the last two decades. Scores were 540 and higher 
in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the fourth year of scoring based on a revised scale  
intended to raise the average score back to 500 and make the 
results more statistically sound. Comparison scores also were 
converted to the revised scale, although those for 1967 to 1971 
were based on estimates. In 1995, the math average was 506; the 
verbal, 504. 
</P>
<P>
	The exam, the most widely used part of what was known as the  
board's Scholastic Assessment Tests, was taken by 1.2 million high 
school graduates. They account for 43 percent of high school 
graduates this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said overall performance is improving because more  
students are preparing for college with tougher courses. The same 
trend was noted in results released this month for the ACT, another 
entrance examination. 
</P>
<P>
	More students are also taking college-level, advanced placement  
courses while in high school, the College Board said. Just over 
half (56 percent) of the nation's high schools offer such classes. 
</P>
<P>
	More minority students are taking the advances classes (30  
percent in 1999), compared with 22 percent in 1989.	   Also over the 10 years, the percentage of parents with at least 
a bachelors degree rose from 51 percent to 54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Some argue as well that the scores cannot be compared over years  
because a larger, more diverse group of students is taking the 
test. College Board officials acknowledge that scores decline in a 
state as more people take the test. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing officials also said students were getting higher grades  
at school than justified by their SAT scores. This year's grade 
average for all SAT takers is 3.24 out of a possible 4, compared 
with 3.08 in 1989. The percentage of students with all A's averages 
rose from 28 to 39.

<HEADLINE> Tensions Rise After E. Timor Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- With armed anti-independence militiamen  
roaming streets and villages in East Timor, gunshots rang out 
through the night in one town and a teen-ager was killed in the 
provincial capital, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence following Monday's relatively peaceful referendum  
on independence. The outbreak raised fears that the territory could 
slide back into lawlessness as pro-Indonesia militas -- sensing 
defeat -- try frantically to take control of whatever they can. 
</P>
<P>
	There was gunfire throughout Tuesday night into early Wednesday  
in the militia-controlled town of Hera, 10 miles outside the 
capital, Dili, said Hiro Ueki, a spokesman for the U.N. elections 
team. Police were checking the reports of four people killed there. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said an unidentified teen-ager was slain in central Dili.  
A day earlier, militiamen carrying homemade guns, machetes and some 
military weapons set up roadblocks across East Timor's mountainous 
countryside and harassed U.N. staff -- in one case shooting at a 
helicopter carrying ballot boxes. Militias, believed to be backed 
by Indonesia's military, accused the United Nations of encouraging 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's landmark ballot asked the mostly Roman Catholic East  
Timorese whether they wanted to become independent or remain part 
of mostly Muslim Indonesia as an autonomous region. About 98.6 
percent of registered voters turned out, U.N. officials said. The 
high turnout is believed to favor a vote for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Vote counting was set to begin Wednesday, although results would  
not likely be available before Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the next step will be a vote in a 700-member special  
assembly to approve the results. While some lawmakers oppose 
independence for East Timor, the ballot results will likely be 
respected. President B.J. Habibie has promised to abide by the 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said the United Nations would have  
to temporarily take over East Timor. The United Nations intends to 
supervise the change of power in the territory, whether to autonomy 
or independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Troops from Indonesia invaded a few months after East Timor was  
given independence from Portugal in 1975. Indonesia annexed East 
Timor in 1976, triggering years of guerrilla warfare and human 
rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said he was encouraged by the high voter  
turnout and the relative lack of violence in East Timor's vote, 
said spokesman Jake Siewert. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Assistance Mission in East Timor called for an  
immediate end to all violence in the half-island territory 
northwest of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now is the time for everyone to lay done their weapons,'' said  
UNAMET spokesman David Wimhurst. 
</P>
<P>
	But tensions were high Tuesday, when most pro-independence  
activists lay low to avoid hundreds of militiamen roaming Dili 
neighborhoods and nearby villages. ``I think the situation is 
uncertain,'' said activist Jose Renaldo. ``Many people are 
worried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Militiamen blocked independence supporters from leaving East  
Timor by plane, ship or road on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pro-independence students and members of the political elite  
cannot leave East Timor from today'' on, said Eurico Guterres, the 
chief of Dili's Aitarak militia. He said the blockade was designed 
to prevent chaos like that in 1975, when Portugal withdrew from 
East Timor and a bloody civil war broke out. 
</P>
<P>
	Militia leaders also said they would boycott peace and  
reconciliation talks with separatist rivals and refused to meet 
with U.N. mediators. 
</P>
<P>
	``UNAMET is really encouraging and backing the people of East  
Timor to break East Timor away from Indonesia,'' said Basilio Dias 
Araujo of the United Front for East Timor Autonomy. He said his 
group had recorded ``thousands of irregularities and misbehaviors'' 
by UNAMET staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. flatly rejected the allegations, but said any formal  
complaints would be investigated by a neutral electoral body. 
</P>
<P>
	A paramilitary group besieged the tiny town of Gleno, in the  
coffee-growing Ermera district. Australian U.N. police advisers at 
the scene said Wednesday that militiamen had fired shots at a U.N. 
helicopter as it lifted off to take ballot boxes to Dili, 28 miles 
to the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
militiamen had terrorized the town for almost 24 hours, firing 
shots from homemade guns and burning houses. 
</P>
<P>
	They also blocked a 17-vehicle convoy of about 150 U.N. staff  
from leaving for the safety of Dili. The group, which included 100 
foreigners, sheltered in a U.N. compound for hours before 
militiamen let them go after tense negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	UNAMET could not confirm Australian media reports that three of  
its workers had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The militias are especially powerful near coffee plantations,  
owned by business interests held by senior Indonesian military 
officers. Coffee is East Timor's largest export, bringing in $20 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, all ballot papers were brought to a central counting  
site in Dili. Indonesian police and unarmed U.N. police advisers 
stood guard as hundreds of blue plastic ballot boxes were stacked 
inside Dili's museum after being flown in by white U.N. 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	Poll organizers say the ballots will be mixed and shuffled  
before being counted to ensure voter secrecy and lessen the risk of 
reprisals against neighborhoods that voted strongly one way or the 
other.

<HEADLINE> Two Injured Cardinals Linemen Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Lester Holmes remembers nearly everything  
about the freeway rollover that injured him and two other Arizona 
Cardinals linemen. 
</P>
<P>
	But he had to look at pictures to realize how close all three  
came to death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't paying attention to the car, just my teammates,''  
Holmes said Tuesday after his first practice session since the Aug. 
16 crash on Interstate 17 south of Flagstaff. ``It was sitting 
there, and I just walked away from it. But the car pretty much told 
the story, know what I mean? We were just lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes, the starting right guard, wore a cap that obscured a  
barely visible scar that runs the width of his forehead, the only 
trace of a gash that plastic surgeon Stephen Lex of Flagstaff 
repaired after the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole Flagstaff medical crew, they did a damn good job,''  
Holmes said. ``They really took care of me, and I just take my hat 
off to those guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lex, vascular surgeon Jerry Mohr and orthopedist Philip Mack all  
worked on Holmes, but spent more time -- a total of 16 hours in 
surgery -- to save the right arm of offensive tackle Ernest Dye. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes called Dye on Sunday and found him in good spirits.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hadn't talked to him before,'' Holmes said. ``He's been  
somewhat drugged up and out of it for the most part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dye, who faces years of rehabilitation, will be transferred from  
Flagstaff Medical Center to a hospital in Phoenix on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes went through a structured routine that included running  
and stretching, but won't be able to hit until he receives medical 
clearance and is fitted for a helmet that won't aggravate his 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive tackle Carl Simpson, the third person in Dye's luxury  
auto, bruised his hip in the accident. Tuesday marked his return to 
the practice field, along with left guard Chris Dishman, who has 
been sidelined after elbow surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	They did some informal aerobics, a welcome sign to coach Vince  
Tobin. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit of clearing at the end of a dark spot,''  
Tobin said. ``They still haven't been cleared to compete yet, but 
it's a first step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin is still awaiting the return of his offensive and  
defensive stars -- quarterback Jake Plummer and defensive tackle 
Eric Swann. Offensive coordinator Marc Trestman confirmed that 
Plummer, who has a sprained right thumb, will miss his second 
straight exhibition game when the Oakland Raiders and Cardinals 
wind up the preseason Friday night in Sun Devil Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want Jake back as quickly as we can, but we don't want him  
to come back so quick that he's not healed and he aggravates it,'' 
Trestman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Swann had knee surgery last fall and again on Dec. 7. But the  
Cardinals are in the dark about when he will return, because he is 
under independent medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're supposed to meet with him this week,'' Tobin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Swann sat beside defensive end Andre Wadsworth in the locker  
room and talked animatedly, but avoided eye contact with reporters. 
Swann refuses interview requests because of stories that questioned 
his dedication.

<HEADLINE> Some Occidental Services To Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) -- Occidental Oil and Gas Corp. said it  
will close its Bakersfield office and move its international 
exploration, engineering and technical services groups to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will layoff 12 of 124 employees immediately and  
another 42 when the move is completed at the end of January 2000. 
Sixty workers will be offered the opportunity to transfer to 
Houston and another 10 will be transferred to other offices. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement on Tuesday is the latest in a series of  
cutbacks by the company's parent, Los Angeles-based Occidental 
Petroleum Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, Occidental announced a two-year, $200 million  
cost-cutting program that included the elimination of more than 
1,000 jobs. In January, Occidental announced it would cut capital 
spending from $1 billion in 1998 to $350 million during 1999 to 
offset record low oil prices that plagued the industry throughout 
1998 and the first months of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Umpires' Injunction Attempt Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- After seven hours of conferences Tuesday,  
the attempt by umpires to get a federal court injunction that would 
save 22 of their jobs was put off until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two dozen lawyers were in a courtroom, ready for the  
hearing to start in early afternoon, but Judge J. Curtis Joyner 
summoned the top lawyers for each side to his chambers, three 
floors below. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with the judge for 1 hour, 15 minutes, the  
umpires' lawyers caucused with their clients for about a half-hour, 
then went back for a meeting that lasted more than 2 1/2 hours. Just 
before 7 p.m. EDT, 5 1/2 hours after the scheduled start of the 
hearing, the sides met for another 90 minutes in chambers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today was devoted to the judge asking both sides to consider  
some issues,'' management lawyer Rob Manfred said. ``We'll consider 
them overnight and come back in the morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several umpires were at the court house, some of them missing  
games they had been assigned to Tuesday night. Among them were 
union president Jerry Crawford and several of the umps scheduled to 
be let go after Wednesday: Richie Garcia, Joe West, Eric Gregg and 
Bob Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires want Joyner to issue a court order preventing baseball  
from letting the 22 go. Baseball claims it accepted their 
resignations, but umpires now say they never really intended to 
quit, that the letters they sent to the American and National 
leagues were merely symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared Joyner wanted to first try to help the sides settle  
their differences rather than start the injunction hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief filed with the court Tuesday, owners said all the  
umpires' legal arguments were meritless. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the union attempts to cast its request for injunctive  
relief as a single reluctant plea for judicial intervention by only 
the most immediate of circumstances, this in fact is the third 
application the union has made,'' the brief submitted by the 
leagues said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union sued baseball in Philadelphia last month, then  
withdrew the case after Judge Edmund V. Ludwig refused to issue a 
temporary restraining order. Umpires then filed unfair labor 
practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board and asked 
it to obtain an injunction, but the agency has not yet made a 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to have something tomorrow,'' said Daniel Silverman,  
the NLRB's New York agency regional director. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, umpires paced the corridors of the court house,  
wondering if they'll have jobs after Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy began July 14 when umpires announced mass  
resignations, effective Sept. 2, saying they wanted to spark an 
early start to negotiations for a labor contract to replace the one 
that expires Dec. 31. But the plan collapsed when 27 umps either 
failed to resign or quickly rescinded their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball then hired 25 umps from the minor leagues and accepted  
22 resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires told the court in their papers that the union would  
collapse if they don't get an injunction. Many AL umps oppose union 
head Richie Phillips, and the 22 departing umps contain many of the 
strongest supporters of the union leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is using every last-ditch effort to get things settled and  
get the guys back,'' AL ump Joe Brinkman, a leader of the 
anti-Phillips faction, said at Yankee Stadium, ``This is a 
last-ditch effort for him too. I don't think baseball will deal 
with him after the shenanigans he pulled and the position he put 
everybody in with this strategy.''

<HEADLINE> Charles Schwab Online Down for Hour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charles Schwab customers were unable to buy or  
sell stock online for part of the day Monday because of computer 
troubles at the nation's largest discount brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. said its systems were down between 11 a.m.  
and noon Eastern time, though some customers reported having 
problems for longer periods of time in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracey Gordon, a company spokeswoman, said the cause of the  
problem was unknown. ``We're looking into it right now,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco-based company handles about 147,700 online  
trades a day for its 6.2 million active investor accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Many customers swamped Internet chat rooms and message boards  
with notes of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got pending orders that I can't get a status on. I have  
no idea what I have bought and sold or how much cash I have on 
hand,'' wrote ``jluchsin'' on a Yahoo! message board. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem started over 4 hours ago,'' the message continued,  
``I just filled out an application for Datek. Trades up to 5,000 
shares for $9.95. (Schwab does 1,000 for $29.95) Also, they 
GUARANTEE their market orders placed in 60 seconds or they're free! 
If they work out, I'll move all of my accounts out of Schwab.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Temporary outages are not uncommon among the competing online  
brokerages, and are usually fixed within a few hours. Most 
companies try to placate customers who are inconvenienced. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Schwab charged customers the $29.95 online commission if  
they were forced to place their orders via telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Charles Schwab fell $3, or 7 percent, to $38.25 on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Laser Expert Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) -- The director of a program intended to  
build the world's most powerful lasers has resigned amid questions 
about his education. 
</P>
<P>
	E. Michael Campbell, associate director for lasers at Lawrence  
Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., left his job 
Friday after a series of anonymous faxes to his bosses revealed he 
does not have a Ph.D. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said he was leaving for personal reasons.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a young family, and I need to spend some time with  
them,'' he told the Contra Costa Times. ``My wife has said the lab 
has sucked the life out of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the world's leading authorities on ultra-high-energy  
lasers, Campbell remains an employee on leave from the lab, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell was director of a $1.2 billion program to build the  
National Ignition Facility, intended to conduct research in weapons 
and fusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Lab spokesman Jeff Richardson said Campbell had allowed lab  
officials to believe he had a doctorate from Princeton University. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike had completed his Ph.D. course work when he joined  
Livermore in 1977, but he never finished his dissertation,'' 
Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lab officials were investigating whether he lied about holding a  
doctorate during the hiring process. They said they are unlikely to 
release the results of their investigation because it is a 
personnel issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said the need for a doctorate became increasingly  
insignificant as he made a rapid rise through the lab's laser 
fusion programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell's supporters say it's a common practice to hire  
scientists who have not yet completed their dissertations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a waste of time and talent to continue to pursue a  
dissertation in some cases,'' said David Crandall, a Department of 
Energy official overseeing the laser project. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the lab requires each senior manager to hold a Ph.D. or  
its equivalent in experience. The lab's former director, John 
Nuckolls, also did not have a Ph.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to laboratory representatives for additional comment today  
were not returned. Campbell's home telephone number is unlisted.

<HEADLINE> Liberty Group, Lee Enterprises Swap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTHBROOK, Ill. (AP) -- Liberty Group Publishing and Lee  
Enterprises announced a swap Tuesday involving five newspapers in 
Iowa, Illinois and Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Group added to its stable of more than 300 community  
newspapers by trading the 8,000-circulation Daily Sun in Beatrice, 
Neb., and an undisclosed amount of cash for papers that include two 
dailies: the 18,000-circulation Ottumwa Courier in Ottumwa, Iowa, 
and the 6,000-circulation Kewanee Star Courier in Kewanee, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty also gets the weekly Aledo Times Record in Aledo, Ill.,  
and the Henry County Advertiser, a shopper in Geneseo, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth L. Serota, president and chief executive officer of  
Liberty, said the acquisitions of Kewanee, Aledo and Geneseo ``will 
allow us to provide greater value to advertisers in our existing 
newspaper cluster in western Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition, the Ottumwa Courier becomes our largest daily  
newspaper and gives us a strategic entry into southeast Iowa,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard D. Gottlieb, president and chief executive of Lee, said  
the trade strengthens the company's position in Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will take advantage of the $30 million printing facility  
under construction at the Lincoln Journal Star, as well as provide 
other operating efficiencies and regional marketing 
opportunities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, headquartered in Davenport, Iowa, owns 22 daily newspapers  
and more than 75 other publications as well as 16 television 
stations and a commercial printing division. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Group Publishing, headquartered in Northbrook, owns  
newspapers in 16 states and is controlled by Leonard Green &AMP; 
Partners, a Los Angeles-based private merchant banking firm.

<HEADLINE> Loose Talk Can Hurt, McCain Admits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Riding aboard his campaign bus, the  
``Straight Talk Express,'' John McCain recalls the pitfalls of his 
own loose talk. 
</P>
<P>
	Before a giggling pack of supporters and reporters, the  
Republican presidential candidate talks about the time he referred 
to the ``Leisure World'' senior citizens home as ``Seizure World.'' 
The quip drew protesters to his congressional campaign, forcing 
McCain to ``crawl on my hands and knees, begging forgiveness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled with a wince a joke he once told about Alzheimer's  
disease: ``I said, 'The nice thing about Alzheimer's is you get to 
hide your own Easter eggs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And McCain said he deeply regretted his ``insensitive and stupid  
and cruel'' joke he told about Chelsea Clinton several months ago. 
But his point was made: ``You've got to have humor in a campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than that, McCain is trying to prove at every stop in a  
four-day bus trip that he is blunt and fearless, willing to take 
chances while his GOP rivals -- particularly front-runner George W. 
Bush -- play it safe. 
</P>
<P>
	He won't temper his ways, McCain says -- even if straight talk  
leads straight to trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get in trouble all the time. I will continue to get in  
trouble,'' McCain said Tuesday, wearing his bad-boy image as a 
badge of honor. ``I say what's on my mind to the frustration of my 
campaign people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As if to make the point, McCain angered anti-abortion allies  
last week by appearing to suggest that he would not support 
repealing Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain was still struggling Tuesday to clarify the off-the-cuff  
remarks. In a Plymouth, N.H., town hall that drew more than 100 
residents, abortion foe Arthur Morrill accused McCain of straddling 
``both sides of the fence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People want a choice. They want a clear choice. They want more  
than a 10 cents difference from Clinton,'' Morrill said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain tersely replied: ``I'm sorry you misinterpreted my  
remarks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His soft-peddling on abortion was an exception to a day that  
otherwise highlighted McCain's pull-no-punches style. In five 
separate town hall meetings, he fielded dozens of questions ranging 
from troubles in Taiwan to one women's crusade to make people work 
on Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
	In Littleton, N.H., he chastised a man who challenged his  
open-trade policies, telling Jerome Danin that he is selling 
himself and his children short with protectionism. ``I did not know 
that your ambitions ... for your children were to work in a textile 
mill,'' McCain said. ``I would rather have you work in a high-tech 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told voters in rural Lancaster that sacrifices come with  
making ``lifestyle choices'' to live in a rural community, 
including reduced access to health care. 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized his party over taxes and government waste. He  
bragged about his fight with the tobacco industry and his efforts 
to reform campaign finance laws -- both unsuccessful ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing in a Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Laconia, N.H.,  
McCain criticized Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the U.S. 
policy toward Moscow. In a biting allusion to the Russian leader's 
reputation for drinking, McCain said: ``Mr. Yeltsin should try to 
take a trip to Betty Ford's place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Shirley Splaine said her family's Ashland, N.H., textile  
mill was ``barely able to keep its doors open'' because of the 
North American Free Trade agreement, McCain didn't budge from his 
free-trade views. 
</P>
<P>
	He would do what he could to retrain workers and help keep the  
company afloat, McCain said, ``but I cannot tell you I would 
protect your company from trade competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Too blunt? ``Possibly,'' the soft-spoken Splaine said afterward.  
``Our town has depended on that mill for years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with potential for gaffes or hard feelings, McCain's  
advisers believe the straight-talking town-hall strategy will 
establish a favorable contrast to Bush, who has yet to expose 
himself to question-and-answer sessions with voters. The Texas 
governor and Elizabeth Dole, another establishment Republican in 
the race, are more cautious campaigners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me the rest of the field is not conducting their  
campaigns the way John McCain is,'' said campaign manager Rick 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain appears undeterred by the prospect for blunders or  
failure, a state of mind he links to his prisoner of war days in 
Vietnam. He says he learned that humor is important, even in the 
bleakest times, and that success is found by sticking to a 
principle. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do what you think is right,'' says McCain, who told his  
war stories in ``Faith of My Fathers,'' an upcoming book about his 
family's military history. ``If it doesn't work out, it doesn't 
work out.''

<HEADLINE> Paper: Chiefs, Tait Agree To Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, (AP) -- Offensive tackle John Tait, the 14th player  
taken in this year's NFL draft, told a newspaper on Monday that he 
has agreed to the terms of a five-year contract with the Kansas 
City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was prepared to do what it took to get a good deal,'' Tait  
told The Kansas City Star. ``I didn't break the bank, but I got a 
good deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, Tait's agent, Ethan Locke, had said the two  
sides were close to a deal but did not expect an agreement before 
Tuesday at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs made the 6-foot-6, 306-pound Brigham Young junior the  
first offensive lineman taken in the 1999 draft. But negotiations 
stalled at the outset and he did not make an offer to the Chiefs 
until the eve of the opening of training camp July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, after missing the entire camp in River Falls, Wis.,  
Tait was quoted as saying he might even sit out the year and go 
back into the 2000 draft. But the Chiefs doubted that, since Tait 
is 24 years old after serving a two-year Mormon mission and is 
already entering his peak earning years as an athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	Tait was expected to join the Chiefs in meetings Tuesday morning  
and practice with the team Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday is the first mandatory cutdown day for NFL teams.  
</P>
<P>
	The club was hopeful Tait could provide immediate help this year  
at left tackle and develop into the next John Alt, who was named to 
the Pro Bowl twice while manning left tackle from 1984-96. 
</P>
<P>
	Tait disputed reports that the Chiefs had had second thoughts  
about drafting him after watching him in offseason minicamps. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe I can come in and compete for a job,'' Tait said.  
``I know I've got a lot of work to do. I know what people in Kansas 
City have said about me, and we'll find out who's right and who's 
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tait was on several All-America lists in his junior year at  
Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed the 1994 and 1995 seasons while he was on an LDS  
church mission to Tennessee.

<HEADLINE> IMF Loans to Russia Said OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Contrary to suspicions of the House Banking  
Committee chairman, the International Monetary Fund says it has 
seen no evidence that its loans to Russia have been illegally 
diverted through U.S. banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Michel Camdessus, the head of the IMF, said adequate controls  
are in place and he sees no reason to block new aid to Russia. The 
international lending agency's board is expected to consider 
approving a $640 million loan installment in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said in an interview published today in the French  
newspaper Liberation that he has ordered additional inquiries into 
relations between Russia's central bank and companies it controls 
that are located outside Russia, such as in the Channel Islands off 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``This aid goes from one IMF account to another. There is  
therefore no reason to block it,'' he said. ``Morever, I have 
ordered additional inquiries into the relations between the 
(Russian) central bank and its offshore subsidiaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a senior IMF official also said the agency already  
has put tight controls in place to prevent siphoning off of its 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments by Tom Dawson, the IMF's director of external  
affairs, followed a statement by the chairman of the House Banking 
Committee that IMF loans to Russia should be halted until controls 
are put in place to prevent diversions of the sort that reportedly 
have occurred through Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to have absolutely no indication of any IMF money  
having been diverted'' through Bank of New York or other U.S. 
banks, Dawson told reporters in a conference call. Nonetheless, he 
added, ``We continue to take the allegations seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Banking Committee chairman, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, spoke  
Friday amid concern that some of the $10 billion or so allegedly 
funneled through the bank by Russian gangsters in a 
money-laundering scheme may have involved IMF loans to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities are investigating whether there was a  
diversion of IMF loans or of U.S. credits extended to the Russian 
government for buying grain, corn and other farm products. 
</P>
<P>
	An IMF team has been in Russia for several days reviewing a $4.5  
billion loan and is scheduled to return at the end of the week, 
Dawson noted. He said the IMF's board of directors likely will 
review the money-laundering allegations at some point when it 
considers approving the second loan installment, for $640 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we are being open and transparent in terms of  
what's been going on,'' Dawson said. ``We just don't believe there 
are any grounds for this particular accusation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Russian government's request, auditing firm  
PricewaterhouseCoopers has been conducting a study for the IMF of 
possible manipulations of loan money by Russia's central bank, 
Dawson noted. He said the IMF had previously instituted tight 
controls, keeping the loan money at the international fund rather 
than transferring it to the central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was prompted by an earlier audit by the accounting  
firm that found the central bank in 1996 funneled $1.2 billion in 
IMF money to a company it controlled in the Channel Islands off 
Britain. The money transfer made Russia's financial picture look 
more favorable than it was when President Boris Yeltsin was running 
for re-election, thereby misleading the IMF, agency officials have 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, another PricewaterhouseCoopers audit, completed earlier  
this month, concluded there was no evidence the central bank 
misused $4.8 billion it received from the IMF in July 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was used partly in an unsuccessful attempt to prop up  
Russia's currency, the ruble.

<HEADLINE> Bush Camp Has Raised About $50M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Fund raising for Texas Gov. George W. Bush's  
presidential race is poised to top $50 million and continue its 
record-breaking pace, according to a published review of 
contributions and interviews with his campaign associates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News reports in today's editions that Bush is  
on target to collect more than $60 million, with another month to 
go in the current reporting period. That's more than three times 
the amount raised by the top presidential candidates at the same 
time four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing. Every time Bush goes out, it means he comes back  
with another million dollars or more,'' Herbert Alexander, 
professor emeritus of political science from the University of 
Southern California, told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, Republican Bob Dole raised $19 million through  
Sept. 30, 1995 en route to winning the GOP nomination, according to 
the Federal Election Commission. President Clinton had raised $19.5 
million through that period for his re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent weeks of campaigning and a series of out-of-state  
fund-raisers have added to Bush's war chest, which had already 
dwarfed the GOP field with $37 million through June 30. Now, the 
campaign will soon exceed $50 million from more than 108,000 
contributors, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fund raising is going very well,'' said Mindy Tucker, a  
spokeswoman for the Bush campaign. ``We'll file with the FEC again 
at the end of September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush in recent weeks has had a string of high-dollar  
fund-raisers, collecting $1.1 million last week in Georgia and 
North and South Carolina. The events, since July, have netted $1.5 
million in New Jersey, $500,000 in Roanoke, Va., and $300,000 in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to Bush's coffers were fund-raisers in Colorado, Maine,  
Minnesota, Oklahoma, Utah and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign has also raised more than $1.25 million in direct  
mail solicitations since July 1, Bush associates said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- High school seniors again scored higher this  
year on math SATs than on the college entrance exam's verbal 
segment, despite a slight dip in the average math results. Scores 
released Tuesday showed reading and vocabulary, the verbal portion, 
stayed the same for a fourth consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
	After climbing for seven straight years, the national average  
math score fell by one point to 511 out of a possible 800. Average 
verbal scores continued at 505. 
</P>
<P>
	The College Board, which administers the test, said the 1.2  
million SAT-takers from among high schoolers who graduated this 
year gained nine points in the math portion and one in the verbal 
over test-takers from a decade ago. But SAT scores remain below 
peak levels of 1969, long before the Internet and scholastic tools 
like graphic calculators were readily available to students. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not good news,'' College Board President Gaston  
Caperton said. The disparity proves the board must ``do more to 
support public school systems so those scores will get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among its projects will be an ``online learning center''  
available next month to provide test-taking tips, sample test 
questions, discussion groups and other resources to students. The 
center is intended to help students improve verbal and mathematical 
reasoning skills they could use in ``real-life situations,'' said 
Gretchen Rigol, the board's vice president of special projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to try to teach tricks to help students  
figure out some quick way to get a high score on the test,'' Rigol 
said. ``What we're teaching are things that will be able to help 
students in school, in college and thereafter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.2 million who took the SAT, the most widely used part of  
what formerly was known as the Scholastic Assessment Tests, account 
for 43 percent of high school graduates this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said overall performance is improving because more  
students are preparing for college with tougher courses. The same 
trend was noted in results released this month for the ACT, another 
entrance examination. 
</P>
<P>
	The College Board also reported Tuesday an increase of students  
taking college-level, advanced-placement courses in high school. 
Just over half, 56 percent, of the nation's high schools offer such 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
	The SAT was taken by more minority students this year -- 33  
percent compared to last year's 25 percent. More minority students 
also are taking advanced placement courses. This year, 30 percent 
took such classes, up from the 22 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Sponsors Sought for 2002 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympic officials have recruited a group  
of local business and community leaders to urge others to sponsor 
the scandal-plagued 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Utah Ambassadors have not necessarily donated  
money themselves, but have agreed to ``give support and help open 
doors,'' said Kem Gardner, the marketing advisory committee's 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake Organizing Committee president Mitt Romney said the  
group should help raise the $179 million needed from corporate 
sponsors to meet the $1.34 billion budget for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We anticipate we will add one to two sponsors a month'' over  
the next two years, he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since January, sales have been stymied by reports of corruption  
in the host-city selection process. Only one new sponsor and four 
suppliers have signed on to the Salt Lake City Games since the 
scandal broke last December. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that people ever flock to give money,'' Romney  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had some problems,'' admitted former French ski  
champion Jean-Claude Killy, deputy chairman of the IOC Coordination 
Commission for the 2002 Games. ``Everything has changed since 
Mitt's arrival. ... Everyone is positive again. Everyone is 
confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake's bid team provided more than $1 million in perks and  
payments to IOC members, prompting a Justice Department probe into 
possible bribery, fraud and money-laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt, who will serve as the group's honorary  
chairman, said he too has ``growing confidence and growing 
optimism'' in the SLOC's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney also reiterated that the SLOC intends to only spend money  
it can raise and will cut the budget if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the ability to accordion our operation somewhat,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambassadors were chosen from a list of business leaders who had  
already demonstrated they are willing to support the games. The 
20-person committee includes the president of Intermountain Health 
Care, which provided free medical services to three Africans 
connected to the IOC. The nearly $28,000 in health care included 
hepatitis treatment, plastic surgery, and knee joint replacement 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner, who is president of the Boyer Company, said one of the  
main reasons he joined the committee was ``in gratitude to Mitt for 
coming out and helping us run these games'' after former SLOC head 
Frank Joklik resigned in January. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Utah's richest industrialist, Jon M. Huntsman, is not a  
member of the group. Huntsman, owner of one of the world's largest 
chemical manufacturers, Huntsman Corp., had been an unyielding 
critic of the 2002 Games until July, when he offered his support, 
but not money. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said Huntsman is helping raise money outside the state,  
while the Utah Ambassadors will focus on Utah companies and those 
with ties to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntsman has said he believes Utah has already paid enough in  
dollars and a damaged reputation.

<HEADLINE> Soybean, Grain Futures Move Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures prices rose in early  
dealings today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans jumped more than 5 cents a bushel -- and as much as 8  
cents -- on Monday's crop report from the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, unexpectedly showing a 1 percentage point drop in the 
crop's good-to-excellent category. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn followed suit, though not to as great an extent, on news  
that there have been no improvements in that crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, wheat got a boost on news that Egypt placed an order  
to buy soft red winter wheat from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 3 1/2 cents to $2.80 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.18 1/2 a bushel; December oats rose 
1 1/2 cents to $1.16 a bushel; and November soybeans were up 6 1/2 cents 
to $4.77 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures prices fell in early trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle fell .43 cent to 66.47 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle fell .33 cent to 78.72 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs fell .37 cent to 45.40 cents a pound; and February pork 
bellies fell 1.25 cents to 58.20 cents a pound.

	THE HIGH COST OF DRIVING: It's no surprise that it costs more to  
live in places like Los Angeles than it does in Sioux Falls, S.D. 
But imagine having to spend $3,000 more just to drive your car 
under the palm trees. Runzheimer International, a management 
consultancy, found it costs $8,907 a year to drive a Ford Taurus 
15,000 per year within a 50-mile radius of Los Angeles, when you 
consider costs such as fuel, oil, tires, maintenance, insurance, 
depreciation and license and registration fees. Driving the same 
car the same distance around Sioux Falls costs $5,843 annually. 
Insurance is a big reason for the difference -- preimums in Los 
Angeles run about $2,800 a year, compared to less than $700 in 
Sioux Falls. Philadelphia, with annual costs of $8,273, was the 
second most expensive place to drive, while Eau Claire, Wis., was 
the second cheapest, at $5,862. 

</P>
<P>
	FINDING A GOOD FIT: A job may seem great at the start, but  
unless an employee is compatible with a corporate culture, chances 
are he or she won't be happy in the long run. Personnel Decisions 
International, a human resources consulting firm, says applicants 
should try to find out how comfortable they'd be in a company 
before they take a job. Personnel Decisions suggests applicants do 
a little detective work -- for example, when going on an interview, 
by listening for laughter in the hallways, or seeing how people 
interact with one another. The firm also suggests prospective 
employees call a customer service line and see how customers are 
treated. Another idea is to talk to vendors, contractors and former 
employees, who might be in a position to talk candidly about what 
it's like doing business with the firm. 

</P>
<P>
	SHOP TILL YOUR PREMIUM DROPS: Consumer Reports magazine advises  
car owners who want to cut their insurance premiums to shop around, 
and keep shopping until they find a better deal. Ellen Braitman, an 
editor at the magazine, called insurance companies, searched the 
Internet and checked with insurance information services such as 
InsurQuote, based in Provo, Utah, and a service provided by 
Consumer Reports publisher Consumers Union. Her research was 
time-consuming, but in the end she was able to find a premium $800 
below the $2,200 she was already paying.

<HEADLINE> Man Saves Girlfriend From Gator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- A woman was nearly dragged underwater by  
a 7-foot alligator before her boyfriend kicked the gator and 
managed to pull her out of a pond. 
</P>
<P>
	Deirdre Dozois, and her boyfriend, Stuart Chandler, were cooling  
themselves off in their favorite pond behind the Jolly Time Bar 
early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were sitting in about 2 feet of water being real quiet, and  
then I felt her body jerk,'' said Chandler, 41. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dozois, 45, tried to leap into the air with the gator's jaws  
locked on her right calf. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like a Rottweiler had grabbed me and wouldn't let  
go,'' she said. ``It started to twist me into the water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler began kicking it, and the gator released its grip. He  
pulled her out and tied a shirt around her thigh to slow the 
bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dozois, who received 75 stitches on her leg, said they  
should have been more careful. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had been sitting near the water talking before it got dark  
and saw the gator stick its head out of the water a couple of 
times,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Med School Applicants Decline Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The number of applicants to U.S. medical schools  
declined for the second straight year last year and will be down 
even further this fall, according to the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors of the report, published in Wednesday's Journal of  
the American Medical Association, did not explore reasons for the 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
	But one admissions dean said the robust economy is encouraging  
many potential doctors to try other fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's good overall, because those who are applying to  
medical school are being attracted for what I would call the right 
reasons,'' said David M. Trabilsy, assistant dean for admissions at 
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore. ``They have a 
genuine interest in serving others, helping those that have 
medically related needs or advancing medical science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trabilsy also said the increasing dominance of managed care and  
the prospect of heavy debt may discourage some potential medical 
school applicants. A typical medical student owes $100,000 by 
graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	Applicants for the 1998-99 class totaled 41,004, a 4.7 percent  
decrease from the 43,020 applicants for the class entering in 1997. 
That year's applicant pool was 8.4 percent smaller than in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Final figures for this fall's class weren't available, but as of  
early May, there were 2,000 fewer applicants than at the same time 
last year, said the report's authors, led by Barbara Barzansky of 
the AMA's Division of Undergraduate Education.

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Char Over 200,000 Acres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	APPLE VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- Thick smoke and wind-driven flames  
swept rapidly through dry brush and tall pines as wildfires in six 
Western states torched more than 200,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 18 blazes scorched wildland in Idaho, Montana, Nevada,  
Utah, Washington and California, where an undetermined number of 
homes were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	The West's largest blaze, the Willow fire, has more than doubled  
in size, consuming almost 50,000 acres by late Monday in the San 
Bernardino National Forest between the resort town of Lake 
Arrowhead and the high desert of Apple Valley, about 80 miles 
northeast of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Erratic winds whipped flames north and east overnight, forcing  
the evacuation of neighborhoods along stretches of valleys where 
rugged hills drop into flat desert stretches dotted with brush and 
gangly Joshua trees, said Nanci Wagner, spokeswoman for the 
California Department of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	Five people were arrested for allegedly looting abandoned homes,  
sheriff's spokeswoman Jennie Risley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty miles to the west, in Angeles National Forest, 785  
firefighters battled steep terrain and hot temperatures in a 
2,500-acre wildfire that forced more than 4,000 campers and cabin 
owners out of San Gabriel Canyon. Three cabins in the North Fork 
Tract were damaged and others were threatened, forest officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Riverside County 70 miles east of Los Angeles, a blaze burned  
about 3,000 acres and forced the evacuation of two campgrounds and 
a trailer park, while another fire in the same forest burned 
1,523-acres but wasn't threatening structures. 
</P>
<P>
	A 3,600-acre blaze in the Mojave Desert hills west of Palmdale  
was fully contained by Monday night, said Jim Crawford, spokesman 
with the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Three sheds were 
destroyed and one house was damaged by flames shortly after the 
fire erupted Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters also had the upper hand on a 45,000-acre blaze  
north of Reno and were dousing hot spots on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In northern California, firefighters struggled with clusters of  
fires that burned 4,547 acres in the Shasta-Trinity National 
Forests. Another fire cluster in Shasta and Trinity counties burned 
over 17,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	A 34,441-acre fire in Modoc National Forest was 50 percent  
contained and in Butte County, firefighters expected full 
containment of several fires that burned 33,924 acres. Six 
additional fires were burning across 8,353 acres in the Plumas 
National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	Thunderstorms were believed responsible for two wildfires on  
Utah rangeland west of Salt Lake City, including a 3,000-acre blaze 
up Peepstone Canyon.

<HEADLINE>  Sampras Exits Open With Back Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pete Sampras winced as he bent to ease into the  
chair, the strain on his back sending spasms through his body, the 
pain etched on his face. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time U.S. Open champion withdrew from the tournament  
Tuesday after hurting his back during practice Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The herniated disc delayed Sampras' bid for a 13th Grand Slam  
championship, a scenario that was falling neatly in place until he 
went to hit on the eve of the Open with Gustavo Kuerten. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went for a shot,'' he said. ``It was on a return of serve. I  
went for this backhand return and I felt it. I didn't hear anything 
but I felt something go. I felt my back just got ... stabbed by a 
knife. I just stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It scared me,'' he said. ``There's no question it scared me. I  
just walked off the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Dr. Brian Hainline, medical director of the  
tournament, thought Sampras' injury was typical of what his staff 
sees at the Open every year. The initial diagnosis was a mild back 
strain. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the tennis tournament, we might see 20 back strains,'' the  
doctor said. ``Pete had initial back pain. It was relatively 
well-localized. There wasn't anything else. There wasn't a 
compelling reason to think it was a disc herniation, although we 
talked about that possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras asked tournament officials to delay his first match  
until Wednesday, a courtesy that was quickly granted to the No. 
1-seeded player. 
</P>
<P>
	And then he waited for the pain to subside.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sunday night and Monday, I felt I had some back spasms,'' he  
said. ``It was something I could get a Wednesday start and kind of 
work through, just do whatever I can to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of getting better, the pain remained, a nagging ache  
that Sampras felt almost constantly as he moved gingerly around his 
hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt it in trying to fall asleep,'' he said. ``Every time I  
moved a different direction, I was feeling it. Moving around, 
picking up things, just doing the day-to-day stuff people do. You 
know you need your back to do whatever you need to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hainline then ordered an MRI and CAT scan. The tests revealed a  
small disc tear in the lower spine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very fortunate in being able to diagnose the herniated  
disc very early, before it became anything serious,'' Hainline 
said. ``There's a very, very focal tear right in the center. It's 
not pressing on any nerves. It's relatively small. We would expect 
him to recover fully from this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The treatment involves rest, followed by exercises and perhaps a  
month or two away from the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The news devastated Sampras, who will lose his No. 1 ranking  
while sidelined. He had been poised to make his run at the Grand 
Slam record at an event where he has prospered. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that quest must go on hold.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really wanted to have a chance to play here,'' he said.  
``I'm not saying I was going to win here or whatever, but to break 
the all-time record was a dream that I had, to do it here in New 
York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras finished 1998 with 11 Grand Slam titles. His victory at  
Wimbledon gave him 12, tying him with Roy Emerson and bringing him 
to the hardcourts of Flushing Meadows, a favorite surface. 
</P>
<P>
	He was playing well, felt in good shape and anticipated making a  
major run at the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras' injury opens the field for, among others, No. 2 Andre  
Agassi, winner of the French Open and loser in the finals at 
Wimbledon to Sampras, No. 3 Yevgeny Kafelnikov and No. 4 Patrick 
Rafter, the two-time defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It puts in perspective just how thankful you need to be for  
the opportunities you do get,'' Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi called Sampras on Tuesday morning.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very classy thing to do on his part,'' Sampras said.  
</P>
<P>
	Someone asked Sampras if he thought Agassi knew about the  
withdrawal when he called. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras smiled thinly.  
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think he was calling to tell me he won last night?'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Lewis, Holyfield Eye Better Judging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Lennox Lewis still believes something was wrong  
at ringside in his first fight with Evander Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	So does Holyfield, although in his case it had nothing to do  
with funny judging. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was cramping going into the ring and that was my biggest  
problem,'' Holyfield said. ``I just didn't feel well, and I thought 
several times of just quitting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield didn't quit, of course, and ended up being rewarded  
with a controversial 12-round draw that both prevented the 
heavyweight title from being unified and sparked investigations 
into how the ringside judges scored the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, both fighters got together once again to vow that on  
Nov. 13 they will finally get it right. 
</P>
<P>
	``The judging definitely was suspect. I believe there was some  
influence there,'' Lewis said, raising his fists. ``But I'm 
bringing my own two judges to this fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Months of fragile negotiations for the rematch ended with both  
fighters signing contracts over the weekend that will pay them some 
$15 million each to meet again at the UNLV campus arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Holyfield still maintains he did not lose, he admitted  
Tuesday that he fought poorly. And he accepted parity in the purses 
this time, after making $20 million to $10 million for Lewis when 
they first fought March 13 at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like getting demoted because you didn't do as well as you  
should,'' Holyfield said. ``If it means taking less, I'll take 
less. If I fought a great fight (the first time), I wouldn't be 
sliding down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield's IBF and WBA titles will be on the line once more, as  
will the WBC title owned by Lewis when the two try once again to 
unify the heavyweight championship for the first time since Riddick 
Bowe threw the WBC belt into a garbage can after beating Holyfield 
on Nov. 13, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, though, the organizations who give out the titles  
will not be picking the judges as they did in New York City. That 
will be done by the Nevada State Athletic Commission, which made it 
clear Tuesday that it will be in charge of the officiating. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we want in the state of Nevada is the man who wins the  
fight in the ring to get the decision,'' said Marc Ratner, the 
commission's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis and Holyfield appeared together as a curtain was raised  
amid music and spotlights in a night club Tuesday at the Las Vegas 
Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis refused later to pose for pictures with promoter Don King,  
who he believes may have influenced the judges into giving 
Holyfield a draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're biased against me,'' Lewis told King, saying later that  
``I don't want to stand there so he can put his arm around me and 
pretend he's with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield, who will be 37 the week after the fight, said after  
the press conference that he has watched tapes of the first fight 
over and over to figure out what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	His stomach was upset and he had cramps in the ring. Then,  
Holyfield said, Lewis fought less aggressively than he expected and 
he couldn't catch him in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a rough night,'' Holyfield said. ``But it wasn't that I  
was old in that fight. I was a little under the weather. People ask 
if Evander can still perform. Nobody will have to guess after Nov. 
13. They'll get the opportunity to see in the ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said there was little else Holyfield could bring into the  
second fight except maybe some renewed determination. 
</P>
<P>
	``All Evander Holyfield is going to be is a little older for  
this fight,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield had predicted he would knock out Lewis in the third  
round of the first fight, saying he received a revelation telling 
him so. 
</P>
<P>
	The third round may have been Holyfield's best of the night, but  
Lewis was still standing when it ended and the rest of the fight 
was a long one for Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the third round was over, there was no plan for the  
other rounds,'' Holyfield said. ``After that round, I had to talk 
myself back into fighting the last nine rounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rematch, expected to sell out the 18,000-seat Thomas and  
Mack arena, is being sponsored by Caesars Palace and the Mandalay 
Bay hotel-casinos, which put up $10 million for the rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The first fight was sold on TVKO to about 1.2 million households  
on pay-per-view, making it the seventh-biggest pay-per-view fight 
ever. Whether the rematch comes close to that may depend on how 
much the controversy over the first fight can be sold, and whether 
the fact the first fight was not a classic can be overlooked.

<HEADLINE>  Sampras Exits Open With Back Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pete Sampras winced as he bent to ease into the  
chair, the strain on his back sending spasms through his body, the 
pain etched on his face. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time U.S. Open champion withdrew from the tournament  
Tuesday after hurting his back during practice Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The herniated disc delayed Sampras' bid for a 13th Grand Slam  
championship, a scenario that was falling neatly in place until he 
went to hit on the eve of the Open with Gustavo Kuerten. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went for a shot,'' he said. ``It was on a return of serve. I  
went for this backhand return and I felt it. I didn't hear anything 
but I felt something go. I felt my back just got ... stabbed by a 
knife. I just stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It scared me,'' he said. ``There's no question it scared me. I  
just walked off the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Dr. Brian Hainline, medical director of the  
tournament, thought Sampras' injury was typical of what his staff 
sees at the Open every year. The initial diagnosis was a mild back 
strain. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the tennis tournament, we might see 20 back strains,'' the  
doctor said. ``Pete had initial back pain. It was relatively 
well-localized. There wasn't anything else. There wasn't a 
compelling reason to think it was a disc herniation, although we 
talked about that possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras asked tournament officials to delay his first match  
until Wednesday, a courtesy that was quickly granted to the No. 
1-seeded player. 
</P>
<P>
	And then he waited for the pain to subside.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sunday night and Monday, I felt I had some back spasms,'' he  
said. ``It was something I could get a Wednesday start and kind of 
work through, just do whatever I can to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of getting better, the pain remained, a nagging ache  
that Sampras felt almost constantly as he moved gingerly around his 
hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt it in trying to fall asleep,'' he said. ``Every time I  
moved a different direction, I was feeling it. Moving around, 
picking up things, just doing the day-to-day stuff people do. You 
know you need your back to do whatever you need to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hainline then ordered an MRI and CAT scan. The tests revealed a  
small disc tear in the lower spine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very fortunate in being able to diagnose the herniated  
disc very early, before it became anything serious,'' Hainline 
said. ``There's a very, very focal tear right in the center. It's 
not pressing on any nerves. It's relatively small. We would expect 
him to recover fully from this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The treatment involves rest, followed by exercises and perhaps a  
month or two away from the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The news devastated Sampras, who will lose his No. 1 ranking  
while sidelined. He had been poised to make his run at the Grand 
Slam record at an event where he has prospered. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that quest must go on hold.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really wanted to have a chance to play here,'' he said.  
``I'm not saying I was going to win here or whatever, but to break 
the all-time record was a dream that I had, to do it here in New 
York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras finished 1998 with 11 Grand Slam titles. His victory at  
Wimbledon gave him 12, tying him with Roy Emerson and bringing him 
to the hardcourts of Flushing Meadows, a favorite surface. 
</P>
<P>
	He was playing well, felt in good shape and anticipated making a  
major run at the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras' injury opens the field for, among others, No. 2 Andre  
Agassi, winner of the French Open and loser in the finals at 
Wimbledon to Sampras, No. 3 Yevgeny Kafelnikov and No. 4 Patrick 
Rafter, the two-time defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It puts in perspective just how thankful you need to be for  
the opportunities you do get,'' Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi called Sampras on Tuesday morning.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very classy thing to do on his part,'' Sampras said.  
</P>
<P>
	Someone asked Sampras if he thought Agassi knew about the  
withdrawal when he called. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras smiled thinly.  
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think he was calling to tell me he won last night?'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Team Tours Ryder Cup Course  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- It wasn't just a practice round that  
U.S. Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw had in mind when he called the 
team together at The Country Club. He also gave them some advice 
for when they return to the tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you go to a tournament, I want you to be together ...  
call one another,'' Crenshaw told them before the team left Monday. 
``I want you to know what one another's thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since watching the favored Americans fall apart in Valderrama in  
1997 -- their second consecutive loss -- Crenshaw has stressed 
teamwork and camaraderie as a key to taking back the trophy. So his 
goal Monday was not just to familiarize the players with the 
course, but also with each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the 12 members of the U.S. team took Crenshaw up on his  
call for togetherness by playing a round at the course where they 
will take on the Europeans on Sept. 24-26. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any moment we can spend with one another is golden in my  
mind,'' Crenshaw said. ``I think today was extremely beneficial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since being named captain two years ago, Crenshaw has gushed  
about the venerated course that essentially gave birth to American 
golf in 1913, when a 20-year-old caddie named Francis Ouimet beat 
Englishmen Harry Vardon and Ted Ray in a playoff to win the U.S. 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The Open was played here again in 1963, when it was won by  
Julius Boros, and in '88, when Curtis Strange won it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The place is dripping with history,'' said Hal Sutton, who  
finished 64th in the '88 Open and will return for the Ryder Cup. 
``I'm just glad to be a part of this next bit of history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sutton joined Ryder Cup teammates Phil Mickelson and The Country  
Club first-timers David Duval and Jeff Maggert in Monday's first 
foursome. Steve Pate, Payne Stewart and first-timers Jim Furyk and 
Justin Leonard played in the second group. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis Love III, who has a problem with a nerve in his neck, was  
seeing Dr. Frank Jobe in Alabama on Monday and could not play. 
Tiger Woods, Tom Lehman and Mark O'Meara were out with prior 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first-timers, when they get here, they'll understand what  
kind of place this is. I wanted them to experience that in a sort 
of a quiet situation,'' Crenshaw said. ``They know that they need 
to make history, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw first came to Brookline as a 16-year-old amateur and  
also played in the '88 U.S. Open, where he finished 12th. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feelings are so tied to this course. I wanted the fellas to  
come in and really enjoy the day -- of course for a practice round, 
but also for the setting,'' he said. ``You really do feel like 
you're playing against ... a piece of art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, camaraderie can only go so far.  
</P>
<P>
	``As much as you want to talk about a team, when Phil's out  
there putting, he has to make that putt,'' Duval said. ``We can't 
help him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pate agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Making putts is better than chemistry,'' he said. ``I don't  
know what you can do. It seems to me it's either there or it's not. 
We'll find out in three weeks.''

<HEADLINE> Tax Bill-Veto Game Following Script </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a month of previews, The Veto is coming  
soon. The Republicans will be sending their tax bill to the White 
House, President Clinton will veto it, and they'll replay the 
arguments they've been sounding all summer. 
</P>
<P>
	All on script, until the last act, which will involve a  
compromise or a standoff, no tax cut but an issue the Republicans 
think they can stretch into the 2000 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton says he'd be willing to talk but not about anything  
close to the $792 billion, 10-year tax cut Congress narrowly 
approved before its summer recess. He calls it irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders held the tax bill at the Capitol rather than send it  
to the White House, to be vetoed while they were out of town until 
Labor Day and the president held the stage alone. 
</P>
<P>
	They also wanted the time to try to build voter support for  
their tax bill, arguing their theme that the money ought to be 
given back to taxpayers, because otherwise Clinton and the 
Democrats will spend it on new government programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton counters that the Republican bill would deprive old  
programs, and vital ones, including Medicare, of vital funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say the polls tend their way on tax cuts, while  
Democrats say there is no groundswell for the tax bill. Either way, 
it won't change Clinton's position against a measure he threatened 
to veto long before it passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor will the cable TV and radio ads being aired by the  
Republican National Committee and GOP presidential candidate Steve 
Forbes on stations that broadcast to the upstate New York resort 
area where Clinton is spending this last week of his vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sign the tax bill, Mr. President,'' Forbes says in his radio  
spot. ``I would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He won't.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. President, there is no honest reason to veto this  
commonsense tax legislation,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert and 
Sen. Trent Lott wrote Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	To which Clinton wrote back that it would be irresponsible for  
him to sign a tax cut that he says would convert surpluses into 
future deficits, force drastic cuts in Medicare and neglect the 
long-term financing of Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	All of which, of course, the Republicans dispute.  
</P>
<P>
	During the recess, House and Senate Republicans say they've held  
around 600 events nationwide to explain and promote their tax cuts. 
Their weekly Saturday radio talks have pressed the GOP message, as 
Arizona Gov. Jane Hull did last weekend. She said Clinton ``either 
has a deep-seated desire to increase government spending or he just 
does not want to give the money back to the people who earned it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton doesn't miss a chance to argue that the Republican tax  
bill would undercut popular programs -- education, farm programs, 
even needs as basic as the air traffic control system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Office of Management and Budget has projected that over the  
next five years, the GOP tax cut would force close to $100 billion 
in automatic spending cuts under a 1990 budget law. 
</P>
<P>
	That Aug. 25 report said the tax bill would trigger offsetting  
cuts in spending, which would cost Medicare $41.4 billion and 
sharply reduce money for programs including farm credit and crop 
insurance, veterans education benefits and social services. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said the report is partisan and misleading.  
</P>
<P>
	Once the bill has been sent to the White House and Clinton has  
vetoed it, the question will be whether they can settle on anything 
to bridge their differences. So far it does not sound promising: 
Democrats have set a tax-cut ceiling of about $300 billion, and 
Clinton wants targeted reductions, written to benefit lower and 
middle-income taxpayers instead of the across-the-board GOP 
language. The Republican formula also includes capital gains tax 
cuts, gradual elimination of the inheritance tax and easing of the 
so-called marriage penalty on two-income couples. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton says he'll bargain on tax cuts, but not until Congress  
deals with the spending he considers vital, including Medicare. 
``Let's figure out what we've got to spend on other things and what 
we've got to do to pay the debt down, and let's give the rest back 
to the taxpayers,'' he said in a public TV interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I will be very flexible about how we do it,'' Clinton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But first, The Veto.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Holtz Worried About Gamecocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Lou Holtz earned a reputation as a  
pessimist while coaching at Notre Dame, no matter how well the 
Irish were doing. But concerns about his new team, the South 
Carolina Gamecocks, may be warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	His offensive line is small and inexperienced. His defensive  
secondary is without leader Arturo Freeman, who ruptured his spleen 
last week and will miss at least four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman underwent surgery in Charlotte on Monday to remove the  
spleen, the university said. He could be back in Columbia as soon 
as today. His condition will be re-evaluated later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But Holtz's worries don't stop there. He also worries about his  
quarterback, the running game and the kicking game. 
</P>
<P>
	The young Gamecocks lack depth and experience. Holtz openly  
questions their physical toughness and conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't honestly tell you a strength of our football team,  
other than the fact we've worked hard,'' Holtz said. ``I can tell 
you where I have a lot of concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You'd think he wouldn't want to play No. 24 North Carolina State  
(1-0) on Saturday in the Gamecocks' season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	No, Holtz says, ``I feel so emotional about this game and I  
don't think I'll have any problem getting this team ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's back on the sidelines after two years in television as an  
analyst for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	He talks about how getting back into coaching has sharpened his  
mind and improved his memory. 
</P>
<P>
	He talks about waking up in the middle of the night in a cold  
sweat trying to figure out how to beat N.C. State, which opened 
last weekend with a 23-20 victory at Texas that knocked the 
Longhorns out of the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	He talks about the rapid passage of time since he was hired in  
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Holtz said, ``When you spend as many years on the  
sidelines as I have, it's not a big adjustment when you've been 
away from it for two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's news conference was in many ways a replay of what Holtz  
has said during the recent months of intense media and fan 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, he said turning around the Gamecocks, 1-10 last  
season, is unlike any of the other five college football rebuilding 
projects he's undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Gamecocks have noticed Holtz's enthusiasm. Senior  
running back Boo Williams says it has infected the entire coaching 
staff 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been real intense in practice lately and really picky,''  
Williams said. ``It's the first game and everybody is anxious to 
get out there and play.''

<HEADLINE> Giants Send Stan Javier to Houston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The San Francisco Giants traded outfielder  
Stan Javier to the Houston Astros for pitching prospect Joe Messman 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Javier, a 15-year major league veteran, has hit .276 with three  
home runs and 30 RBI in 112 games this season with the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade to Houston allows Javier to become a full-time player  
with a playoff-contending team, said Giants general manager Brian 
Sabean. 
</P>
<P>
	``Houston had some ongoing interest in Stan, heightened by their  
recent injury bug,'' Sabean said. 
</P>
<P>
	Messman, a 24-year-old right-hander, is 2-4 this season with 15  
saves and a 2.54 ERA in 44 relief appearances for Single-A 
Kissimmee. 
</P>
<P>
	Javier, 35, is a .266 career hitter with 48 home runs and 426  
RBI in 1,549 games. He has also played for the New York Yankees, 
Oakland Athletics, Los Angeles Dodgers, Philadelphia Phillies and 
the California Angels.

<HEADLINE> Bush To Announce Farm Endorsements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush is getting the  
endorsement of more than 100 prominent Iowa farm activists, 
including backers in each of the state's 99 counties. 
</P>
<P>
	The list includes prominent commodity group leaders, political  
figures and local farm leaders. It's by far the most extensive 
compilation of Iowa farm leaders compiled by a GOP presidential 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The group will be headed by former Iowa Agriculture Secretary  
Robert Lounsberry of McCallsburg and popular former farm 
broadcaster Herb Plambeck of Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was headed to the Dallas Center farm of Tom and Judy  
Barrett on Wednesday to announce the endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is an impressive organizational feat, and solidifies  
Bush's standing as the front-runner in the battle for Iowa's 
precinct caucuses, which launch the nominating season next winter. 
</P>
<P>
	The backing from farmers is important in the caucus campaign, in  
part because the farm economy is suffering from historic low 
commodity prices, and many farmers face bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Some activists blame the farm recession on GOP-led efforts to  
revamp the nation's farm policy and eliminate many traditional farm 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	``He truly understands agriculture and the need to develop  
strong markets,'' said former Iowa Farm Bureau president Merlin 
Plagge, among those joining the endorsement effort Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The farm leaders said they favored Bush's approach to bolster  
sales of farm commodities overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush's commitment to market development is crucial to  
cattle producers, and his commitment to ethanol is equally crucial 
to corn growers in Iowa and throughout the Midwest,'' said Nancy 
Pellett, past president of the Iowa Beef Industry Council.

chairmen of the House and Senate agriculture committees.

<HEADLINE> Hornets' Coleman Faces Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Prosecutors have approved a misdemeanor warrant  
charging Charlotte Hornets forward Derrick Coleman with disorderly 
conduct, following accusations that he urinated in front of dining 
room patrons at a downtown restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman's attorney has been notified that his client must turn  
himself in, Detroit Police Investigator Mattie Lewis told The 
Detroit News for a story Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Coleman has denied any wrongdoing, saying he  
spilled a drink on himself. His attorney, Harold MacDonald, 
couldn't be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Intermezzo Italian Ristorante manager Ralphie Apone alleged that  
on Aug. 7, Coleman urinated in full view of patrons, then again 
outside the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the police report, Coleman was seen relieving  
himself about 1:30 a.m. in the dining room and was asked to leave 
by the manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, the 1991 NBA rookie of the year and former Detroit high  
school basketball star, has done a lot of charity work in Detroit, 
including coaching city kids during summer months and buying 
basketball shoes for less-fortunate students. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they lacked enough evidence to charge Coleman  
with indecent exposure, a more serious charge. Conviction on that 
count brings inclusion on a state sex offender list for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	While he doesn't have a criminal record in Michigan, Coleman has  
had numerous run-ins with police. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces a civil suit filed by Tammie Phillips in 1997. She is  
suing him for trespass and battery stemming from an alleged Aug. 
26, 1997 assault at her Detroit home. His attorney in that case has 
said the allegation is untrue. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Coleman was arrested and charged with refusing to move  
his truck and swearing at a police officer in Detroit. The jury 
failed to reach a verdict and the case ended in a mistrial.

<HEADLINE> Lions Acquire Rams RB Greg Hill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The Detroit Lions added a running back to help  
fill the Barry Sanders void Tuesday, acquiring Greg Hill from the 
St. Louis Rams for two draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal cost the Lions fifth- and seventh-round choices in next  
year's draft. The fifth pick is conditional, meaning the Rams could 
get a higher pick if Hill, a former first-round pick in 1994, is 
successful in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams and Lions close the preseason Thursday night in  
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill ran for 240 yards and four touchdowns in two games last  
year before breaking his leg and sustaining season-ending ankle 
ligament damage in a loss to Buffalo. Hill proclaimed himself fully 
recovered last November, but missed time in the preseason with a 
sprained ankle and had four carries for minus-8 yards Saturday 
against San Diego in his only game action. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill fell to second-string when the Rams acquired Marshall  
Faulk, the best all-purpose back in the NFL last year, two days 
before this year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a little bit despondent and you could see it in his  
practice,'' coach Dick Vermeil said. ``His heart wasn't really in 
it. There is too much talent there to not be in the frame of mind 
to use it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trade saves the Rams, who were close to the salary limit,  
$700,000 in cap dollars. But Vermeil said that was not a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our ownership and our management is dedicated to keeping the  
best football players here regardless of salary cap problems,'' 
Vermeil said. ``That has nothing to do with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill was a first-round draft pick of Kansas City and spent his  
first four NFL seasons with the Chiefs, rushing for 2,126 yards 
over that span. The Rams signed him to a free agent deal last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The unexpected retirement of Sanders -- the NFL's second-leading  
career rusher -- at the start of training camp left the Lions thin 
at running back. They also have Ron Rivers and rookie Sedrick 
Irvin, a fourth-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders rushed for 1,491 yards last year and ended his career  
with 15,269 yards -- 1,458 yards shy of Walter Payton's career 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions earlier considered free agents Terry Allen and Raymont  
Harris, but both wanted too much money. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade also leaves the Rams thin in the backfield, at least  
for now. Robert Holcombe, a second-round pick last year who is the 
starting fullback, becomes the backup at running back. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other backs, Amp Lee and June Henley, are injured. Lee had  
surgery for knee tendinitis in July and is expected back in 
October, and Henley has turf toe.

<HEADLINE> Detroit To Test Parking Meter Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Motorists fumbling for coins to feed this city's  
parking meters soon may see some convenient change -- in the form of 
meters that also will accept plastic. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit's parking department will test meters that allow users  
to swipe a special debit card to pay for parking. About 3,000 such 
meters are in place downtown, in the city's New Center area and at 
Wayne State University, ready to begin accepting the 
microchip-equipped cards by this year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Not interested in the debit card? Fear not, the meters still  
will take quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, the city collects about $9 million in parking fines,  
with about 40 percent of the tickets issued by the parking 
department for meter violations. 
</P>
<P>
	To parking officials, coin-strapped motorists should embrace the  
debit cards, which the city plans to sell for various dollar 
amounts. They'd work like phone cards, with the amount spent 
deducted after each use. 
</P>
<P>
	``I constantly receive letters from people who say, `I was going  
to get change, and I came back and had a ticket,''' Ronald Ruffin, 
the parking department's head, told the Detroit Free Press in a 
story Tuesday 
</P>
<P>
	``This will give them the opportunity to always have money.''

<HEADLINE> Schoolteachers in Detroit Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The city's schoolteachers went on strike today,  
canceling the first day of fall classes and dealing another blow to 
the effort to revive Detroit's underperforming schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike -- in part over such contentious reform proposals as  
merit pay -- will now test a state law that bars public school 
teachers from walking out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rhetoric's the same. We don't have a contract and we don't  
see any real change,'' Mike Pahl, a science teacher at Spain 
School, said this morning. ``This is the only way we're going to 
get any real improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The district's 172,000 students were told to stay home today.  
Classes will not be held until officials know that enough of the 
district's 7,200 teachers will report for work. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous contract between the Detroit Federation of Teachers  
and the school system expired June 30, and an extension ran out 
Monday after teachers voted to reject their negotiators' 
recommendation for another extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have liked for them to follow my recommendations to go  
back to work for 10 days while I negotiate,'' union President John 
Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the walkout, talks are scheduled to resume this  
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks are the first negotiations with the teachers since  
Detroit's elected school board was replaced earlier this year with 
one appointed by Mayor Dennis Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	The issues still unresolved included salary increases, merit  
pay, extended work days and a dress code. Teachers said merit pay 
was the most contentious issue. Many prefer to keep the old 
standards of experience, seniority and education; and say the real 
way to improve schools would be steps such as cutting class size. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody in our building deserves merit pay because everyone  
here's a good teacher,'' said Rita Greenberg, a second-grade 
teacher at Spain School. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have to say the rejection today does reflect an  
unwillingness by some teachers to engage themselves in significant 
change,'' said David Adamany, the district's interim chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the union's first walkout 1992. Under a 1994 Michigan  
law, public school employees who strike lose a day's pay in 
addition to being fined a day's pay. The law has never been tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Adamany said the school district will not seek a court  
injunction to try to force the teachers back to work, but is 
looking into the question of seeking fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor said in a statement that he is troubled by the strike  
vote after the work the district had done to prepare for the school 
year. Over the summer, district employees and private sector 
volunteers combined to make $80 million worth of repairs and 
renovations to the district's 263 buildings, some of them nearly 
100 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointed school board -- an idea pushed by Republican Gov.  
John Engler and approved by the Legislature -- followed decades of 
declining performance and alleged mismanagement and pork-barrel 
politics in Detroit schools. Supporters said an appointed school 
board would be better able to make difficult political decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Samona, a math teacher at Redford High School, said he  
would ideally like to be teaching today, but that working for a 
better contract was also important. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate really that we are not doing what we do  
best,'' he said. ``But we want to be back in the classroom with a 
fair contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The median salary for Detroit teachers with a bachelor's degree  
is $50,978 and with a master's degree is $58,494, said Janna 
Garrison, executive vice president of the Detroit Federation of 
Teachers. The median salary for teachers in Wayne County, and 
neighboring Oakland and Macomb counties is $55,700 for teachers 
with a bachelor's degree and $64,822 with a master's degree, she 
said.

<HEADLINE> Plea Entered for Wisconsin Fullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A judge entered innocent pleas Tuesday on  
behalf of Wisconsin fullback Jael Speights, who is charged with 
sexually assaulting a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The freshman from Zion, Ill., was charged last week with two  
felony counts of second-degree sexual assault and one count of 
burglary. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman told police that she was repeatedly threatened, beaten  
and choked as she was sexually assaulted in her apartment on July 
31. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA evidence linked the 18-year-old Speights to the assault, a  
criminal complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speights did not know the woman, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
	He waived his preliminary hearing and Judge Paul Higginbotham  
entered innocent pleas on his behalf. He is being held on $15,000 
bond and could face up to 80 years in prison if convicted on all 
the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Public defender Dee Watson said Speights' bond should be lowered  
to $3,000, arguing that he was a responsible student who graduated 
from high school with honors and came to the university in June on 
an academic and athletic scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson said Speights' family could not afford to get him out of  
jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Higginbotham refused to lower the bond, saying the charges  
``scream out for public reaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This sits right up there in terms of one of the worst cases  
I've seen,'' Higginbotham said. ``Not only is the victim at risk, 
but the general public is at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speights has been indefinitely suspended from the football team.

<HEADLINE> IOC Panel Urges Athlete Drug Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- A drug-use report card for Olympic athletes was  
among the recommendations offered today by an IOC reform panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``health passport'' would contain the athetes' drug-test  
records. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also said the IOC itself should be more accountable by  
simplifying its financial records to make it easier for the public 
to understand its sources of income and expenditure. 
</P>
<P>
	And it urged the IOC to continue making the Olympics open to all  
by promoting the use of free television networks, rather than pay 
TV channels, and by encouraging affordable seating prices at 
Olympic venues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the Olympics on free television so that everybody  
without social barriers can watch,'' said Thomas Bach, the 
coordinator of the 23-member Working Group on the Role of the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Financial considerations can only take second priority,'' Bach  
said in a telephone interview after the meetings in Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel said the IOC should improve its communications with  
athletes and give them a stronger voice. But, despite the wish to 
encourage universal participation in the games, the number of 
athletes and coaches should be kept at 10,000 and 5,000, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to greater rights, athletes should also have more  
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Working Group encouraged the athletes to reconfirm their  
pledge not to take prohibited substances to enhance their 
performances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendations followed a rash of flunked drug tests by  
big-name athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey, who dominated sprint events for  
two decades and won 14 World Championship medals, pulled out of the 
world championships in Seville after testing positive for the 
steroid Nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous weeks, Cuban high jumper Javier Sotomayor, the world  
champion and world-record holder, tested positive for cocaine at 
the Pan American Games and was stripped of his gold medal. The 1992 
Olympic and world 100-meter champion Linford Christie of Britain 
was suspended for a positive Nandrolone test; and U.S. 100-meter 
champion Dennis Mitchell was suspended for two years after testing 
positive for high testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	Bach said all the recommendations were agreed unanimously by the  
panel, part of the 80-member IOC 2000 Commission, set up following 
the Salt Lake City bribery scandal to overhaul the organization and 
prevent future vote-buying. 
</P>
<P>
	Six IOC members were expelled and four resigned in the Olympic  
movement's worst ever corruption scandal.

<HEADLINE> Calif. OKs Old Molestation Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The California Supreme Court has opened the  
door for prosecutors to try alleged child molesters for crimes they 
are accused of committing decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's 4-3 ruling Monday upheld a 1994 state law that  
allows molestation charges to be filed within a year of the case 
being reported to authorities, regardless of when the crime 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	In most other cases in California, prosecutors must file charges  
within six years of the alleged crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling, which is expected to affect dozens of California  
cases already in the legal pipeline, contradicted decisions by 
courts in some other states that such laws are unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	In his majority opinion, Justice Marvin Baxter wrote that the  
Legislature crafted the law out of recognition that ``young victims 
often have difficulty remembering and reporting traumatic abuse at 
the hands of adults, particularly adults who breach positions of 
trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The law, he wrote, does not violate the Constitution since it  
leaves the definition of the crime and length of potential sentence 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the law said it provided adequate safeguards  
against false accusations being brought forward years later. Among 
its provisions is one allowing prosecutors to file charges only 
when the accusation is supported by independent evidence, which 
cannot consist of a psychiatric opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Sevilla, who represented the defense group California  
Attorneys for Criminal Justice, said the ruling would lead to 
prosecutions based on dubious evidence, including the 
scientifically questionable theory of recovered memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``As time passes, memory erodes, accuracy diminishes and biases  
and distortions cloud the accuracy of recall,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled specifically in the case of Raymond L. Frazer,  
charged in Mendocino County in 1996 with molesting a girl under age 
14 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadline for prosecution expired in 1990, but the  
prosecutor, relying later on the 1994 law, filed the charge within 
a year of the time the alleged victim came forward.

<HEADLINE> Farmers OK New Milk Pricing System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even though it could cost them money, dairy  
farmers overwhelmingly approved an overhaul of the way milk is 
priced around the country rather than have the government end its 
regulation of their industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The new plan, which was developed by the Agriculture Department  
to smooth regional disparities in the prices that farmers receive 
for milk, is likely to undergo revision in Congress this fall 
before it takes effect. The current system expires Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA's plan received near-unanimous approval in most regions of  
the country, according to results of the Aug. 2-6 referendum that 
were released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The smallest margin of victory for the plan was in the  
Northeast, where 90.5 percent of the 13,921 producers voting 
supported it. The plan was approved by 96 percent of the 20,013 
farmers who voted in the upper Midwest. The margin was even larger 
in most other regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists say the USDA plan would hurt most producers outside  
the upper Midwest, but producers had no choice but to vote for it 
given that the current system is scheduled to end, said Chris 
Galen, a spokesman for the National Milk Producers Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The referendum was a choice between the lesser of two evils.  
The most egregious evil is having no federal order program. ... 
It's no surprise that dairy producers very grudgingly and with a 
great deal of reservation did vote in the USDA proposal,'' Galen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His group estimates that farmers would lose $200 million a year  
compared to the current system. Consumers would likely see little 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to USDA, the largest dairy cooperative in the  
nation, Dairy Farmers of America, said its members were approving 
the pricing plan reluctantly. ``Our 'yes' vote does not mean that 
dairy farmers can live with the final rule. They cannot. 
Economically, the income and livelihood of many dairy farm families 
will suffer significantly under your proposal,'' the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	The current pricing system, which was set up in the 1930s to  
stimulate milk production in areas where it was scarce, guarantees 
that farmers in the South and West receive up to $3 per hundred 
pounds more for their fluid milk than producers in the upper 
Midwest. The USDA plan would narrow those disparities although some 
regional differences would continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers in Texas would lose more than $1 per hundred pounds  
under the plan, while producers in the Chicago area would gain 55 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
	The prices vary under a network of regional ``milk marketing  
orders.'' Under the USDA plan, the 31 regions in the current system 
would be consolidated into 11. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA was ordered by Congress in 1996 to come up with a  
replacement for the existing system. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Agriculture Committee voted 32-15 earlier this month  
to block the USDA plan and implement an alternative proposal that 
is closer to the existing system. The legislation is sponsored by 
more than 220 lawmakers, a majority of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dairy farmers across the country have voiced their support for  
these modest reforms because they know it is time to introduce the 
concept of fairness back into our milk marketing order system,'' 
said Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Laser Expert Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) -- The director of a program intended to  
build the world's most powerful lasers has resigned amid questions 
about his education. 
</P>
<P>
	E. Michael Campbell, associate director for lasers at Lawrence  
Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., left his job 
Friday after a series of anonymous faxes to his bosses revealed he 
does not have a Ph.D. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said he was leaving the position for personal  
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a young family, and I need to spend some time with  
them,'' he told the Contra Costa Times. ``My wife has said the lab 
has sucked the life out of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the world's leading authorities on ultra-high-energy  
lasers, Campbell remains an employee on leave from the lab, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell was director of a $1.2 billion program to build the  
National Ignition Facility, intended to conduct research in weapons 
and fusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Lab spokesman Jeff Richardson said Campbell had allowed lab  
officials to believe he had a doctorate from Princeton University. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike had completed his Ph.D. course work when he joined  
Livermore in 1977, but he never finished his dissertation,'' 
Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lab officials were investigating whether he lied about holding a  
doctorate during the hiring process. They said they are unlikely to 
release the results of their investigation because it is a 
personnel issue. 
</P>
<P>
	While Campbell cited personal reasons, Susan Houghton, senior  
media relations manager at the laboratory, said today: ``The reason 
for the resignation is due to the Ph.D. issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Senior management felt a bit misled,'' Houghton said. ``I can  
tell you our senior managers were shocked. The assumption on senior 
management's part was that Mr. Campbell did have a Ph.D.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said the need for a doctorate became increasingly  
insignificant as he made a rapid rise through the lab's laser 
fusion programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell's supporters say it's a common practice to hire  
scientists who have not yet completed their dissertations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a waste of time and talent to continue to pursue a  
dissertation in some cases,'' said David Crandall, a Department of 
Energy official overseeing the laser project. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the lab requires each senior manager to hold a Ph.D. or  
its equivalent in experience. The lab's former director, John 
Nuckolls, also did not have a Ph.D. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference in Nuckolls' case is that ``everybody was well  
aware of that,'' Houghton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell's home telephone number is unlisted.

<HEADLINE> Funds Can Fit Religious Beliefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The proliferation of mutual funds during the  
past decade has made it possible for investors of almost any 
religion or lifestyle to find a fund that fits their beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of these funds fall under the category of so-called  
socially responsible funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Socially responsible funds are those funds that use  
non-financial criteria as at least part of the reason for selecting 
certain stocks,'' said Emily Hall, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., 
a Chicago firm that tracks mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said religious and lifestyle funds emerged -- and grew --  
following the popularity of funds focused primarily on 
environmental and labor practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``For religious reasons, many investors weren't comfortable with  
certain stocks in their portfolios,'' she said. With that in mind, 
fund managers set about creating funds that met investors' diverse 
philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, different faiths and lifestyles frequently find  
themselves in opposition to one another's goals. Yet mutual fund 
investors all have the same goal -- financial security through savvy 
investing. 
</P>
<P>
	So it's interesting to see how different funds that represent  
different groups go about meeting the goals of their investors 
through divergent strategies. 
</P>
<P>
	Take the Meyers Pride Value Fund, for example, whose objective  
is to invest only in companies with ``progressive policies toward 
gays and lesbians.'' The fund's five top holdings include such 
well-known, blue chip stocks as AT&AMP;T Corp., J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., and 
General Instrument. 
</P>
<P>
	To meet the fund's requirements for receiving investment  
dollars, all of these companies must have stated policies against 
discrimination in their hiring and promotion based on sexual 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that companies which are more responsive toward  
addressing the concerns of all its employees and other 
constituencies will benefit financially from the consumer loyalty 
generated by such social awareness,'' the fund's prospectus states. 
</P>
<P>
	At the other end of the spectrum is the Timothy Plan, a family  
of funds founded in 1992 and geared toward the retirement plans of 
Christian ministers. The funds' list of investment principles 
includes avoiding companies that promote ``nontraditional married 
lifestyles.'' The fund's Web page asserts: ``We feel strongly that 
we must steer clear from any company that is helping to promote 
unbiblical lifestyles by providing Domestic Partner Benefits,'' 
which afford gay and lesbian couples the same benefits as married 
couples. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Timothy Plan funds also avoid investing in  
companies that are pro-choice, including insurance companies that 
pay for abortions and firms that contribute to Planned Parenthood, 
the nonprofit organization that provides abortion and family 
planning services. And like many socially responsible funds, 
Timothy Plan also shies away from companies that are connected to 
pornography, alcohol or gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to meet the funds' stringent criteria, fund managers  
apparently have to look beyond standard lists of household name 
stocks. Timothy Plan's top five holdings list includes lesser-known 
companies such as publishing firm John Wiley &AMP; Sons, computer 
reseller Comdisco Inc., and aviation equipment company Kellstrom 
Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Muslims can also find a family of funds that adhere to Islamic  
tenets against drinking alcohol and usury. Amana Funds, which avoid 
bonds altogether because they are interest-based financial 
instruments, lean heavily on technology stocks. Indeed, eight of 
Amana's Trust Growth fund's top 10 holdings fall under the 
technology umbrella, including America Online Inc., Microsoft 
Corp., and Apple Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Morningstar's Hall said technology stocks are popular among  
socially responsible fund managers because many tech companies are 
relatively new and have grown up in more socially aware times. 
Consequently, they have better track records on labor policies and 
the environment than companies that have been around for many 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot easier to have a software company with a good  
environmental record than a paper company with a good environmental 
record,'' she observed. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the small Mennonite community in the United States has a  
family of funds dedicated to their beliefs. The Mennonites are 
pacifists, so the MMA Praxis funds prohibit investments in 
companies that manufacture weapons, as well as in securities 
directly issued by the U.S. Treasury Department because the agency 
provides funding for the U.S. military.

<HEADLINE> 69 Said Dead in Argentine Jet Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- An Argentine airliner carrying at  
least 90 people crashed on takeoff Tuesday night, slamming into a 
golf course and bursting into flames. Local news reports said at 
least 69 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	There were unconfirmed reports of 26 survivors, at least two who  
jumped to safety from the disintegrating Boeing 737 as it skidded 
in flames across the course. 
</P>
<P>
	The LAPA, Lineas Aereas Privadas Argentinas, plane went down as  
it was taking off from Jorge Newberry airport, one of the city's 
largest, fire and police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet, which was beginning a trip to Cordoba, 475 miles to the  
northwest, burst into flames after it slammed into the golf course 
along the Rio de la Plata river. 
</P>
<P>
	One bystander said the plane had barely cleared a fence  
surrounding the airport before plunging to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The man, around 30 who declined to give his name, said people on  
the course shouted for passengers to get out of the wreckage. He 
said he saw a man and a woman leap from the craft. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were shouting frantically, `We're safe! We're safe','' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters poured streams of water on the wreckage. Ambulances  
took away victims, reportedly to two area hospitals, sirens blaring 
amid a scene of nighttime confusion. 
</P>
<P>
	It was left a smoldering tangle of metal and other debris after  
being consumed by flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities at the scene told local news agency Noticias  
Argentinas that there were at least 69 dead and 26 survivors. The 
account could not be immediately confirmed independently and there 
was no immediate comment from the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Local news agency Diarios y Noticias quoted one survivor as  
saying he escaped through the rear of the plane. The report, which 
did not give the man's name, quoted him as saying the plane barely 
lifted off when it crashed into the earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Police blocked routes all around the airport, creating huge  
traffic jams along key arteries that pass the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are doing all we can,'' said Fernando de la Rua, the Buenos  
Aires mayor, who said he had ordered civil defense workers, 
ambulance and fire crews from around the city to the scene.

<HEADLINE> McConnell Ruled Blue Jackets' Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Lamar Hunt has lost another round in the  
dispute over who will control the NHL's Columbus Blue Jackets. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio's 10th District Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that steel  
magnate John McConnell and his partner, Wolfe Enterprises Inc., did 
not do anything improper when they excluded Hunt from the Blue 
Jackets' ownership group. The ruling upheld a decision in May by 
Judge John Bessey of Franklin County Common Pleas Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is to begin play in October 2000 in Nationwide Arena,  
which is being built downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell and his partners reached a deal with Nationwide to  
build an arena for the expansion franchise after Hunt turned down a 
contract with Nationwide. They sued Hunt to validate the group's 
ownership claim without him. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt, of Dallas, has accused the NHL and Nationwide of bad-faith  
bargaining and breach of contract. The owner of the NFL's Kansas 
City Chiefs and Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer has 
countersued in a New York court, seeking to have the NHL franchise 
taken away from Columbus and asking for $50 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	That case was put on hold while Hunt appealed the Columbus  
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``We perceive that we won the case very substantially,'' said  
John W. Zeiger, a lawyer representing McConnell, the Blue Jackets' 
principal owner. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell did not respond to a message seeking comment, but  
Zeiger said, ``I think it's fair to say that all of our clients are 
extremely pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt's attorney said the franchise was never in jeopardy.  
</P>
<P>
	``What you have here is a business deal where the partners had a  
falling out and it's in the court trying to get sorted out who did 
what and gets what,'' Anthony Celebrezze said. ``The franchise is 
not at issue at this point. It's going to be in Columbus. What is 
at issue is who owns the franchise and what part of it each of the 
owners has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't a total loss for Hunt.  
</P>
<P>
	The appellate court ruled that the lower court was wrong when it  
ordered Hunt to pay McConnell's group $920,000 in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we're grateful that they decided that Hunt Sports  
didn't have to pay the legal fees of the other side,'' Celebrezze 
said. ``We're disappointed that the court didn't reverse other 
aspects of the trial court judgment that would allow three of the 
investors to walk off with the franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrezze said he and the rest of Hunt's legal team would  
probably decide within the next 10 days whether to appeal to the 
Ohio Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Petr Korda Suspended for One Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tennis players hailed the ruling Tuesday against  
Petr Korda that strengthened the sport's anti-doping program, 
although they took no pleasure in Korda's stiff punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda, the 1998 Australian Open champion, lost an arbitration  
ruling in Lausanne, Switzerland and was ordered to forfeit all 
prize money since July 1998 -- $661,831 -- for testing positive for 
the steroid Nandrolone at Wimbledon last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport ended a  
protracted legal battle between Korda and the International Tennis 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old Czech also received a one-year ban, until Aug.  
31, 2000, and lost computer ranking points accumulated since the 
1998 Wimbledon. But that part of the punishment won't mean much to 
Korda, who retired in July after failing to gain wild-card entry 
into Wimbledon and losing in the qualifying round. 
</P>
<P>
	The CAS ruled there were no ``exceptional circumstances'' that  
would excuse Korda from suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ITF and its partners in the joint anti-doping program --  
the ATP Tour and the WTA Tour -- are pleased that the intent of the 
anti-doping program regulations has been upheld,'' Deborah Jevans, 
the ITF executive director of medicine, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is now clear that the burden of proof rests with the player  
to prove on the balance of probabilities how a banned substance 
came to be present in his body. This sets a clear precedent for the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players must demonstrate the circumstance in which the offense  
occurred if they wish to seek a reduction in the mandatory 
sanctions based on the relevant degree of intent, fault or 
negligence on their part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Miles, head of the ATP Tour, said the case supported the  
tour's efforts ``to create the strongest anti-doping program 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Martin, president of the ATP Player Council, said the  
language of the rules has been ``very hazy,'' and that's going to 
be changed now that the Korda case is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter of upholding the integrity of the sport and  
the integrity of our program,'' Martin said. ``It's disappointing 
for Petr. That's no way to finish your career. Despite the fact 
that he somehow allowed the substance into his body, I think 
everybody should have a little compassion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsay Davenport, a member of the WTA Tour board of directors,  
praised the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you test positive, you test positive,'' she said. ``He  
never came out and said why he thought it had gone into his system. 
It was always kind of a really gray area. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it should be one of the toughest things we have on the  
tour, the anti-doping. I don't think it's fair when people do that. 
You just can't say, `I didn't take it,' and get off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korda's case went to the CAS for a final ruling after the ITF  
won an appeal in a British court to seek a drug ban. 
</P>
<P>
	His failed drug test came after he lost in the Wimbledon  
quarterfinals to Tim Henman last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He avoided a mandatory one-year suspension when an independent  
appeals panel met in December and decided there were ``exceptional 
circumstances'' because he claimed he did not know he had taken, or 
been administered, the substance. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel found Korda had broken anti-drug rules. But instead of  
receiving a ban, Korda lost his prize money and ranking points from 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	The lenient penalty angered players, and many threatened to  
boycott the Australian Open, where Korda was defending his title. 
</P>
<P>
	The ITF then appealed to the CAS in January, contending the  
panel had misapplied its rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda subsequently appealed to the High Court, which ruled the  
decision of the ITF's panel could not be appealed to the Court of 
Arbitration for Sport. 
</P>
<P>
	But that decision was overturned in March by the Court of Appeal  
in London, allowing the ITF to proceed. The CAS met to consider the 
case on July 29 in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda's case is one of several disputed drugs cases involved  
Nandrolone, which occurs naturally in the body and can be increased 
by certain foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Track and field was rocked before the recent world championships  
in Seville, Spain, when star Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey tested 
positive for the steroid. 
</P>
<P>
	Linford Christie, the 100-meter champion in the 1992 Olympics  
and now practically retired, tested positive for Nandrolone after 
an indoor meet this year at Dortmund, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey and Christie contend they are innocent and plan to fight  
the accusations.

<HEADLINE> Sheppard Drops Exhumation Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Prosecutors can exhume the body of Dr. Sam  
Sheppard's wife without a court fight from the couple's son, who 
has brought a wrongful imprisonment suit in the case that inspired 
TV's ``The Fugitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Reese Sheppard reluctantly agreed Monday to allow the  
exhumation of his mother to proceed, even though it may mean 
another delay in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is emotionally wearing,'' Sheppard said.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors want to obtain DNA samples from Marilyn Sheppard to  
help them defend the state in the lawsuit filed by Sheppard's son. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Sheppard spent a decade in prison after being  
convicted of beating his wife to death in July 1954 at the couple's 
home on Lake Erie. He was acquitted at a retrial in 1966 after the 
U.S. Supreme Court overturned the original verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Sheppard contends a window washer killed his mother  
and has worked for the last 10 years to try to clear his father's 
name. If he wins the wrongful imprisonment lawsuit, damages could 
reach as much as $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard, his attorneys and prosecutors met behind closed doors  
for nearly two hours Monday with Judge Ron Suster of Cuyahoga 
County Common Pleas Court to discuss the exhumation of Mrs. 
Sheppard. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard, 52, of Oakland, Calif., is upset about the exhumation  
because he feels prosecutors have had 45 years to investigate the 
case and views the exhumation as a last-minute stalling tactic. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard's attorney, Terry Gilbert, said the exhumation wasn't  
worth fighting over. ``We feel it's going to confirm our case or 
not determine much of anything, frankly,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	County Prosecutor William Mason ordered the exhumation last week  
and plans to have an anthropologist, forensic dentist and DNA 
expert examine Mrs. Sheppard's remains. No date has been set for 
exhuming the body from Knollwood Cemetery in suburban Mayfield 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains of Sheppard, who died in 1970, were exhumed for DNA  
samples in 1997, at his son's request. The doctor always insisted 
that a bushy-haired intruder killed his wife, then knocked him 
unconscious when he came to her aid.

<HEADLINE> Innocent Plea Entered for Furrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lawyers now will evaluate strategy after a  
judge entered a plea of innocent for a white supremacist who 
allegedly confessed to killing a Filipino-American postal worker 
and shooting up a Jewish community center full of children. 
</P>
<P>
	Magistrate judge Stephen Hillman entered an innocent plea for  
Buford O. Furrow Jr., 37, after defense lawyers stated they did not 
intend to enter a plea. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a defense move is not unusual, and provides time for  
lawyers to plot strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillman set a tentative trial date of Oct. 12 and assigned the  
case to U.S. District Judge Richard Paez. 
</P>
<P>
	Paez will determine a formal trial date after he confers with  
attorneys and finds out whether Furrow will waive his right to a 
speedy trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of slain letter carrier Joseph Ileto sat across the  
courtroom from Furrow as he answered ``yes'' in a quiet voice, 
acknowledging he understood the charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ileto, 39, was shot to death Aug. 10. Although the arraignment  
was for that killing, the government could add hate crimes 
allegations that would encompass the wounding of five people, 
including three children, the same day at the Jewish Community 
Center in suburban Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow faces separate state charges of attempted murder in that  
shooting. The district attorney's office also filed a murder charge 
in the Ileto killing and added hate crime allegations against 
Furrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow allegedly told investigators he intended that shooting as  
``a wake-up call to America to kill Jews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both state and federal charges carry a potential death penalty.  
</P>
<P>
	Experts have suggested that Furrow will have a defense based on  
mental illness.

	For the record, Lisa, a self-described A student who does her  
homework every night, thinks schools need more money and that all 
kids should stay in school until they graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	At Howard School of Academics and Technology in Chattanooga,  
Tenn., Riley launched his bus tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``Better education is everybody's business,'' Riley told a crowd  
of students and teachers gathered in the school library today. 
``When parents and communities are involved in a serious way, 
students learn better, have better discipline and stay in school 
longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before boarding a large charter coach decorated in yellow to  
resemble a school bus, Riley touted Clinton administration 
initiatives to go before Congress this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``If ever there was a time to be investing in the future, that  
time is now,'' he said. ``This is why we should use our nation's 
budget surplus to protect Social Security, shore up Medicare ... 
and invest in quality education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He praised a new generation of Southern governors for what he  
called ``pro-education agendas.'' The governors will ride various 
legs of the ``Success Express'' along the way as Riley visits their 
schools, some of which are running well and others the state has 
had to take over. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Riley's caravan was visiting local schools to launch the  
Mars Millennium Project -- a program to help schoolchildren 
nationwide learn about science by designing a Mars colony. He also 
was stressing parental involvement at Litchfield High School in 
Gadsden, Ala., the first school in Alabama to fall under state 
control because of poor scores on the Stanford Achievement Test. 
</P>
<P>
	A math and technology magnet school, Litchfield was targeted for  
takeover after it failed to improve its poor performance on the 
test, which is the only measure of academic achievement under state 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are the sorts of reforms Southern governors are being  
praised for, said Mark Musick, president of the Southern Regional 
Education Board, an advisory panel to Southern governors in 16 
states including the ones Riley will visit -- Alabama, Georgia, 
Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not trying to shame schools into doing better by  
putting their names in the paper,'' Musick said. ``(Riley is) going 
to sense in these stops some feeling that we're making progress, 
that there's some determination about the direction we're moving 
in.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Hits 7-Month Low Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar hit a seven-month low against the  
surging yen, and also lost ground to the euro Tuesday as traders 
lost confidence in the U.S. currency during another turbulent day 
on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0578, up  
from $1.0462 late Monday. The dollar also was quoted at 109.59 
Japanese yen, down from 110.73. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's movements continue be ``reasonably well  
correlated'' with those of the U.S. stock and bond markets, said 
Guillermo Estebanez, currency strategist at the Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. stocks were mixed after a volatile trading day. The Dow  
Jones industrial average lost more than 80 points, its fourth 
straight day of losses, but the technology-laden Nasdaq composite 
index rose more than 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said currency traders sold dollars to purchase yen and  
euros in order to capitalize on optimism for the Japanese and 
European economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Estebanez said traders had believed the Bank of Japan would  
intervene to prop up the dollar if it fell below the 110 figure. A 
weakened dollar and a rising yen could hurt Japan's economic 
recovery by making Japanese exports more expensive to U.S. 
consumers. ``An excessive appreciation of the yen will make it 
harder for Japan to sell its goods overseas,'' Estebanez said. 
</P>
<P>
	But since the Japanese bank failed to intervene, the dollar is  
likely to fall further against the yen as traders sell U.S. 
currency to buy into Japan's recovering economy, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5136 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5306, and 1.4925 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4935. The British 
pound rose to $1.6064 from $1.5896. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8507 German 
marks, down from 1.8694; 6.2071 French francs, down from 6.2695; 
and 1,832 Italian lire, down from 1,851.

<HEADLINE> Heat, Drought Take Toll on Catfish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- The drought that has withered trees and  
crops, lowered lakes and creeks and frustrated lawn-obsessed 
homeowners has also hurt farm-raised catfish. 
</P>
<P>
	Catfish eat less -- and grow less -- when the temperature climbs  
above 90 degrees, says Gary Burtle, a University of Georgia catfish 
specialist. High temperatures also can cause outbreaks of disease, 
and excessive sunlight is dangerous, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been no catastrophic fish kills,'' Burtle said.  
``It's more of a chronic situation. We had one farmer who had been 
losing a few fish a day since June.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burtle predicts below-average production and higher prices.  
Catfish rank fifth among America's most popular fish or shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
	But Henry Gantz, president of the Catfish Institute in Belzoni,  
Miss., says that any price increase will be marginal. 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial catfish producers make sure they have wells to  
maintain water levels and equipment, such as aerators, to oxygenate 
the ponds, Burtle said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People with plenty of well water and who are careful managers  
have fewer problems,'' Burtle said. ``When you get to the small 
pond owner who may not be as intensively managing, you can have 
some problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even commercial producers are affected by the weather.  
</P>
<P>
	Burtle predicts there will be fewer catfish to market this year.  
A harvest-size catfish should weigh at least a pound, and the 
industry average is approaching 2 pounds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With catfish eating less, producers have to care for them longer  
and that raises their costs, Burtle said. Also, pond owners who 
would normally restock their ponds may be reluctant to buy more 
fish until water levels stabilize. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might see catfish filet prices increase to nearly $5 a  
pound in the grocery store,'' Burtle said. ``Normally, it sells for 
less than $4 per pound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As of August, the industry had processed 347 million pounds of  
catfish, compared with 335 million for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hopeful we'll be just ahead of last year,'' said Mike  
McCall, editor of the Catfish Journal in Jackson, Miss. ``Catfish 
farmers fight heat and oxygen problems every summer, especially in 
August.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Simmons, manager of Owens &AMP; Williams Inc., Georgia's  
largest commercial producer, said his company is having a 
productive summer, despite the drought. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have more fingerlings than we have ever had, but the fish  
are not selling,'' he said. ``A lot of the ponds are low and people 
are not buying. They're waiting on rain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's really too soon to judge the market because pond owners  
don't usually start restocking until late August and early 
September, Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens &AMP; Williams has been able to maintain normal water levels  
in its 80 ponds, occupying 300 acres near Newton and Hawkinsville, 
because they are all supplied by wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Many ponds in the Hawkinsville area are at a half or third of  
their normal levels, and fish kills are the largest in four or five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of it is just the extreme heat,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Jury To Be Picked in Dragging Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- A pool of 161 potential jurors crowded a  
courtroom today for the murder trial of a second white supremacist 
accused in the gruesome dragging death of a black man last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Russell Brewer is charged with murder in the death of  
James Byrd Jr. Lawyers will spend two weeks whittling the group to 
12. Testimony is set to begin Sept. 15 and should take about three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 161 prospective jurors who reported, 19 are black. In  
early questioning of the entire jury pool, 20 potential jurors, 
five of them black, were excused for health or legal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, wearing a coat and tie, was seated at a table facing  
away from potential jurors, who sat in the audience area of the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, 32, is the second of three men to be tried. Co-defendant  
John William King was convicted in Jasper last February and 
sentenced to death. Shawn Allen Berry is to be tried later. Both 
Brewer and Berry face a death sentence if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were accused of beating Byrd in June 1998, chaining  
him to a pickup truck and dragging him for nearly three miles 
outside Jasper, a town of 8,000 about 150 miles northeast of 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's trial was moved to the Brazos County Courthouse in  
Bryan, 150 miles west of Jasper, at the request of prosecutors who 
didn't want the defense to use a Jasper location as an issue for 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray believes King led  
the other two men to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no question that King had the charisma,'' Gray said  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gray says it was Brewer -- a member of the pro-Aryan  
Confederate Knights of America prison gang since 1995 -- who lured 
King down the path to organized hate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone had to teach Bill King,'' Gray said. That someone, he  
says, was Brewer. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy-two reporters from around the nation have been granted  
courtroom seats, indicating public interest remains strong more 
than a year and a half after the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors believe the death of Byrd, 49, was an event King and  
Brewer staged to launch their own fledgling hate group, the Texas 
Rebel Soldiers, and initiate King's friend Berry as a member. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's attorney, Doug Barlow, did not return calls from The  
Associated Press. Prosecutors are preparing for a defense similar 
to one they heard six months ago, when King's lawyers claimed their 
client joined a white supremacist prison gang to survive beatings 
or rape by black prisoners

<HEADLINE> Sex Offenders Fight Police Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- State police on Tuesday delayed the launch  
of a Web site identifying sex offenders living in Oregon after 
several offenders filed lawsuits seeking to keep their names, 
addresses and photos off the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site, due to go online Wednesday, is on hold until a  
judge rules in the case, probably by mid-September, said Lt. Bob 
Sundstrom, who oversees the state's violent offender program. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers representing at least 10 offenders asked a judge to  
block the site, calling it a violation of their rights and an 
invasion of privacy. The site is intended to notify neighbors of 
possible predators. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can bet your bottom dollar that every landlord and every  
employer will be looking through the Web page,'' said Philip Lewis, 
a lawyer representing four released sex offenders. ``If these 
people are rehabilitated, why are we doing all this to make their 
lives worse?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers faulted the Web site for not distinguishing between  
newly convicted hard-core predatory offenders and people who 
wrapped up their cases years ago for such minor misdemeanors as 
indecent exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	The names and photos of nearly all 9,000 offenders would be kept  
online until the day they die. 
</P>
<P>
	Megan's Law, signed by President Clinton in May 1996, requires  
community notification when a dangerous sex offender moves in, but 
it doesn't specify how that should be done. 
</P>
<P>
	In some states, authorities knock on doors in the sex offender's  
neighborhood, publish offenders' names in the newspaper or 
distribute fliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states already using the Internet for community  
notification include Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, North 
Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Bank of New York Reputation Defended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The chairman of the Bank of New York, in a  
strongly worded memo to employees, defended his institution's 
reputation amid allegations that it may have been used by Russian 
mobsters to launder money. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas A. Renyi said in the memo sent Monday that he was  
``deeply troubled'' by the possibility that the bank's controls may 
have been compromised. ``We will do whatever is needed to prevent 
illegal or improper activities that involve the Bank. Period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The memo, which the bank provided to The Associated Press on  
Tuesday, was sent just days after the bank dismissed a London-based 
executive who had been involved in the bank's Eastern European 
operations. Lucy Edwards, who was born in Russia, is married to a 
Russian businessman reportedly under investigation in the 
laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	In his memo, Renyi assured employees that the bank was  
cooperating with investigators, that the bank has not been accused 
with any wrongdoing, and that no funds have been lost or customer 
services interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our reputation, built on our collective hard work and sound  
business practices, is our most valuable asset. We will do 
everything in our power to protect and enhance it. We will not 
tolerate any action that tarnishes our reputation,'' Renyi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are examining allegations that as much as $10  
billion may have passed through accounts at the Bank of New York in 
a major money laundering operation involving Russian organized 
crime figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Money laundering involves moving around profits from criminal  
activities through a series of transactions until they appear to be 
gains from legitimate businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to firing Ms. Edwards, the bank has also suspended  
another executive, Natasha Kagalovsky, who supervised the bank's 
business in Eastern Europe from her post in New York. Ms. 
Kagalovsky has denied any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> MIT Student Dies From Laughing Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- An MIT junior was found dead in his dorm  
room early Tuesday after using a plastic bag to inhale laughing 
gas, campus officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Richard Guy, 22, was discovered shortly after  
midnight Monday. Guy, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was a physics 
major. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical examiner said Guy died from asphyxiation as a result  
of nitrous oxide intoxication. 
</P>
<P>
	Pure nitrous oxide dissolves in the bloodstream, pushing oxygen  
out from the blood into the lungs, depriving the brain and other 
organs of oxygen. Dentists frequently use it as a painkiller. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts Institute of Technology officials released few  
other details and did not return phone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Classes aren't scheduled to begin at MIT until Sept. 7, but  
freshmen and some upperclassmen had already moved into their rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1997, 18-year-old freshman Scott Krueger died three  
days after he was found in an alcohol-induced coma on a fraternity 
floor.

<HEADLINE> Chargers' Seau To Play Tight End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Chargers found a way to juice up  
a meaningless exhibition game by letting Junior Seau make his debut 
at tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll know when he's going in when I turn my back and I turn  
blue,'' rookie coach Mike Riley said Tuesday after saying his 
All-Pro linebacker will become the NFL's latest two-way player when 
the Chargers play host to AFC West rival Kansas City on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Seau has been dabbling at tight end since minicamps,  
Riley said a few weeks ago that he didn't have the guts yet to put 
him in. Seau told tight ends coach Paul Chryst that he wanted some 
action before the season starts, and that means now, since the 
Chargers are idle the first week of the NFL schedule and open Sept. 
19 at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to get the nerves out,'' Seau said. ``I want to  
feel the anticipation of playing both and having the mental outlook 
of what will be going on and how I will prepare differently, if 
there will be any difference. It's mainly just getting in sync 
within and being comfortable with what I've got to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With it being an exhibition game, ``a dress rehearsal is all it  
is,'' Seau said. ``We're going to hope to get out of it healthy and 
hopefully score some points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last thing the Chargers want is to lose their live-wire  
leader to injury, and are constantly reminded of the season-ending 
knee injury that New York Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn suffered 
on a kickoff return last exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also know how hard it is to say `no' to their best  
player, who originally got the idea as a way to help San Diego's 
pitiful offense. The Chargers have beefed up in the wake of a 5-11 
season by adding quarterbacks Jim Harbaugh and Erik Kramer, but the 
offense hasn't looked impressive in four exhibition losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, we haven't practiced it for four months for  
nothing,'' Seau said. ``If it was going to be thrown on the shelf, 
it would have been done three months ago. It's definitely part of 
the package and we hope to make it work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, Seau will play H-back, the hybrid tight  
end-fullback position, and will be in for 8-10 plays. Asked what 
situations Seau will be used in, Riley said: ``Safe ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By that, he meant the Chargers won't send Seau long on their  
first offensive play. He'll be used once the Chargers cross 
midfield, both as a receiver and blocker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Send him over the middle,'' running back Natrone Means joked  
in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Means, though, seemed to side with defensive coordinator Joe  
Pascale, who doesn't want the offensive reps to be too much of a 
load for Seau. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need him on defense more than we do on offense,'' Means  
said. ``But, give the man a shot. That's all he's asking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Lew Bush, who like Seau was adamant that the team  
sign a veteran quarterback in the wake of Ryan Leaf's many rookie 
meltdowns, is excited by the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever it takes to put points up, I'm with it,'' Bush said.  
``Junior's an exceptional athlete. Let him go out and make 
something happen. Even if it's just a decoy or whatever, run him up 
the field, a safety will go get a good lick on him and, touchdown 
Jeff Graham.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seau knows the Kansas City defense will be eager to come after  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a rookie out there. They know that and I'm going to have  
to take my bumps and bruises like everyone else. Believe me, I'm 
not going to run away from them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seau pumps his fists after big tackles, but claims he doesn't  
have a celebration planned in case he scores. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to run to the Gatorade bottle and get ready for  
defense,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush To Raise Nearly $50 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush's campaign will  
report raising more than $50 million by the end of September -- more 
than any presidential candidate ever has had available to seek the 
nomination, a senior official in his campaign predicted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With a half-dozen events in September, the campaign expects to  
add to the total before the Sept. 30 reporting deadline. But the 
figure is not expected to reach $60 million, one senior Bush aide 
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there are some who are talking about my capacity to  
raise money, particularly some of my opponents,'' Bush said while 
campaigning in Omaha, Neb. ``I would suggest that if you ask them, 
they would like to trade places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush raised a record $37 million through June 30 and has  
continued to take in money since then, including $250,000 Tuesday 
at a $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser in Nebraska. The campaign has 
planned fund-raisers next week in Kansas and Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Bush campaign raised about $1 million from events  
in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``The $50 million certainly would indicate that wealthy donors  
want to ride with a winner,'' said Kent Cooper of Public 
Disclosure, an Internet consulting firm. ``The aggressive nature of 
the fund-raisers indicates that he has captured the fund-raising 
arm of the Republican Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of September, expectations are that Bush will have  
raised more money than any other presidential candidate ever has, 
even when federal matching funds are figured in. Including the 
federal funds, 1996 Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole had 
$45 million to spend and President Clinton had $43 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is not accepting the federal funds, which require  
candidates to limit their spending in exchange for the money. 
Neither is publisher Steve Forbes, who is paying for much of his 
campaign out of his own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's ensuring that he will be able to compete with Steve  
Forbes, who can spend unlimited money,'' said Herbert Alexander, 
professor emeritus of political science at the University of 
Southern California. ``He won't be outspent and he won't rub 
against the limits. It's perfectly logical for Bush to follow this 
route.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said Tuesday that he didn't know how much money he had  
raised, except to say ``it's a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
campaign will report more than $50 million in contributions Sept. 
30.

	Spokeswoman Mindy Tucker refused to comment on Bush's  
fund-raising totals, saying only that the campaign would release 
its figures on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's opponents and their spokesmen said they were long  
resigned to the Texas governor vacuuming up most of the available 
cash, and him breaking the $50 million barrier doesn't change 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in New Hampshire, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he  
was raising enough money to compete with Bush but nowhere near as 
much as the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I look at the money Governor Bush has raised, I talk to  
my staff and say, 'Remember the words of Chairman Mao, who said 
it's always the darkest before it's black,''' McCain quipped. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have to outspend him; we have to out-idea him,''  
Forbes spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said. ``The more this race 
is pushed into an issues-agenda race, the more Gov. Bush is on 
Steve Forbes' turf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This simply confirms the notion that this is a very tight  
fund-raising environment,'' said Jonathan Baron, a spokesman for 
former Vice President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our assumption has always been we won't financially be able to  
catch up to George Bush, but money alone does not win elections, as 
John Connally, Phil Gramm and Ross Perot can attest,'' said Ari 
Fleischer, a spokesman for Elizabeth Dole.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Steelmakers Appeal Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Three major Japanese steelmakers have lodged an  
appeal in the United States against the Commerce Department over an 
anti-dumping measure, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon Steel Corp., Japan's largest steelmaker, and NKK Corp.  
appealed to the U.S. Court of International Trade on Tuesday, after 
Kawasaki Steel Corp. filed with the same court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taking action since the anti-dumping investigation by  
the U.S. Commerce Department has been conducted under an unfair 
procedure,'' said Nippon Steel spokesman Takashi Kanke. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department in late April determined that Japanese  
steel companies were engaged in illegal steel dumping -- selling 
abroad at less than home-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled in favor  
of the Commerce Department's position, allowing the United States 
to impose tariffs of up to 67 percent on hot-rolled carbon steel, a 
widely used product. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry has filed dumping complaints against  
Japanese and other competitors over eight different steel products. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the U.S. International Trade Commission  
ruled that steel beams from Japan and South Korea are being dumped 
on the U.S. markets at less than fair value. 
</P>
<P>
	That ruling clears the way for the Commerce Department to  
continue its investigation into the case. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the Commerce Department found preliminary evidence that  
Japan and five other countries have been selling steel plates in 
the United States at an unfairly low price compared with their 
domestic markets.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Most College Athletes Hazed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers were stunned enough to learn that  
80 percent of college athletes are hazed. Even more surprising is 
the list of sports in which athletes are most at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Swimming, diving, soccer and lacrosse topped a nationwide hazing  
survey released Monday by Alfred University. Track, fencing and 
golf were at the bottom. The size of the school didn't matter, with 
Division III schools not far behind Division I schools in most 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Division I scholarship athletes in big-revenue sports,  
they were more likely to be subject to alcohol-related hazing. 
Otherwise, the playing field was found to be more or less level 
across the board. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a really astonishing thing to us,'' said Nadine  
Hoover, principal investigator for the National Survey of 
Initiation Rites and Athletics, ``because we expected to find 
places where this was much more prevalent. There is no significant 
difference between divisions or levels of teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study, conducted with the cooperation of the NCAA, was the  
first attempt to gauge the hazing problem on a national basis. The 
upstate New York university surveyed 10,000 student-athletes, 3,000 
coaches and more than 1,000 other athletic officials from NCAA 
colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
	Examples of hazing ranged from criminal or dangerous acts, such  
as kidnappings and destruction of property, to questionable acts 
like yelling and cursing at freshmen or forcing them to wear 
embarrassing clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty percent of the athletes who responded said they took part  
in criminal, dangerous and-or alcohol-related hazing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's appalling what's going on,'' said Ron Stratten, the  
NCAA's vice president for education services. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found men were more at risk than women, and that  
hazing was more likely in the East or South, and on rural or 
residential campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find the results of our study on hazing to be horrifying,''  
Alfred University president Edward Coll said. ``It's pervasive. 
It's dangerous, and it is behavior that is forced upon student 
athletes as the price of admission to a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coll said he asked for the study after criminal charges were  
filed last year against four Alfred football players following a 
party at which freshmen allegedly were tied together and forced to 
drink alcohol or water until they vomited. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Coll said his university has taken a zero-tolerance  
policy toward hazing in athletics and called on other schools to do 
the same. He said coaches specifically need to stop ignoring the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the coaches turn a blind eye toward it because many of  
them don't think supervising their student-athletes outside their 
practice or game-day procedures is a part of their 
responsibility,'' Coll said. ``I think this is an issue we need to 
address to let coaches know that we do expect some accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches have a specific role to fulfill here, whether they  
like it or not,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stratten said the NCAA has planned no specific legislation in  
response to the study, but will address the issue with the 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to raise the bar with regard to our knowledge of  
this issue,'' Stratten said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study defined hazing as ``any activity expected of someone  
joining a group that humiliates, degrades, abuses or endangers, 
regardless of the person's willingness to participate. This does 
not include activities such as rookies carrying the balls, team 
parties with community games, or going out with your teammates, 
unless an atmosphere of humiliation, degradation, abuse or danger 
arises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under this definition, only 12 percent of athletes said they had  
been hazed. However, when asked about specific activities, the 
figure rose to 79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also explored ways for schools to stop hazing.  
Recommended solutions include written antihazing policies, more 
coach involvement and the development of positive, team-sponsored 
initiation events that could take the place of private ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not address the causes of hazing, but Coll said  
the answer lies in tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hazing exists because it was done before,'' he said. ``That's  
the only logical explanation I've ever had for Greek (fraternity) 
hazing. The sophomores and juniors do it because it was done to 
them when they were freshmen.''

	Stocks Close Mixed; Dow Down 84.85  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as a report of continued  
growth in the manufacturing sector ignited fears of inflation and 
hurt blue-chip companies. But technology stocks, benefiting from a 
wave of new deals and products, rose. The Dow Jones industrial 
average ended down 84.85 at 10,829.28. Earlier in the session, the 
Dow was off as much as 132 points, a dip large enough to spur some 
buying by bargain hunters and computer-driven trading programs, 
analysts said. Broader stock indicators were mixed, with the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index up 25.13 at 2,737.82.

	Economic Reports Are Mixed  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence fell for the second straight  
month in August as interest rates rose, while economic activity in 
the manufacturing sector grew for the seventh consecutive month, 
according to two private reports released today. The Conference 
Board said its consumer confidence index, which measures consumers' 
likeliness to spend, edged down 0.4 of a point, less than analysts 
expected, to 135.8 from a revised 136.2 in July. Separately, the 
National Association of Purchasing Management said its index 
measuring industrial activity rose to 54.2 percent, up from 53.4 in 
July. A measure of inflation, which tracks prices paid by industry 
for raw materials and supplies, also rose. The purchasing 
executives report had been scheduled for tomorrow, but the figures 
were mistakenly released today, the group said. 

</P>
<P>
	European Stocks Close Lower  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks fell to their lowest point in a  
week and a half today, driven by weakness in the bond market 
hurting insurers and a decline in pharmaceutical shares headed by 
SmithKline Beecham. Allianz AG, the biggest stock in the Dow Jones 
Stoxx Insurance index, closed with a loss of 7.30 euros, at 247.00 
euros, while in London, Allied Zurich was the worst blue-chip 
performer, with a loss of 45.5 pence to 760.5 pence. Banks and 
insurance companies hold large bond portfolios and are more 
sensitive to rising interest rates. SmithKline led the drop in 
European pharmaceutical stocks after the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration requested modifications to its license application 
for Bexxar leukemia treatment. The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 
European companies fell 5.89 points, or 1.9 percent, to close at 
308.69. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 297 companies 
in countries that joined the single currency, closed down 5.89 
points at 323.44.

the world's first desktop supercomputer, its new G4 model for 
professionals, in an attempt to extend the company's technological 
and financial rebound. ``This is the most powerful personal 
computer ever brought to market,'' said Apple interim CEO Steve 
Jobs today during his keynote address at the Seybold publishing 
conference. Heartened investors pushed shares of Apple up 3 3/16 to 
65 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The new computers, powered by chips 
made by Apple, Motorola Inc. and IBM, cost between $1,600 and 
$3,500.

	American Airlines Absorbs Reno

	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines absorbed Reno Air  
Inc. today with little effect on the schedule of the nation's 
second-largest carrier despite the airline's inability to reach 
agreement about the deal with its pilots. As part of the 
transition, white Reno jets sported American decals and airport 
signs were changed over in the middle of the night. The purchase of 
tiny Reno has been a sore point between American's parent company, 
AMR Corp., and its pilots, many of whom called in sick to show 
displeasure with the company's dealings. The sickout was halted by 
federal judge.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Child car seats take on a new look starting  
tomorrow, when stricter head protection standards take effect. That 
means most seats will come equipped with a tether strap that 
anchors the top of the seat more securely so children move less in 
a crash. The change is the first phase of a three-year federal plan 
to create a universal, easy-to-use child seating system. The goal 
is to eliminate the confusion among parents that results in 
incorrect installation of up to 80 percent of car seats.

	Amana Recalls Over 5,000 Gas Ovens  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amana Appliances is recalling more than 5,000  
gas-fueled, down-draft ovens that have a faulty lock. The oven can 
open during the self-clean cycle, exposing people to high 
temperatures, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said today. No 
injuries have been reported. The commission said customers should 
stop using the self-cleaning feature but can use the oven for 
cooking.

	Allergic Reaction Kits Recalled  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American Home Products is recalling hundreds of  
allergic reaction kits in North America because the epinephrine 
syringes in them may not work. Epinephrine, which increases blood 
flow and promotes breathing, is used to treat anaphylactic shock 
and asthma attacks. For American Home, which faces legal problems 
from its diet drugs and Norplant contraceptive device, the recall 
is the latest setback. American Home's Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories 
division said it is voluntarily recalling Epinephrine Injection, 
USP1:1000 in 1 mL Tubex syringe. The company said it's taking the 
action after observing discolored samples in routine 
quality-control tests. A few of the discolored samples were found 
to be less potent than they should be.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clothing designer GUESS? is recalling more

the front. The liquid contains a petroleum distillate that can be 
harmful if ingested, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said 
Tuesday. No injuries have been reported.

	Japanese Wary of The Pill  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- By Thursday, Japanese women will at last have the  
pill -- the convenient, effective birth control that has been 
available to women elsewhere for four decades. But no rush by 
Japanese women to take it is expected. In Japan's male-dominated 
society, major obstacles remain among both men and women to the 
pill's social acceptance. Despite gains in the workplace and 
society, women who take initiative -- especially about their 
sexuality -- are frowned upon in Japan. That attitude was evident 
during the pill's nine-year struggle against opposition in the 
government and among conservatives who thought it would erode 
morals. The pill finally was approved in June.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Wildfires Near Lake Resorts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE ARROWHEAD, Calif. (AP) -- The biggest of the giant wildfires  
burning in the West came within miles of lake resorts high in the 
mountains Tuesday after destroying a dozen homes in the Mojave 
Desert below. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50,000-acre blaze chewed through dense stands of tall trees  
on 8,000-foot peaks in the San Bernardino Mountains, and residents 
of the areas around Lake Arrowhead and Big Bear Lake nervously 
watched billowing plumes of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``My house is right over this ridge, and if those flames come  
much closer I'm getting my wife and my kids in my car and we're 
getting out of here,'' said Dick Solter, a Los Angeles man who has 
a vacation home at Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire, which was only 10 percent contained, was the largest  
of the blazes being battled by more than 9,000 firefighters in 
California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	A 40,000-acre blaze started by a downed power line had charred  
miles of grass in southern Idaho, five miles from the Snake River 
town of Glenns Ferry. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lake Arrowhead, a group of people cried and hugged as they  
stood atop a dam and watched helicopters repeatedly dip buckets 
into tiny Papoose Lake and roar off to drop the water two miles 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Restaurant worker Karen Hanson said she hadn't seen anything  
like it in 26 years at Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I live on the other side of the lake so I'm not worried about  
the flames getting to me,'' she said. ``What hurts me is seeing all 
of this wildlife destroyed. There is some really old growth around 
Arrowhead and Big Bear and if it catches I don't know how they'll 
put it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters were not sure where the fire was going. Even though  
the biggest flames were high in the mountains, there still was 
concern for homes on the fringes of the desert communities of Apple 
Valley and Lucerne Valley, where scorched earth smoldered. 
</P>
<P>
	``The winds are very erratic,'' said Kathy Saindon, a San  
Bernardino County fire spokeswoman. ``They blow northwest one 
minute and southeast the next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 people voluntarily left homes down in the desert, but  
by evening there were no evacuation orders in Arrowhead or Big Bear 
Lake, seven miles from the nearest flames.

<HEADLINE> Officer Testifies About Jim Brown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jim Brown's wife told police responding to a  
911 call that he threatened to break her neck and bashed her car 
with a shovel, an officer testified Tuesday at the football Hall of 
Famer's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Monique Brown was upset and had been crying when police arrived  
at the couple's Hollywood Hills home on June 15, Officer Fernie 
Montesdeoca told a jury at the Municipal Court in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defendant had threatened to kill her by snapping her  
neck,'' Montesdeoca said Monique Brown told him. 
</P>
<P>
	``She stated there were prior domestic violence incidents during  
their two-year marriage. She never reported any to the police,'' 
Montesdeoca said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors played Monique Brown's 911 call, in which she  
claimed Brown threatened to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 63, has pleaded innocent to one count of making terrorist  
threats and one count of vandalism, both misdemeanors. He could 
face 18 months in jail if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a record of arrests dating to 1965 for alleged violence  
against women, but he either was acquitted or the charges were 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	The city attorney's office is prosecuting Brown even though  
Monique Brown, 25, has recanted her story. The couple's attorney 
has said she made up the threats because she was frustrated and 
believed her husband was having an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown has alleged that police forced his wife to make the  
allegations and that they targeted him because he is a black 
community leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems more a case about prosecuting her than me. She's been  
doing a great job,'' Brown, holding hands with his wife, said as he 
arrived at court. 
</P>
<P>
	He was greeted by about 25 sign-waving supporters.  
</P>
<P>
	``Stop the prosecution of black celebrities. White celebrities  
are not targeted even though they are caught red-handed,'' one sign 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Montesdeoca testified that 18 officers responded to the 911 call  
Monique Brown made from a neighbor's house. She told them that 
Brown had a handgun in the house and had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	When Brown did not answer a telephone call to the home, officers  
surrounded the front, armed with a shotgun, a gun that shoots bean 
bags and a Taser stun gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Six officers went to the door and knocked. Brown answered.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was calm'' and was arrested peacefully, Montesdeoca said.  
</P>
<P>
	Officers found a loaded handgun, a box of ammunition and two  
knives in a bedroom drawer. In the garage, they found a shovel and 
a battered white Honda Accord. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the windows had been busted out and there were dents all  
over the vehicle.'' Montesdeoca said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer carried the shovel to the witness stand and it was  
introduced into evidence along with photos of Monique Brown's 
damaged car. 
</P>
<P>
	On cross-examination, defense attorney William Graysen asked the  
officer about the police response to the 911 call. 
</P>
<P>
	``You were anticipating the worst?'' he asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``We always do, sir,'' Montesdeoca replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Questioned later by prosecutor Grace Kim Lee, Montesdeoca said  
officers requested a supervisor on the scene to ensure things were 
handled properly. 
</P>
<P>
	That is unusual in domestic conflict cases.  
</P>
<P>
	``We called (the supervisor) because he was possibly a  
barricaded suspect, and because he was Jim Brown,'' the officer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Jerry Janecek testified that Monique Brown seemed  
``pretty comfortable'' as she and her English Labrador retriever 
were driven to the police station in the back of a patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was laughing and playing with her dog'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	After being interviewed by detectives, she was returned to her  
home, where she packed a few things, got into the smashed Honda and 
drove off, telling officers she would go to a hotel, Janecek 
testified.

<HEADLINE> FBI Seeks Independent Waco Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- FBI Director Louis Freeh is pushing for an  
independent investigator to head the probe into why it took his 
agency six years to acknowledge using incendiary tear gas canisters 
in the waning hours of the Branch Davidian siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid concern over the appearance of the FBI and Justice  
Department investigating themselves, Freeh has told Attorney 
General Janet Reno she should appoint an outsider to head the 
inquiry, an FBI official confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the FBI has identified 40 agents who could do the  
investigative legwork, Freeh is supporting a probe without FBI 
involvement, spokesman Tron Brekke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recognizing that the agency's credibility has been damaged,  
Brekke added: ``We would welcome a qualified group of (independent) 
investigators to do that investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno was said by Justice sources to be searching for a qualified  
outsider but had reached no final decision Tuesday, said Justice 
spokesman Myron Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is still working through her options,'' Marlin said. ``She  
has pledged to get to the bottom of this, and that's what she will 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional committees also have begun inquiries of their own  
and some are planning hearings this fall. The latest round of 
scrutiny into the deadly, 51-day siege near Waco, Texas, was 
triggered by the FBI's about-face last week after claiming for 
years that only non-burning tear gas was used. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidian leader David Koresh and about 80 followers died during  
the April 19, 1993 inferno. The FBI and Reno have said there is no 
evidence to suggest the blaze was set by the tear gas grenades, 
which were lobbed at a concrete bunker 40 yards from the wooden 
compound a few hours before the fire erupted. 
</P>
<P>
	Mindful that 1995 Waco hearings degenerated into intense  
partisan bickering, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, 
R-Ill., is mulling a proposal to create a joint House-Senate 
commission in place of hearings by his panel, an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been no final decision that's been made, but we're  
trying to work our way through this and find some solution that 
might remove this entire affair from the political fever swamp,'' 
said Sam Stratman, a spokesman for the House panel. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint commission would have its own budget and investigative  
authority and likely would follow the of other congressional 
commissions: Its members would be appointed by House and Senate 
leaders from both parties but would not necessarily be lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, chairman of the House Government Reform  
Committee, which also is investigating the matter, said creating a 
commission could take several months. 
</P>
<P>
	``By that time, I hope to have a lot of this information in hand  
and have a lot of the answers,'' Burton, R-Ind., said on CNN's 
``Late Edition Primetime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His committee is sending subpoenas this week to the Justice  
Department, the FBI and the Defense Department. Burton said the 
committee will also issue a subpoena Wednesday to the White House 
about any contacts between officials there and those on the ground 
in Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any reason why they shouldn't comply if they have  
nothing to hide,'' Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his committee's investigators are analyzing a 5-year-old  
document received by Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston that 
discusses the use of ``military gas'' by the FBI on the last day of 
the siege. The Dallas Morning News reported that Johnston was 
concerned because the three-page document included handwritten 
notations suggesting it be kept from anyone outside the Justice 
Department's legal staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., and others are demanding more information  
about the role played by the Army's secretive Delta Force during 
the FBI operation. Only under tightly proscribed rules is the 
military allowed to participate in domestic law enforcement 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials have said three Army special forces officers  
were at the scene, but were there only as observers. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton said his committee is subpoenaing members of the Delta  
Force who may have been in the Waco area and a CIA agent who 
supposedly has spoken to Delta Force members about their possible 
involvement in the siege.

<HEADLINE> Farmers OK Milk Pricing Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) -- Dairy farmers have overwhelmingly approved a  
plan to overhaul the way milk is priced around the country, a move 
that could lead to lower prices at the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Depression, the federal government has set a minimum  
price that dairy farmers must receive for their milk. But it was 
based on how far a farmer is from Eau Claire, Wis. -- the further 
away from Eau Claire, the more money could be charged. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the system was an incentive to establish milk  
producers outside of Wisconsin, when the state was the main 
supplier for the country's milk. The aim was to ensure all regions 
had sufficient supplies of drinking milk, but today the system is 
considered by many to be an anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
	In a referendum held between Aug. 2 and Aug. 6, dairy producers  
gave near-unanimous approval to a reform developed by the U.S. 
Agriculture Department to smooth regional disparities in prices 
that farmers receive for milk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a matter of accepting something they didn't like or  
accepting something that could be worse,'' said Ed Jesse, an 
economist at the University of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Congress scheduled the current system for elimination  
and ordered USDA to come up with a new plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The approved reform scraps Eau Claire as a factor and  
consolidates the 31 regions for setting milk prices into 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Kozak, chief executive officer for the National Milk  
Producers Federation, said the referendum was not an endorsement 
for the change and it passed with ``great reluctance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His group estimates farmers would lose $200 million a year.  
</P>
<P>
	But Bob Prahl, who milks 50 cows in his 250-acre farm near  
Wausau, said he figured the change might boost the price for his 
raw milk by 2 cents per 100 pounds, earning him about $200 extra a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's pretty much insignificant,'' he said. ``But it is a  
positive move. The dollars are not the issue. It is the fact we 
have shrunk down the market orders and created a little bit more of 
a uniform pricing system. It is a step in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Congress allows the reform to take effect Oct. 1, the change  
would save consumers somewhere between $50 million and $130 million 
a year, economist Tom Cox said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking that down for consumers means that a family that drinks  
three to four gallons of milk a week would save almost a dime, said 
Cox, a professor of agriculture and economics at the University of 
Wisconsin in Madison. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you really going to feel nine cents a week?'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, completely deregulating the system so that the  
market sets the price for raw milk, as some farmers want, would 
lower the price of a store-bought gallon of milk between 15 to 20 
cents a gallon, saving consumers about $1 billion a year, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	The thinking behind deregulation is that while some farmers  
would go out of business, those that remain would be able to make a 
profit without government intervention. Deregulation has not been 
formally proposed.

<HEADLINE> D-Backs Acquire Harris From Colorado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks picked up an experienced  
left-handed hitter for the final month of their playoff drive 
Tuesday, acquiring utility infielder Lenny Harris from the Colorado 
Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, the Rockies got 20-year-old minor-league second  
baseman Belvani Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, who has played all four infield positions and the  
outfield in his 12 years in the major leagues, is hitting .297 this 
season. He has a major league best 20 pinch hits this year, the 
latest one a double in Colorado's 11-8 loss to Pittsburgh on Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good addition for us,'' Arizona manager Buck Showalter  
said. ``He's been in a lot of wars. He's got a great reputation in 
baseball. He'll fit right in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 34, is first among all active players and eighth on the  
career list with 109 pinch hits. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Harris, the Diamondbacks placed shortstop Andy  
Fox on the disabled list, retroactive to Aug. 28, with strained 
ribs. Arizona also purchased the contract of outfielder Turner Ward 
from Triple-A Tucson and placed him on the 15-day disabled list 
with tendinitis in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	The DL moves came just before Tuesday night's deadline for teams  
to establish their 25-man playoff rosters. Players on the disabled 
list also are eligible for the playoffs, leaving the Diamondbacks 
room to maneuver later. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona had an 8 1/2-game lead over second-place San Francisco in  
the NL West going into Tuesday night's action. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris has a career .272 batting average with Cincinnati, Los  
Angeles, the New York Mets and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's capable of playing third base, second base, first base,  
shortstop and corner outfield,'' Showalter said. ``He's even caught 
a little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez was the second-leading hitter in the Class A California  
League with a .333 average for High Desert. 
</P>
<P>
	``Arizona needed a left-handed hitter and were willing to pay  
the price,'' Colorado director of business administration Tony 
Siegle said. ``We looked over their organization and got the best 
player available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies filled Harris' roster spot by recalling second  
baseman Chris Sexton from Triple-A Colorado Springs.

<HEADLINE>  Browns' Chris Spielman Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Chris Spielman arrived at the Cleveland  
Browns' training facility at 6 a.m., got taped and headed straight 
to the weight room. 
</P>
<P>
	When you're Spielman, that's what you do every day. Why stop on  
the day you're announcing your retirement from pro football? 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, the NFL's most intense middle linebacker, who  
postponed his comeback from neck surgery a year ago to care for his 
family, announced his retirement Monday, just two days after a 
violent hit left him momentarily paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearful that another jarring hit could do irreparable damage to  
his spinal cord, doctors urged Spielman to retire. And, reluctant 
at first, he heeded their advice and walked away from the game 
while he still could. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to accept your mortality as a player,'' he said. ``My  
mortality is today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman announced he was leaving the game he loved, the same  
way he played it: direct and head on. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a football player, you're trained to feel invincible,''  
said Spielman, who sat out the '98 season to be with his wife, 
Stefanie, and their two children as she battled breast cancer. ``I 
would love to keep playing, but I couldn't jeopardize my arms and 
legs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman never wanted to quit, not as he fought to get the  
feeling back in his body, and not even when doctors told him to 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Without ever uttering the word ``retired,'' Spielman, with  
Stefanie sitting at his side, ended his stellar 10-year career in 
the same state where he was a household name before leaving high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been very fortunate to be an NFL player,'' he said.  
``That's the hard part, to wake up tomorrow morning and know I'm 
not an NFL player anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, who underwent neck fusion surgery in 1997, took a  
crushing, blindside hit from Bears center Casey Wiegmann on 
Saturday night while defending a screen pass in Cleveland's 
exhibition win over Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Face down in the grass, his body tingling from head to toe,  
Spielman said he had one thought: ``Get up and get the play 
called,'' he said. ``But I couldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman eventually made it to the sideline with some help. He  
was immediately taken for an MRI, the second he needed this summer 
following a high-impact collision. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had that first hit in training camp and that scared me,''  
said his brother, Rick, the Bears' director of pro personnel, who 
was in St. Louis that night. ``I told him, `One day you're going to 
take a hit and you're not going to be able to get up.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the second scare, and doctors telling him to stop,  
Spielman's stubbornness wouldn't let him. On Sunday morning, he 
walked into Browns coach Chris Palmer's office and said: ``I'm not 
retiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But after consulting with his family, Spielman came to one  
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until you have pure medical evidence in front of you, as a  
player your mentality is, `I'll beat this,''' he said. ``But as 
they say in football, the films don't lie, and here the images of 
the MRI don't lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And as Spielman already showed, he has his priorities in line.  
</P>
<P>
	``He told me his daughter was at the game and she's 4, 4 1/2,''  
Rick Spielman said. ``She knows that Daddy has a bad neck. When she 
saw him get hit, she just started crying and later she asked him, 
`Daddy, if you're in a wheelchair, does that mean we can't go 
swimming anymore?' That's just the nail in the coffin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the injury that forced him to retire is unrelated to  
the fusion surgery that interrupted Spielman's career in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Two vertebrae in his back are narrowing closer to his spinal  
cord, and each time he took a solid hit, he got a tingling 
sensation. He had been having bouts with numbness during training 
camp, but didn't tell anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said Spielman has been offered a coaching position with  
the Browns, but had not decided whether to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, 33, was regarded as the heart and soul of the  
expansion Browns before they even played their first regular-season 
game. He joined the team in February, grateful for a second chance 
and honored to be doing it at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me as a northeast Ohio kid to play my last game on the  
Cleveland Browns field, in front of Cleveland Browns fans, in a 
Cleveland Browns helmet. You couldn't write it any better,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Browns will go on without him. Rookie Wali Rainer will  
take over Spielman's inside spot with the starting defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``He taught me so much in just a short period of time,'' Rainer  
said. ``To play every down as if it was your last whether in 
practice or a game. I thought I was an intense player. Then I met 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Considered too small to make it in the NFL, the 6-foot,  
247-pound Spielman slipped to the 28th overall pick in the 1988 
draft, when he was selected by Detroit. He made the Pro Bowl three 
consecutive seasons (1989-91), and then again in '94. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the '95 season, he signed as a free agent with the  
Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Always around the football, Spielman seemed to be in on every  
tackle. And when he wasn't planting his face mask in a running 
back's chest, he was causing some kind of havoc near the line of 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Stefanie if I ever, ever got helped off the football  
field, that would be the end of my career,'' he said. ``I would do 
anything to crawl off, cartwheel off, skip off. That's the first 
time (Saturday night) I can remember that I was ever helped off the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It turned out to be true. So I stand by my code.''

<HEADLINE> Camp Specializes in Ethnic Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSONBURG, N.J. (AP) -- Alec Powell broke boards during tae  
kwon do, dished up Thai chicken with satay during cooking class and 
sang Korean grace before each meal. But the best thing about summer 
camp for this 10-year-old? ``It has people just like you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holt Heritage Camp provides the usual swimming and singing  
around the fire of sleep-away summer camp, but most importantly, it 
lets people like Alec learn about the cultures of their birth 
countries and meet others who were adopted from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	For once, children like Emily Goldberg, Christine Van Hise, Mike  
Viscardo and Alison Zukowski don't have to explain why their names 
don't match their faces. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't ask you stupid questions here,'' Alec said,  
recalling a lifetime of queries, usually from staring strangers 
trying to compare his Korean features with those of his white 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Campers, who range from 9 to 15, are grouped by age. At any  
given time, one set may be outside playing mook chee bah, a Korean 
variation of scissors, rock and paper in which children pair up 
with partners and contort their bodies in shapes according to the 
word being called out. 
</P>
<P>
	Another group of campers may be inside the mess hall measuring  
soy sauce for the bul go gi, or Korean barbecue, they are learning 
to make. A third group may be across the room gluing glitter, 
sequins, feathers and string to Indonesian masks. 
</P>
<P>
	Alec, from Hamilton, N.J., picked tae kwon do over fan dancing  
and Korean language class as his elective. He began to regret his 
decision toward the end of the week when his instructor punished 
him and others for chitchatting during class. The punishment: 10 
pushups. 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer you guys talk, the longer we do this,'' instructor  
Brian Parise barked, shortly before he ordered them to do five 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	Conversations among campers aren't different from others their  
age -- summer romances, make-up, cars -- except when the topic turns 
to adoption. Questions then turn to how old they were when they 
were adopted or whether they plan to visit their birth countries. 
The answers vary -- some desperately want to visit, and have even 
made plans to do so, while others have no interest in such a trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all of the campers were adopted from Asia -- more than 90  
percent are Korean, said Korean-born camp director Todd Kwapisz of 
Eugene, Ore., where Holt International is based. Others were 
adopted from China, India, Vietnam, the Philippines and one from 
Romania. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian influence at Heritage Camp is noticeable in the names  
campers pick for their cabins: Seoulful Sweeties, Mocha Men, 
Kimchee Kuties, Sarang Sisters, Biggie's Buddha Boys and Pretty Fly 
for Asian Guys. 
</P>
<P>
	The camp is one of three organized by Holt International, an  
adoption agency, and is similar to more than a dozen other culture 
camps nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	It provides a ``safe environment'' for people who grew up with  
similar experiences, said Katie Cieplik, a 22-year-old former 
camper from Parsippany, N.J.,who has returned the past four summers 
as a counselor. Prejudices toward Asian-Americans sometimes feel 
worse for adopted children because their parents usually cannot 
relate to taunts about ethnic features or people who question their 
identity as Americans, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cieplik said her first culture camp, back in 1987, boosted her  
self-confidence and pride in her Korean heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learn more about myself in the five days I'm here than the  
other 360 days of the year,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	All counselors at Heritage Camp are adopted. Most of them, like  
Cieplik, attended a cultural camp when they were younger. 
</P>
<P>
	Counselor Phil Golowatsch, 23, of Philadelphia, has a different  
situation from most, in that both of his adoptive parents are 
foreign-born -- his mother is from Brazil and his father is from 
Poland. Growing up, he felt more comfortable with his parent's 
cultures than his own. And, as a child, he often felt ashamed of 
being Korean and found it difficult relating to other Asians. 
</P>
<P>
	``You think you're alone,'' he said. Heritage Camp provided him  
with ``the comfort of knowing that someone else is going through 
similar experiences.'' It also led him to his girlfriend, Shelah 
Reber, another Korean-born adoptee and fellow counselor who now 
lives in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Camp concludes with a dinner of multiethnic dishes and a variety  
of skits and dances for the parents, who arrive to find their 
children dressed identically in navy blue T-shirts. Unlike other 
times they would pick up their child at school or a friend's house, 
many parents found it difficult to single out their child. 
</P>
<P>
	``At home, I could pick out the brown haired girl in the pool --  
that was my Kate, no problem,'' said Cami Reynolds of Philadelphia. 
``Here, I couldn't spot her at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, her 10-year-old daughter found her, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``She goes, 'Hey, Mom. These people look like me. You're the one  
who looks different here.'''

<HEADLINE> Mexico Bank Aid Costs Exeeed Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The cost of Mexico's bank bailout will be  
higher than previously estimated, reaching the equivalent of 21 
percent of the country's gross domestic product, according to 
ratings agency Standard and Poor's. 
</P>
<P>
	S&AMP;P on Tuesday estimated the cost of the bailout at $105.1  
billion. That figure doesn't include the amount the government can 
recover from the sale of assets seized from failed banks, but S&AMP;P 
estimated these recoveries will be less than $10.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates for the bank bailout have varied. The government has  
put the amount at $58.7 billion and an independent auditor hired by 
Congress said in July it was $67.3 billion.

	Mexico's banking industry, poorly regulated by the government  
after they had been privatized in the early 1990s, nearly collapsed 
during the peso crisis of 1994-95. With the currency falling, 
interest rates soared and debtors were unable to pay back loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank deposit protection agency assumed most of the banks'  
bad loans. Congress last year approved President Ernesto Zedillo's 
proposal to have the government formally assume the debts as part 
of an overhaul of the banking system. Opposition politicians argued 
that Mexico's mostly poor taxpayers were being asked to bail out 
rich bankers.

<HEADLINE>  Browns' Chris Spielman Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Chris Spielman arrived at the Cleveland  
Browns' training facility at 6 a.m., got taped and headed straight 
to the weight room. 
</P>
<P>
	When you're Spielman, that's what you do every day. Why stop on  
the day you're announcing your retirement from pro football? 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, the NFL's most intense middle linebacker, who  
postponed his comeback from neck surgery a year ago to care for his 
family, announced his retirement Monday, just two days after a 
violent hit left him momentarily paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearful that another jarring hit could do irreparable damage to  
his spinal cord, doctors urged Spielman to retire. And, reluctant 
at first, he heeded their advice and walked away from the game 
while he still could. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to accept your mortality as a player,'' he said. ``My  
mortality is today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman announced he was leaving the game he loved, the same  
way he played it: direct and head on. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a football player, you're trained to feel invincible,''  
said Spielman, who sat out the '98 season to be with his wife, 
Stefanie, and their two children as she battled breast cancer. ``I 
would love to keep playing, but I couldn't jeopardize my arms and 
legs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman never wanted to quit, not as he fought to get the  
feeling back in his body, and not even when doctors told him to 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Without ever uttering the word ``retired,'' Spielman, with  
Stefanie sitting at his side, ended his stellar 10-year career in 
the same state where he was a household name before leaving high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been very fortunate to be an NFL player,'' he said.  
``That's the hard part, to wake up tomorrow morning and know I'm 
not an NFL player anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, who underwent neck fusion surgery in 1997, took a  
crushing, blindside hit from Bears center Casey Wiegmann on 
Saturday night while defending a screen pass in Cleveland's 
exhibition win over Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Face down in the grass, his body tingling from head to toe,  
Spielman said he had one thought: ``Get up and get the play 
called,'' he said. ``But I couldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman eventually made it to the sideline with some help. He  
was immediately taken for an MRI, the second he needed this summer 
following a high-impact collision. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had that first hit in training camp and that scared me,''  
said his brother, Rick, the Bears' director of pro personnel, who 
was in St. Louis that night. ``I told him, `One day you're going to 
take a hit and you're not going to be able to get up.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the second scare, and doctors telling him to stop,  
Spielman's stubbornness wouldn't let him. On Sunday morning, he 
walked into Browns coach Chris Palmer's office and said: ``I'm not 
retiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But after consulting with his family, Spielman came to one  
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until you have pure medical evidence in front of you, as a  
player your mentality is, `I'll beat this,''' he said. ``But as 
they say in football, the films don't lie, and here the images of 
the MRI don't lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And as Spielman already showed, he has his priorities in line.  
</P>
<P>
	``He told me his daughter was at the game and she's 4, 4 1/2,''  
Rick Spielman said. ``She knows that Daddy has a bad neck. When she 
saw him get hit, she just started crying and later she asked him, 
`Daddy, if you're in a wheelchair, does that mean we can't go 
swimming anymore?' That's just the nail in the coffin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the injury that forced him to retire is unrelated to  
the fusion surgery that interrupted Spielman's career in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Two vertebrae in his back are narrowing closer to his spinal  
cord, and each time he took a solid hit, he got a tingling 
sensation. He had been having bouts with numbness during training 
camp, but didn't tell anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said Spielman has been offered a coaching position with  
the Browns, but had not decided whether to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, 33, was regarded as the heart and soul of the  
expansion Browns before they even played their first regular-season 
game. He joined the team in February, grateful for a second chance 
and honored to be doing it at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me as a northeast Ohio kid to play my last game on the  
Cleveland Browns field, in front of Cleveland Browns fans, in a 
Cleveland Browns helmet. You couldn't write it any better,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Browns will go on without him. Rookie Wali Rainer will  
take over Spielman's inside spot with the starting defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``He taught me so much in just a short period of time,'' Rainer  
said. ``To play every down as if it was your last whether in 
practice or a game. I thought I was an intense player. Then I met 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Considered too small to make it in the NFL, the 6-foot,  
247-pound Spielman slipped to the 28th overall pick in the 1988 
draft, when he was selected by Detroit. He made the Pro Bowl three 
consecutive seasons (1989-91), and then again in '94. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the '95 season, he signed as a free agent with the  
Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Always around the football, Spielman seemed to be in on every  
tackle. And when he wasn't planting his face mask in a running 
back's chest, he was causing some kind of havoc near the line of 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Stefanie if I ever, ever got helped off the football  
field, that would be the end of my career,'' he said. ``I would do 
anything to crawl off, cartwheel off, skip off. That's the first 
time (Saturday night) I can remember that I was ever helped off the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It turned out to be true. So I stand by my code.''

<HEADLINE> California Gunman Remains at Large </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GARDEN GROVE, Calif. (AP) -- A gunman who killed two people and  
wounded four others when he opened fire at an auto accessories 
store remained at large today as police sought a motive. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack Monday at Robotek began when the man started firing  
in the parking lot. He then burst inside the store and continued 
shooting, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses reported that the attacker fled in a gray minivan,  
possibly with another man, Sgt. Dennis Ellsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	One victim died in the parking lot and the other inside the  
store. Three others were in critical condition late Monday at the 
University of California, Irvine, Medical Center in Orange, 
hospital spokeswoman Kim Lachance said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another victim -- a 15-year-old boy -- was shot in the ankle and  
treated and released from a hospital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether the victims were employees, customers or  
bystanders, Sgt. Todd Elgin said. A motive for the attack remained 
unknown. Detectives didn't immediately return phone calls this 
morning seeking further detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Garden Grove is about 35 miles southeast of Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Socially Responsible Mutual Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: I want to make sure my mutual fund invests in companies that  
are socially responsible. Do these types of funds exist? 
</P>
<P>
	A: There are a number of funds that exclude whole industries  
from their portfolios because those industries are judged to be 
harmful to society. The tobacco, alcohol, firearms, gambling and 
logging industries are some of the more prominent members of that 
group. And global funds have been known to exclude the stocks of 
companies located in countries that are accused of allowing human 
rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical fund manager is concerned primarily with the  
performance of the stocks included in his or her portfolio. The 
manager of a socially responsible fund, however, must also pay 
close attention to a company's labor practices and environmental 
record, among other things. For example, a company that violates 
child labor laws in a foreign country in order to reduce production 
costs would be excluded from a socially responsible fund. Likewise, 
a company that dumps toxins into the rivers of developing countries 
would also be left out of a socially responsible fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``Socially responsible funds are those funds that use  
non-financial criteria as at least part of the reason for selecting 
certain stocks,'' said Emily Hall, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., 
a Chicago firm that tracks mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall explained that socially responsible funds tend to lean  
toward the newer, high-technology sectors, such as computer 
software and health care services, because those areas tend to have 
better track records on labor practices and the environment than 
older industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider, for example, the Calvert Group's $196 million Social  
Investment equity fund, which is heavily weighted in favor of 
high-tech and health care companies, including Hewlett Packard Co., 
Sun Mircosystems Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., and Mylan Labs Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvert lists four characteristics it seeks when selecting  
companies to include in the Social Investment portfolio. They are: 
a sound environmental record; a good history of labor relations, 
including strong equal opportunity programs; the production or 
marketing of ``safe, healthy and useful'' products and services; 
and a solid reputation as good corporate citizen in the local 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	The banned list includes companies considered ``major  
polluters,'' or which have questionable labor practices; nuclear 
power companies; and those ``significantly'' involved in firearms, 
tobacco, alcohol or gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall cautioned investors to treat socially responsible funds as  
they would any other investment. A potential investor should first 
ask whether a particular fund fits their investment needs. If so, 
the investor should determine whether that fund screens out the 
stocks of companies the investor finds objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the better known socially responsible fund families  
include the Bethesda, Md.,-based Calvert Funds, which offers the 
most extensive array of socially screened investment products, 
including both stock and bond funds, as well as money market funds; 
Portsmouth, N.H.,-based Citizens Funds, which offers four stock 
funds and a money market fund; and New York-based Domini Funds, 
which offers two stock funds.

<HEADLINE> Carolina Coast Dodges Hurricane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAGS HEAD, N.C. (AP) -- Relieved coastal residents watched  
Hurricane Dennis churn out to sea, marveling at the power of the 
winds it generated and the sparse property damage it left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``All in all, we did dodge a bullet,'' Danny Couch, owner of a  
shopping center in Buxton, said Monday evening. ``It was a pretty 
impressive system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning along the North Carolina coast was  
downgraded to a tropical storm warning Monday night, but 
forecasters said it was too early to write off Dennis completely. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Jarrell of the National Hurricane Center in Miami said  
forecasters believed Dennis would stall at sea today for three or 
four days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, one of our better models is showing that it  
comes back into the coast, not far from where it is right now, 
close to Norfolk or in that general vicinity,'' he warned. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 a.m. today, Dennis was 165 miles east of Cape Hatteras,  
moving toward the east-northeast at 7 mph with maximum winds up to 
85 mph. A gale warning was extended from Chincoteague, Va., to 
Great Egg Inlet, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	For a time Monday, it seemed yet another hurricane might cross  
Cape Fear, directly south of Wilmington, just like Bertha and Fran 
in 1996 and Bonnie in 1998. Fran killed 25 people and caused up to 
$6 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	But just as Dennis approached the Outer Banks, it began edging  
away. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm's eye stayed 60 miles from shore, but it still  
pummeled the coast with high winds and up to 8 inches of rain. The 
effects of the storm were felt as far north in the beach towns of 
Nags Head, Kill Devil Hills and Kitty Hawk. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people died Monday in a head-on car collision in Onslow  
County that was blamed on poor visibility from wind and rain. A 
surfer's death at St. Augustine Beach, Fla., on Saturday was 
attributed to heavy surf from Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dare County, a Coast Guard helicopter rescued four men from a  
small boat that had blown into a marsh after its engine failed in 
the 30-foot surf. 
</P>
<P>
	On Hatteras Island, the ocean washed out Route 12, the only  
highway along the narrow barrier island. A stretch of the road was 
shut down near Kitty Hawk, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding was a problem farther south. The community of Cedar  
Island in Carteret County was cut off by water, and Ocracoke Island 
was drenched by rain and waves, said Hyde County Manager Jeff 
Credle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole village was covered with water ... six feet above  
sea level,'' Credle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds howled up to 100 mph earlier in the day but calmed to  
below 60 mph by late afternoon, Credle said. Damage estimates can't 
be made until water recedes on the island, which is reachable only 
by ferries. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy Babbitt rode out the storm in her Hatteras Landing Marina,  
just across the inlet from Ocracoke. ``We're faring OK,'' she said. 
``I tried to look outside, but the rain is so sideways I can't 
see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Utz, of Nags Head, said a weather gauge on his house  
measured wind speeds up to 50 mph. ``We were sitting in my house 
watching shingles peel off the house across the street,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A rental cottage here was gutted by a fire that officials  
believe was caused by winds shorting out power lines. Earlier in 
the day, a firefighter in Kill Devil Hills was shocked when a power 
line arced toward him, but he recovered and was back on duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Storm damage was light. New Hanover's losses totaled $217,000,  
while in Brunswick County, the collapse of a beachfront house at 
Ocean Isle Beach was the worst property damage reported, said Cecil 
Logan of the county emergency management office. 
</P>
<P>
	Utility companies said about 67,000 customers in coastal and  
inland counties lost power. The outages stretched as far inland as 
the Raleigh in central North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Life resumed a more normal pace along the northern and southern  
beaches by Monday evening. Many restaurants were open, and a few 
hardy souls ventured onto the wind-whipped beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen a bunch of bad weather in this area, but we're real  
happy with how things turned out this time,'' said Bob Sheppard of 
Wrightsville Beach.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall for Fourth Session / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell for a fourth straight session  
Tuesday as a report on strength in the industrial economy and 
rising prices for raw materials kept inflation worries alive. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/8 point,  
or by $1.25 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, rose to 6.06 percent from 6.05 percent late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were caught by surprise by a National Association of  
Purchasing Management report, released by mistake a day earlier 
than scheduled, that said the industrial economy grew in August for 
a seventh straight month. The inflation component of the survey 
also rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	The stronger-than-expected figures pointed to a continued  
resurgence in manufacturing and rekindled inflation jitters. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders worry that unless the economy starts to cool off,  
inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates 
for a third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates push down the value of fixed-income  
investments such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged, and intermediate maturities fell 1/32 point to 1/8 
point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.96 percent as the  
discount fell 0.05 percentage point from Monday's treasury auction 
to 4.83 percent. Six-month yields were 5.20 percent, as the 
discount rose 0.01 percentage point from the weekly auction to 5.00 
percent. One-year yields were 5.27 percent as the discount fell 
0.01 percentage point from late Monday to 5.00 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.62 1/2 percent from 5.31 1/4 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 5/32 point to 114 11/32. The average 
yield to maturity rose to 5.78 percent from 5.77 percent late 
Monday.

<HEADLINE>  Brazil Eyes Budget Surplus, Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Caught between conflicting demands to  
create jobs and cut spending, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
on Tuesday promised something for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso unveiled a stripped-down budget for next year that calls  
for a surplus of 28.5 billion reals, now about $14.8 billion. The 
surplus is part of Brazil's agreement with the International 
Monetary Fund to qualify for a $41.5 billion loan. 
</P>
<P>
	He also announced a massive four-year program of 358 projects to  
be undertaken by the government and private enterprise. Called 
``Advance Brazil,'' the program is expected to bring investments of 
$165 billion, create 8.5 million jobs and help kick-start a 
stagnant economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil is hungry for growth,'' Cardoso said in a speech at the  
presidential palace. But he added that growth ``must be a 
consequence of organized public accounts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hunger has been building for two years, while Latin  
America's biggest economy was a victim of its own artificially 
strong currency. The strong real kept inflation down but hurt 
exports and aggravated a chronic budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocked by the Asian crisis in 1997 and Russia's meltdown last  
year, Brazil was forced to devalue its currency and raise interest 
rates. The IMF's rescue package came with austere targets for 
shrinking the deficit, but Brazilians are chafing under years of 
stagnation and high unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 2000 budget, the government tried to juggle the demand  
for renewed growth with the need to generate a primary surplus -- 
which doesn't count interest payments -- equivalent to 2.65 percent 
of the gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	Budget Minister Martus Tavares said the government plans to  
guarantee the surplus by conditioning expenses to the availability 
of financing. Without ready funds, spending is prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget includes a forecast of 4 percent growth and inflation  
of 6 percent. Interest rates, now at 19.5 percent, will fall to 13 
percent next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso also unveiled a broad outline for development, a  
multiyear plan the president is required to submit. The plan -- 
which ranges from building railroads in the midwest to encouraging 
ecotourism in the Amazon -- would depend on estimated investments of 
about $513 billion, from federal and local governments, lending 
agencies and the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, which is separate from the ``Advance Brazil'' project,  
earmarks 60 percent of expenses for ``social'' investments that 
benefit mainly the poor. Cardoso has come under fire from 
opposition and allies alike that his government does little for 
needy Brazilians.

	PARIS (AP) -- French farmers dumped vegetables in front of

<P>
	In the southern city of Montpellier, hundreds of farmers  
protested the imprisonment of an activist who led the ransacking of 
a new McDonald's restaurant several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Bove and four other men were jailed Aug. 19 after they  
vandalized the McDonald's construction site in the southern town of 
Millau. Bove, a sheep farmer and local leader of a radical farmer's 
union, says he is fighting globalization. 
</P>
<P>
	Bove's union has called for a wave of demonstrations at  
McDonald's restaurants to protest U.S. sanctions on a slew of 
luxury French food products, ranging from Roquefort cheese to foie 
gras. The sanctions were slapped on European goods earlier this 
summer in retaliation for the European Union's decision to ban 
imports of U.S. hormone-treated beef. 
</P>
<P>
	During the past several weeks, protesters have vandalized many  
McDonald's, sometimes dropping tons of manure outside the 
restaurants. The company says the union has the wrong target 
because 90 percent of the beef served in French McDonald's 
restaurants comes from cows raised in France. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's France, hoping to ease farmers' concerns, has dropped  
its civil charges against Bove. The Court of Appeals in Montpellier 
is expected to decide Thursday whether to release him. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, smaller milk producers targeted big business,  
saying the wave of mergers that has swept through France this 
summer will continue to lower the prices they receive for their 
product. A farmer's association in Brittany cited, among others, 
this week's merger of two major French food retailers, Carrefour 
and Promodes. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the milk producers, fruit and vegetable farmers are  
concerned that large-scale distribution is hurting their profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In Marseilles on Monday night, fruit and vegetable producers  
dumped several tons of apples, tomatoes and peaches on the 
doorsteps of local politicians to press farm concerns. Similar 
protests were held in other cities.

<HEADLINE> Carolina Coast Dodges Hurricane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAGS HEAD, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis weakened and slowed to a  
near halt today just off the coast, leaving relatively sparse 
property damage in its wake along the North Carolina seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``All in all, we did dodge a bullet,'' Danny Couch, owner of a  
shopping center in Buxton, said Monday evening. ``It was a pretty 
impressive system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning along the North Carolina coast was  
downgraded to a tropical storm warning but forecasters said it was 
too early to write off Dennis completely. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis, almost stationary this morning, could linger without  
moving much through Saturday, said Rod Gonski, forecaster at the 
National Weather Service office in Raleigh. ``It likes that moist, 
warm air on the Gulf Stream, and that's where it's centered now,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If it starts moving again, it's just as likely to head south or  
southwest as it is to reverse course toward the Outer Banks or 
southeastern Virginia, Gonski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a chance it could come back, a little less than 50-50,  
but certainly worth talking about for sure,'' he said. ``There is 
nothing nudging it out in the ocean right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the uncertainty about the storm, people have started  
calling oceanfront hotels in southeastern Virginia to cancel 
reservations for Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis ``puts a lot of things into sort of a holding pattern,''  
said Jimmy Capps, president of the Virginia Beach Hotel-Motel 
Association. ``What we probably need to do is give it another day 
and see where it's going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. today, Dennis was nearly stationary about 150 miles  
east of Cape Hatteras, the National Hurricane Center said. Its 
motion was expected to continue to be slow and erratic at least 
into Wednesday morning. Its maximum sustained wind had slowed to 
about 75 mph, barely above the minimum wind speed for a hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to North Carolina, the tropical storm warning  
stretched northward to Chincoteague, Va., and a gale warning 
extended from there to Great Egg Inlet, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	For a time Monday, it seemed yet another hurricane might cross  
Cape Fear, directly south of Wilmington, just like Bertha and Fran 
in 1996 and Bonnie in 1998. Fran killed 25 people and caused up to 
$6 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	But just as Dennis approached the Outer Banks, it began edging  
away. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm's eye stayed 60 miles from shore, but it still  
pummeled the coast with high wind and up to 8 inches of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people died Monday in Onslow County in a head-on car  
collision blamed on poor visibility from wind and rain. A surfer's 
death Saturday at St. Augustine Beach, Fla., was attributed to 
heavy surf from Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dare County, a Coast Guard helicopter rescued four men from a  
small boat that was blown into a marsh after its engine failed in 
the 30-foot surf. 
</P>
<P>
	On Hatteras Island, the ocean washed out Route 12, the only  
highway along the narrow barrier island. Part of the road was 
closed near Kitty Hawk and up to 3 feet of sand covered the 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther south, the community of Cedar Island in Carteret County  
was cut off by high water, and Ocracoke Island was drenched by rain 
and waves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole village was covered with water ... 6 feet above sea  
level,'' Hyde County Manager Jeff Credle said of the town of 
Ocracoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage on Ocracoke Island can't be estimated until the water  
recedes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy Babbitt rode out the storm in her Hatteras Landing Marina,  
just across the inlet from Ocracoke. ``We're faring OK,'' she said. 
``I tried to look outside, but the rain is so sideways I can't 
see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Storm damage was light. New Hanover's losses totaled $217,000,  
while in Brunswick County, the collapse of a beachfront house at 
Ocean Isle Beach was the worst property damage reported, said Cecil 
Logan of the county emergency management office. 
</P>
<P>
	Utility companies said about 67,000 customers in coastal and  
inland counties lost power. The outages stretched as far inland as 
the Raleigh in central North Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Woman Summons Help Via E-mail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah (AP) -- A woman who says her husband was  
threatening to take her hostage summoned help via e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested the man within 30 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're calling it the `You've got mail,' case,'' Lt. Charles  
Illsley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the man threatened to hit his wife if she attempted  
to use the phone. The computer was on, and she was able to send an 
e-mail without him noticing. 
</P>
<P>
	Police got a call Monday from the Calaveras, Calif., sheriff's  
office after it heard from a woman who said she had e-mail from a 
Phoenix man who got an e-mail from the alleged victim in a chat 
room. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the only option,'' the 29-year-old woman said. ``I  
could tell by the way he was acting that it was going to go bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,  
obtained a protective order against her husband after he was 
charged with aggravated assault against her. He is now in jail on 
that charge.

<HEADLINE> Schoolteachers in Detroit Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The city's schoolteachers went on strike today,  
canceling the first day of fall classes and dealing another blow to 
the effort to revive Detroit's underperforming schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike -- in part over such contentious reform proposals as  
merit pay -- will now test a state law that bars public school 
teachers from walking out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rhetoric's the same. We don't have a contract and we don't  
see any real change,'' Mike Pahl, a science teacher at Spain 
School, said this morning. ``This is the only way we're going to 
get any real improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The district's 172,000 students were told to stay home today.  
Classes will not be held until officials know that enough of the 
district's 7,200 teachers will report for work. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous contract between the Detroit Federation of Teachers  
and the school system expired June 30, and an extension ran out 
Monday after teachers voted to reject their negotiators' 
recommendation for another extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have liked for them to follow my recommendations to go  
back to work for 10 days while I negotiate,'' union President John 
Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the walkout, talks to resumed at midafternoon today,  
said Greg Bowens, press secretary to Mayor Dennis Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks are the first negotiations with the teachers since  
Detroit's elected school board was replaced earlier this year with 
one appointed by Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	The issues still unresolved included salary increases, merit  
pay, extended work days and a dress code. Teachers said merit pay 
was the most contentious issue. Many prefer to keep the old 
standards of experience, seniority and education; and say the real 
way to improve schools would be steps such as cutting class size. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody in our building deserves merit pay because everyone  
here's a good teacher,'' said Rita Greenberg, a second-grade 
teacher at Spain School. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have to say the rejection today does reflect an  
unwillingness by some teachers to engage themselves in significant 
change,'' said David Adamany, the district's interim chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the union's first walkout 1992. Under a 1994 Michigan  
law, public school employees who strike lose a day's pay in 
addition to being fined a day's pay. The law has never been tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Adamany said the school district will not seek a court  
injunction to try to force the teachers back to work, but is 
looking into the question of seeking fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor said in a statement that he is troubled by the strike  
vote after the work the district had done to prepare for the school 
year. Over the summer, district employees and private sector 
volunteers combined to make $80 million worth of repairs and 
renovations to the district's 263 buildings, some of them nearly 
100 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointed school board -- an idea pushed by Republican Gov.  
John Engler and approved by the Legislature -- followed decades of 
declining performance and alleged mismanagement and pork-barrel 
politics in Detroit schools. Supporters said an appointed school 
board would be better able to make difficult political decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Samona, a math teacher at Redford High School, said he  
would ideally like to be teaching today, but that working for a 
better contract was also important. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate really that we are not doing what we do  
best,'' he said. ``But we want to be back in the classroom with a 
fair contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The median salary for Detroit teachers with a bachelor's degree  
is $50,978 and with a master's degree is $58,494, said Janna 
Garrison, executive vice president of the Detroit Federation of 
Teachers. The median salary for teachers in Wayne County, and 
neighboring Oakland and Macomb counties is $55,700 for teachers 
with a bachelor's degree and $64,822 with a master's degree, she 
said.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Close Mixed; Dow Down 84.85 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Tuesday as a report of  
continued growth in the manufacturing sector ignited fears of 
inflation and hurt blue-chip companies. Technology stocks, 
benefiting from a wave of new deals and products, moved higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 84.85 to close at  
10,829.28. The Dow suffered its fourth straight loss during a 
volatile session in which the index rose as much as 67 points and 
tumbled as much as 132 from Monday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The technology-dominated  
Nasdaq composite index rose 26.66 to 2,739.35, and the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 fell 3.61 to 1,320.41. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks fell after the National Association of Purchasing  
Management inadvertently released its monthly survey on August 
manufacturing activity a day early. 
</P>
<P>
	The report showed the NAPM's monthly index of business activity  
rose to 54.2 percent from 53.4 percent in July. A reading above 50 
is a sign of growth in the industrial sector of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Most troubling to stocks was a segment of the report that tracks  
prices paid by industry for raw materials and supplies. That figure 
rose to the highest levels since June 1995, and suggested inflation 
may be building as the economy continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	Many cyclical stocks, whose performance is tied to the fortunes  
of the broader economy, fell. Sears fell 2 to 37 1/2 and Caterpillar 
lost 2 7/8 to 56 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately Tuesday, the Conference Board said its consumer  
confidence index fell in August for the second straight month. The 
index, which measures consumers' likeliness to spend, edged down 
0.4 of a point, but still remains near the 30-year high reached in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect the Labor Department's employment report, due on  
Friday, to provide the next spark in trading. Any suggestions that 
the U.S. economy is growing too quickly -- a trend that would be 
shown by the number of new jobs created -- could convince investors 
that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a third time 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a market searching for leadership,'' said Ned Riley,  
chief investment officer at BankBoston. ``Most people are waiting 
for the payrolls (job creation) report to formulate opinions about 
what the Fed might do next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates threaten stocks by cutting into corporate profits  
and increasing the value of alternative investments, like bonds. 
Tuesday, yields on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.06 
percent from 6.05 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most oil companies were higher, including Dow components  
Chevron, up 1 to 92 5/16, and Exxon, up 1 1/16 to 78 7/8. Crude oil 
futures jumped sharply Monday after Venezuela, Mexico and Saudi 
Arabia decided against raising production. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks bucked the market's weakness as several  
companies announced new deals or new products. Hewlett Packard rose 
2 9/16 to 105 3/8 after the company unveiled several new printers and 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Nasdaq, Sun Microsystems rose 3 3/4 to 79 3/8 after the company  
bought Star Division Corp., a small maker of office productivity 
software. Analysts viewed the acquisition as an assault on 
Microsoft's dominance of the office software market. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple rose 3 3/16 to 65 1/4 after the company unveiled a new,  
high-speed desktop computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE composite volume totaled 1.01 billion shares, compared with  
731.46 million in the previous session. The pickup in volume 
heartened analysts, although many attributed the higher volume to 
end-of-the-month settling of portfolios and computer-driven 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.47 to 427.83.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas indexes were mostly lower. Japan's Nikkei stock average  
fell 2.7 percent. Germany's DAX index fell 2.3 percent, Britain's 
FT-SE 100 lost 2.0 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 1.5 percent 
lower.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pete Sampras is no longer No. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	By withdrawing from the U.S. Open with a back injury, Sampras  
will drop out of the No. 1 spot when the ATP Tour rankings are 
compiled at the end of the year's final Grand Slam tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Agassi moved ahead of Sampras, advancing one spot from the  
No. 2 ranking, but may not be No. 1 in two weeks. That's because 
Yevgeny Kafelnikov also can pass Sampras in the rankings by 
reaching the round of 16, and the Russian could conceivably 
overtake Agassi, according to how far each goes in the Open. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SISTERS DOING IT:* Venus and Serena Williams are both ranked at  
career-high positions this week, Venus at No. 3 after her victory 
at New Haven, Conn., last week, and younger sister Serena at No. 6 
after winning two weeks ago at Manhattan Beach, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The Williams sisters thus become the highest ranked sibling act  
in WTA Tour history. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest the three Maleeva sisters were ranked at the same  
time was from June 14-July 4, 1993, when Magdalena was No. 11, 
Manuela No. 12 and Katerina No. 13. The best any two of the 
Maleevas could manage at any one time was when Katerina was No. 7 
and Manuela No. 8 from June to August, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MISSING IN ACTION:* Tim Henman's problems in Grand Slam  
tournaments continued Tuesday when he lost 7-6 (7-1), 6-4, 6-3 in 
the first round to Guillermo Canas. 
</P>
<P>
	The sixth-seeded Henman lost in the first round of the Grand  
Slam tournament for the first time since the French Open last year, 
where back problems forced him to retire while trailing 5-2 in the 
opening set. 
</P>
<P>
	In 19 career Grand Slam tournaments, the top British player has  
lost in the first round six times. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *A LITTLE LAUGHTER:* When Pete Sampras met the media to talk  
about his withdrawal from the U.S. Open with a back injury, there 
were a couple moments of levity. 
</P>
<P>
	After Sampras said second-seeded Andre Agassi had called him  
Tuesday morning, saying it was a ``very classy thing to do on his 
part,'' a reporter asked Sampras if Agassi already knew of the 
injury when he called. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think he was calling me to tell me he won last night?''  
Sampras chided the questioner. 
</P>
<P>
	When Dr. Brian Hainline, the tournament's medical director, was  
asked to ``repeat the medical phrase you used in reference to 
Pete's injury and spell it,'' the doctor said: 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, there's a small disc, d-i-s-c, herniation at L-5, S-1.  
Usually we write that as a L-5, S-1.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STEADY SLIDE:* Alexandra Stevenson's slide since reaching the  
Wimbledon semifinals continued at the U.S. Open on Tuesday when she 
lost to 11th-seeded Nathalie Tauziat 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	At Wimbledon, Stevenson became the first woman qualifier to gain  
a semifinal berth. She has not won a match since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauziat also has struggled. Going into the U.S. Open, the  
Frenchwoman had won just one match in her last three tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SWINGING STADIUM:* ``It's OK for Louis Armstrong to be part of  
tennis,'' Lucille Armstrong, widow of the great trumpeter, said in 
1977. ``Both are swinging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Louis Armstrong Stadium at the National Tennis Center, not  
far from where the Armstrongs lived from 1943 until his death in 
1971, and she lived until her death in 1983, was rededicated on 
Monday, the first day of the U.S. Open. It has been rebuilt as a 
state-of-the-art facility for tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	It opened in 1964 as the Singer Bowl, by the Singer Sewing  
Machine Company, in connection with the World's Fair. It was later 
taken over by the city and dedicated July 4, 1973, as the Louis 
Armstrong Bowl for concerts. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Tennis Association took over in 1977, and two years ago  
built the larger Arthur Ashe Stadium next door. 
</P>
<P>
	At Monday's dedication, the Jazz Orchestra of Lincoln Center  
played music associated with Armstrong.

	Consumer Confidence Falls in August  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence fell for the second straight  
month in August as higher interest rates started to weigh on the 
minds of more people, the Conference Board reported today. The 
private business group's index of consumer confidence, which 
measures consumers' likeliness to spend, edged down 0.4 of a point, 
less than analysts expected, to 135.8 from a revised 136.2 in July. 
The July figure originally was reported as 135.6. The July drop 
from a 30-year high of 139.0 marked the first decline after eight 
consecutive monthly gains. Consumer sentiment is an important 
economic indicator since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds 
of the nation's overall economic activity. 

</P>
<P>
	Stocks Turn Up; Dow Gains 34.51  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned higher after a lower opening this  
morning as continuing worries over interest rates continued. Just 
before 11 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 34.51 
at 10,948.64. Broader stock indicators were generally up, too. The 
Nasdaq composite index was up 8.05 at 2,720.74. In a quiet week, 
with many Wall Street professionals taking vacations, many 
investors are willing to wait for each new piece of economic data 
to guide their decisions.

	Sun Micro Is Buying Star Division  
</P>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Sun Microsystems is taking aim again at

	Microsoft Fixes Hotmail Flaw  
</P>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft said a security flaw in its free  
Hotmail e-mail system that left millions of accounts vulnerable was 
patched before anyone was hurt by the breach. ``The good news is 
the Hotmail servers are back up and running now and the issue has 
been resolved,'' Deanna Sanford, lead product manager for MSN 
marketing, Microsoft Corp.'s Internet division, said Monday. ``We 
haven't heard any reports, any customers calling to say they were 
affected by this directly.'' Microsoft shut down its Hotmail e-mail 
system, which has 40 million accounts, for about two hours 
yesterday morning after discovering the flaw that made accounts 
vulnerable to outside access. The company said the trouble was 
fixed by 1 p.m.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Fruit of the Loom Ltd. CEO William Farley is  
stepping down as part of a corporate restructuring at the clothing 
company, though he will stay on as chairman. The Chicago-based 
company also said yesterday that production and customer service 
difficulties will cause financial results for the rest of the year 
to fall significantly below analysts' expectations. Board member 
Dennis Bookshester will serve as acting chief executive officer of 
the company, best known for its underwear and active wear, until a 
replacement is found for Farley. The search is expected to take six 
to nine months.

	Cigarette Packs To Jump 22 Cents  
</P>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Smokers already hit hard by price increases  
stemming from the $206 billion tobacco settlement soon will be hit 
with another double-digit markup. The nation's leading cigarette 
manufacturers have raised wholesale prices 18 cents a pack, 
anticipating an upcoming excise tax increase and higher costs 
associated with their settlement with the states over health care 
costs. After markups, retail prices are likely to increase by about 
22 cents per pack, analysts said yesterday. Cigarettes now cost 
about $2.50 to $3.25 a pack, depending on the region of the 
country.

	Jury: Exxon Doesn't Owe California  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A jury has rejected claims that Exxon Corp.  
owed the state of California $750 million for allegedly 
underpricing oil pumped from public lands. Superior Court jurors 
decided yesterday that the state received fair royalty payments 
during the 1980s for oil taken from the 8,000-acre Wilmington field 
off Long Beach. Jurors also said Exxon did not act in bad faith or 
manipulate oil prices. In its 13-year-old civil suit against Exxon, 
California claimed that the company had shortchanged the state 
about $350 million for oil pumped from 1981 to 1989. With interest, 
that sum would have grown to $750 million, said Larry Feldman, a 
lawyer who represented Exxon.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Three major Japanese steelmakers have lodged an

anti-dumping measure, officials said Tuesday. Nippon Steel Corp., 
Japan's largest steelmaker, and NKK Corp. appealed to the U.S. 
Court of International Trade today, after Kawasaki Steel Corp. 
filed with the same court yesterday. ``We are taking action since 
the anti-dumping investigation by the U.S. Commerce Department has 
been conducted under an unfair procedure,'' said Nippon Steel 
spokesman Takashi Kanke.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Close Mixed; Dow Down 84.85 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Tuesday as a report of  
continued growth in the manufacturing sector ignited fears of 
inflation and hurt blue-chip companies. Technology stocks, 
benefiting from a wave of new deals and products, moved higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 84.85 to close at  
10,829.28. The Dow suffered its fourth straight loss during a 
volatile session in which the index rose as much as 67 points and 
tumbled as much as 132 from Monday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The technology-dominated  
Nasdaq composite index rose 26.66 to 2,739.35, and the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 fell 3.61 to 1,320.41. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks fell after the National Association of Purchasing  
Management inadvertently released its monthly survey on August 
manufacturing activity a day early. 
</P>
<P>
	The report showed the NAPM's monthly index of business activity  
rose to 54.2 percent from 53.4 percent in July. A reading above 50 
is a sign of growth in the industrial sector of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Most troubling to stocks was a segment of the report that tracks  
prices paid by industry for raw materials and supplies. That figure 
rose to the highest levels since June 1995, and suggested inflation 
may be building as the economy continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	Many cyclical stocks, whose performance is tied to the fortunes  
of the broader economy, fell. Sears fell 2 to 37 1/2 and Caterpillar 
lost 2 7/8 to 56 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately Tuesday, the Conference Board said its consumer  
confidence index fell in August for the second straight month. The 
index, which measures consumers' likeliness to spend, edged down 
0.4 of a point, but still remains near the 30-year high reached in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect the Labor Department's employment report, due on  
Friday, to provide the next spark in trading. Any suggestions that 
the U.S. economy is growing too quickly -- a trend that would be 
shown by the number of new jobs created -- could convince investors 
that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a third time 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a market searching for leadership,'' said Ned Riley,  
chief investment officer at BankBoston. ``Most people are waiting 
for the payrolls (job creation) report to formulate opinions about 
what the Fed might do next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates threaten stocks by cutting into corporate profits  
and increasing the value of alternative investments, like bonds. 
Tuesday, yields on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.06 
percent from 6.05 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most oil companies were higher, including Dow components  
Chevron, up 1 to 92 5/16, and Exxon, up 1 1/16 to 78 7/8. Crude oil 
futures jumped sharply Monday after Venezuela, Mexico and Saudi 
Arabia decided against raising production. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks bucked the market's weakness as several  
companies announced new deals or new products. Hewlett Packard rose 
2 9/16 to 105 3/8 after the company unveiled several new printers and 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Nasdaq, Sun Microsystems rose 3 3/4 to 79 3/8 after the company  
bought Star Division Corp., a small maker of office productivity 
software. Analysts viewed the acquisition as an assault on 
Microsoft's dominance of the office software market. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple rose 3 3/16 to 65 1/4 after the company unveiled a new,  
high-speed desktop computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE composite volume totaled 1.01 billion shares, compared with  
731.46 million in the previous session. The pickup in volume 
heartened analysts, although many attributed the higher volume to 
end-of-the-month settling of portfolios and computer-driven 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.47 to 427.83.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas indexes were mostly lower. Japan's Nikkei stock average  
fell 2.7 percent. Germany's DAX index fell 2.3 percent, Britain's 
FT-SE 100 lost 2.0 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 1.5 percent 
lower.

<HEADLINE> New York Mayor To Serve on Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He was a no-nonsense federal prosecutor. Then he  
became the mayor of the most populous city in the nation. Now Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani has a new job -- juror. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor was selected Monday as jury foreman in a case in which  
a man is suing his landlord claiming he was badly scalded while 
taking a shower. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed by Oliver and Larene Johnson, seeks $6  
million in damages from Riverton Associates for allegedly 
improperly maintaining the boiler and pipes in the couple's 
apartment building. Mrs. Johnson is seeking an additional $1 
million for loss of companionship. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was caused to sustain severe, protracted and serious  
personal injuries as a result of the negligence'' of the owners, 
according to the lawsuit filed after the February 1995 incident. 
</P>
<P>
	In court documents, Riverton Associates has denied the  
allegations. A phone message left at the company was not 
immediately returned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, who expected to be dismissed quickly from the pool of  
jurors Monday, instead waited the entire morning and most of the 
afternoon with other prospective jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor said he was shocked when he was selected.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised, but I really want to comment on it as little  
as possible,'' he said. ``I am gratified and very honored to serve 
and actually looking forward to it after all these years as a trial 
lawyer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani is the latest in a list of politicians and celebrities  
to be called for jury duty since the state approved a jury reform 
law in 1995 that did away with exemptions for lawyers and doctors, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who have been called up -- but not selected for trial  
-- are Gov. George Pataki, Spike Lee, Woody Allen, Richard Gere, 
Glenn Close and Sally Jessy Raphael. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's trial was scheduled to begin today and expected to  
last about a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very rewarding experience, I hope,'' the mayor said.  
``You never know.''

<HEADLINE> Sampras Exits Open With Back Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pete Sampras withdrew from the U.S. Open today  
before his first match because of a back injury, delaying his bid 
for tennis history. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time champion has a small herniated disc in his lower  
back and said he injured himself hitting a return during practice 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt my back just got ... stabbed by a knife,'' Sampras  
said. ``I immediately stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, the world's No. 1 player and seeded first at the Open,  
said he would be out for ``quite some time.'' Later in his news 
conference, he said he would miss at least a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras is bidding for a record 13th Grand Slam men's singles  
title. He tied Roy Emerson with 12 major championships by winning 
his sixth Wimbledon title in July. 
</P>
<P>
	After injuring himself, he canceled Monday's practice and asked  
that his first-round match at the Open be delayed, believing an 
extra day of rest would help. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Brian Hainline, the U.S. Open medical director, suggested  
Sampras undergo a CAT scan and an MRI, which revealed the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not allowing him to move as he should,'' Hainline said.  
``He has some pain, but he's completely normal otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hainline examined Sampras and said the tear in the disc could  
have worsened, jeopardizing his future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we caught it early and he should recover fully,''  
Hainline said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras was to have played Marat Safin of Russia on Wednesday.  
His spot in the Open draw was taken by Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden, 
ranked 130th in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that he always want to play,'' Hainline said. ``So  
ultimately he made the decision on whether to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras retired during a match two weeks ago in Indianapolis  
with a hip injury. 
</P>
<P>
	He played several additional tournaments last fall in a  
successful attempt to finish No. 1 for a record sixth straight 
time. But he then skipped the Australian Open in January, citing 
fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his success on the Open's hardcourts, the 28-year-old  
star has been beset by injury and illness at Flushing Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he retired from his semifinal against eventual winner  
Patrick Rafter with an injured thigh. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Sampras vomited on the court during his five-set  
victory against Alex Corretja but recovered and went on to win the 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	This marks the second time this year a top-seeded man has pulled  
out of a Grand Slam tournament before stepping onto the court. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Marcelo Rios of Chile pulled out of the Australian  
Open because of a stress fracture in his back. He didn't return to 
the tour until March. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the No. 1 seed withdrew from the U.S.  
championships was in 1950 when Budge Patty injured his ankle.

<HEADLINE> Indians Get Tyler Houston From Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians, facing the possibility  
that Sandy Alomar's left knee may keep him out of the playoffs, 
acquired catcher Tyler Houston from the Chicago Cubs for minor 
league pitcher Richard Negrette on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston, 28, is hitting .233 this year with nine home runs and  
27 RBIs in 100 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The versatile, left-handed hitter has appeared in 18 games at  
catcher and 63 games at third base. He has a career major league 
average of .260 with 23 home runs and 115 RBIs in 346 games with 
the Atlanta Braves and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians will remove a player from its 40-man roster when  
Houston reports to Cleveland on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, hitting .317 with three homers and 16 RBIs in 82 at-bats  
this year, went on the disabled list May 21. He had surgery 10 days 
later to remove a bone chip from his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar said Monday he will get an injection of gel in the back  
of his knee in an effort to relieve discomfort, then resume his 
rehabilitation program while wearing a brace. But it's uncertain 
whether that will be enough to allow Alomar to return to 
Cleveland's lineup, or if he will have to undergo surgery that he 
hoped to postpone until after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Negrette, 23, is 1-3 with one save and a 6.15 ERA in 33 relief  
appearances for Double-A Akron this year.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Exits, Agassi Now Favored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. Open received a jolt today when  
four-time champion Pete Sampras was forced to withdraw before 
playing a match because of a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras has a small herniated disc, said Dr. Brian Hainline,  
medical director of the Open. ``It's not allowing him to move as he 
should,'' Hainline said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, who withdrew from a tournament in Indianapolis two  
weeks ago with a hip injury, hurt his back during practice on 
Sunday and had asked Open officials to delay his first-round match 
until Wednesday. On Monday, he underwent a CAT scan and MRI, which 
revealed a small tear in a disc in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good part is that we discovered it early,'' Hainline said.  
``A large herniated disc could've jeopardized his future, so it's 
good we caught it early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras said he was returning a serve from Brazilian Gustavo  
Kuerten when ``I felt my back just got ... stabbed by a knife. I 
immediately stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament lost another seeded man when No. 6 Tim Henman of  
Britain was ousted by Argentine Guillermo Canas 7-6 (7-1), 6-4, 
6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	In other matches today, No. 7 Todd Martin of Ponte Vedra Beach,  
Fla., edged Frenchman Stephane Huet 6-4, 6-3, 6-7 (2-7), 6-7 (5-7), 
7-6 (7-3); Lleyton Hewitt of Australia defeated Switzerland's Marc 
Rosset 6-2, 6-2, 6-0; and Vincent Spadea of Boca Raton, Fla., 
downed Jens Knippschild of Germany 6-3, 6-7 (3-7), 7-5, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	In women's singles, No. 9 Julie Halard-Decugis of France stopped  
Cara Black of Zimbabwe 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 and Jennifer Capriati of 
Wesley Chapel, Fla., defeated Croatia's Iva Majoli 6-1, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
	The withdrawal of Sampras, the Wimbledon champion, makes Andre  
Agassi the tournament favorite. The second-seeded Agassi began his 
quest under the lights on opening night at Arthur Ashe Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always enjoyed playing at night,'' Agassi said after  
turning in an outstanding performance Monday night. ``I'm used to 
it. I love the energy of the crowd. It almost feels like theater 
out there. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just there to be entertained and enjoy.''  
</P>
<P>
	Seeking his third consecutive Grand Slam tournament final, the  
second-seeded Agassi capped the opening day of the year's final 
Grand Slam tournament Monday night with a 6-1, 6-1, 6-3 thrashing 
of Sweden's Nicklas Kulti. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi, who won the French Open in June and reached the final of  
Wimbledon in July, was in complete control against Kulti, making 
only four unforced errors in the opening set. He needed only 75 
minutes to grab a spot in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's never as easy as it looks,'' said Agassi, who equaled his  
best performance at the National Tennis Center. In 1997, he lost 
only four games in a second-round victory over Romanian Adrian 
Voinea 6-0, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	It definitely wasn't easy for 10th-seeded Marcelo Rios, who  
outlasted Martin Damm of the Czech Republic 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), 3-6, 
5-7, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one seeded player lost on Day One: No. 6 Amanda Coetzer of  
South Africa, who fell to Romanian Irina Spirlea 6-1, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Monday's winners in the women's singles were top-seeded  
Martina Hingis and No. 3 Venus Williams, Spirlea's on-court bump 
partner two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Agassi and Rios in the men's second round included No. 3  
Yevgeny Kafelnikov, No. 8 Carlos Moya and No. 12 Richard Krajicek. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Lindsay Davenport began the defense of her women's  
singles title when she took on Corina Morariu of Boca Raton, Fla. 
Tonight's key matches pit seventh-seeded Serena Williams, Venus' 
younger sister, against fellow American Kimberly Po, and defending 
men's champion Patrick Rafter, seeded fourth, against Frenchman 
Cedric Pioline. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi was magnificent as he made center court his stage,  
slashing winners from every angle, outslugging his Swedish foe from 
the baseline, forcing his will on which way the points were to be 
played. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked easier than it is because it's never simple,''  
Agassi said. ``There's a lot of work that goes into making yourself 
play good tennis or focused tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I was adjusting to the conditions rather quickly,  
was moving well ... and was returning really well, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Striking the ball cleanly, Agassi made only four unforced errors  
in the 22-minute-long first set. Kulti played well, but Agassi had 
the perfect answer to every challenge the Swede presented. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love playing,'' Agassi said. ``This is what I do, it's what  
I love. I truly am enjoying this stage of my life. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis, who broke down in tears and had to be forced to return  
to the court for the trophy presentation after she lost the French 
Open, then was upset in the first round at Wimbledon, got off on 
the right foot in this Grand Slam event. She raced through the 
first set, then survived three breaks of her service in the second 
set to beat No. 74-ranked Czech Kveta Hrdlickova 6-1, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Wimbledon, Hingis won two of the three tournaments she  
entered. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, knocked out early at the French Open by a qualifier  
she underestimated, took no chances this time and romped past 
another qualifier, Tatiana Poutchek of Belarus 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't take it seriously,'' Williams said of her short stay  
in Paris. ``You can't do that. I've learned my lesson. I had to 
learn it the hard way, in a Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each player -- like today, I'd never seen her before -- I'm  
really going out there to be serious about her. I'm not sure who I 
play next, or who I have the possibility of playing, but I'm 
definitely going to go into the match as serious as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Williams made a big splash in her U.S. Open  
debut, reaching the final before losing to Hingis. In the 
semifinals that year, she bumped into Spirlea, literally, when 
changing sides during a tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
	In her victory over Coetzer, Spirlea made 31 unforced errors,  
three more than her opponent, but had 10 more winners, 14-4.

<HEADLINE> Browns' Rainer a 'Hard-Nosed' Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Wali Rainer's nose split wide open for the  
first time back in Pop Warner when he planted his helmet in some 
poor 10-year-old quarterback's chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Now every year around this time, Rainer cuts the bridge of his  
nose. It's become a ritual, and a badge of courage, signaling to 
the Cleveland Browns rookie linebacker that football season has 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``It always happens,'' Rainer said. ``I hit with my face, not  
with my helmet. It helps me coming off blocks. I think of myself as 
a hard-nosed player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rainer had better be. He's the man with the challenge of  
replacing Chris Spielman at middle linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman reluctantly retired on Monday after being momentarily  
paralyzed from a blindside block during Cleveland's exhibition game 
against Chicago last weekend. His departure strips the expansion 
Browns of their biggest-name player, their defensive leader, their 
heart and soul. 
</P>
<P>
	Rainer, who has already shown some of Spielman's traits -- he's  
intense, hardworking and aggressive -- thinks he can fill Spielman's 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready for this,'' said Rainer, taken by the Browns in the  
fourth round out of Virginia. ``I'm ready to step up. I provide the 
team intensity and hard work. I've been a linebacker my whole life. 
I'm ready to prove to everyone that I can play the position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rainer already sounds like Spielman. Now he has to show he can  
play like him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns were delighted when the 6-foot-2, 235-pound Rainer  
slipped to the fourth round in April's college draft. Cleveland 
needed to address some other needs before worrying about a middle 
linebacker, and in Rainer they think they found a good one. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very pleased when Wali was there,'' Browns coach Chris  
Palmer said. ``Some people had some reservations about him. But 
when you get him between the white lines he's quite a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rainer began making an impression on the Browns from the moment  
he walked on the field for his first practice. He didn't act like a 
rookie, taking command of the second-unit defense by barking out 
the defensive signals and making plays all over the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far I've been impressed,'' said outside linebacker Jamir  
Miller, who will now play alongside Rainer. ``He's been flying 
around, he doesn't lose his cool. I think he'll be a good 
linebacker in this league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if he's destined to live up to Spielman's name, maybe  
everyone should learn Rainer's name -- first name, that is. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not Wally. It's pronounced Wah-LEE. His father, James, gave  
him the name, which translates in Arabic to protector, leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it fits my personality,'' he said. ``My father  
couldn't have picked a better name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rainer has made 14 solo tackles in the Browns' first four  
exhibition games. After Spielman was helped off the field last 
Saturday, Rainer came in with the starting defense and on his first 
play stopped running back Edgar Bennett for a 1-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Rainer knows all eyes will be on the middle of the Browns'  
defense as he tries to replace Spielman, a football icon he only 
had as a teammate for a short time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could go on and on talking about what I learned from him,''  
Rainer said. ``The biggest thing is that you play every play like 
it's your last. He did it in practice and in the game. I want to be 
the same player that he's been for a lot of years and get the 
respect from the around the league he got.''

<HEADLINE> Sponsors Sought for 2002 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympic officials have recruited a group  
of local business and community leaders to urge others to sponsor 
the scandal-plagued 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Utah Ambassadors have not necessarily donated  
money themselves, but have agreed to ``give support and help open 
doors,'' said Kem Gardner, the marketing advisory committee's 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake Organizing Committee president Mitt Romney said the  
group should help raise the $179 million needed from corporate 
sponsors to meet the $1.34 billion budget for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We anticipate we will add one to two sponsors a month'' over  
the next two years, he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since January, sales have been stymied by reports of corruption  
in the host-city selection process. Only one new sponsor and four 
suppliers have signed on to the Salt Lake City Games since the 
scandal broke last December. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that people ever flock to give money,'' Romney  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had some problems,'' admitted former French ski  
champion Jean-Claude Killy, deputy chairman of the IOC Coordination 
Commission for the 2002 Games. ``Everything has changed since 
Mitt's arrival. ... Everyone is positive again. Everyone is 
confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake's bid team provided more than $1 million in perks and  
payments to IOC members, prompting a Justice Department probe into 
possible bribery, fraud and money-laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt, who will serve as the group's honorary  
chairman, said he too has ``growing confidence and growing 
optimism'' in the SLOC's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney also reiterated that the SLOC intends to only spend money  
it can raise and will cut the budget if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the ability to accordion our operation somewhat,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambassadors were chosen from a list of business leaders who had  
already demonstrated they are willing to support the games. The 
20-person committee includes the president of Intermountain Health 
Care, which provided free medical services to three Africans 
connected to the IOC. The nearly $28,000 in health care included 
hepatitis treatment, plastic surgery, and knee joint replacement 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner, who is president of the Boyer Company, said one of the  
main reasons he joined the committee was ``in gratitude to Mitt for 
coming out and helping us run these games'' after former SLOC head 
Frank Joklik resigned in January. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Utah's richest industrialist, Jon M. Huntsman, is not a  
member of the group. Huntsman, owner of one of the world's largest 
chemical manufacturers, Huntsman Corp., had been an unyielding 
critic of the 2002 Games until July, when he offered his support, 
but not money. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said Huntsman is helping raise money outside the state,  
while the Utah Ambassadors will focus on Utah companies and those 
with ties to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntsman has said he believes Utah has already paid enough in  
dollars and a damaged reputation.

<HEADLINE> Bush Named in Free Speech Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush won a victory in one  
lawsuit even as he found himself the target of another. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge on Monday dismissed a subpoena that sought Bush's  
testimony in a whistleblower lawsuit filed by the fired head of the 
Texas Funeral Service Commission, Eliza May. While the governor 
isn't a defendant in the case, May alleges she lost her job over an 
investigation of a Houston-based funeral company that had given 
Bush campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyers said the Republican presidential front-runner was a  
``co-conspirator'' in the case. But Ms. May is a former Texas 
Democratic Party treasurer, and District Judge John Dietz threw out 
her subpoena after Attorney General John Cornyn called the lawsuit 
political. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a search for the truth. This is about harassment.  
This is about politics,'' Cornyn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bush was named in a lawsuit Monday accusing him of  
violating the free speech rights of environmental protestors at the 
governor's mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmentalists allege that Bush has given state troopers  
``unbridled discretion'' to target protesters picketing in front of 
the mansion on a public sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Texas Constitution does not stop at the sidewalk in front  
of the governor's mansion,'' said Rick Abraham, executive director 
of Texans United, one of the groups suing Bush. Abraham said he was 
arrested twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush aides say the protesters strayed from a designated protest  
area. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision regarding protesters was made by the Department  
of Public Safety to protect the safety of pedestrians and 
protesters around the Governor's Mansion,'' Bush spokesman Ray 
Sullivan said. ``They were concerned that protesters blocking 
sidewalks could result in people walking in the street or otherwise 
jeopardizing their safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests took place four times -- March 11, March 29, April 19  
and May 25 -- and in each case the Travis County's district 
attorney's office dropped charges of blocking an entry way. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous governors of both parties allowed protesters to picket  
on the sidewalk, Abraham said. ``People were not arrested. Not 
until George Bush decided to run for president. Then the arrests 
started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. May's lawyers wanted to question Bush about the  
investigation of Service Corp. International, which resulted in 
recommended fines of $445,000 that the company is fighting. The 
company denies wrongdoing and says the commission misinterpreted 
state embalming law. 
</P>
<P>
	She alleges that SCI, whose political action committee gave Bush  
$45,000 in 1996 and 1997, worked with Bush's staff to interfere 
with an investigation of the company. Her lawyers said they would 
push forward with the case and question key Bush aides, including 
the governor's chief of staff and his general counsel, about the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The judge has, in essence, ruled that he wants us to seek the  
evidence from others who were involved in the matter at issue. We 
will be doing that,'' said Chuck Herring, one of Ms. May's 
attorneys. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Militiamen Block Roads in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Angry militiamen blocked roads and  
stopped separatists from boarding planes and ferries out of East 
Timor's capital today, amid expectations that the Indonesian 
loyalists lost a vote on the troubled territory's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of machete-wielding, gun-toting militia members  
returned to the streets, menacing villages and parts of the 
capital, Dili, and raising fears that they might launch a new 
campaign of terror against those who favor independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-Jakarta militias have been battling separatists for decades  
in the impoverished region, which Indonesia invaded in 1975, 
shortly after Portugal pulled out as colonial ruler. The militias 
are supported by elements of the Indonesian military, which have 
business interests in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	The militias say they want to stop independence leaders from  
leaving to avoid a political vacuum that could plunge the territory 
into chaos, similar to what followed Portuguese withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said in Dili that he could not  
confirm a news report that three local U.N. staff members had been 
killed there. The slaying of one staffer after polls closed Monday 
was widely reported at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	In Geneva, Switzerland, the U.N. refugee agency said it was  
talking to Australian officials about setting up a base in the city 
of Darwin ``in case some major aid operation is needed in East 
Timor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said it fears a new flood of people could be  
displaced despite Monday's relatively peaceful referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and U.N. advisers spent several hours negotiating the  
safe passage of a 17-vehicle convoy trying to leave Gleno in Ermera 
district, about 28 miles southwest to the capital, Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	In the town of Hera, 10 miles south of Dili, hundreds of militia  
members armed with machetes and homemade guns roamed the streets 
searching for independence activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't try to come in here. It is very dangerous,'' said one of  
the militiamen. 
</P>
<P>
	The blockade took place as the United Nations estimated that  
98.6 percent of East Timor's 438,000 registered voters had taken 
part in Monday's ballot. Another 13,000 voted overseas. The ballot 
gave Timorese the choice between remaining part of Indonesia as an 
autonomous region or independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Poll observers and independent activists say the high voter  
participation points to a big victory for those wanting to break 
free of Indonesia, which invaded in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	President B.J. Habibie said today the election was ``very good,  
peaceful and fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is that we have to honor the decision  
of the East Timorese people,'' Habibie told reporters in Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	Eurico Guterres, the leader of Dili's Aitarak militia, said  
pro-independence students and members of the political elite could 
not leave East Timor from today on. 
</P>
<P>
	Roadblocks were reportedly set up on highways leading out of the  
territory. Departing independence activists had been stopped and 
turned around, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the airport, one witness said the militias ``stood outside  
the terminal at the airport and grabbed tickets out of the hands of 
passengers.'' The person spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing 
reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
	Five militia members chased an ethnic Chinese family out of the  
terminal after they had checked into a flight bound for the 
Indonesian tourist island of Bali. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian airport police ordered the gang members to stop but  
were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	Guterres said the blockade would last until at least the result  
of the vote is announced by the United Nations on or before Sept. 
7. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said today that Indonesia will hand  
over the interim administration of East Timor to the United Nations 
-- not to Portugal, which hastily pulled out of their troubled 
colony nearly a quarter-century ago before Indonesia invaded. 
</P>
<P>
	A 25-member reconciliation commission, made up of pro- and  
anti-independence representatives was scheduled to convene its 
inaugural meeting today, but the session fell apart when the 
militias walked out, saying they'd been the targets of U.N. bias 
and an ``international conspiracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have withdrawn from these important negotiations with  
UNAMET,'' said Basilio Dias Araujo, a spokesman for one of the 
militias, using the acronym for the United Nations' elections team 
in East Timor. ``Clearly UNAMET has violated the polling 
regulations which it itself had laid down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations today denied the accusations, but said any  
wrongdoing by staff members would be investigated by an independent 
electoral body. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people have expressed themselves massively,'' Wimhurst  
said. ``It is imperative that everybody lays down their arms and 
ceases all violent activity as it is completely futile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, hundreds of blue plastic ballot boxes were brought into  
the provincial capital, Dili, by white U.N. helicopters from tiny 
villages across the half-island territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting is expected to start Wednesday at the city's museum.  
Poll organizers say the centralized vote count will ensure voter 
secrecy and lessen the risk of reprisals after months of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Observers, including officials from rival factions, will be  
allowed to monitor the count. 
</P>
<P>
	However, they will be sworn to secrecy to prevent false and  
incomplete results being leaked, said Carina Pirelli, the chief of 
the U.N.'s Electoral Assistance Division.

<HEADLINE> Finances Eyed in Gingrich Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA, Ga. (AP) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich wants to  
use a financial agreement he worked out with his wife more than 10 
years ago to settle his pending divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich filed a request Friday in Cobb County Superior Court  
asking a judge to rely on a separation agreement signed by the 
couple and notarized in December 1987. There is no indication the 
agreement was ever filed. 
</P>
<P>
	The request comes about three weeks after Gingrich's wife,  
Marianne, asked a judge to freeze the couple's assets until their 
divorce is final. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gingrich claims her husband transferred ``substantial  
portions of certain valuable assets'' before filing for divorce. 
Gingrich has denied the allegation. A hearing on her request is 
scheduled Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The separation agreement -- worked out during a six-year  
separation -- called for Mrs. Gingrich to get $2,000 a month for six 
months, control over money market and checking accounts and the 
couple's 1984 Ford Thunderbird. It made Gingrich responsible for 
the couple's bank loans and a Hecht's department store account. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple also divided the furniture in their Washington  
residence and in their apartment in Jonesboro. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple married in 1981, just months after Gingrich divorced  
his first wife, Jackie Battley. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich's divorce attorney, Thomas Browning, said Mrs. Gingrich  
called her husband on his birthday in June 1987 to tell him she was 
leaving him. Gingrich, he said, returned to Georgia to find an 
empty home. 
</P>
<P>
	``All she left was a television and a guest bed,'' Browning  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Gingriches maintained separate residences for six  
years before reconciling in late 1993 or early 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich resigned as House Speaker after Republicans lost seats  
in the 1998 elections. He again separated from his wife May 10 and 
filed for divorce July 29, amid allegations of an affair with 
33-year-old congressional aide Callista Bisek. 
</P>
<P>
	Randolph Evans, Gingrich's attorney, has denied the allegation.  
</P>
<P>
	In court papers filed Friday, Gingrich's attorneys indicated  
they would not oppose the deposition of Ms. Bisek, which is 
tentatively scheduled for Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gingrich, a county planner and business consultant from  
Ohio, referred questions pertaining to the divorce to attorney John 
Mayoue. Mayoue was out of his office Monday and could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich now runs a political consulting firm.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Economic Growth Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Australia's economic growth slowed to  
4.1 percent in the three months ending June 30, as investment 
slumped and exports remained subdued, official data released 
Wednesday showed. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's gross domestic product grew by 0.2 percent,  
seasonally adjusted, in the year's second quarter, the Australian 
Bureau of Statistics said. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterly result was below market expectations, which  
centered on a rise of about 0.5 percent for the quarter after 
revised 1.4 percent GDP growth in the previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau said the major contributors to growth were increased  
household consumption spending and a rise in stocks, while imports 
and a decline in spending on buildings and structures detracted 
from GDP growth. 
</P>
<P>
	In seasonally adjusted terms, exports of goods and services were  
flat in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasurer Peter Costello said the overall result for the 12  
months ending June 30 -- an average growth rate of 4.5 percent -- was 
above the government's forecasts despite the latest slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been predicting a slowdown which is consistent with  
these numbers,'' Costello said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Costello said domestic demand was set to continue, underpinning  
strong job growth, high productivity, healthy corporate 
profitability, historically low interest rates and low inflation 
outcomes. 
</P>
<P>
	The treasurer said the data also confirmed that inflation was  
low and that tax reforms to begin in July 1, 2000, would further 
boost growth.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Replace Brister at QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Bubby is out and Brian is in.  
</P>
<P>
	In a stunning move, Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan on Monday  
benched quarterback Bubby Brister, the heir apparent to the retired 
John Elway, and elevated second-year pro Brian Griese into the 
starting role. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two weeks before the start of the regular season, the  
Broncos decided to go with a talented but unproven quarterback who 
has never started an NFL game. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Griese has played in just one NFL regular-season game,  
subbing for Brister in the fourth quarter of a victory over 
Philadelphia last season going 1-of-3 for 2 yards with an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan, whose team is seeking an unprecedented third straight  
Super Bowl title, seemed unfazed by what most observers called a 
risky gamble. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that Bubby Brister has not played at the level I  
think he can,'' Shanahan said. ``It's that Brian Griese has played 
so well throughout camp and preseason games that I think he 
deserves that opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I didn't feel like Brian could take us all the way, I  
wouldn't have ever made this decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The change was made a day after the Broncos were embarrassed  
22-12 in Dallas, their second straight dismal performance on 
national television. Denver was routed 27-12 by Green Bay in the 
previous game. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, 37, inherited the starting job after going 4-0 in the  
games he started last season in place of the injured Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	But under his stewardship, the two-time Super Bowl champions are  
just 2-2 this preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure to replace a guy like John Elway is tremendous,  
and the scrutiny by the media is something that is overwhelming,'' 
Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	During four preseason games, Brister completed 31 of 50 passes  
for 302 yards, no touchdowns and three interceptions for a 
quarterback rating of 53.9. He twice threw interceptions on his 
first pass attempt of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brister's defense, the Broncos' first-team offense has not  
performed well as a unit. An abundance of penalties, missed 
assignments and dropped passes have plagued the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our offensive woes are not the fault of one player,'' Shanahan  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense has not played much better either, and as a team the  
Broncos have averaged at least eight penalties this preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	But Griese has shined in the preseason, even if most of his work  
has come against second- and third-team defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said Griese has impressed him in ``everything he does --  
how he handles himself on offense, running game, passing game; how 
he handles himself in the huddle; the way he understands defense; 
his protection scheme, how he handles himself with the blitz under 
fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griese, 24, who led Michigan to a Rose Bowl victory and a shared  
national championship in 1998, has completed 56 of 84 passes for 
605 yards, Denver's six touchdowns and one interception for a 106.5 
rating in the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Brian) has consistently played better than I thought he would  
at this point in his career, and that's why he's getting this 
chance,'' Shanahan said. ``He's been playing against the first-team 
defense (in practice), and he picks this (offensive scheme) up as 
quick as anyone I've ever been around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griese, the son of Hall of Fame quarterback Bob Griese of the  
Miami Dolphins, will play a minimum of two series with the first 
team in Denver's final preseason game against the San Francisco 
49ers on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said he may play as long as one half, with Denver's  
third-string quarterback, Chris Miller, playing the other half. 
Brister, allowed to skip Monday's running drills, might not play 
against the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a veteran who was out of football three years because of  
recurring concussions, signed with the Broncos last spring. He has 
played sparingly because of persistent tendinitis in his throwing 
elbow, but Shanahan said the quarterback threw without pain Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said he will know more about Miller's status on  
Wednesday when the team returns to the practice field. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought Brister would come back to work Wednesday  
with a positive attitude, Shanahan said: ``I just know what kind of 
guy Bubby is. He'll be there just like he has been in the past. 
He's disappointed, but he's going to come back in and support 
Brian, just like Brian has supported him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brian's going to have some growing pains,'' Shanahan said. If  
necessary, ``Bubby can come in and provide the spark, just like he 
did last year.''

<HEADLINE> Teens Shop for Back-to-School Wear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Forget worries about tough teachers  
and too much homework. 
</P>
<P>
	With the start of the school year around the corner, kids today  
are more concerned about one thing: What should they wear? 
</P>
<P>
	Are flare jeans in or out? What pant styles look best rolled up  
at the bottom? Is orange the ``hot'' color? Are flower appliques 
acceptable in the fall? 
</P>
<P>
	The back-to-school shopping season is well under way, and the  
nation's stores and malls are filled with parents and children 
seeking out the must-have fashion items of the new school year. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to the booming economy, retailers are expecting sales to  
be particularly strong this year as shoppers buy up everything from 
new clothes and shoes to notebooks and pens. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent study of 1,500 parents and teens by American Express  
found that families planned to spend $455 per child on 
back-to-school purchases, up 12 percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	And even with all of the recent hype about the Internet, the  
survey found that only 4 percent of teens were making some of their 
back-to-school purchases online. The rest were heading straight to 
the mall. 
</P>
<P>
	One recent afternoon, a reporter checked out what's hot for  
back-to-school with a group of teens spending the day at The 
Westchester, a mall in the New York suburb of White Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could spend days at the mall getting ready to go back to  
school. It's really important to look good the first few days we 
get back,'' said 16-year-old Jenny Fleisher. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Fleisher's first trip to the mall for back-to-school  
shopping, one of many visits that will come in the next few weeks. 
She was accompanied by other soon-to-be 11th graders -- Jamie 
Horowitz and Amanda Kremer -- her best friends and fashion 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	The first scream of shopping bliss came five minutes into the  
five-hour outing and it could be heard across the selling floor 
</P>
<P>
	``That is soooo cute!'' bellowed Fleisher, pointing to a pair of  
black flared pants her friend was holding up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to try them on,'' said Horowitz. ``Love them.''  
</P>
<P>
	Yes, flared pants were the big thing of the day. Also popular  
were khakis, or anything with cargo pockets or drawstrings. The 
three young women combed through hundreds of pairs of pants in 
stores such as Nordstrom, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, J. Crew and Guess. 
</P>
<P>
	As for when to cuff the bottoms of their pants, the group said  
it was OK to roll up those with straight legs but never those with 
a flare. 
</P>
<P>
	When it came to color, orange was it. Really it. All they wanted  
was orange -- whether it was solid or just a hint of the bold color 
in belts, shirts and shoes. At Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, khakis with an 
orange accent around the ankle got big cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The orange makes it soooo cool and trendy,'' Horowitz said.  
``I bought a belt with orange yesterday and just love it. It is so 
different from anything I own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forget wearing sleeves that come down to the wrist. Every shirt  
that they eyed had cropped sleeves -- most coming slightly below the 
elbow. Some came in T-shirt material, while others buttoned up. All 
had a touch of Lycra to make them stretchy. 
</P>
<P>
	Appliques were also popular -- on the neckline, on the ankle,  
along the sleeve. Flowers, yes. Asian designs, very much yes. But 
``nothing too big and no big labels. We hate big labels,'' said 
Kremer. 
</P>
<P>
	Then onto shoes. Adidas and Puma sneakers -- resembling those  
worn in the 1980s -- were must-haves, not for phys ed but to wear to 
class. Also noteworthy were platform shoes with super-size heels: 
``They make me so tall but who cares. They look good. I can't 
resist,'' Fleisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time they left the mall, the three -- whose bills were  
being paid by their parents -- had purchased five pairs of pants, 
seven shirts, four pairs of shoes, one beaded necklace and one MAC 
lipstick. Total for the day: almost $800. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not bad for a day's work,'' Fleisher said. ``But don't think  
we are done. We've just begun to scratch the surface. Once we go to 
school, I'm sure we will see more things we like and then we'll be 
running back here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the 11th graders were buying up a storm, Fleisher's  
12-year-old sister, Sara, and her two friends were also circling 
the mall. It was the first time that they had gone back-to-school 
shopping without their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the older girls, they went for the casual look.  
Oversized, stretch athletic pants with matching shirts. They loved 
sweatshirts, especially those with hoods. And anything fleece -- 
vests, pants, shirts, hats -- was an absolute. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about being comfortable,'' said Tiffany Betz, a  
seventh grader from Harrison, N.Y. ``I like looking good but I 
don't want to wear stuff that isn't comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Fleisher made the big purchase of the group, buying a gray  
and black fleece vest and a long-sleeve shirt from Abercrombie &AMP; 
Fitch. Both items had a huge ``Abercrombie'' labels on them. 
</P>
<P>
	But before she made the purchase, she consulted with shopping  
buddy Krista Ventura, who is considered one of the fashionable 
girls in school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Labels are soooo important,'' Ventura said. ``You want  
everyone to know where you are buying it, especially Abercrombie 
because everyone likes this store.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other things that the younger girls were hot to have:  
$14 glass ball bracelets. The different colors mean different 
things -- intelligence, money, serenity, happiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are definitely what everyone will have when we get to  
school and I didn't have any, so I decided that I'd get two,'' Sara 
Fleisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also popular -- and a must-have for the first day back at school  
-- are tattoos. The three were searching for cool temporary tattoos 
to apply to their upper arms and ankles. 
</P>
<P>
	But the big spending was really left to the older girls. The  
12-year-olds did lots of browsing, but were still nervous about 
forking over big bucks without their parents' consent. They ended 
the day spending about $170. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still like shopping with my mom,'' said Sara Fleisher.  
``Sometimes I still need her input.''

<HEADLINE> Vail Resort Lands in Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- The nation's largest ski resort is up to its  
neck in legal troubles for carving a dirt logging road across a 
bog. 
</P>
<P>
	Vail Resorts has said it was an honest mistake. And for nearly a  
year, until the Army Corps of Engineers realized what the resort 
had done, no one even noticed that the temporary road had been 
built in the wrong spot and was spilling sediment into a protected 
half-acre wetlands area. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, however, the resort could be looking at millions in fines,  
after having already spent years fending off environmentalists over 
its plans to open new ski trails in the backcountry. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Environmental Protection Agency determines a violation of  
the Clean Water Act occurred, the resort could be hit with civil 
fines of up to $27,500 a day since the road was built. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the Army Corps of Engineers has closed the  
road, leaving the resort with more than a million board-feet of cut 
timber with no way to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's a road Vail Resorts never wanted to build. The U.S.  
Forest Service had ordered Vail to build the road so logging trucks 
could remove the timber without rumbling through the 
tourist-clogged village. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Allender, the resort's planning director, said he got  
confused when building the road because surveyors had left three 
proposed routes marked with ribbons through the wilderness. But 
that is no defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``If fill material is discharged into the waters of the United  
States without a permit, it is a violation. It's worse if they knew 
they were breaking the law, but whether it was unintentional 
doesn't change anything,'' said Steve Ireland of the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clean Water Act requires permits for construction through  
wetlands to protect migratory birds and other fauna. 
</P>
<P>
	The road is another chapter in the decades-long, controversial  
effort by Vail Resorts to complete a $14 million, 885-acre 
expansion project that will be powder heaven for intermediate 
skiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists recently lost a legal challenge to the  
project, arguing unsuccessfully that the Forest Service didn't 
adequately assess the effect on wildlife, specifically the lynx. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Earth Liberation Front claimed responsibility for an  
outbreak of fires at the resort that caused $12 million in damage. 
The eco-terrorist group cited the threat to lynx habitat as a 
motive. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to any fine, Vail Resorts will have to pay the fix  
the damage to the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the cut timber, the wood may have to be burned on site,  
eliminating the need for the logging road. The logging trucks could 
be brought through town, though that would probably trigger another 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, Vail could be required to build a new road, though federal  
wildlife experts oppose that because it would cause even more 
environmental damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Vail is pursuing the expansion work, hoping for  
completion by the 2000-2001 ski season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that pains me the most is I think that we have done  
a spectacular job'' in the expansion area,'' Allender said. ``But 
it doesn't matter. We're never going to get an ounce of credit.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles Complete Baines Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles on Tuesday acquired  
left-hander Jimmy Hamilton as the player to be named in the trade 
that sent Harold Baines to the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Baines was traded to Cleveland last Friday. The Orioles earlier  
acquired right-hander Juan Aracena in the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, 24, is in his fourth professional season. He was 1-2  
with a 5.18 ERA in 24 games for Triple-A Buffalo. He was called up 
to Buffalo on June 20 after starting the season at Double-A Akron, 
where he was 0-2 with a 3.73 ERA in 25 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He has pitched exclusively in relief the last two seasons after  
spending two years as a starter. Hamilton will be assigned to the 
Orioles' Triple-A affiliate in Rochester.

<HEADLINE> NHL Vote on Penguins Sale Proceeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The NHL's vote scheduled for Wednesday on  
Mario Lemieux's bid to buy the Pittsburgh Penguins is expected to 
take place before the Hall of Fame center formally takes control of 
team. League officials say that timetable is not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL spokesman Frank Brown said league approval to sell the team,  
if it comes, would be made contingent on the bankruptcy court in 
Pittsburgh also approving the deal. The league's governing body 
will vote in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you move into a house that needs (to be) painted,''  
Brown said. ``This is no different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, who if the deal is completed will be the first athlete  
from a major professional franchise to buy his former team, still 
needs to work out details of a $5 million investment in the team 
from SMG, a Philadelphia-based partnership that manages the Civic 
Arena, where the Penguins play home games. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports Tuesday night that Lemieux and SMG had  
reached an oral agreement and could be ready by Thursday to seek 
court approval for the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	But there have been many delays in previous deadlines to  
complete the transaction, and officials close to the deal were 
reluctant to set another one. 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins' attorney Douglas A. Campbell said talks Tuesday with  
SMG had been productive but had not produced a final agreement. 
Campbell declined to elaborate on the talks, and SMG president and 
chief executive officer Wes Westley did not return a telephone 
message left for him Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations with SMG have been the most difficult for Lemieux  
to resolve. The Penguins blamed the high cost of their lease with 
SMG to play at the arena for helping push the franchise into 
bankruptcy in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Under U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz's threat to cancel  
the Penguins' lease, SMG agreed to a new deal. The Penguins will 
pay $1.8 million a year until 2007 instead of the $6 million to $7 
million annually the club had paid in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Joseph F. McDonough, who represents a bank and three  
life insurance companies that loaned the team $22 million, was 
surprised by the continuing delays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm astounded these things keep popping up,'' McDonough said.  
``We're at a practical end to the whole process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins' training camp opens Saturday, and the first  
exhibition game is Sept. 11 against the New York Islanders.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Probably Won't Seek Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, locked in  
a potentially nasty divorce fight, sees himself as a future adviser 
to presidents and congressional leaders rather than as a candidate 
for public office. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first detailed interview since deciding to step down as  
speaker last year, Gingrich said he probably won't run for public 
office again but hasn't ruled it out completely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect to,'' Gingrich said in the interview with  
C-SPAN, the public affairs cable network that broadcasts House and 
Senate proceedings. ``I mean, I wouldn't rule it out, but I don't 
expect to. I think I've contributed to that part. I'd rather be an 
adviser to presidents and speakers and Senate majority leaders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he could see himself running for president someday,  
Gingrich replied, ``I don't think so. ... I see myself developing 
the next generation of ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The interview, conducted by C-SPAN chairman Brian Lamb, will air  
in three parts on consecutive nights beginning tonight. C-SPAN 
released a transcript Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview was taped last month on the day Gingrich filed for  
divorce from his second wife, Marianne Gingrich. Since then, the 
Georgia Republican has been linked romantically through the divorce 
proceedings with Callista Bisek, 33, who worked for the House while 
he was speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Gingrich was asked only once about the divorce  
filing. He said his wife is ``a wonderful person, and a very smart 
person, and we've had a very long and complex relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While not asked directly about his relationship with Ms. Bisek,  
Gingrich said no personal factors influenced his decision to resign 
from the House and give up his speakership after the GOP's poor 
showing in the 1998 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the public has a right to know ``about the lives of  
powerful people because you're loaning them power.'' But he said he 
said there should be a line drawn at inquiring into the private 
lives of public officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always tried to draw the distinction with President Clinton  
between his personal behavior and lying to a federal grand jury, 
because I think there's a very big difference,'' he said. ``One is 
a violation of the law ... the other is private life. And I think 
that's a very big difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich said he has no regrets about his resignation and he's  
purposely remained quiet to keep from interfering with his 
successor, Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois. He also wanted time 
for personal reflection and study, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I've learned enough, I'll start talking again,'' he said.  
``But other than doing a retrospective like this, I don't feel that 
I'm ready yet to offer something comparable to the Contract (With 
America) and to talk about ideas at the right level to really make 
much sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The interview covers Gingrich's political career from his early  
years in the House as a back-bench rabble-rouser through his 
successful campaign to oust Democrat Jim Wright of Texas from the 
speakership to his own four-year term in the speaker's chair. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich complained throughout the interview about a double  
standard, which he contends was applied to him by congressional 
Democrats through repeated accusations of ethics violations and by 
the media, who covered the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a different set of rules for Newt Gingrich,'' he  
said, ``and I think in retrospect it's because I was the person who 
led the charge to take control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich is credited with leading Republicans back to control of  
the House in 1994 for the first time in 40 years. Two years later, 
he agreed to pay a $300,000 penalty and accept a House reprimand 
for failing to seek proper legal advice on using tax-exempt 
projects to advance his political goals and for allowing inaccurate 
statements to be provided to the House ethics committee.

<HEADLINE> Colts Release Lineman Leeuwenburg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indianapolis continued rebuilding its  
offense Tuesday with the release of Jay Leeuwenburg, the Colts' 
most experienced offensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts got down to the league roster limit by terminating the  
contract of Leeuwenburg, who lost his starting job during training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Leeuwenburg, who started 37 consecutive games for the Colts,  
made every offensive snap last year at center for a line that 
allowed only 22 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	He was replaced in the starting lineup by second-year pro Larry  
Moore, who was moved from guard. Moore's spot on the starting line 
was taken over by Waverly Jackson, another second-year lineman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prior to the start of training camp, back in May and in early  
June, we brought Jay in and told him that we were going to rotate 
him with Larry and Waverly,'' Colts coach Jim Mora said. ``We told 
him that we felt like we had some good young offensive linemen here 
that we wanted to take a long look at. 
</P>
<P>
	``We told Jay that he would have the chance to compete for a  
starting job. But as camp progressed, we decided that we wanted to 
go with Larry at center and Waverly at guard. We thought that they 
had played well enough through training camp to have the 
opportunity to start for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mora said that the decision to let the veteran Leeuwenburg go  
was not an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I've been here and long before that, Jay has been a  
consummate professional for the Indianapolis Colts,'' the coach 
said. ``It was a tough decision to let Jay go. ... He's been a true 
leader on this ballclub since he's been here. 
</P>
<P>
	``But, I told Jay that the guys we have are playing better at  
this time of their careers than he was. ... That's why we made the 
move. It was not a decision made for the future. We're looking at 
it as a now decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leeuwenburg was scheduled to be paid $1.3 million in the last  
year of the four-year contract he signed in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``He handled it very professionally,'' Mora said of the release.  
``He accepted it with a lot of class. I know it was not easy for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leeuwenburg, 30, was starting his eighth NFL season. He had  
started 48 consecutive games for the Chicago Bears before signing 
with the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	The release gives the Colts an offensive line with two players  
starting their third year in the league and three second-year

<HEADLINE> Charismatic Ready for Life As Stud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERSAILLES, Ky. (AP) -- Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes  
winner Charismatic, who broke down near the finish of the Belmont 
Stakes, is getting ready for his career as a stud horse. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane's End Farm said Charismatic, who was co-bred by Lane's End  
owner William Farish and is owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, arrived 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane's End expects to begin hand-walking the colt this week. His  
stud career begins next year, and his stud fee will be $35,000 for 
a live foal. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic ran twice in $62,500 claiming races last winter,  
then emerged unexpectedly as the best of the 3-year-old crop, 
winning the Lexington Stakes, Kentucky Derby and Preakness in 
succession. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into the Belmont on June 9, the D. Wayne Lukas-trained  
colt was poised to be the first horse to sweep the Triple Crown 
since Affirmed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Belmont, Charismatic led with an eighth of a mile to go,  
but took a bad step and fractured his left foreleg as Lemon Drop 
Kid swept by to win. Charismatic finished third, 1 1/2 lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have said the fracture, which shattered Charismatic's  
cannon bone and broke his sesamoid, easily could have proved fatal 
had the bone broken the skin. They praised jockey Chris Antley for 
dismounting quickly and lifting Charismatic's injured leg to take 
weight off it. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic had surgery and has been recuperating in Lukas' barn  
at Belmont.

<HEADLINE> Contract War in Options Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The same competitive threat from electronic  
trading systems that has taken U.S. stock exchanges by storm has 
emerged recently as the catalyst for dramatic changes in the more 
obscure world of options trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned opening in January 2000 of an alternative electronic  
options exchange -- called the International Securities Exchange -- 
has prompted three of the four existing options exchanges to 
encroach on one another's territory, breaking a long-standing 
policy of allowing each exchange exclusive trading rights certain 
popular options. The policy is known as single listing. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the  
largest of the four bricks and mortar exchanges, fired the first 
salvo when it began trading Dell Computer Corp.'s options, one of 
the most widely traded contracts in the options market, which for 
years had traded exclusively through the Philadelphia Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	CBOE Chairman William Brodsky said the decision to open a  
competitive war was easy. ``We wanted to control our own destiny,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the face of pending competition from the electronic exchange,  
CBOE officials felt they should reach out for market share wherever 
the opportunity presented itself, Brodsky explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Options are generally used to hedge bets against stock  
investments. An option allows the purchaser the right to buy or 
sell stock at a specific price for a fraction of the cost of buying 
the actual stock. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than two decades, the four U.S. options exchanges -- the  
CBOE, the Philadelphia exchange, the American Stock Exchange and 
the Pacific Stock Exchange -- had agreed not to list each others' 
popular contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry claimed the policy came about and stayed in place  
because the exchanges saved money by not having to build the 
support systems needed to trade all of the existing popular 
contracts. Instead, each exchange was content to have a handful of 
singly-listed, high-volume contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The single-listing policy has recently come under scrutiny,  
however, from the U.S. Justice Department, which is investigating 
whether the exchanges colluded to keep the policy in place in order 
eliminate competition and artificially keep trading costs high. The 
exchanges have denied collusion. 
</P>
<P>
	But whatever arrangement existed between the exchanges became  
moot when the ISE announced plans to open an electronic exchange 
where investors will be able to trade 600 of the most popular 
options cheaper and faster than on the traditional exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia exchange retaliated immediately against the  
CBOE's encroachment by introducing trading in Coca Cola Co. and 
Apple Computer Inc. options. Coca Cola's options had previously 
been exclusive to the CBOE, and Apple to the Amex. The Amex, in 
turn, also began trading Dell options. 
</P>
<P>
	And the war has escalated since then, with the participating  
exchanges upping the ante almost daily by listing more and more 
previously singly-listed contracts. The Pacific Exchange has so far 
stayed out of the fray. 
</P>
<P>
	The demise of the single-listing policy was inevitable once the  
ISE filed with the Securities and Exchange to become an options 
exchange, said Michael Schwartz, chief options strategist at 
investment bank CIBC Oppenheimer and chairman of the Committee on 
Options Proposals, an industry group. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all boils down to competition,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The effect of the ISE has been felt in other areas of the  
options industry, as well. For example, the traditional exchanges 
have slashed their trading fees by as much as 30 percent in order 
to retain customers once the alternative exchange opens. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes are being driven by options trading's increasing  
popularity. Trading volume in equity options nationwide has nearly 
doubled this decade, to 406 million in 1998 from 210 million in 
1990, according to CBOE statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there are potential pitfalls to the increased level of  
competition in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Some options experts argue that the options market could become  
too fragmented as exchanges vie for market share among popular 
contracts. Since the various exchanges aren't currently linked, 
investors may have trouble finding the best price available. The 
same criticism has been leveled at the electronic stock trading 
systems that are putting competitive pressure on the New York Stock 
Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have fragmented markets, getting the best execution  
is difficult without linkage,'' said Joseph Stefanelli, executive 
vice president for derivatives securities at the Amex. ``And the 
more markets are fragmented, the more difficult it is to access the 
best market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is also concern that the computer system used by the  
exchanges to distribute price quotes will become overloaded if the 
system has to carry data on every contract traded on each exchange. 
In the past, single listings held the volume of information in 
check.

<HEADLINE> Competitors Snipe at New Dictionary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- The first new English dictionary in 30  
years is being billed as more contemporary, more global and more 
tuned-in than the hidebound tomes collecting dust on the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
	Assembled by 320 editors and consultants in 20 countries via --  
you guessed it -- e-mail, the Encarta World English Dictionary 
promises to define the pop culture of ``yadda yadda yadda'' 
alongside the linguistic legacy of Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
	But rival publishers say the new dictionary backed by the  
resources of Microsoft may be a little too hip -- why, they wonder, 
is Madonna the pop singer placed before Madonna the mother of 
Christ? 
</P>
<P>
	``If the name Microsoft provides the user with no more  
guarantees about the reliability of its dictionaries than ... its 
software, then people will not take the dictionaries to be 
particularly authoritative,'' said Geoffrey Nunberg, a Stanford 
University linguist and chairman of a usage panel at competing 
American Heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	The established publishers began sniping at Encarta shortly  
after its arrival on store shelves last month. They scoffed at such 
editorial decisions as including a picture of Microsoft founder 
Bill Gates, but not ones of Adolf Hitler or even President John F. 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tight market,'' said Garrett Kiely, an executive at  
Microsoft's dictionary publishing partner, St. Martin's Press. ``We 
are a new entry into the dictionary world. Microsoft is a big entry 
into it. People get their toes stepped on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selling for $50, the print version of Encarta directly competes  
with ``The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,'' 
which came out in 1969 in response to criticism that 
Merriam-Webster's dictionary was getting too trendy. 
</P>
<P>
	The new dictionary defines such neologisms as nose stud,  
no-fly-zone, and the yadda yadda yadda of Seinfeld fame. But 
critics fault a preachy tone that labels words like ``crone'' and 
``butch'' as offensive but dares not even define them. 
</P>
<P>
	They also fault some outright mistakes. Union Gen. George Gordon  
Meade, for example, is incorrectly identified as a Revolutionary 
War soldier; he fought in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	In perhaps the greatest irony, some critics wonder why Microsoft  
didn't push the technology further. Why not have a much larger 
Internet dictionary with links to demonstrate a word's context? Why 
not provide access to much more of Encarta's database, with almost 
limitless illustrations, audio and video? 
</P>
<P>
	``As technology has changed our lives, something as traditional  
as a dictionary hasn't changed all that much,'' Kiely said. Thus, 
Encarta is full of ``quick definitions'' that summarize, in bold 
face, the longer definitions ``in a bow to the way we live today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As far as the other criticisms, Kiely said typos are inevitable  
in a work of 3.5 million words and that the many flags for 
offensive language simply reflect today's realities. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps predictably, Merriam-Webster, the Springfield-based  
industry leader, has also given Encarta a poor review. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it's always exciting to see something new come on the  
market ... we're pretty confident that the Merriam-Webster 
Collegiate Dictionary brings with it an air of authority and years 
of experience,'' said Deborah Burns, the marketing director for 
Merriam-Webster. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiely points to the technological advances of the new dictionary  
as one of its benefits: With Encarta built entirely on a computer 
database, it will be easy to update the print or CD-ROM versions. 
</P>
<P>
	But he acknowledged it will be hard for Microsoft to crack the  
market: ``Americans keep their first dictionary for a very long 
time.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Inconvenient, Not Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOREHEAD CITY, N.C. (AP) -- The 50-foot oak in Patty Russell's  
front yard survived more than a century of hurricanes. More than 
that, it had survived generations of kids playing in its gnarled, 
moss-encrusted branches. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had nails right here and nails right here, and we would use  
the nails to climb up,'' the Morehead City woman said. ``We never 
built a tree house in it because Daddy wouldn't let us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Hurricane Dennis passed through, the massive tree with the  
10 1/2-foot girth lay against her house, broken off just about the 
ground, one of its branches through her kitchen window. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to miss my tree,'' Mrs. Russell said Monday as her  
13-year-old son, Stephen, sawed off stray limbs. ``A lot of 
memories tied up in that tree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as bad as Dennis was for the Russells, he was little more  
than a blowhard compared to past North Carolina storms like Fran, 
Bonnie and Bertha. 
</P>
<P>
	``A mullet blow is what we call this,'' Jeff Turnage, a line  
serviceman for Carolina Power &AMP; Light Co., said as he surveyed 
downed power lines in Atlantic Beach on Monday. ``Just a lot of 
wind and rain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although some residents of North Carolina's fragile Outer Banks  
were surprised by the high winds and rain, there was a sense that 
things could have been a lot worse along the state's southern 
coastline. 
</P>
<P>
	But forecasters warned not to write off Dennis too quickly. The  
National Hurricane Center in Miami said Dennis would stall at sea 
for a few days, then come back toward the coast possibly near 
Norfolk, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Dennis steered mostly clear of southeastern Virginia,  
but caused blustery conditions that left flooded streets, scattered 
power outages and other minor damage behind in Hampton Roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Tides in Virginia Beach were at about 6 feet, or a couple feet  
above normal, and there were reports of minor coastal flooding, 
said Mark Marchbank, deputy coordinator of emergency services for 
Virginia Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	In Norfolk and Chesapeake, flood waters made several  
intersections impassable. 
</P>
<P>
	Langley Air Force Base in Hampton planned to send 36 F-15  
fighter jets to Grissom Air Reserve Base in Indiana. But the 
crosswinds were so high that the planes could not leave and had to 
be tied down on the flight line instead, Langley spokeswoman Lt. 
Dawnita Bruner said. Fifteen jets were moved to hangars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy sometimes sends ships to sea during bad weather, but  
Monday decided to let ships ride out the storm at their piers at 
the Norfolk Naval Station. Sailors were on standby in case plans 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Thunderous surf and lethal rip tides from Dennis also closed  
beaches up and down the Maryland and Delaware coasts. Most people 
abandoned the beaches for shelter from the wind, and those that 
wanted to test the rough water found themselves barred by 
lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our water's completely closed,'' said Capt. Tim Ferry of the  
Bethany Beach, Del., beach patrol. ``We're not even allowing people 
to wade in the shallow stuff because that tide is so dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina's Morehead City, an empty tin grain silo on  
U.S. Highway 70 blew down, and the Sanitary Fish Market lost its 
awning and some roof. Down the road at the 60s and 70s Museum, a 
plywood cutout of late rocker Jim Morrison took a ride on the 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The high winds overturned newspaper boxes and garbage cans in  
Beaufort, and the heavy rains flooded some low-lying streets in 
Atlantic Beach. But there were very few injuries or structural 
damage reported in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Duffey and four friends were delivering a 35-foot fishing  
boat, the Carp, from New York to Sebastian, Fla., when Dennis 
forced them to make an unscheduled stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any other idiots out here?'' the Long Island man screamed as  
the group scrambled to tie the vessel up at the Gulf Dock in 
Morehead City. ``We're living on the edge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not long after Dennis skirted the coast, people in Morehead City  
were venturing into the trash- and limb-strewn streets. On the 
waterfront, neither Jeremy Coy of Newport nor his children, Summer 
and Aaron, seemed impressed by Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This one right here has been slack,'' Coy said.  
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Raines Sees Former Teammates in NY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tim Raines brought laughter to the New York  
Yankees' clubhouse so often last season, lightening the mood with a 
subtle dig or a practical joke. 
</P>
<P>
	So it was only appropriate that his former teammates played the  
joke on Raines, when he saw them for the first time since learning 
he had Lupus. 
</P>
<P>
	Raines, traveling with the Oakland Athletics for the first time  
since leaving the team with the chronic illness earlier this month, 
came to Yankee Stadium on Monday night to visit with friends and 
receive his World Series ring from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Raines walked onto the field to a standing ovation from the  
crowd, the Yankees and the Athletics. New York manager Joe Torre 
handed him a box, Raines opened it and it was empty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees broke into laughter as they went en masse toward  
Raines. Bernie Williams handed his former teammate his ring, and 
Raines joined them in laughter and a hug. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was emotional. Very emotional,'' Raines said of seeing his  
former teammates. ``This was my first time seeing these guys since 
this happened. It's my first time back in New York since the World 
Series parade. It's been an emotional day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been a lot of emotional days recently for Raines, who  
has a disease with no known cure. Lupus is a connective tissue 
disease in which the immune system turns against a person's own 
body. It affects various parts of the body, especially the skin, 
joints, blood and kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Its symptoms can be treated and Raines is taking medication  
daily and intravenous treatment once a month. While his season is 
over, the 39-year-old Raines vows to return to baseball by spring 
training and still is committed to one day playing with his son, 
Tim Jr., who is in the Baltimore Orioles' farm system. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the one thing I want to do,'' Raines said. '' I want to  
do the Griffey thing. I'm going to play again. I know that. I can 
play five or six more years. I feel like a rookie again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raines became bloated and mysteriously gained 15 pounds near the  
All-Star break. A kidney biopsy was performed July 23 and he was 
then diagnosed with Lupus. 
</P>
<P>
	Raines underwent four days of treatment in the hospital, where  
he was given high doses of medications designed to relieve the 
swelling in his kidneys and to try keep his immune system from 
attacking his own body. 
</P>
<P>
	He has since lost about 25 pounds and has already begun to taper  
off his medication. Doctors say if the disease is in remission, 
Raines could return to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Raines, one of baseball's top base stealers and leadoff hitters  
during his 20-year career, was told he by doctors he probably had 
Lupus for more than a year. The disease could have contributed to 
knee and hamstring problems when he played with the Yankees from 
1996-98. 
</P>
<P>
	While those injuries slowed him, he still contributed enough to  
help the Yankees win two World Series championships during his 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is one person we miss, not necessarily because of his  
at-bats but because of his presence, it's Rock,'' Torre said. ``He 
had an infectious laugh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That laugh and presence were visible Monday. There was Raines  
telling Paul O'Neill he could still pick up a bat and swing. He 
chastised Ramiro Mendoza for not throwing enough fastballs. He even 
played a practical joke on Mariano Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera walked up behind Raines and gave him a hard pat on the  
back. Raines turned around and shot Rivera a glare. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ain't that healthy anymore. Don't hit me like that,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera stepped back with a worried look on his face. Then came  
that laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got you. I got you,'' Raines squealed.  
</P>
<P>
	Rivera broke into a smile and hugged his former teammate. Once  
again he brought laughter to a serious situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He helped us win two World Series,'' Tino Martinez said.  
``Just look. You can see how he is.''

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays, Twins Brawl in Toronto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- After allowing seven unearned runs in the fourth  
inning, Toronto reliever Paul Spoljaric threw a pitch over the head 
of Minnesota's Cristian Guzman, who charged the mound and started a 
brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Both benches and bullpens emptied as Guzman tackled Spoljaric.  
Both players were ejected, and Spoljaric left the field with a 
black eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Guzman, who had two plate appearances in the inning, led off the  
fourth with a ground ball to third baseman Tony Fernandez, who let 
it slip under his glove for an error. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins then sent seven men to the plate before Jacque Jones  
capped the seven run outburst with a three-run homer. Spoljaric 
then threw the next pitch over Guzman's head.

<HEADLINE>  Raines Sees Former Teammates in NY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tim Raines brought laughter to the New York  
Yankees' clubhouse so often last season, lightening the mood with a 
subtle dig or a practical joke. 
</P>
<P>
	So it was only appropriate that his former teammates played the  
joke on Raines, when he saw them for the first time since learning 
he had Lupus. 
</P>
<P>
	Raines, traveling with the Oakland Athletics for the first time  
since leaving the team with the chronic illness earlier this month, 
came to Yankee Stadium on Monday night to visit with friends and 
receive his World Series ring from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Raines walked onto the field to a standing ovation from the  
crowd, the Yankees and the Athletics. New York manager Joe Torre 
handed him a box, Raines opened it and it was empty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees broke into laughter as they went en masse toward  
Raines. Bernie Williams handed his former teammate his ring, and 
Raines joined them in laughter and a hug. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was emotional. Very emotional,'' Raines said of seeing his  
former teammates. ``This was my first time seeing these guys since 
this happened. It's my first time back in New York since the World 
Series parade. It's been an emotional day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been a lot of emotional days recently for Raines, who  
has a disease with no known cure. Lupus is a connective tissue 
disease in which the immune system turns against a person's own 
body. It affects various parts of the body, especially the skin, 
joints, blood and kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Its symptoms can be treated and Raines is taking medication  
daily and intravenous treatment once a month. While his season is 
over, the 39-year-old Raines vows to return to baseball by spring 
training and still is committed to one day playing with his son, 
Tim Jr., who is in the Baltimore Orioles' farm system. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the one thing I want to do,'' Raines said. '' I want to  
do the Griffey thing. I'm going to play again. I know that. I can 
play five or six more years. I feel like a rookie again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raines became bloated and mysteriously gained 15 pounds near the  
All-Star break. A kidney biopsy was performed July 23 and he was 
then diagnosed with Lupus. 
</P>
<P>
	Raines underwent four days of treatment in the hospital, where  
he was given high doses of medications designed to relieve the 
swelling in his kidneys and to try keep his immune system from 
attacking his own body. 
</P>
<P>
	He has since lost about 25 pounds and has already begun to taper  
off his medication. Doctors say if the disease is in remission, 
Raines could return to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Raines, one of baseball's top base stealers and leadoff hitters  
during his 20-year career, was told he by doctors he probably had 
Lupus for more than a year. The disease could have contributed to 
knee and hamstring problems when he played with the Yankees from 
1996-98. 
</P>
<P>
	While those injuries slowed him, he still contributed enough to  
help the Yankees win two World Series championships during his 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is one person we miss, not necessarily because of his  
at-bats but because of his presence, it's Rock,'' Torre said. ``He 
had an infectious laugh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That laugh and presence were visible Monday. There was Raines  
telling Paul O'Neill he could still pick up a bat and swing. He 
chastised Ramiro Mendoza for not throwing enough fastballs. He even 
played a practical joke on Mariano Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera walked up behind Raines and gave him a hard pat on the  
back. Raines turned around and shot Rivera a glare. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ain't that healthy anymore. Don't hit me like that,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera stepped back with a worried look on his face. Then came  
that laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got you. I got you,'' Raines squealed.  
</P>
<P>
	Rivera broke into a smile and hugged his former teammate. Once  
again he brought laughter to a serious situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He helped us win two World Series,'' Tino Martinez said.  
``Just look. You can see how he is.''

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Expecting Deion, but Smith? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- The Dallas Cowboys know they'll have Deion  
Sanders back this season, maybe even in September. They're not as 
sure about Kevin Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who started at cornerback opposite Sanders most of last  
season, will be out up to six weeks while trying to rehabilitate a 
lower back injury. 
</P>
<P>
	His absence adds a bit of urgency to Sanders' return from a  
severe toe problem. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Tuesday it is 
possible that Sanders will be ready for the Sept. 12 opener against 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not expecting it, but it could happen,'' Jones said. ``I  
do like the progress he's making. He's doing some things to 
simulate coverage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said he's pleasantly surprised by  
Sanders' recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess anything Deion does should not surprise me, though,''  
Gailey said. ``He has always gone above and beyond whatever was 
expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bye during the third week of the season helps Dallas ease  
injured players back into the lineup. The Cowboys play their third 
game Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who lost his spot as a starter late last year but was  
expected to open this year in Sanders' place, is trying to recover 
from a bulging disc in his lower back that was discovered in June. 
</P>
<P>
	He felt strong enough to start training camp and play in the  
first exhibition game, but he's been out ever since. He's received 
three epidural injections to relieve the pain, yet is still ailing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was not satisfied, and his doctor, a specialist he has,  
just felt like the risk wasn't worth what he could gain by staying 
out of competition for four, five or six weeks,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating,'' Smith said. ``I just want to make sure  
it's right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith rejected surgery for fear of it ending his season.  
However, it's still an option if the therapy doesn't work. Even if 
it does, Smith still might need an operation in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully the rehabilitation will be effective,'' Jones said.  
``One of the things we didn't want to do was get him out here early 
and basically start over again. This gives us the best chance of 
having him for as much of the season as he can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Mathis and Charlie Williams, who has primarily played  
safety the past four seasons, will start in Thursday night's 
exhibition finale against Jacksonville and in the opener unless 
Sanders returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said the Cowboys have enough room under the salary cap to  
sign another cornerback, but coaches have enough confidence in 
Mathis, Williams and their backups. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said the Cowboys have enough room under the salary cap to  
sign another cornerback, but doesn't expect to sign a veteran free 
agent. Part of the reason is their hopes for having Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's our gut feeling,'' Gailey said. ``Unless we see  
something that changes our mind, I don't think we'd be in the 
market for getting an experienced corner right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other cornerbacks on the roster are undrafted rookie Duane  
Hawthorne, who has drawn praise throughout the summer; Zebbie 
Letheridge, who spent last year on the practice squad; and 
LaDouphyous McCalla, a rookie free agent from Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the guys we have,'' Gailey said. ``But from a depth  
perspective, it's a little bit tenuous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerbacks Terry Billups and Kevin Brooks were among 10 players  
cut Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> 19th-Century Coin Fetches Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A silver dollar minted as a gift for the Sultan  
of Muscat and considered the Mona Lisa of coins has fetched a 
record-breaking $4.14 million at auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get over four million is absolutely incredible,'' said  
Raymond N. Merena, the president of the New Hampshire-based 
Auctions by Bowers and Merena, Inc., which held the auction Monday 
at the Park Lane Hotel in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale price is more than double the previous $1.8 million  
world record auction price for a rare coin, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The coin, which was snapped up in under two minutes of bidding,  
went to an American buyer identified only as a Southwestern 
business executive, said Donn Pearlman, a spokesman for the 
auctioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	Carried on a secret mission to the Middle and Far East by an  
emissary for President Andrew Jackson, the rare coin was a present 
for the Sultan of Muscat -- now Oman -- after a new trade treaty was 
ratified. 
</P>
<P>
	The coin is part of a collection of nearly 1,000 rare coins  
being auctioned by the family of the late Walter Childs of 
Brattleboro, Vt. Heirs of Childs bought the coin in 1945 for 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sultan of Muscat coin was one of eight silver dollars minted  
in 1834. The coin is dated 1804 because silver dollars were not 
being minted at the time and an old coin mold had to be used. 
</P>
<P>
	``To coin collectors this is like the Mona Lisa or the Holy  
Grail,'' Q. David Bowers, chairman of Auctions by Bowers and 
Merena, said Monday. ``This really is an American treasure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was another 1834 coin sold by Bowers and Merena in 1997 to a  
West Coast coin dealer that fetched the previous record of $1.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sultan of Muscat coin is virtually in the same condition  
as the day it was minted,'' Bowers added. ``It's never been 
mishandled or dropped. It's never been cleaned or polished; for 
that to happen over a period of 150 years is truly amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $4.14 price included a 15 percent buyers fee, Pearlman said.  
Pre-sale estimates for the coin were in the $2 million range.

<HEADLINE> ESPN, Baseball Meet With Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge on Tuesday discouraged major league  
baseball from filing a motion to dismiss ESPN's lawsuit over the 
sport's decision to pull its Sunday night games off the cable 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	In a conference between lawyers for ESPN and baseball, U.S.  
District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin encouraged the sides to resolve 
the dispute before a trial starts in mid-November, a person 
involved in the dispute said on condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN filed suit in May after baseball terminated a $40 million a  
year contract with the cable sports giant that was supposed to last 
through 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	For a second straight year, ESPN switched three Sunday night  
baseball games to ESPN2 so it could show three NFL games instead in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball refuses to take a back seat to another sport, and gave  
the games back to the teams to sell to local broadcasters in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, baseball terminated the deal, setting off the legal  
dispute in May. ESPN argues it has the right to switch baseball 
gams to ESPN2 for events ``of significant viewer interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball says the move must be made with its approval, which  
cannot be ``unreasonably withheld.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN wants to make the switch to accommodate its $4.8 billion  
deal with the highly rated NFL. ESPN is available to about 76 
million homes, while ESPN2 is available in 65 million. 
</P>
<P>
	September baseball games on ESPN averaged a 1.7 rating in 1997,  
about a quarter of the NFL's average in the same time slot last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In related news, ESPN said it had resolved a separate dispute  
with baseball over the use of highlights on its nightly 
``SportsCenter'' show. Earlier this season, baseball said it would 
enforce a limit of five minutes of same-night highlights per show. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a dramatic cutback for ESPN, which stopped airing  
highlights for all games. That began to change a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have reached an agreement with baseball on the expanded use  
of highlights,'' ESPN spokesman Chris LaPlaca said.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars' Smith Makes Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Larry Smith is still catching on to  
the subtleties of technique and assignments. The bigger picture -- 
knocking offensive linemen on their backs -- seems to be coming more 
quickly to the Jaguars defensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville's second-round draft pick has made an immediate  
impact, both in practice and in games, where offensive linemen are 
having difficulty blocking him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a talented player,'' said Jaguars tackle Tony Boselli,  
who doesn't block Smith in practice, but works next to the guys who 
do. ``He's got a lot to learn, but if he keeps working, he's going 
to be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-5, 283-pound tackle out of Florida State, Smith was  
projected as anything from a first- to a fourth-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL personnel staffs had plenty of concerns:  
</P>
<P>
	--Smith missed the NFL scouting combine in February because his  
girlfriend was recovering from an auto accident. 
</P>
<P>
	--He skipped a March workout in front of scouts at Florida State  
because he was recovering from food poisoning that caused him to 
lose 15 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	--He missed significant time at Florida State in 1998 because of  
an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
	--He is 24 years old, considered old for a rookie. He entered  
college late because he went to prep school after high school. 
</P>
<P>
	None of these concerns could overshadow what the Jaguars saw in  
Smith -- overwhelming talent, energetic play on every down and 
something of a mean streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``That kind of temperament could be good for us,'' coach Tom  
Coughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Through three exhibition games, Smith has five tackles, one sack  
and four quarterback pressures, although statistics don't tell the 
whole story. 
</P>
<P>
	He has frequently overwhelmed players on the Jaguars' interior  
line in practice and makes penetration in games. Against the 
Chiefs' second team last week, he looked like an All Pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``He plays well against the first-string guys, too,'' Coughlin  
said. ``He has done a lot of nice things this preseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Coughlin has criticized him for not playing `assignment  
football.'' At times, Smith's eagerness to get to the quarterback 
has left gaps open for other teams to run through. But his mistakes 
offer glimpses of the raw physical talent that even his doubters 
knew he had. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first got into camp, I told myself, `This is the  
NFL,''' Smith said. ``You've got to go hard, 100 percent every 
play. And when I feel tired, I know the guy across me is tired, so 
I just try to keep the motor going at all times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has already secured a spot in the defensive line rotation.  
It looks as if it will be hard to keep him out of the starting 
lineup for long. Even the players trying to hold him off are 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's already a great pass rusher,'' defensive lineman Seth  
Payne said. ``He didn't have to play a lot of disciplined run 
defense at Florida State, so that's what he's working on now. He's 
a hard worker. He wants to be a complete football player. He 
definitely has they physical potential to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower Tuesday,  
dragged down by another sharp fall on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed  
482.41 points, or 2.69 percent, to close at 17,436.56. On Monday, 
the average closed up 319.60 points, or 1.82 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo share prices opened lower as investor sentiment was damped  
by another overnight fall in New York and the weaker U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 176.04  
points to close Monday at 10,914.13, declining for the third 
consecutive session. 
</P>
<P>
	Disappointment over weak month-end demand from foreign fund  
managers also pushed down the Nikkei. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 110.18 yen,  
down 0.86 yen from its level of 111.04 yen late Monday in Tokyo and 
below its late New York level of 110.73 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar moved as high as 111.11 yen during the day, bolstered  
by worse-than-expected economic data from the Japanese government. 
Industrial production in July fell 0.6 percent from the previous 
month, below forecasts for a 0.2 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar's gains were quickly eroded on the view that the  
Group of Seven industrialized nations are not likely to support the 
dollar against the yen in the short-term. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 205.89 points,  
or 1.5 percent, closing at 13,482.77. On Monday, the index had 
surged 305.53 points, or 2.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said Hong Kong investors took profits following Monday's  
sharp fall on Wall Street amid lingering fears of another rise in 
U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian shares closed slightly higher on bargain-hunting in  
select blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Market sentiment remained weak with many investors sidelined,  
closely watching developments in East Timor after Monday's polls to 
decide the province's future. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index edged up 0.356  
point to 567.026.

	The Malaysian market was closed Tuesday for Independence Day  
celebrations.

	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower. The benchmark  
NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 2.69 points, or 0.1 percent, to 
2,152.62. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower for the fourth straight  
session as concerns over higher interest rates weighed on investor 
sentiment. The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 
27.42 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,173.82. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher for the second straight  
session on selective bargain-hunting. The market's key Weighted 
Stock Price Index rose 86.37 points, or 1.1 percent, to 8,157.73. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower, pushed down by  
Wall Street's decline. The All Ordinaries Index fell 41.1 points,

<HEADLINE> Lemieux's Pitch Should Be Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mario Lemieux helped to save the Pittsburgh  
Penguins as a player. He's close to doing the same as an owner. 
</P>
<P>
	The former NHL great planned to meet with the league's Board of  
Governors today to make a presentation to buy the troubled team for 
his group at a cost of $95 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The board is expected to approve the takeover. The league has  
endorsed Lemieux's group all along in a determined effort to keep 
the Penguins in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it's still up to a bankruptcy court in Pittsburgh to  
make the final determination. That could come later this week, 
hopefully before Saturday when the Penguins are scheduled to open 
training camp. The Penguins will play their first exhibition game 
Sept. 11 against the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you move into a house that needs (to be) painted,''  
NHL spokesman Frank Brown said Tuesday. ``This is no different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux still needs to work out specifics of a $5 million  
investment in the team from SMG, a Philadelphia-based group that 
operates the Civic Center, the Penguins' home arena. Lemieux and 
SMG have reportedly reached an oral agreement on most of the points 
and could seek court approval as early as Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux is the first retired player to take over ownership in  
one of the four major North American pro sports leagues. He led the 
Penguins to the Stanley Cup title in 1991 and 1992. A six-time NHL 
scoring champion, Lemieux retired following the 1996-97 season and 
went directly into the Hall of Fame without the usual three-year 
waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
	By converting $25 million in deferred salary and cash into an  
equity stake, Lemieux will have the largest financial stake of an 
ownership group that numbers more than a dozen investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Lemieux stepped forward, there was still some doubt  
whether the Penguins would remain in Pittsburgh, or even in the 
NHL. The team went into bankruptcy during last season and was only 
able to meet its payroll with the help of a bank loan. 
</P>
<P>
	If the deal goes through, it would not be the first time that  
Lemieux helped to save the Penguins franchise. Before he joined 
them as a player in 1984, the Penguins had dire financial problems. 
The Penguins were losing games, fans and money. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance plunged to the bottom of the NHL, and there was talk  
the team would be moved out of town. With Lemieux on the ice, 
attendance soared and the Penguins eventually became a solvent and 
winning team. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been a long road for Lemieux in his attempt to buy the  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The arena lease accounted for much of the delay in Lemieux's  
takeover. Under the lease, SMG will continue to control the 
38-year-old Civic Arena until 2004, when it will revert to Lemieux, 
with SMG as the arena manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations with SMG have been tough for Lemieux to resolve.  
The Penguins blamed the high cost of their lease with SMG to play 
at the Civic Arena for helping push the franchise into bankruptcy.

<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Rockets and the city have reached a  
tentative agreement for a new $160 million sports arena that 
includes the city and team splitting costs, according to a 
published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Six hours of negotiations led up to the tentative agreement late  
Monday. Sources told the Houston Chronicle and KRIV-TV in Houston 
that Rockets owner Les Alexander appeared willing to accept Mayor 
Lee Brown's offer to an even split of the cost for designing and 
building a new facility. 
</P>
<P>
	During six hours of negotiations, the newspaper said, both the  
city and the team made significant concessions on major issues. 
KRIV reports the two sides would split the $160 million cost 
equally, with Alexander picking up the tab for all overruns. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for both sides were instructed to work out the details  
for review today in the next meeting. If the two sides continue to 
agree, the deal would be presented to the Harris County-Houston 
Sports Authority during a special 2 p.m. meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step would be a Nov. 2 referendum, following agreement  
of authority board members agree.

<HEADLINE>  Ethnic Albanians Warned To Disarm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO's commander in Kosovo pressed  
the leader of ethnic Albanian rebels in the province Tuesday to 
abide by an agreement requiring the Kosovo Liberation Army to 
disband by mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
	In closed door talks, Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson urged the KLA's  
political chief Hashim Thaci to meet the deadline, sources close to 
Thaci said. They also discussed terms to end an eight-day-long 
stalemate between ethnic Albanians and Russian soldiers in the 
southern city of Orahovac, the sources said on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Thaci plans to address the hundreds of ethnic  
Albanians who have been blocking roads to the town for more than a 
week, refusing to allow Russian peacekeepers to enter. 
</P>
<P>
	Thaci has said in the past that he will abide by the disarmament  
agreement reached with international officials in Kosovo in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, the KLA must demilitarize by mid-September.  
While international officials insist the group is to be disbanded, 
KLA commanders say they will continue as a defensive force. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley said the  
agreements are unambiguous on what the rebels. must do. By Sept. 
19, he said, ``the KLA must place all automatic small-arms in 
secure weapons storage sites and must cease wearing military 
uniforms and insignia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington,  
Army Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's top commander in Europe, said 
demilitarization of the KLA ``seems to be very much on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, the top U.N. official in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner,  
swore in seven new judges and two prosecutors in the divided 
northern town of Kosovska Mitrovica, flanked by a Serb translator 
and an Albanian translator. 
</P>
<P>
	The law officials, who are both Serb and Albanian, will be part  
of a new legal system that is being set up by the United Nations to 
replace the Serbian law that previously ruled the province. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very important to build the judiciary system in Kosovo  
... to write the law according to international conventions, 
including that on human rights,'' Kouchner said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said doctors and lawyers were fired under the previous law 10  
years ago, so they shouldn't be expected to accept the same law 
that was used unjustly against them. 
</P>
<P>
	International officials are eager to have a judicial system  
under which criminals can be prosecuted up and running in the 
province. The entry of about 40,000 international peacekeepers, who 
started arriving on June 12, has not been enough to prevent revenge 
attacks and criminal acts from taking place in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pristina on Tuesday, NATO peacekeepers moved a tank to the  
site of a suspected mass grave in the Kosovo capital, but plans to 
begin digging were postponed amid heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 bodies are believed buried at the site, near Pristina's  
hospital, and a local newspaper cited relatives of victims as 
saying the victims were ethnic Albanians who died from 
ill-treatment by Serb troops during their 18-month-long crackdown 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavy rains also led U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to cancel  
his planned flight to Albania, said his spokeswoman, Mary Ellen 
Glenn. Instead, Holbrooke, who arrived in Kosovo on Saturday, left 
for Macedonia, and then for Bosnia, the last leg of his first trip 
abroad since confirmation earlier this month as the U.S. ambassador 
to the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Ciccarelli To Announce Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARNIA, Ontario (AP) -- Dino Ciccarelli is retiring after 19  
seasons in the NHL, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old will announce the end of his playing career  
Wednesday, he told his hometown newspaper, the Sarnia Observer. 
</P>
<P>
	He was troubled by a back injury last season and played only 14  
games for the Florida Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always heard people say you will know when it's time to  
call it quits. I know for sure it's time for me to go,'' he said 
from his home in Yale, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-winger is ninth on NHL all-time goal scoring with 608  
goals - two behind Bobby Hull. He also had 592 assists in 1,232 NHL 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm retiring because of my back injury,'' he said. ``I tried  
skating a bit last week and the same soreness and stiffness was 
there. There's no use kidding myself anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ciccarelli broke into the NHL with the Minnesota North Stars in  
1981. 
</P>
<P>
	He also played in Washington, Detroit, and Tampa Bay before  
being traded to Florida last year.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Hit With Safety Penalties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday  
it is seeking a $396,000 fine against American Airlines for having 
the wrong safety cards on one of its jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The cards and safety manuals for passengers and flight  
attendants were made for jets with emergency lights on the floor, 
but the Boeing 757-223 had been modified to put the lights on the 
seat arm rests, the FAA said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate action, the FAA said Southwest Airlines has agreed  
to pay a $34,500 penalty for carrying a container of hazardous 
material on a March 31 flight from Dallas to Harlingen. 
</P>
<P>
	A Southwest spokesman said the airline was looking into how the  
container of cesium, which is used in nuclear reactors, came to be 
placed on board the flight. The airline prohibits hazardous 
material on its planes. The spokesman said Southwest would take 
steps to prevent a recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA originally sought to fine Southwest $66,000, but lawyers for  
the agency and the airline agreed on the lesser penalty last week, 
the FAA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed penalty against American came after the airline was  
given several notices that one of its jets had the wrong safety 
cards, but the cards went uncorrected for 36 flights, the FAA said. 
</P>
<P>
	One American captain, however, refused to allow his flight to  
continue until photocopies of a corrected card were made and placed 
on the jet, the FAA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline has 30 days to contest the penalty, and American's  
spokesman said the airline would protest to the FAA.

<HEADLINE> Study: MDs Should Help Smokers Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- U.S. medical school graduates are woefully  
unprepared to help patients quit smoking, the nation's most deadly 
preventable health care problem, a study concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers surveyed nearly every accredited medical school  
in the country and found very little coursework devoted to nicotine 
dependence. 
</P>
<P>
	They called the statistics distressing, given National Cancer  
Institute recommendations from seven years ago that training in how 
to kick the habit be made mandatory at every U.S. medical school. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings appear in Wednesday's Journal of the American  
Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public health community is active and aggressive in  
anti-smoking efforts, but there's nothing innovative going on'' at 
medical schools, said Dr. Linda Ferry, director of preventive 
medicine at Loma Linda University School of Medicine in California. 
``It starts right at the ground level in medical school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cigarette smoking kills more than 400,000 Americans each year,  
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One in 
every five deaths in the United States is smoking-related, CDC 
figures show. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferry cited a 1991 survey showing that few doctors felt their  
formal medical training prepared them to help patients stop 
smoking, and another that found few physicians advise their 
patients about kicking the habit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferry and colleagues looked at responses from 122 of 126 medical  
schools about course offerings in the 1996-97 school year. Not all 
schools answered every question. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-two out of 102 medical schools dedicated an average of  
less than one hour of classroom time per year in smoking cessation 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	There was more tobacco-related instruction in the first two  
years of medical school. But only three schools reported having a 
required course devoted to tobacco education in the third and 
fourth years. 
</P>
<P>
	And almost 70 percent of schools -- 83 of 120 -- did not require  
any smoking cessation training at all in those two years, when 
students theoretically are learning how to apply their knowledge to 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors acknowledged that more smoking cessation instruction  
could be taking place in informal settings in the final years of 
medical school. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David Steward, chairman of internal medicine at the Southern  
Illinois University School of Medicine in Springfield, said that is 
the case at his school, where third- and fourth-year students are 
often working directly with patients and practicing physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's probably the most powerful teaching tool and it's hard  
to quantify,'' Steward said. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors recommended that a model tobacco curriculum be  
developed and put in place in all U.S. medical schools, and said 
the licensing exam for doctors should pay greater attention to the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Rigotti, director of a preventive medicine course at  
Harvard Medical School, suggested a philosophical change may be in 
order as well. She said too many doctors particularly older ones, 
may be afraid of alienating patients or feel it's not their place 
to counsel them.

<HEADLINE> Astros Acquire Javier From Giants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Astros acquired outfielder Stan  
Javier from the San Francisco Giants for minor league reliever Joe 
Messman on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Javier is hitting .276 with three home runs and  
30 RBIs in 112 games this season. The switch-hitter has made 45 
starts in left field, 29 in right and two in center for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stan gives us a valuable veteran presence on our club,''  
Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``His versatility will 
be a great asset down the stretch. He is a winning player who knows 
what it takes to win a championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Javier, a 15-year veteran, has played with the Giants since  
1996. He made his major league debut with the New York Yankees in 
1984. He was originally signed as a non-drafted free agent by the 
St. Louis Cardinals on in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Messman, a 24-year-old right-hander, was 3-4 with a 2.43 ERA in  
45 games for Class A Kissimmee this season. He ranked first on the 
club with 15 saves and struck out 47 in 59.1 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Messman, 24, was drafted by the Astros in the sixth round of the  
1997 draft out of Oregon State.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Turn Higher; Dow Up 14.88 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks edged higher today as continuing worries  
over interest rates kept many investors out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 14.88 at 10,929.01. The index fell as much as 32 
points and rose as much as 67 as low volume contributed to 
exaggerated price swings. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose slightly. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 3.66 at 1,327.68, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was up 2.02 at 2,714.71. 
</P>
<P>
	In a quiet week, with many Wall Street professionals taking  
vacations, many investors are willing to wait for each new piece of 
economic data to guide their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board said today its consumer confidence index  
fell in August for the second straight month. The index, which 
measures consumers' likeliness to spend, edged down 0.4 of a point, 
less than analysts expected. The study offered confirmation that 
worries over interest rates have taken hold with U.S. consumers, 
but stocks barely reacted to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect two more widely watched barometers to spark some  
activity later this week: The National Assocation of Purchasing 
Managers report on Wednesday and the Labor Department's jobless 
report Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Any suggestions that the U.S. economy is growing too quickly  
could convince investors that the Federal Reserve will raise 
interest rates for a third time this year. Higher rates can 
threaten stocks by cutting into corporate profits and increasing 
the value of alternative investments, like bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond held steady today  
at 6.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil companies were helping the Dow, as Chevron rose 15/16 to 92 1/4  
and Exxon rose 1 1/4 to 79 1/16. Crude oil futures jumped sharply 
Monday after Venezuela, Mexico and Saudi Arabia decided against 
raising production. 
</P>
<P>
	Office Depot was unchanged at 10 1/2 after shedding 26 percent in  
after-hours trading Monday. The company said it expects to miss 
earnings expectations for the rest of 1999 as weaker sales and 
price erosion on paper supplies hurt gross margins. Shares of 
competing office supply stores fell today. Staples lost 2 3/8 to 19 
9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 226.7 million 
shares, ahead of Monday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 200 index of smaller company stocks was down 0.28 at  
427.08.

<HEADLINE> House Subpoenas Waco Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee has subpoenaed records for  
its investigation of the FBI's admission that incendiary tear gas 
canisters were used in the government's fiery 1993 clash with the 
Branch Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Government Reform Committee on Monday subpoenaed the  
Texas Rangers for evidence sifted from the charred remains of the 
Davidians' compound. Also subpoenaed was an assistant U.S. attorney 
in Waco who prosecuted criminal cases against surviving Davidian 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno and the FBI have said there is no  
evidence that the incendiary devices lobbed at a concrete bunker 40 
yards from the Davidians' compound ignited the fire that later 
raced through the wooden structure. But Reno has pledged a full 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI Director Louis Freeh has recommended to Reno that she  
appoint an outside investigator to head the team, an FBI official 
said today. And while the FBI has identified 40 agents who could 
undertake an investigation, Freeh is supporting a probe without FBI 
involvement, said spokesman Tron Brekke. 
</P>
<P>
	Recognizing that the agency's credibility has been damaged by  
its recent about-face, Brekke said: ``We would welcome a qualified 
group of (independent) investigators to do that investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid complaints on and off Capitol Hill that the FBI and its  
parent Justice Department cannot properly investigate themselves, 
Reno still has not decided who should head the investigation, said 
Justice spokesman Myron Marlin. ``She is still working through her 
options,'' he said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., whose panel will hold  
hearings in the fall, sent two investigators to Austin last week to 
review evidence. Monday's subpoenas will be followed by others, 
including to agencies involved in the siege, said committee 
spokesman Mark Corallo. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them is the Defense Department, whose secretive Delta  
Force had members at the scene -- a point of controversy for some 
who contend the military played more than an observer's role. Only 
under tightly proscribed rules is the military allowed to 
participate in domestic law enforcement operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials have said three Army special forces officers  
were present outside Waco, Texas, on April 19, 1993, but were not 
involved in the FBI operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena to the Texas Rangers seeks all documents relating  
to the use of the pyrotechnic tear gas devices as well as the 
Rangers' final report on the incident, Corallo said. The 
information requested must be provided by Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, The Dallas Morning News said Assistant U.S. Attorney  
Bill Johnston, the prosecutor subpoenaed by Burton's committee, 
wrote Reno on Monday that last week he received a 5-year-old 
document that discusses the use of ``military gas'' by the FBI on 
the last day of the siege.

	Johnston said he was concerned because the three-page document,  
a set of notes on interviews with the FBI hostage rescue team, 
included handwritten notations suggesting it be kept from anyone 
outside the Justice Department's legal staff, the newspaper said in 
today's editions.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Decides To Pay Unwed Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Undoing what almost everyone agreed was an  
injustice, the state crime compensation fund on Tuesday agreed to 
give money to victims who had broken minor laws such as living with 
a member of the opposite sex while unmarried. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crime Victims Compensation Commission will pay families of  
14 murder victims whose claims had been rejected because the 
victims -- all unmarried -- were living with a member of the opposite 
sex. That violates a rarely enforced 1805 state law against 
cohabitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the beneficiaries Tuesday was Diana Zambory of Newport,  
who was originally denied compensation after her 24-year-old 
daughter was killed by her live-in boyfriend. Now, two people who 
covered her daughter's funeral costs will receive $1,677. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely grateful now that the right thing will be  
done,'' Ms. Zambory said. ``I would love to have the record 
stricken where my daughter was accused of being a criminal, but I 
don't think that will ever happen. And that still hurts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission pays up $7,500 to cover the funeral expenses for  
murder victims and the medical costs for other victims. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the state toughened its compensation law after a judge  
ruled that a man who was shot and paralyzed while committing a 
robbery was entitled to victim's benefits upon parole. 
</P>
<P>
	The law required the commission to reject a claim for a victim  
who was involved in a felony or nontraffic misdemeanor. That meant 
victims were ineligible even if they were guilty of cohabitation or 
fishing without a license. 
</P>
<P>
	The state commission denied 47 claims on the basis of  
cohabitation alone through June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But in July, Gov. Jim Hunt signed a new law allowing the  
commission to merely consider nontraffic misdemeanors when making 
awards, instead of making it mandatory to deny those cases. The 
cohabitation law remains on the books, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The law also allows the panel to reconsider some previously  
denied cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some really tough decisions that hopefully now we  
don't have to repeat,'' said Jonathan Babb, the commission's 
attorney. ``This is a good step, especially when you have the crime 
of murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More cases, including those denied for reasons other than  
cohabitation, also will be reconsidered, said the commission's 
director, Robert Reives.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians, Israel Close to Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian and Israeli officials are  
optimistic they will reach an agreement on reviving a U.S.-brokered 
peace plan by the time Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
arrives this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations resumed today, a day after Israeli and Palestinian  
officials had made their most positive statements in months about 
the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I imagine within two or three days we will reach a  
conclusion,'' Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The positive atmosphere, however, was threatened late Monday by  
the discovery of the bodies of a slain Israeli couple near the West 
Bank border. Police suspected the killings were politically 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	The killings near the Megiddo forest, a popular nature reserve  
straddling Israel and the northern West Bank, could complicate the 
grueling talks on reviving the long-delayed Wye River peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak expressed his ``deep shock'' over the killings.  
</P>
<P>
	Palestinians, though, agreed the two sides were close to a  
resolution. ``I have to say that these people intend to implement 
the agreements,'' senior negotiator Saeb Erekat said Monday after 
another four-hour session with his Israeli counterpart, Gilead 
Sher. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright is due in the region on Thursday and expects an accord  
by the time she arrives, her spokesman said in Washington. Egypt 
also hopes to host a signing ceremony launching the implementation 
of the Wye agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat traveled to Alexandria, Egypt,  
today to meet with President Hosni Mubarak -- the fifth visit 
between the two leaders this summer. After the meeting, Egyptian 
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said an implementation agreement might 
be signed in Alexandria on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two sides will intensify their negotiations'' in an effort  
to reach an agreement, Moussa said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, signed last October, called for three Israeli  
withdrawals from the West Bank in return for security measures by 
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian government. 
</P>
<P>
	But after a single pullback in December 1998, former Israeli  
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu froze the deal, alleging 
Palestinian noncompliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak defeated Netanyahu in May elections, pledging to revive  
Wye. But before Monday, talks had largely been stalemated. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel and the Palestinians appeared closer than ever on the two  
issues that have deadlocked the sides until now: a timetable for a 
long-delayed Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, and the release 
of Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel acts. 
</P>
<P>
	Differences over a timetable for a withdrawal from the West Bank  
were down to less than a month: Israelis are sticking to a Jan. 20 
deadline, and the Palestinians want the pullback to be completed by 
Dec. 31. On the prisoners issues, the Palestinians demand that 650 
will be freed, while Israel says it would release a little more 
than 300. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright's spokesman, James B. Foley, said the secretary wanted  
to look beyond the Israeli withdrawal and focus on more difficult 
issues concerning a final settlement between Israel and the 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel and the Palestinians are still apart on a new deadline  
for such an agreement, which would address issues like the final 
borders of the Palestinian entity and the status of Jerusalem. The 
Palestinians seek April 2000 as a target date, while Israel has 
proposed December 2000 as a new deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright also wants to review the status of Israeli and Syrian  
peace talks, which broke off three years ago, Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen evidence that each side is eager to resume those  
negotiations,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Buckeyes Face Lots of Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Coach John Cooper will need a golf  
cart to carry the ``to-do'' list facing his Ohio State Buckeyes 
when they get back to the practice field. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 10 minutes it took Cooper to get to the interview room  
after Sunday night's 23-12 loss to Miami in the Kickoff Classic, he 
already composed a sizable pile of projects to be wrapped up before 
the Buckeyes host No. 17 UCLA on Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to tackle better, block better, protect our  
quarterback, run the football better, certainly eliminate our 
turnovers and we've got to be more efficient in the kicking game,'' 
Cooper said. ``You name it, we've got to work on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shocker for Ohio State's players, fans and coaches wasn't  
that the Buckeyes lost, but how it all came unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes never recovered after Kenny Kelly ran for a score  
and then tossed a long TD pass to Santana Moss with eight seconds 
left in the first half to turn a two-point Ohio State lead into a 
23-9 burial plot. 
</P>
<P>
	The statistics tell the tale. The Buckeyes rushed for just 116  
yards and passed for 104 more, averaging just 3.9 yards per play. 
They fumbled four times, losing two, and had two interceptions to 
go with seven costly penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get these mistakes corrected,'' linebacker Na'il Diggs  
said solemnly. ``It's like I said before the game: if we win, it's 
a great stepping stone for us. If we lose, it'll be a great 
learning experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hesitated and added, ``We're going to greatly, highly learn  
from this game today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And not just the players. The coaching staff must evaluate and  
determine a workable rotation at quarterback and tailback. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin Moherman was playing well before he was pulled in favor  
of backup quarterback Steve Bellisari. Cooper said he wants to 
avoid another battle for the job like the one between Joe Germaine 
and Stanley Jackson in 1996 and 1997, when they traded series and 
the team had a split personality. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense also will be scrutinized. A veteran front line  
seldom applied pressure to Kelly and the secondary surrendered 245 
passing yards -- including the looping, wind-blown 50-yarder from 
Kelly that Moss turned into the 67-yard clincher. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State had 10 new starters on the Giants Stadium field. But  
offensive coordinator Mike Jacobs said rookie mistakes weren't why 
the Buckeyes lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some experienced people who didn't play well,'' he  
said. ``We were outcoached and outplayed and Miami won the game 
today. We've got 11 ballgames to go and two weeks to get ourselves 
back on track here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the loss came at the hands of another ``M'' team  
only a lot earlier than 1996 and 1998 when the Buckeyes had perfect 
seasons spoiled by Michigan and Michigan State, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there were 30 seconds left on the clock and we were down  
whatever number of points, all I could think about was, `OK, let's 
get back to square one,''' offensive tackle Tyson Walter said. 
``This is a difficult time that will test our character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No team has ever lost twice and won the national title. And the  
Buckeyes still play No. 2 Penn State, No. 7 Michigan, No. 9 
Wisconsin, No. 17 UCLA and No. 22 Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least it wasn't a Big Ten game, so we're still in the title  
hunt,'' offensive guard Ben Gilbert said. ``Remember, Florida State 
lost a game early last year and still was in the national 
championship game. One game doesn't make a season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was Cooper's first in an Ohio State opener and was also  
the first time the Buckeyes dropped an opener since the 1986 
Kickoff Classic against Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper is 29-4 in September games, 36-12-1 in October, 26-10-3  
in November and has won three of 10 bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, he has as many losses in November and beyond  
(17) as he has in August, September and October combined. 
</P>
<P>
	It's too early to panic, of course, but the Buckeyes can't  
afford to develop slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	``UCLA has got some great skill people,'' Cooper said. ``UCLA's  
got a couple of wide receivers and a couple of running backs who 
can play on any football team in the country. So we had better be a 
better football team when we play UCLA than we were today.''

<HEADLINE> NHL Will Vote on Lemieux Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Funding for the bankrupt Pittsburgh Penguins  
will continue until final details of the franchise's sale are 
worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Funding from a $20 million loan from French bank Societe  
Generale was scheduled to expire Aug. 31. Salvatore Galatioto, 
Societe Generale managing director and head of sports finance, said 
today the loan would be extended. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to extend it until we need to,'' Galatioto said.  
``It's not going to be a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations between the Pens and SMG, the private,  
Philadelphia-based partnership that managed the Civic Arena, were 
continuing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Lemieux may be one day away from owning the Pittsburgh  
Penguins, the team he led to two Stanley Cup championships earlier 
in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, who spent last week closing on his $95 million purchase  
of the bankrupt franchise, will meet Wednesday with the NHL's 
executive committee to review his takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless the executive committee unexpectedly balks, Lemieux is  
expected to be voted in as an owner during an NHL Board of 
Governors meeting that afternoon in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Swift approval is expected since the league has already endorsed  
Lemieux's takeover, the first by a recently retired player in one 
of the four major North American professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, a six-time NHL scoring champion, retired following the  
1997 season. By converting $25 million in deferred salary and cash 
into an equity stake, he will have the largest financial stake of 
an ownership group that numbers more than a dozen investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins open training camp at their Southpointe practice  
rink in Washington County on Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Webster Slaughter and Jay Leeuwenburg, a couple of old pros, are  
looking for jobs with new NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaughter was released by the Baltimore Ravens and Leeuwenburg  
by the Indianapolis Colts as NFL teams trimmed down to the 
league-imposed 65-player roster limit on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very tough,'' Ravens coach Brian Billick said of  
releasing Slaughter, a wide receiver with 13 years of NFL 
experience. ``And he handled it with typical class and 
professionalism. He was great for us while we were in camp. He was 
great for those young players. It's tough because he was a good 
friend, but he understands the nature of the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slaughter, who turns 35 in October, was signed in June and was  
one of a large number of receivers the Ravens took to training 
camp. However, Slaughter was unable to distinguish himself in the 
preseason and caught just three passes for 11 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	In his career, he has caught 563 passes, 44 for touchdowns, and  
has 8,111 yards as a receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts, meanwhile, continued rebuilding their offense with  
the release of Leeuwenburg. The Colts' most experienced offensive 
lineman lost his starting job during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Leeuwenburg, who started 37 consecutive games for the Colts,  
made every offensive snap last year at center for a line that 
allowed only 22 sacks. He was replaced in the starting lineup by 
second-year pro Larry Moore, who was moved from guard. Moore's spot 
on the starting line was taken by Waverly Jackson, another 
second-year lineman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Jay that the guys we have are playing better at this  
time of their careers than he was,'' Colts coach Jim Mora said. 
``That's why we made the move. It was not a decision made for the 
future. We're looking at it as a now decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leeuwenburg, 30, was starting his eighth NFL season. He started  
48 consecutive games for the Chicago Bears before signing with the 
Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's last preseason cuts will come Sunday, when NFL  
teams must trim down to 53 players. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Dolphins    	
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of wavering, rookie defensive end Dimitrius  
Underwood returned to football Tuesday and pledged his 100 percent 
commitment to the Dolphins. To show he meant it, Underwood even 
showed up for practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The workout was the first for the unpredictable rookie since  
Aug. 2, when he walked out on the Minnesota Vikings after one 
practice to focus on his religious faith. Underwood said his career 
with Miami will last longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to be here,'' he said. ``I'm going to get on my  
horse and get going. I've got a lot to prove. You want to be the 
best of the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, 22, arrived at the Dolphins' complex one day late  
after missing two flights from Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Lions    	
</P>
<P>
	The Lions, desperate for a running back since Barry Sanders'  
unexpected retirement, picked up Greg Hill from St. Louis for two 
undisclosed picks in the 2000 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, 27, rushed for 240 yards and four touchdowns for the Rams  
before his 1998 season was cut short by a broken ankle. He spent 
his first four NFL seasons with Kansas City, rushing for 2,126 
yards. The Rams signed him to a free-agent deal last summer. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Browns    	
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland claimed wide receiver Zola Davis from the waiver list  
on Tuesday. On Monday, Green Bay waived Davis, an undrafted free 
agent who signed with the Packers in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot, 185-pounder was a four-year starter at South  
Carolina, where he finished his career as the school's second 
leading receiver with 164 catches. Only Sterling Sharpe had more 
for the Gamecocks. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Chiefs    	
</P>
<P>
	Brian Shay, the fireplug running back from Division II who broke  
all NCAA rushing records, was cut by the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Gunther Cunningham said the Chiefs hoped Shay would sign  
with the practice squad. Shay, who rushed for an NCAA-record 6,958 
yards for Emporia State, signed a free-agent contract with the 
Chiefs after being ignored in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	In three exhibition games, Shay had only two carries for 10  
yards. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Broncos    	
</P>
<P>
	Fullback Ryan Christopherson was one of six players waived by  
the two-time defending Super Bowl champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Also waived were quarterback Chuck Clements, safeties Jason  
Moore and Brad Trout, center Clay Shiver and wide receiver Shawn 
Turner.

<HEADLINE> Paterno Keeps Lions Humble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- For Penn State players who endured  
1997 and 1998 -- lean years by Joe Paterno's standards -- dismantling 
Arizona on Saturday was quite a rush. 
</P>
<P>
	This was a victory over a Top 5 team, the Nittany Lions' first  
in five years. And it came in sensational fashion, with tough 
defense and a big-play offense that looked more like a Pac-10 team 
than Paterno's team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is the best feeling we've had in a long time,''  
quarterback Kevin Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	By Monday, the veterans knew, the time for savoring was over:  
Paterno had spent the weekend dissecting game tape. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to make sure we're humble,'' fullback Aaron Harris  
said after No. 2 Penn State won 41-7, sending Arizona tumbling to 
No. 15 in the rankings. ``As soon as we watch this film, he'll find 
50,000 mistakes with a good play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So how many did Joe turn up?  
</P>
<P>
	``Probably more than Aaron thought,'' Paterno joked Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Actually, there really were problems hidden in the glow of 504  
yards of total offense. Paterno is never one to depend on the 
surprise play, and beyond surprise plays, Penn State's offense 
wasn't quite so dominating. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very inconsistent running the football. We had some  
breakdowns in pass protection. We had four sacks,'' Paterno said as 
the Lions prepared for Akron, which visits Saturday. ``When they 
start taking the gimmicks away from you, then you've really got to 
be able to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next team will be ready for inside reverses and first-down  
passing. They're not the usual Penn State fare, but they went for 
three touchdowns in the first half against the poor-tackling 
Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
	A better team might also have made the Lions pay for their  
errors. Quarterback Rashard Casey tripped as he stepped away from 
center on fourth-and-goal. Thompson had a pass picked off. The 
offensive line was called for two false starts in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	And lost in the celebration was this troubling statistic: The  
Lions fumbled six times, losing two. 
</P>
<P>
	``You fumble six times in a close football game and you're out  
of it. You're out of it,'' Paterno said. ``We were minus-2 in 
turnovers. Most big games, you're minus-2 and you're licked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So maybe Paterno had a point when he tried to rein in the  
postgame lovefest. Interestingly, this team didn't seem to need 
Paterno's reminders about the long road ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	There were a few errant comments: ``We won't be surprised if we  
score 70 points,'' said receiver Corey Jones, who pulled a 
hamstring and might miss the Akron game. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the experienced Lions weren't getting carried away by  
the victory -- even with the lowly Zips next on the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly one of the major things the coaches have stressed  
upon us is that we can't have a letdown,'' Thompson said. ``We've 
got to come out and we've got to be able to run the football 
effectively and pass the ball effectively. We're not going to fool 
everybody this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They may not need to fool the Zips, who were 4-7 last year. They  
have yet to beat a Top 25 team in a dozen Division I-A seasons, 
with ranked teams piling up 54.3 points per game. In 1997, Nebraska 
routed them 59-14, and LSU blanked them 56-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've played a lot of games in my tenure at Akron like this,''  
said Zips coach Lee Owens, going into his fifth season. ``The 
biggest risk we've taken in the past is the risk of embarrassment 
and loss of confidence. It's really important to leave this game 
feeling good about ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If it sounds as if Owen has already given up, he hasn't. In  
fact, he reminded his team of Sept. 10, 1983: Cincinnati 14, 
defending national champion Penn State 3. 
</P>
<P>
	The circumstances were a little different; Nebraska defeated the  
Lions 44-6 the week before, but Paterno has also cautioned his team 
about that Cincinnati game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worry more about these games than about the Arizonas,''  
Paterno said. ``I'll be disappointed if this team isn't mature 
enough to understand what can happen to them.''

<HEADLINE> Raptors Re-Sign Charles Oakley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Raptors ended months of speculation  
and re-signed veteran power forward Charles Oakley today. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Oakley was courted by eight other teams, including  
the Los Angeles Lakers and the NBA champion San Antonio Spurs, 
there was little doubt the 35-year-old free agent would re-sign 
with the Raptors because of the salary cap. 
</P>

	Russian Troops Resume Rebel Attack  
</P>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian aircraft and artillery  
pounded a mountainous stronghold of Islamic militants for a third 
straight day today in a battle for control over a volatile southern 
region. The attack on several remote villages in Dagestan follows 
two weeks of intense fighting in another part of the impoverished 
republic earlier in August. Government forces are again using 
helicopter gunships and heavy artillery in an attempt to crush the 
rebels who have imposed strict Islamic law in several small 
villages they control.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- North Korea marked the anniversary of its launch of  
a long-range missile over Japan one year ago today with boasts of 
scientific and technological advances. Japanese government 
officials and media, meanwhile, urged vigilance lest the North 
decide to launch yet again. ``Over the course of the year, our 
scientists and engineers have seen the successful results of over 
50 meaningful research and development projects,'' said a broadcast 
by Korean Central Radio, which is monitored in Tokyo by the 
Radiopress agency.

	Farmers OK New Milk Pricing System  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even though it could cost them money, dairy  
farmers overwhelmingly approved an overhaul of the way milk is 
priced around the country rather than have the government end its 
regulation of their industry. The new plan, which was developed by 
the Agriculture Department to smooth regional disparities in the 
prices that farmers receive for milk, is likely to undergo revision 
in Congress this fall before it takes effect. The current system 
expires Oct. 1. USDA's plan received near-unanimous approval in 
most regions of the country, according to results of the Aug. 2-6 
referendum that were released today.

	LONDON (AP) -- Two years after Princess Diana's fatal car crash,  
flowers, toys and photographs again decorate the gates in front of 
her Kensington Palace home and admirers come to mark her death. 
``Where's Diana's memorial?'' read a placard that summed up what 
many people feel about today's anniversary of Diana's death in a 
Paris car crash on Aug. 31, 1997. In recent weeks, the Mirror 
newspaper has been campaigning for a permanent Diana memorial and 
claims to have had 144,000 phone calls of support. A memorial 
committee set up last year had proposed a commemorative garden near 
Kensington Palace, but the plan was quietly put on hold after local 
residents objected.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke told  
ethnic Albanian leaders that congressional support will evaporate 
if they don't disarm their guerrilla army. Holbrooke, newly 
confirmed as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, travels to 
Albania today to continue talks on ways to stabilize the southern 
Balkans after a 78-day NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. 
``Let me just stress again what ethnic differences in this region 
really are. They're just racism,'' Holbrooke said Monday after 
meetings with ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian and Israeli officials appear  
optimistic they will reach an agreement on reviving a U.S.-brokered 
peace plan by the time Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
arrives this week. The positive atmosphere, however, was threatened 
late yesterday with the discovery of the bodies of a slain Israeli 
couple near the West Bank border. Police suspected Palestinian 
militants. The killings near the Megiddo forest, a popular nature 
reserve straddling Israel and the northern West Bank, could 
complicate the grueling talks on reviving the long-delayed Wye 
River peace deal.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Absorbs Reno </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Reno Air Inc. is no more.  
</P>
<P>
	The company officially became part of American Airlines in the  
dead of night Tuesday. Airport signs were changed overnight, 
employees reported to work in American uniforms and white Reno jets 
sported American decals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no vestiges one would see of Reno,'' said American  
spokesman John Hotard. 
</P>
<P>
	``The integration has proceeded very smoothly since midnight,''  
he said midday Tuesday. ``Operationally the airline is doing very 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase of tiny Reno last December and its integration into  
the nation's second-largest carrier has been a sore point between 
American and its pilots union. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute reached a boiling point in February when about  
one-quarter of American's 9,500 union pilots called in sick to show 
their dissatisfaction with the company's dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	The sickout stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers around  
the globe and cost the company $225 million. It was halted by a 
federal judge who oversaw the institution of a permanent injunction 
and fined the Allied Pilots Association $45 million for ignoring 
his order to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reno issue has been stressful for pilots concerned with  
their job security. To address those concerns, APA has had 
mediation sessions with American's parent company, AMR Corp., over 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks continued Tuesday even though the integration had begun.  
They persisted so APA could continue to weigh in on American's 
purchase of tiny Reno, a union spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing is we're going to have to look at how they go about  
it without an agreement,'' said Drew Engelke, a pilot with American 
and a union spokesman. ``If they pick and choose the things out of 
the agreement that benefit only them, that would be problematic. If 
they comply with the contract right down the line that would be new 
and exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots can't strike, or engage in a work slowdown or another  
sickout over the Reno issue because the injunction remains in 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, APA does have some legal avenues it could pursue. The  
union could file grievances or ask a judge to intervene if contract 
infractions occur, Engelke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some insiders say the mediated talks continued in part to  
satisfy U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall, who has set a hearing on 
Nov. 15 to determine whether certain individuals should be held 
liable for the sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge has already fined the union president and vice  
president $15,000 in connection to the sickout and is expected to 
consider whether 23 other union officers should also be liable.

<HEADLINE> Ad Agency Studies Teen Shopping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Paul Florio and Erica Grossman, young and  
hip, have just been given $200 to buy anything they want. 
</P>
<P>
	The money did not come from their parents. It came from a  
Stamford advertising agency that wants to get into the brains of 
teen-agers as they shop for back-to-school merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	North Castle Partners, which specializes in youth-market ads,  
sent seven teen-agers on shopping sprees in Connecticut and New 
York in August. The goal of this unconventional research was not 
only to see what's hot, but to see what's on teen-agers' minds. 
</P>
<P>
	The hooded sweatshirts, T-shirts and surfer wear Florio and  
Grossman bought will help the agency accurately depict teens in 
their print and television ads. But even more important to the 
agency's clients is what the teens talked about during the shopping 
sprees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not so much to stay in tune with trends, because trends  
are elusive. It's more what's really happening with teens and 
what's important to them,'' said Grant MacDonald, a partner at 
North Castle. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has designed ads for popular teen snacks such as Slim  
Jim, Lifesavers, Planter's Nuts and Coca-Cola, as well as the 
pHisoderm line of facial cleansers. 
</P>
<P>
	Teens spent about $141 billion last year -- $94 billion of their  
own money and $47 billion of their parents' money, according to 
Teenage Research Unlimited, a research firm based in Northbrook, 
Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Castle agency sent Susan Chaggaris, an account  
executive, to accompany the students on their shopping sprees. 
</P>
<P>
	At the upscale Stamford Town Center, Chaggaris handed $200 in  
cash to each of four teens: Florio, 17, and Grossman, 15, both 
students at Stamford High; Chantal Dore, 15, a sophomore at New 
Canaan High; and Matt Barcello, 16, a junior at Stamford's Westhill 
High. 
</P>
<P>
	The four teens went from store to store together, buying fairly  
typical fare: compact discs, videos, lip gloss and of course, 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	They bought polo shirts and vests from The Gap, cargo pants from  
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, surfer wear from Pacific Sunwear and music 
from Sam Goody. 
</P>
<P>
	The teens said they hoped the research would help manufacturers  
and retailers better understand their peers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They get to see what kids really like,'' Florio said.  
``There's a lot more diversity (among teens) than people think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In between purchases, Chaggaris asked the kids about topics  
ranging from handling peer pressure to the importance of good 
grades. Chaggaris received a unanimous response when she asked them 
what they were looking forward to about going back to school: 
seeing friends. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad agency plans to tell its clients that their advertising  
should reflect a strong sense of belonging. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about social acceptance and being part of  
something,'' said MacDonald. ``So, if we were going to be working 
with a client ... we'd say, how do we connect them to social 
acceptance or belonging?'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacDonald said the agency also got an idea for a promotional  
campaign just by looking at the jewelry worn by the teen shoppers. 
Florio sports three silver earrings and a silver barbell in his 
tongue. Grossman has a tongue barbell and a belly button piercing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Typical teen promotions are music, music, music ... but  
looking at how involved these teens are in jewelry, I think there's 
a provocative thought for marketers. Why not do promotions around 
jewelry?'' MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Lee, associate marketing director for Chattem Inc., the  
maker of pHisoderm, said the ad agency has designed ``edgy'' and 
``slightly uncomfortable'' ads that have been highly effective in 
reaching teens. 
</P>
<P>
	One recent print ad for its 4-way Daily Acne Cleanser shows a  
girl holding a sander to the side of her face. On the handle of the 
sander is the message, ``Zit Be Gone.'' The tagline says, ``It's 
better to use pHisoderm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said she thinks pHisoderm can use the information North  
Castle gleans from the shopping sprees, even though the teens did 
not buy the company's skin care products. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you might come up with an idea that if teens are  
buying this type of jeans ... maybe there's an opportunity for them 
to tie that to our product to make it more relevant,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the more you know (about teens), the better off you  
are.''

<HEADLINE> Rockets' Francis Feels No Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- If Steve Francis feels pressure because the  
Houston Rockets traded a third of their playoff roster to get him, 
the former Maryland star isn't admitting it. 
</P>
<P>
	After ending last season with their second consecutive  
first-round playoff exit, the Rockets on Monday introduced Francis 
and Tony Massenburg, two of the principals in last week's 11-player 
deal with Vancouver and Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis is projected as the Rockets' starting point guard, with  
Cuttino Mobley possibly moving over to the other guard slot. 
They'll join front-court players Hakeem Olajuwon, Scottie Pippen 
and Charles Barkley, who is expected to re-sign soon with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't lead the league in assists playing with those  
guys,'' he said, ``something will be wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to describe his game, Francis mentioned the influence of  
Isaiah Thomas, then touched on several of the league's current 
point guard stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``There aren't many guys that are fast, can run, jump and  
shoot,'' he said of the difficulty finding players he could model 
his game after. ``I think I'm a combination of Allen Iverson and 
Stephon Marbury put together. I take a lot of pride in my defense 
like John Stockton. It's a lot of different guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets said Francis is not as anxious to shoot as the  
comparison with Iverson and Marbury might indicate. Rockets coach 
Rudy Tomjanovich said Francis leans more toward playmaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy was so exciting when you see the highlight reels on  
him. There are a lot of players that can get on highlights. But he 
is a team player. I watched a lot of tape on him and I thought 
sometimes he was so unselfish as times, he could have done more,'' 
Tomjanovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every coach that he's had said he is a team player, and they  
had a good relationship with him, and I think that's important. The 
point guard is connected to the head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would think he took a lot more shots. He took less than 12  
shots (per game) this year. Talking to (Maryland coach) Gary 
Williams, Gary said, `You would think he took a lot more shots. But 
he plays to win. He plays defense.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In the largest deal in NBA history, Vancouver and Orlando added  
some much-needed depth in return for the rights to Francis, picked 
No. 2 overall by the Grizzlies in the June draft.

<HEADLINE> West Wildfires Char 150,000 Acres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	APPLE VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- Smoke rose into the Mojave Desert  
sky from the north flank of the San Bernardino Mountains today as 
firefighters struggled to contain active forest and brush fires 
that had burned 150,000 acres in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest uncontrolled blazes were being fought in Idaho,  
Montana, Utah and California. Fires had been contained in Nevada 
and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest concentration of firefighters worked to tame a  
50,000-acre blaze that had destroyed 12 homes since Sunday about 80 
miles east of Los Angeles, between the resort town of Lake 
Arrowhead and the high desert of Apple Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all we have,'' resident Steve Chisholm said today as he  
stood in a pile of ash that was once his living room. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was spreading along the mountains east toward Lucerne  
Valley today, but none of the widely scattered rustic homes in the 
area of scrub and Joshua trees were threatened. San Bernardino 
County fire spokeswoman Kathy Saindon said at least 200 people had 
voluntarily evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	Five people were arrested Monday for allegedly looting abandoned  
homes, sheriff's spokeswoman Jennie Risley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Erratic wind that fanned flames during the night eased today. On  
Monday, wind blew smoke from the fire more than 180 miles to the 
northeast, tinting the sky over Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sunrise this morning was blood-red, it was gorgeous,''  
said Bob Leinbach, spokesman for the Clark County (Nev.) Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty miles west of Apple Valley, more than 780 firefighters  
worked in the San Gabriel Mountains to contain a 2,500-acre 
wildfire that damaged three cabins in the Angeles National Forest. 
Several thousand people, mostly campers, were ordered out of the 
area when the fire broke out Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Northern California, a 34,441-acre fire in Modoc National  
Forest was 50 percent contained, and firefighters in Butte County 
expected full containment of several fires that burned 33,924 
acres. Six other fires were burning on 8,353 acres in Plumas 
National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	A cluster of fires in Shasta and Trinity counties had blackened  
17,059 acres, and other fires had burned 4,547 acres in the 
Shasta-Trinity National Forests. 
</P>
<P>
	Thunderstorms were believed responsible for two wildfires on  
Utah rangeland west of Salt Lake City, including a 3,000-acre blaze 
up Peepstone Canyon and a wind-blown 750-acre fire about 40 miles 
west of Salt Lake City.

	Fair to partly cloudy skies covered much of the eastern part of  
the country on Tuesday, while the Plains and the West were mostly 
fair as well, 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Dennis continued to weaken east of North Carolina.  
Light rain associated with the storm dropped on parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	High pressure located over the Northeast was responsible for  
fair skies and dry weather. A frontal boundary stretching along the 
Gulf Coast from Florida, west into southeastern Texas, brought a 
few showers and thunderstorms. 
</P>
<P>
	In Houston, the storms packed winds of 60 mph, knocking down  
power lines, breaking windows and killing a roofer who was crushed 
when a motel under construction collapsed. Nearly 100,000 homes 
were without power late Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Storms also moved onshore in the Florida Panhandle, southern  
Alabama, southern Mississippi and southern Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Showers were scattered across parts of Kansas. The remainder of  
the Plains were under fair to partly cloudy skies.

Rockies, bringing an increased threat of scattered showers and 
thunderstorms. 
</P>

<P>
	Temperatures across the Lower 48 ranged from a low of 25 in

<HEADLINE> Felton Spencer Signs With Spurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Veteran center Felton Spencer signed a  
one-year contract with the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday, 
effectively replacing departing backup center Will Perdue. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer, a 7-footer selected in the 1990 NBA draft by the  
Minnesota Timberwolves with the sixth overall pick, played last 
season with the Golden State Warriors before becoming a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Spurs, Spencer will make the league's veteran minimum  
salary of $885,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared in 26 games with the Warriors during the  
lockout-shortened 1999 season, averaging 1.6 points and 1.8 
rebounds per contest. His best year in the league was the 1993-94 
season, when he averaged 8.6 points and 8.3 rebounds as a starter 
for the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	Perdue was a backup for San Antonio center David Robinson for  
four years before leaving as a free agent last week to sign with 
the Chicago Bulls, his former team.

<HEADLINE> Hotmail Temporarily Shut Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft's free Hotmail e-mail system was  
shut down for about seven hours because of a security flaw that 
left millions of accounts vulnerable, though it was unclear whether 
anyone was harmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't heard any reports, any customers calling to say  
they were affected by this directly,'' said Deanna Sanford, lead 
product manager for MSN marketing, Microsoft's Internet division. 
</P>
<P>
	The system has been back on line and working smoothly ever  
since,'' said spokeswoman Kim Bouic a spokeswoman at Waggener 
Edstrom, a public-relations firm under contract to Microsoft. She 
added that no reports of problems had been received today. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft shut down its Hotmail e-mail system, which has 40  
million accounts, for about seven hours Monday morning after 
discovering the flaw that made accounts vulnerable to outside 
access. The company said the trouble was fixed by 10 a.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we were notified, we got our developers and testers  
on it, and we were able to determine a fix,'' Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was first reported by the Swedish newspaper  
Expressen, which said several hackers around the world had set up 
Web sites offering unauthorized access to Hotmail's accounts simply 
by typing in a user name. Microsoft got word early Monday morning, 
Bouic said. 
</P>
<P>
	Via the Web sites, people were able to read and send mail from  
any account without having the password. The Redmond-based software 
maker did not know how long the accounts were accessible. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft posted a note to Hotmail users on its Web page Monday,  
apologizing for the shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of the inconvenience that such an action can cause  
users, this is not something that we take lightly but felt that, 
given Microsoft's commitment to protecting people's private data 
and information, it was the appropriate course of action,'' the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Security and privacy are obviously key concerns,'' Microsoft  
spokesman Dan Leach said Monday night in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was brought back on line and everything is fine,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach said he knew of no other Microsoft products or services  
that might be similarly vulnerable.

Valentin on the 15-day disabled list with knee tendinitis on 
Tuesday and recalled infielder Wilton Veras from Double-A Trenton. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentin has said his left knee has bothered him since spring  
training. He was batting .153 over his last 16 games, and had to 
leave Monday night's game in the fifth inning, shortly after he 
couldn't get to a relatively easy grounder to his left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to take him out of the game. That's not good,'' manager  
Jimy Williams said Monday night. ``There was no collision, nothing 
at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentin was batting .251 with 11 homers and 68 RBIs this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Veras hit .288 with 11 home runs and 75 RBIs at Trenton. He also  
had a 12-game stint in Boston earlier this season, going 13-for-40 
(.325) with two homers and five RBIs.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Quick Pneumonia Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration has approved  
a 15-minute pneumonia test that uses a patient's urine to detect a 
bacterium called Streptococcus pneumoniae blamed for an estimated 
500,000 cases of pneumonia a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Binax Inc. test approved Monday should help doctors decide  
more quickly whether a patient's pneumonia is caused by that 
bacteria, and thus what treatment is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	That's important because of a growing army of bacteria that are  
impervious to antibiotics. Just this month, the government 
announced that infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Strep 
pneumoniae are on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Antibiotics have no effect on viruses. They kill only bacteria.  
But symptoms alone don't let doctors tell whether pneumonia is 
caused by a virus or bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Conventional pneumonia tests analyze either phlegm or blood and  
can take two to three days to more than a week. Consequently, 
doctors often prescribe antibiotics to be safe -- the best decision 
for a patient with bacterial pneumonia but an unnecessary exposure 
to antibiotics for patients whose pneumonia was caused by a virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Unnecessary use of antibiotics leads other bacteria in the body  
to evolve resistance to the drugs. That could mean that if the 
patient were to contract a bacterial infection later, antibiotics 
might not help. 
</P>
<P>
	Binax's new pneumonia test detects an antigen, or protein,  
present on bacterial cells that gets into patients' urine soon 
after symptoms appear. The antigen acts as a marker for 
strep-caused pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors simply stick a swab into a patient's urine sample and  
put it on a special reactive strip that within 15 minutes signals 
whether it detects the strep antigen. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland, Maine-based Binax said it was ready to ship the tests  
to doctors' offices immediately. They will cost doctors $15 to $20.

<HEADLINE> Kidney Donor Homeless, Needs Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A woman who was so generous that she gave a  
little boy one of her kidneys now has no place to live. 
</P>
<P>
	Marian Neal, 40, moved into a northern Virginia homeless shelter  
after housing officials in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, 
Va., said she was breaking the rules by living in a friend's public 
housing unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first time in a homeless shelter, but it's OK,''  
Neal said Monday in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	She remains optimistic that her situation will improve. ``I'm  
number 60 on the city's housing list, so that's good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neal said she was sharing her friend's apartment, because a  
spinal condition has kept her from working for the past few years 
and she was denied Social Security benefits. She lives on $340 a 
month in food stamps and general relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been real, real difficult,'' Neal said.  
</P>
<P>
	But she said one of the benefits of living with her friend was  
that she got to know her 7-year-old neighbor, Terrance Varner and 
his grandmother, Elaine Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrance suffered from kidney disease, and Neal volunteered to  
take him to dialysis three days a week so Harris wouldn't miss 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a few months, Neal offered one of her own kidneys to save  
the boy. The transplant took place in December and was a success. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrance now has his health but says he misses his neighbor. He  
says he ``hopes she finds a new place to live and she has money to 
pay the rent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neal says no matter where she ends up, the two will always be  
connected in a special way. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a part of me,'' she said. ``Nothing financial could  
make me feel as good as I have when I look at Terrance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terrance's grandmother says she wishes she could help but says  
the city law prevents her from inviting Neal to live with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal is not letting it get her down.  
</P>
<P>
	She has received a federal grant to attend Northern Virginia  
Community College. And while she says she doesn't know what she 
wants to do with her education, she's certain of one thing: ``I 
want to help people.''

<HEADLINE>  Underwood Pledges Full Commitment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Dimitrius Underwood's new teammates with the  
Miami Dolphins are curious to see how he develops after missing 
virtually all of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he comes in and does a spectacular job, we might start  
scratching our heads and say, `Hmm, maybe we don't need training 
camp,''' linebacker Derrick Rodgers said jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of wavering, the unpredictable Underwood pledged 100  
percent commitment to the Dolphins and practiced with them for the 
first time Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The workout was the first for the rookie defensive end since  
Aug. 2, when he walked out on the Minnesota Vikings after one 
practice to focus on his faith. Underwood said his career with the 
Dolphins will last longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to be here,'' he said. ``I'm going to get on my  
horse and get going. I've got a lot to prove. You want to be the 
best of the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, 22, arrived at the Dolphins' complex one day late  
after missing two flights from Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had some loose ends to tie up,'' he explained.  
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6 Underwood reported at 270 pounds, a few less than  
his playing weight. Wind sprints at the end of practice left him 
gasping, and he admitted that he needs to get into shape, but he 
looked quick during team drills. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood has a five-year contract, and the Dolphins consider  
him a long-term investment. But coach Jimmy Johnson didn't discount 
the possibility that his newest lineman will play this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had an excellent practice, and without question he's an  
excellent prospect,'' Johnson said. ``We had him rated as the top 
defensive end in the entire draft, and nothing he did today makes 
us change our mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota took Underwood with the 29th pick in the first round.  
He considered a career in the ministry after leaving the Vikings, 
and they released him Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was claimed on waivers by Miami after 23 other teams  
passed. He declined to tell reporters what changed his mind about 
playing football. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be like Einstein trying to explain the theory of  
relativity to you guys,'' he said. ``It would take all day and you 
still probably wouldn't understand it. I know I wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to do something until I make up my mind to. I  
told the Minnesota Vikings I wasn't ready because I wasn't fully 
committed. I'm not going to give 50 or 75 percent. When I get ready 
to do something, I can guarantee it's going to be 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Money isn't his motivation, he said, even though he has twin  
17-month-old children. Underwood sacrificed a $1.75 million signing 
bonus by leaving the Vikings, and he'll settle for a base salary of 
$395,000 with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a higher power than money,'' he said. ``The NFL is a  
great thing, but what wakes people up every day is not the same 
thing for everybody. Some wake up for the money. I wake up to a 
different beat -- the beat of God.''

<HEADLINE> Baseball Trades Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs haven't done much to help themselves during a  
dismal season, but they helped Boston and Cleveland fill holes just 
prior to Tuesday night's deadline for players to be available for 
playoff rosters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs traded closer Rod Beck to the Red Sox and catcher Tyler  
Houston to the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck became the fifth pitcher with 50 saves last season, but  
struggled at the start of this year, going 2-4 with four blown 
saves and a 10.54 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	He was placed on the disabled list May 17 with bone spurs and  
chips in his right elbow, and underwent surgery five days later. He 
was activated July 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck has a 5.51 ERA and no decisions in 15 games since  
returning. He will likely become Boston's closer, since Tom Gordon 
has missed most of the season with an arm injury and Tim Wakefield 
was forced back into the Red Sox rotation due to other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians acquired Houston as insurance in case Sandy Alomar's  
left knee keeps him out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston, who also plays third base, is hitting .233 with nine  
home runs and 27 RBIs in 100 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians will remove a player from the 40-man roster when  
Houston reports to Cleveland on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs got reliever Mark Guthrie and a player to be named for  
Beck, and minor league pitcher Richard Negrette for Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Guthrie, a left-hander, is 1-1 with a 5.83 ERA in 46 relief  
outings this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Negrette, 23, is 1-3 with one save and a 6.15 ERA in 33 relief  
appearances for Double-A Akron this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the National League, Arizona and Houston each obtained  
veteran hitters before the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks picked up Lenny Harris from the Colorado  
Rockies for 20-year-old minor league second baseman Belvani 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, who has played all four infield positions and the  
outfield in his 12 years in the major leagues, is hitting .297 this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros, after a recent rash of injuries to their outfield,  
got Stan Javier from the San Francisco Giants for pitching prospect 
Joe Messman. 
</P>
<P>
	Javier, a 15-year major league veteran, has hit .276 with three  
home runs and 30 RBIs in 112 games this season with the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Messman, a 24-year-old right-hander, is 2-4 this season with 15  
saves and a 2.54 ERA in 44 relief appearances for Single-A 
Kissimee. 
</P>
<P>
	Also:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Toronto signed free agent catcher Pat Borders, the Blue Jays'  
World Series MVP in 1992, and called up reliever John Hudek from 
Triple-A Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Baltimore acquired left-hander Jimmy Hamilton as the player to  
be named in Friday's trade that sent Harold Baines to the Cleveland 
Indians. Hamilton will be assigned to the Orioles' Triple-A 
affiliate in Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Atlanta signed free agent catcher Jorge Fabregas, who was  
recently released by the Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In addition to acquiring Harris, Arizona also purchased the  
contract of outfielder Turner Ward from Triple-A Tucson and placed 
him on the 15-day disabled list with tendinitis in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cleveland also purchased the contracts of lefty reliever Jim  
Poole from Double-A Akron and right-hander Sean DePaula from 
Buffalo.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Attack Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian aircraft and artillery  
pounded a mountainous stronghold held by Islamic militants for a 
third straight day today in a battle for control over a volatile 
southern region. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 80 combatants have been killed since Sunday, with the  
militants suffering the vast majority of the casualties, Russian 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack on several remote villages in Dagestan follows two  
weeks of intense fighting in another part of the impoverished 
republic earlier in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Government forces are again using helicopter gunships and heavy  
artillery in an attempt to crush the rebels who have imposed strict 
Islamic law in several small villages they control. 
</P>
<P>
	The villages have a total population of about 10,000, but most  
civilians fled Saturday when authorities ordered residents to hand 
over their weapons. Some 8,000 people have become refugees, Russian 
Interior Ministry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian troops moved into the villages Sunday and Monday, while  
the rebels took cover in surrounding hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian forces began using new Grad and Uragan rockets against  
the militants today, the Interior Ministry said, adding that the 
rebels appeared well-prepared for fighting and difficult to uproot. 
Seven Russian servicemen have been killed and 31 wounded, according 
to Dagestan's Deputy Military Prosecutor Zaur Akhmedov and other 
military officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The region under attack, Karamakhi, is about 50 miles east of  
where Russian troops battled insurgents earlier in August. In that 
battle, the militants came from the breakaway republic of Chechnya 
in a bid to establish an Islamic state in Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Karamakhi region was not involved in that round of fighting.  
But it is considered the heart of Islamic fundamentalism in 
Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of militant leader Bagaudin Magomedov evicted police  
and administrators from Karamakhi and surrounding villages, the 
area about 25 miles south of Dagestan's capital Makhachkala. 
</P>
<P>
	When Magomedov and his followers began imposing Islamic law, and  
Dagestan's secular authorities pleaded to Moscow for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents have been forbidden to listen to music or view  
pictures of living things. Cameras are forbidden. All women are 
required to wear Islamic dress, covering their faces, arms and 
legs. Children are barred from having toy animals or dolls, 
considered pagan objects by local religious leaders.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find Diabetes Chemical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scientists say they have identified a key  
chemical player in the development of the most severe kind of 
diabetes, a step that might help in prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, done in mice, pertains to Type 1 diabetes, which is  
treated with daily insulin shots. The disease, also known as 
juvenile diabetes, appears after the immune system mistakenly 
attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Nobody knows what 
triggers the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have been trying to identify the precise targets of  
the attack in hopes of developing a vaccine-like treatment to 
prevent the destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The new work identified a small bit of the insulin molecule as a  
target for some white blood cells involved in the destruction. That 
supports current studies in humans to see whether giving tiny 
amounts of insulin to healthy people at risk of getting diabetes 
will prevent the disease by training the immune system to ignore 
the target, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	It will take more study to see whether using the entire insulin  
molecule or just a bit of it would work better, said Dr. F. Susan 
Wong of the Yale School of Medicine. She and colleagues present the 
work in the September issue of the journal Nature Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, other researchers identified a protein called glutamic  
acid decarboxylase as a key target of attack. That protein and the 
newly identified insulin fragment are among the front-running 
candidates for development of a preventive treatment, said Dr. 
Robert Goldstein, vice president of research at the Juvenile 
Diabetes Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Coach Bemused by Trojans' Low Rank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The USC Trojans better hurry up and play a  
game or they're going to fall out of the national rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	A bemused coach Paul Hackett turned the tables on reporters  
Tuesday, saying, ``I have a question for you. How can you drop a 
couple of places even when you don't play?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Trojans, who open their season Saturday, were ranked 19th in  
The Associated Press preseason poll but slipped to No. 21 this 
week, the first vote after a smattering of early games. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's 41-7 drubbing at Penn State last weekend apparently  
soured the media poll board members' opinions about other Pac-10 
teams, including USC. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, considered the frontrunner for the conference title  
this year, was ranked fourth, but fell to 15th after the loss to 
the Nittany Lions, who moved from third to second in the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA, which also has yet to play a game, dropped a notch to No.  
17, and the Pac-10's other representative in the rankings, Arizona 
State, remained at No. 25 while awaiting its season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``So Arizona loses and we drop down? I'd think it would be hard  
to drop when you don't play,'' Hackett said, smiling and shaking 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
	It might get even weirder for USC this weekend; the Trojans play  
at Hawaii, facing a team that is mired in the nation's longest 
losing streak, 18 straight. Even a victory by USC, which is favored 
by four touchdowns, probably won't impress voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackett, who guided the Trojans to an 8-5 record last season in  
his first year, doesn't think Arizona's one-sided loss to Penn 
State provides much of an indication about the Wildcats, or the 
rest of the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think that sets everybody up,'' he said. ``I think that  
was one of those deals. I've had the misfortune to play in Happy 
Valley myself. It's an extremely difficult place to play. If they 
(the Nittany Lions) get on a roll, they don't ease up. It just 
snowballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has happened historically to some very good teams. So I  
don't really put any stock into that (the Arizona loss) at all. It 
was just one game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hackett believes Arizona, and the rest of the conference, will  
be just fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Arizona will bounce back against TCU, and I think  
they'll still be a very good team,'' Hackett said. ``I think the 
Pac-10, as the year unfolds, people will understand how good we 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Trojans should be better than last year, when Hackett was  
still getting used to the job and the players. The offense looks 
particularly strong, with quarterback Carson Palmer back after 
winning the job as a freshman last season, along with explosive 
wide receiver-kick returner R. Jay Soward and tailback Chad Morton. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking to the Hawaii game, Hackett is concerned about what he  
considers the perils of playing in paradise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's what I refer to as a foreign and hostile environment,''  
he said, seriously. ``From the Astroturf to the stands, to the 
crowd, to Waikiki, none of those things are in our favor. We'll 
find out if we're a mature enough team to learn from happened in El 
Paso.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What happen in El Paso last Dec. 31 was that the heavily favored  
Trojans were beaten 28-19 by TCU in the Sun Bowl. That should help 
his players make sure they don't take the Rainbows lightly, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to say much about that. This team was in El Paso.  
I think they realize the consequences of not preparing,'' Hackett 
said. ``One of the good things to come out of that is that I think 
we will be serious about this game.''

<HEADLINE> Bears Coach Expects To Win Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- He looked like Dick Jauron. He sounded like Dick  
Jauron. But the words were vintage Mike Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bears rookie coach doesn't care if everyone else  
expects his team to finish at the bottom of the NFC Central. He and 
his players think the Bears can win this season, and that's all 
that matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the season, we'll see where those predictions  
are,'' he said Tuesday, speaking to a sold-out crowd at the 
inaugural Kickoff Luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our future is now,'' he added. ``All of us. We want to win  
every game and we want to win now. I think we have a chance, and I 
think we have a chance because we all believe we have a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wow. Pretty strong words for a coach who inherited a team that  
was 4-12 the last two years and who still doesn't have a starting 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's Jauron. He might come across as calm and  
mild-mannered -- some might even say boring -- but he's got plenty of 
``Da Coach''s fire in him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We call it the championship season,'' he said. ``We call it  
that because at the end, there's going to be a champion, and we 
want to be that team. We want to be that team this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	OK, not to crash the kickoff party, but let's talk reality for a  
minute. The Bears will start either rookie Cade McNown or Shane 
Matthews, a veteran who's never started an NFL game, at 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis Enis, the cornerstone of the running game, is recovering  
from a season-ending knee injury last year. Rookie Russell Davis 
will likely start at right defensive end. And insurance policy 
Brian Gowins was cut Tuesday even though Jeff Jaeger isn't fully 
recovered from a hip injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really believe when a team commits to each other ... that we  
have a chance. And I think we have a strong chance,'' Jauron said. 
``Does that mean we'll win every game? No, it does not. But we 
can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron isn't the only one talking big these days. Ted Phillips,  
who became the team's president when Michael McCaskey was booted 
upstairs, doesn't want to hear about timetables or building 
processes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears had some growing pains during the preseason, but they  
also showed promise, Phillips said. They might have finished 2-2, 
but that's the best preseason record Chicago has had since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team has shown ability to win football games, and that's  
the most important thing,'' Phillips said. ``I believe the passion 
and commitment to winning has been reignited.''

<HEADLINE> David Bowie Plans Album on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Rock star David Bowie is to release his new album  
on the Internet weeks before it appears in record stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans will be able to download ``hours...'' from the Web sites of  
about 50 major music retailers including Tower Records and Virgin 
from September 21 for a fee. CDs of the recording will not hit the 
shelves until Oct. 4 in Britain and the following day in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't be more pleased,'' Internet enthusiast Bowie said  
in a statement. He said he is determined to help Internet music 
releases become the norm rather than the exception. 
</P>
<P>
	A credit card payment will allow customers to download the album  
to their hard drive but, to combat piracy, they will not be able to 
transfer it to a disk. 
</P>
<P>
	The price will be set independently by the retailers but could  
be much lower than the cost of purchasing a conventional recording. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Bowie broke new ground with an Internet-only  
release of his song ``Telling Lies.'' Bowie also has his own 
Internet service provider, BowieNet, where fans who pay a monthly 
subscription can access a full news and sports service as well as 
watch the musician rehearsing in the studio. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowie's Internet site is at www.DavidBowie.com.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Rivals Firm on Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Opposition parties demanding  
Slobodan Milosevic's ouster said in comments published today that 
they would take part in early elections -- but not if they are 
controlled by the Yugoslav president. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic is willing to hold elections early in Yugoslavia, his  
spokesman, Ivica Dacic, said on Monday. However, he rejected 
rivals' calls for the vote to be under international supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	At their meeting late Monday, the leaders of the Alliance for  
Change, who have spearheaded protests for Milosevic's ouster, 
agreed to take part in the early elections even if he does not 
relinquish power, which was their previous demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Alliance is ready for elections, but not if they are  
organized by Milosevic,'' Velimir Ilic, the group's member, told 
the V.I.P. daily bulletin. ``We will take part in the elections 
only if they are organized by someone neutral and if they are 
controlled by the international community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition claims all elections in Serbia, the dominant  
Yugoslav republic, have been rigged since Milosevic came to power 
10 years ago. The next regular elections were scheduled for the end 
of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's devastating bombing of Yugoslavia and the de-facto loss  
of Kosovo, as well as years of economic misery, have fueled demands 
for the president's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
	Vladan Batic, another Alliance leader, said that Milosevic is  
likely this week to set a date for an early vote. Batic predicted 
elections would take place before the winter, when harsh cold and 
the lack of electricity could further diminish Milosevic's 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alliance's conditions for taking part in elections include  
banning those indicted for war crimes and under travel 
restrictions, and the freeing of the state-run media, Milosevic's 
chief means of maintaining power. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic and four of his top aides have been indicted by a U.N.  
war crimes tribunal. About 300 Serbian government officials have 
been banned from traveling abroad by the European Union and other 
Western states for supporting Milosevic's autocratic policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Batic said that since Milosevic is unlikely to accept those  
conditions, the Alliance will continue with their street protests 
until the Yugoslav president is ousted. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement by the Alliance's leaders to take part in the  
elections brings them closer to their opposition rival, Vuk 
Draskovic, who has been calling for an early vote even with 
Milosevic in power. 
</P>
<P>
	Draskovic today rejected Alliance calls for a single opposition  
bloc to challenge Milosevic's communist-ultranationalist coalition, 
saying any coalitions had to wait until after election results. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ready to fight for election conditions with other  
democratic parties, but we will go the elections alone,'' Draskovic 
said.

<HEADLINE> Newest Economic Reports Are Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence fell for the second straight  
month in August as interest rates rose, while economic activity in 
the manufacturing sector grew for the seventh consecutive month, 
according to two private reports released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index, which  
measures consumers' likeliness to spend, edged down 0.4 of a point, 
less than analysts expected, to 135.8 from a revised 136.2 in July, 
but still close to the 30-year high reached in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the National Association of Purchasing Management  
said its index measuring industrial activity rose to 54.2 percent, 
up from 53.4 in July. A measure of inflation, which tracks prices 
paid by industry for raw materials and supplies, also rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing executives report had been scheduled for  
Wednesday, but the figures were mistakenly released today, the 
group said. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise report of a stronger-than-expected economy rattled  
Wall Street, which briefly gave up its early gains on fresh 
inflation jitters and started sinking sharply before recovering a 
bit on bargain-hunting late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow, which fell sharply in each of the past three sessions,  
was off as much as 132 points early this afternoon before regaining 
the lost ground. It was up slightly as the final hour of trading 
began, then sank again to close down 84.85 at 10,929.28. 
</P>
<P>
	The two reports painted a picture of an economy that remains  
strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overall picture is one of continuing growth in  
manufacturing activity during the month of August,'' Norbert J. 
Ore, chair of the National Association of Purchasing Management's 
business survey committee, said in a statement. ``Production and 
new orders remain positive and provide encouragement that the 
manufacturing sector will continue on a path of growth into the 
second half of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That sentiment, however, revived inflation fears on Wall Street.  
The Dow Jones industrial index, which had been up nearly 68 points 
during morning trading, quickly reversed course on worries the 
robust economy would push interest rates even higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's two reports are viewed as key information on the current  
state of the economy because both are measurements from August. In 
contrast, figures in many government economic releases are at least 
a month old. 
</P>
<P>
	The declines in consumer confidence in July and August followed  
eight consecutive monthly increases that led to the 30-year high 
reading of 139.0 in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers are just still so high,'' said Diane Swonk, chief  
economist with Chicago-based Bank One Corp. ``Consumers are still 
willing to spend at a fairly rapid clip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator since  
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall 
economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	While consumer confidence remains near record levels, Americans  
may begin to curtail purchases of cars and washing machines in 
light of rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve has raised key interest rates twice this  
summer in an effort to cool consumer and business spending, which 
could drive up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hikes in interest rates, severe drought conditions in the  
Northeast, and rising gasoline prices have helped dampen overall 
consumer optimism,'' said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference 
Board's Consumer Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers are less confident about current economic conditions  
and job prospects than they were in July, the survey said, with 
slight increases in the proportion saying business conditions are 
bad and jobs are hard to get. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dip in optimism in August did not carry over into  
Americans' expectations for the next six months. About 17 percent 
of all consumers look for business conditions to get better, 
roughly the same as in July. About 17.5 percent predict the job 
market to improve during the next six months, up a bit from July. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer confidence survey is based on a representative  
sample of 5,000 U.S. households. The monthly poll is conducted for 
the Conference Board by NFO Research Inc. of Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of purchasing managers is compiled from monthly  
replies to a survey of executives in more than 350 industrial 
companies.

<HEADLINE> Jury To Be Picked in Dragging Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- About 175 potential jurors reported today  
for the murder trial of a second white supremacist accused in the 
gruesome dragging death of a black man last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Russell Brewer is charged with murder in the death of  
James Byrd Jr. Lawyers will spend two weeks whittling the group to 
12. Testimony is set to begin Sept. 15 and should take about three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, 32, is the second of three men to be tried. Co-defendant  
John William King was convicted in Jasper last February and 
sentenced to death. Shawn Allen Berry is to be tried later. Both 
Brewer and Berry face a death sentence if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were accused of beating Byrd in June 1998, chaining  
him to a pickup truck and dragging him for nearly three miles 
outside Jasper, a town of 8,000 about 150 miles northeast of 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's trial was moved to the Brazos County Courthouse in  
Bryan, 150 miles west of Jasper, at the request of prosecutors who 
didn't want the defense to use a Jasper location as an issue for 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray believes King led  
the other two men to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no question that King had the charisma,'' Gray said  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gray says it was Brewer -- a member of the pro-Aryan  
Confederate Knights of America prison gang since 1995 -- who lured 
King down the path to organized hate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone had to teach Bill King,'' Gray said. That someone, he  
says, was Brewer. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy-two reporters from around the nation have been granted  
courtroom seats, indicating public interest remains strong more 
than a year and a half after the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors believe the death of Byrd, 49, was an event King and  
Brewer staged to launch their own fledgling hate group, the Texas 
Rebel Soldiers, and initiate King's friend Berry as a member. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's attorney, Doug Barlow, did not return calls from The  
Associated Press. Prosecutors are preparing for a defense similar 
to one they heard six months ago, when King's lawyers claimed their 
client joined a white supremacist prison gang to survive beatings 
or rape by black prisoners

<HEADLINE> Harlem March Organizers Seek Permit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Organizers of a Harlem march that ended last  
year in a brawl with police asked a federal judge on Monday to 
force the city to grant a permit for this year's rally, saying they 
were urging peace, not violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge agreed with organizers that police may have  
overreacted to threats of violence at last year's Million Youth 
March. Organizers asked the judge to limit the city's police force 
so it does not again use helicopters and large numbers of riot-clad 
police to disperse the crowd afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, some of it seems excessive, helicopters swooping in  
at 4 o'clock,'' U.S. District Judge Denny Chin said as he discussed 
the way police moved in a year ago at the exact moment the 
four-hour rally was required to end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think reasonable people will agree there's different  
treatment here. I don't think there are helicopters swooping down 
on the Thanksgiving Day Parade,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Chin said he would review videotapes of last year's  
demonstration before deciding whether the city must grant a permit 
for the event on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The city last week refused to grant a permit after its  
organizers threatened to stage the rally with or without a permit. 
Michael Hess, the city's corporation counsel, said this year's 
rally was not protected by the First Amendment because organizers 
have made it clear that they hope to inspire violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger S. Wareham, a lawyer for the Million Youth March, told  
Chin that rally organizers were urging peace and could not be held 
accountable for everything every speaker said last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not an official position that people should come armed  
and initiate action against the police,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wareham said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had a personal vendetta  
against rally organizer Khallid Abdul Muhammad, who last year 
encouraged the crowd to beat or shoot officers if they were 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, 28 people were injured, including 16 police  
officers, when a confrontation ensued between police and rally 
participants as it concluded. A federal appeals court allowed the 
rally to take place but severely limited its size and duration.

<HEADLINE> Northwestern's Matt Hartl Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Matt Hartl, one of the leaders of the 1995  
Northwestern football team that played in the Rose Bowl, has died 
after a lengthy battle with Hodgkin's disease. He was 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Barnett, Hartl's coach at Northwestern and now the head  
coach at Colorado, said Hartl died Monday night. A Northwestern 
spokesman confirmed that Hartl had died but did not have any 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just what you would want your son to grow up to be,''  
Barnett said of the player he recruited out of a Denver high 
school. ``He had an appreciation for everybody, all walks of life. 
He was a tough guy when he needed to be tough, and sensitive when 
he needed to be sensitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartl helped lead the team that became the first Wildcats' squad  
to play in the Rose Bowl since 1949. A redshirt freshman fullback, 
Hartl was used primarily as a blocking back. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a few months of the Rose Bowl, doctors discovered a tumor  
in his chest and diagnosed him with Hodgkin's disease, the same 
cancer his mother, Eleanor, had beaten more than 20 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	After missing the 1996 season while undergoing treatment, he  
returned for the 1997 season, starting in 11 games for the 
Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
	He planned to play the next season but could not because the  
disease reoccurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartl's death came about two years after his mother died at the  
age of 45, her heart fatally weakened by the radiation treatments 
that helped cure her cancer years before. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett said he had heard recently that Hartl's condition had  
worsened and that he had lapsed into a coma. Still, Barnett said he 
held out hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``In classic Hartl fashion he'd beat all the things he wasn't  
supposed to beat, so we were hoping he might beat this, too,'' the 
coach said.

<HEADLINE> California Gunman Remains at Large </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GARDEN GROVE, Calif. (AP) -- A gunman who killed two people and  
wounded four others when he opened fire at an auto accessories 
store remained at large today as police sought a motive. 
</P>
<P>
	Bursts of gunfire began about 1:10 p.m. Monday inside the  
Robotek store, which sells performance car accessories. A customer 
inside the store was killed and three other people were wounded, 
including the shop owner, Lt. Frank Hauptmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman then shot two more people outside the store, killing  
one, Hauptmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman used a semiautomatic weapon capable of firing bursts  
of bullets. He fled in a gray 1990 to 1994 Mazda MPV minivan, and 
another man may have fled with him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	An employee at Vina, a pager store a couple of doors down, said  
he heard about 10 gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so scared, I hide behind my counter and I didn't see  
anything,'' said the employee, who declined to give his name. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the store was a popular hangout for young people.  
</P>
<P>
	The shooting was similar to an unsolved June 2 attack on another  
auto store that killed one person and injured another. However, 
Hauptmann said investigators had not drawn any direct connection 
between the two shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead were identified as customer, Mario Taborga, 21, of  
Anaheim, killed inside the store; and Tony Ngo, 18, of Fountain 
Valley, who was killed by shots fired through the window of his 
parked car. 
</P>
<P>
	The wounded were identified as shop owner Charlie Kim, 48, of  
Garden Grove, listed in critical condition today; customer Edward 
Kim, 18, of Garden Grove, in fair condition; Han Vo, 17, also in 
fair condition; and a 15-year-old boy who was treated for an ankle 
wound and released. The Kims were not related, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garden Grove is about 35 miles southeast of Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Like $1.7M N.Y. Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKANEATELES, N.Y. (AP) -- The house-hunting first family wants to  
buy a $1.7 million property in Westchester County near New York 
City, according to two people familiar with the search. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, are  
searching for a post-White House home in New York to help Mrs. 
Clinton establish residency in anticipation of her bid for a vacant 
Senate seat. The Clintons and daughter Chelsea toured the house in 
Chappaqua on Saturday on their way from one vacation stop on 
Martha's Vineyard off the Massachusetts coast to another on New 
York's Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear if they were prepared to make an offer, but two  
people familiar with the visit said the Clintons had their heart 
set on the house. They spent nearly two hours inspecting the white 
Georgian colonial, which boasts a swimming pool out back and an 
exercise room on the top floor. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials have said they will release details on any  
particular property only after a deal is sealed, not wanting to 
sour the Clintons' ability to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
	The always cumbersome home-buying process is even further  
complicated for the Clintons, who must confer with the Secret 
Service about security issues and the White House counsel about 
legal matters related to their transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	The house sits screened by evergreens at the end of a cul-de-sac  
called Old House Lane, in a community described by neighbors as a 
quiet area with good schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very nice house, but we don't have any announcement to  
make,'' Clinton said after the visit.

<HEADLINE> US Insists KLA Must Demilitarize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid mixed signals from the Kosovo Liberation  
Army about its intentions, the State Department said Tuesday the 
KLA must abide by its promise to demilitarize by Sept. 19 and 
become a political entity. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman James Foley said the KLA military leadership has  
promised to fulfill that pledge during discussions this week with 
Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	But KLA military commander Agim Ceku said Monday the KLA would  
become a ``Kosovo army'' -- an entity not provided for in a June 
agreement signed by the KLA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The KLA will transform in several directions, not just into a  
military guard,'' Ceku said. ``One part will become part of the 
police, one part will become civil administration, one part will 
become the army of Kosovo, as a defense force. And another part 
will form a political party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Foley said the June agreements are unambiguous on what the  
KLA must do. 
</P>
<P>
	By Sept. 19, he said, ``the KLA must place all automatic  
small-arms in secure weapons storage sites and must cease wearing 
military uniforms and insignia ... September 19 is the last 
deadline envisaged under the agreement for KLA demilitarization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington,  
Army Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's top commander in Europe, said 
demilitarization of the KLA ``seems to be very much on track.'' He 
said he was pleased at signs that some Serbs who had fled Kosovo 
are beginning to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who has been visiting the Balkans  
this week, said Monday that congressional support for Kosovo 
Albanians would ``evaporate overnight'' if it became apparent they 
were not pursuing a democratic path. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the arrival of NATO-led peacekeepers in Kosovo last June,  
revenge killings and violence by ethnic Albanians targeting Serbs 
have derailed international attempts to establish normality. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, former U.S. Ambassador Thomas Melady, writing an  
opinion piece in Tuesday editions of the Washington Post, said the 
administration's policy of ``immediate reconciliation'' between 
Kosovo Albanians and Serbs is mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion, it will not work,'' Melady wrote. ``Worse than  
that it will encourage more violence and instability in Kosovo. We 
now need a period of recuperation and healing. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we know from our Western experiences in the past several  
centuries, meaningful reconciliation will come after healing. In 
the West, it has come from the people; it has not been imposed by 
outside forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Melady, who has served as ambassador to the Vatican, Burundi and  
Uganda, said his observations were based partly on his experience 
in Burundi. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there has been repeated ethnic strife there between  
Hutus and Tutsis since independence in 1962 despite the 
determination by ``outside forces'' that the two groups should live 
together in ``pluralistic democracy.''

<HEADLINE> Underwood a No-Show for Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Rookie defensive end Dimitrius Underwood  
failed to show for his first practice with the Miami Dolphins, 
which didn't seem to bother coach Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, who left the Minnesota Vikings unannounced to focus  
on his faith, was claimed off waivers Aug. 16 by the Dolphins and 
agreed to report for practice Monday. But he failed to make his 
flight Sunday night from Michigan to Fort Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he's not bothered by Underwood's pattern of  
unreliability. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a tendency to straighten out those patterns,'' Johnson  
said. ``If the pattern stays the same, obviously we'll have to 
address it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood caught a later flight, arrived Monday night and was  
expected for practice today. The rookie's tardiness raised renewed 
doubts about his commitment to a football career. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to understand our motive here,'' Johnson said.  
``Our whole thought process was to get an outstanding talent for 
the future. It would have been fine with me if he had reported next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel he's going to want to play football eventually. We  
just didn't know when.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, 22, was taken by the Vikings with the 29th pick in  
the first round of the draft. He was released Aug. 11 by the 
Vikings after practicing just once, and this month he changed his 
mind about whether to play football at least four times -- maybe 
five. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood is already not the most popular player in the  
Dolphins' locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the guy can get his act together,'' said veteran  
defensive end Trace Armstrong, sitting across from Underwood's 
vacant stall. ``He's like everybody else -- he's got to earn a spot 
on this team. He's not off to a good start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's wavering between football and faith has attracted  
considerable national publicity. He made an appearance last week on 
Jim Rome's talk show on Fox Sports Net. 
</P>
<P>
	``I notice he did make the flight for the Jim Rome show,''  
Armstrong said. ``The thing that sticks in your throat is that if 
you bring a guy like that in, you're going to have to let somebody 
go. That can be tough to swallow, given the circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Underwood joins the team, he'll bump another defensive  
lineman from the roster even though he's unlikely to play much this 
season. His conditioning is questionable because he sat out last 
season at Michigan State with a sprained ankle, and the Dolphins 
don't need to rush him into the lineup because of their depth in 
the front four.

<HEADLINE> Umpires Sue Baseball Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In what may be their last chance to save 22  
jobs, umpires went before a federal judge today asking for an 
injunction against the American and National leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Major League Umpires Association, in papers filed Monday in  
U.S. District Court, claimed the 22 are being terminated against 
their will. Union head Richie Phillips said ``permanent 
unemployment ... is a virtual certainty'' without a court order. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leagues' refusal to retain the 22 umpires -- fully a third  
of the umpire work force -- threatens to complete the destruction of 
the union's effectiveness as a collective bargaining agent,'' 
Phillips said in papers filed with the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Management lawyers think the case is a rehash of earlier  
allegations. Baseball said the umpires aren't being fired, that it 
accepted the resignations of the 22, effective after Wednesday's 
games, as a result of a failed mass resignation strategy the 
umpires embarked on after the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	The union filed a grievance against the AL and NL late Friday.  
Today's hearing was before U.S. District Judge J. Curtis Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Immediate injunctive relief is appropriate and necessary to  
maintain the status quo to permit the arbitrator to consider and 
act upon the dispute,'' the 16-page complaint said. ``Unless 
promptly enjoined, the leagues will not cease and desist from their 
unlawful course of action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires said they would be irreparably harmed if they are let  
go, partly because they would lose health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	They also sued baseball July 26, but withdrew the case Aug. 16.  
Baseball says all of the matters are covered by either binding 
arbitration or the National Labor Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB's New  
York regional office Aug. 3, asking the agency to issue a complaint 
and to seek an injunction. The NLRB has not yet ruled on the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still evaluating the evidence,'' Daniel Silverman, the  
NLRB's New York regional director, said Monday. ``I'm still hopeful 
we'll have a decision his week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Presumably in an effort to humanize the case, the complaint  
listed all the umpires scheduled to be terminated along with their 
marital status and the number of children and grandchildren they 
have. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires, who held a series of three conference calls Monday,  
said the sport would be injured if the 22, who have a combined 355 
years of major league experience, were let go. 
</P>
<P>
	``The baseball-loving public will be harmed by having less than  
the best umpires in place during this critical portion of the 1999 
season, as well as the playoffs,'' they said in a a 34-page legal 
brief filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The brief began with a quote from President Nixon, who  
arbitrated a 1985 dispute between umpires and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leagues should recognize that umpires have a special  
relationship to the game, which is different from that of 
players,'' Nixon said. ``Umpires should not be treated as employees 
but as judges who are independent of both players and owners, whose 
primary responsibility is to maintain the integrity of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brief went on to say that unless the court issues an  
injunction baseball ``will succeed in destroying two of the most 
sacred principles in major league baseball: the independence and 
integrity of major league umpires and the sanctity of arbitrating 
disputes under the collective bargaining agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fearful baseball would lock them out after their labor contract  
expires Dec. 31, umpires announced July 14 they would quit en masse 
to try to force an early start to negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	But the strategy backfired when 27 of the 68 umpires either  
refused to resign or quickly withdrew their resignations. Baseball 
then hired 25 new umpires from the minors and accepted 22 
resignations, effective Sept. 2, even though all umpires tried to 
rescind them. 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging that umpires have split into pro- and  
anti-Phillips factions, the brief said ``the union will effectively 
be gutted and rendered powerless'' if the 22 are let go because 
they are among the most hard-core supporters of the union 
leadership. The court case in Philadelphia will be a key to 
Phillips' future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, if we win tomorrow's case in court, his stock goes  
up tremendously,'' NL umpire Terry Tata said. ``If not, that's to 
be evaluated as time goes along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires now claim they never intended to quit, and the  
resignations were merely symbolic. They also claimed AL ump Drew 
Coble, one of the 22, never actually resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner was appointed to the federal bench by President Bush in  
November 1991. A resident of West Chester, Pa., he had been a judge 
on the Chester County Court of Common Pleas since 1987 before 
joining the District Court.

<HEADLINE> Jack Ford Leaving NBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jack Ford is leaving NBC to be a host and  
correspondent on ABC's ``20/20,'' where he will be a leading 
candidate to replace Charles Gibson on ``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has been the chief legal correspondent at NBC and co-anchor  
of the ``Today'' show weekend editions. 
</P>
<P>
	He will report legal and other stories and anchor one night a  
week for ``20/20,'' a newsmagazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford will also sub regularly on ``GMA,'' where Gibson returned  
as host in January to stop a ratings free fall. Gibson said he will 
stay with the morning show through the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ford and ABC News spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said no  
promises had been made that Ford will inherit Gibson's job. But 
Ford said Monday it's an attractive position. 
</P>
<P>
	A former prosecutor in Monmouth County, N.J., Ford began his TV  
career as a legal commentator at New York's WCBS in 1983. He was an 
anchor at Court TV from 1991 until 1994.

<HEADLINE> No Excuses in `Alarm School' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- Think of it as traffic school with bells  
and whistles. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents and business owners whose security systems keep going  
off, causing police to come running one time too many, can escape 
fines by taking a two-hour class on how to avoid false alarms. 
</P>
<P>
	The concept is believed to have been pioneered in Los Angeles,  
where about 129,000 false-alarm calls came in last year. Residents 
in the nation's second-largest city get two false calls, then a 
choice between an $80 fine or False Alarm Reduction Class. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar program recently began in Oxnard, a city of 160,000  
where police responded to 6,931 alarm calls in 1998. Of those, 98.8 
percent were false. It costs Oxnard police about $62.04 to respond 
to each call -- meaning $424,725 a year is wasted on false alarms. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oxnard, the class is for people whose burglar alarms have  
been wrong three or more times. City law forgives the first two, 
but a third false call carries a $75 fine, and $150 per call after 
that. Those who attend an alarm-school session, however, get a $150 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is like traffic school,'' Sgt. Tom Chronister told the 45  
alarmists at the city's first-ever class. ``We want to work with 
you people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most homeowners said they forgot to close a door or window, but  
many were reluctant to admit they were at fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``A spider set it off,'' said one woman so security-conscious  
that she refused to give her name. 
</P>
<P>
	There were similar excuses:  
</P>
<P>
	``The motion detector was set too sensitive and there was a  
mouse. We got rid of that problem,'' said a man who also refused to 
give his name. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Santa Ana wind moved the drapes,'' a woman said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Birds get through the roll-up door and trigger the motion  
detector,'' a businessman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vince Nigro, president of Southern California Security  
Association, stepped to the front of class with a helium ``Happy 
Birthday'' balloon. He used it to show how it can set off motion 
detectors by bobbing and floating around. 
</P>
<P>
	He said dogs and ceiling fans are also frequent motion-detector  
violators, and pointed out how even dust in the air can foul alarm 
sensors. 
</P>
<P>
	Chronister was an Oxnard canine unit officer who was so fed up  
with false-alarm calls that he organized the alarm education 
program. Already there has been a decrease in false alarms, Police 
Chief Art Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, the classes might not be able to stop some of  
the worst offenders: local government and the police department 
itself. The LAPD, which is exempt from alarm fines, had 97 false 
alarms last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's embarrassing,'' said Lt. Ron Marbrey, who heads the  
force's alarm unit.

<HEADLINE> David Bowie Plans Album on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Rock star David Bowie is to release his new album  
on the Internet weeks before it appears in record stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans will be able to download ``hours...'' from the Web sites of  
about 50 major music retailers including Tower Records and Virgin 
from September 21 for a fee. CDs of the recording will not hit the 
shelves until Oct. 4 in Britain and the following day in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't be more pleased,'' Internet enthusiast Bowie said  
in a statement. He said he is determined to help Internet music 
releases become the norm rather than the exception. 
</P>
<P>
	A credit card payment will allow customers to download the album  
to their hard drive but, to combat piracy, they will not be able to 
transfer it to a disk. 
</P>
<P>
	The price will be set independently by the retailers but could  
be much lower than the cost of purchasing a conventional recording. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Bowie broke new ground with an Internet-only  
release of his song ``Telling Lies.'' Bowie also has his own 
Internet service provider, BowieNet, where fans who pay a monthly 
subscription can access a full news and sports service as well as 
watch the musician rehearsing in the studio. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowie's Internet site is at http://www.DavidBowie.com.

<HEADLINE>  Diana Remembered Two Years Later </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Two years after Princess Diana's fatal car crash,  
flowers, toys and photographs again decorate the gates in front of 
her Kensington Palace home and admirers come to mark her death. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where's Diana's memorial?'' read a placard that summed up what  
many people feel about today's anniversary of Diana's death in a 
Paris car crash on Aug. 31, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	John Loughrey, 44, from southwest London, held a vigil outside  
the palace gates today. ``I was here last year, and I was here for

	In recent weeks, the Mirror newspaper has been campaigning for a  
permanent Diana memorial and claims to have had 144,000 phone calls 
of support. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial committee set up last year had proposed a  
commemorative garden near Kensington Palace, but the plan was 
quietly put on hold after local residents objected. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are not so many people out here this year, and it's  
going to get less and less. That is why we need a permanent 
memorial,'' said Joyce Vanherring, 42, who visited the palace 
Monday with her daughter Emma, 13. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, meanwhile, French police stood guard today at the  
Flame of Liberty, the Paris statue that has become Diana's shrine 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	The monument attracted almost as many television news crews as  
tourists. Of the Diana fans who did stop by, most simply snapped a 
few pictures before heading on to other Paris sites. 
</P>
<P>
	England's Royal National Rose Society was to launch a new breed  
of rose today called England's Rose in honor of the princess. The 
rose is creamy pink with an apricot blush. Its fragrance is 
described as delicate, yet deceptively powerful. Five thousand 
plants will initially be released. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a rose of the greatest delicacy and charm,'' said  
breeder David Austin. ``I can think of no rose more suitable to 
bear Diana, Princess of Wales' name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the princess' family planned low-key remembrances.  
</P>
<P>
	Diana's sons, Prince William, 17, and Prince Harry, 14, are  
spending the day at Balmoral, the royal estate in Scotland. On 
Sunday, they attended a prayer service at a nearby church along 
with their father, Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth II and other 
members of the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, was to spend today at Althorp,  
the family estate where the princess is buried on an island. There 
is also an exhibition there about her, which is open to the public 
during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the final day the exhibition was open, Althorp  
officials said there was a surge in visitors, many of whom didn't 
have tickets but wanted to pay their respects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would estimate that there are at least 500 next to the lake,  
and as always the mood is very reflective and quiet,'' said 
Spencer's spokeswoman, Shelly-Ann Claircourt. 
</P>
<P>
	Debbie Martin, 34, who visited with her family, said: ``It was a  
wonderful experience -- very moving, and I am pleased we have been 
able to make it this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Calleja, 35, visiting from New York, was less  
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a bit too commercial for my liking,'' she said. ``But  
it is nice to know I have been here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The anniversary came amid a controversy over a book planned by  
James Hewitt, Diana's former lover. Hewitt is reportedly going to 
publish his life story late this year or early next year, and is 
selling serialization rights to a tabloid. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival tabloids are expressing outrage at the distress this would  
cause Diana's sons and say he plans to make public some of the 
letters she wrote to him. Hewitt has said in the past he would 
never publish them, and his lawyer said Sunday that the letters 
would not be featured in the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckingham Palace on Monday refused to comment about Hewitt's  
book.

	LONDON (AP) -- Two years after Princess Diana's fatal car crash,

her Kensington Palace home and admirers come to mark her death.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Said To Eye Reform Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLYMOUTH, N.H. (AP) -- Pat Buchanan, the three-time presidential  
candidate whose 2000 campaign has been faltering, has intensified 
discussions about bolting the Republican Party. Supporters say he 
is more likely than ever to join the Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The supporters, including top advisers to his campaign, say the  
discussions have included talk about possible running mates and 
potential strategy for capitalizing on the media attention that 
would be generated by his departure. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.  
</P>
<P>
	However, his sister and campaign adviser Bay Buchanan said in a  
recent interview that Buchanan is considering a switch. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is seriously considering this, but he won't have a decision  
anytime soon,'' said Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press reported earlier this month that Buchanan  
was mulling a departure from the Republican Party, but Bay 
Buchanan's comments marked the first on-the-record confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent meetings, Buchanan advisers have discussed how they  
could dovetail the release of his latest book, a foreign policy 
thesis and the accompanying book tour, with the announcement of his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisers say the talks increasingly are conducted under the  
assumption that he will decide to leave the party. 
</P>
<P>
	In one recent meeting -- described as a brain storming session by  
one adviser -- Buchanan was said to have discussed the most 
politically beneficial attributes for a Reform Party running mate: 
an old-line Democrat with roots in the labor community. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials stressed that Buchanan has not made it clear  
whether or not he will leave the party but they said a decision 
could come as early as next month. He has not made a final 
decision, although the aides say he is leaning in the direction of 
a switch. 
</P>
<P>
	If he does leave, Buchanan would not be assured of the  
presidential nomination in the fractious Reform Party. Backers of 
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura have wrested the party leadership from 
associates of party founder Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
	While Perot supporters, including 1996 vice presidential  
candidate Pat Choate and past chairman Russell Verney, would 
welcome Buchanan to the party, Ventura has been cool to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reform Party nominee will have access to more than $12  
million in federal funding, millions more than Buchanan is expected 
to raise as a GOP candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said the intensified discussions about Buchanan moving to  
the Reform Party began after his disappointing fifth place finish 
in the GOP straw poll in Ames, Iowa, earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Buchanan was said to be worried that the Republican  
nomination process is geared in favor of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 
and that he has little chance of winning or even pushing his social 
and economic issues to the forefront of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders worry that a Buchanan defection would drain  
support of the GOP's most conservative voters. Already, 
conservative Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire has abandoned the 
Republican Party for a third-party run at the White House. Buchanan 
defended him against criticism from GOP leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	In a little-noticed television interview in July, Buchanan  
complained that the GOP establishment had decided that he was not a 
viable candidate. ``If they slam those doors shut,'' he warned, 
``we'll just have to look for another way.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Manager Mum on Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado Rockies manager Jim Leyland would not  
comment Tuesday on speculation that he wants to take a break from 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe reported Sunday that the 54-year-old Leyland  
has told friends he wants to take a year off because he is worried 
he can no longer relate to the modern player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't want to comment about it,'' Leyland said Tuesday  
before Colorado's game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland, who signed a three-year, $6 million contract last  
winter, hinted he would return for at least another year as he 
talked about looking forward to seeing Colorado's young prospects 
during spring training in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies have done little to inspire Leyland this season.  
With virtually the same roster that finished 77-85 under Don Baylor 
last year, the Rockies were 60-73 -- last in the NL West -- entering 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland, who won the World Series with Florida in 1997, was  
expected to get Colorado back into playoff contention this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the team has struggled and he has expressed frustration  
with the limitations of managing at Coors Field, Leyland has not 
given any clear indication that he will leave the Rockies at the 
end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules for Million Youth March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge ruled Tuesday that the Million Youth  
March can go forward in Harlem this weekend over the city's 
objections because the First Amendment protects even offensive 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Denny Chin said that many statements made by  
the event's organizers, including Khallid Abdul Muhammad, were 
``bigoted, hateful, violent and frightening.'' But he said that did 
not justify denying a permit for the rally. 
</P>
<P>
	The right to free speech ``applies not only to politically  
correct statements but also to statements with which we may 
disagree and, indeed, abhor,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least as frightening as the rhetoric of Mr. Muhammad is the  
possibility of a society where freedom of speech is not respected 
and where the right to speak publicly can be denied on the basis of 
administrative whim, personal dislike or disapproval of anticipated 
content.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city had said it would appeal any ruling that allowed the  
rally to go forward. It refused to grant a permit for the event, 
scheduled for Saturday, after organizers threatened to hold it with 
or without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Hess, the city's chief lawyer, argued that the rally  
should not be protected by the First Amendment because organizers 
made it clear they hoped to incite violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a federal appeals court allowed a similar rally to  
take place but limited its size and duration. Twenty-eight people 
were injured, including 16 police officers, in a clash between 
police and participants. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said in a lawsuit that this year's rally will push  
for the elimination of police brutality and misconduct. It also 
will call for reparations for descendants of slaves, jobs for young 
people and an increase in spending on education. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Wareham, a lawyer for the Million Youth March, told the  
judge that the rally organizers were urging peace and could not be 
held accountable for everything every speaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not an official position that people should come armed  
and initiate action against the police,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wareham said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had a vendetta against  
Muhammad, who last year encouraged the crowd to beat or shoot 
officers if they were attacked. Some in the crowd threw barricades, 
chairs and bottles in the closing moments of the rally. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Harlem news conference Monday, Malik Shabazz, a march  
organizer, vowed that ``all efforts to stamp out the Million Youth 
March will be met with divine doom and destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shabazz insisted he was not advocating violence. But he decried  
the police shooting earlier this year of African immigrant Amadou 
Diallo and said: ``The only solution to us being gunned down and 
murdered like this is, every time you see a funeral like Amadou 
Diallo's funeral, that you see an equal funeral go down in the 
white community.''

<HEADLINE> Ways To Stem Employment Losses Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is looking for ways  
to stem employment losses among the nation's manufacturers, who 
have lost nearly half a million jobs over the last 18 months 
despite the strong economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president and vice president have been committed to  
putting a specific focus on any part of the economy that has not 
shared in the strong economic times,'' said Gene Sperling, director 
of the National Economic Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is working with economists and labor leaders  
to come up with proposals the president can make in his next State 
of the Union address in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal in the task force is to take a broad-based look at  
everything from export policies to tax policies,'' Sperling said in 
a recent interview. Worker training is also under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor is a key Democratic party constituency, one that Vice  
President Al Gore is counting on to support his 2000 presidential 
campaign. The administration also wants to involve manufacturers in 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
	But some business leaders are not convinced there is a problem.  
They note that while manufacturing employment is down, productivity 
is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The focus of the task force should be to investigate ways to  
sustain manufacturing's decade-long resurgence, not formulate a 
centrally planned national industrial policy or attempt to fix a 
nonexistent problem,'' said Paul Huard, a vice president of the 
National Association of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the AFL-CIO, in a report to the administration, said the  
manufacturing sector ``is in crisis, having lost 491,000 jobs since 
March 1998. Little has been done to assist manufacturing companies 
in coping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sperling agreed that there have been ``significant losses'' in  
manufacturing over the last year and a half. However, he said the 
sector lost as many as 2 million jobs in the decade before 
President Clinton took office. 
</P>
<P>
	The sector gained 800,000 back during the first five years of  
his administration, thanks in part to federal support for 
shipyards. 
</P>
<P>
	He and labor analysts agree that the Asian financial crisis and  
subsequent monetary devaluations around the globe are largely to 
blame for the U.S. job losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor and business leaders both would like to see greater  
incentives for manufacturers to invest in retraining workers. 
</P>
<P>
	But some of labor's suggested solutions are unlikely to win  
administration support, such as devaluing the dollar and urging the 
Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has long been our policy that we are for a strong dollar  
and not using it as an instrument of trade policy,'' Sperling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other labor proposals include renegotiating the North American  
Free Trade Agreement to increase worker protections, making it 
easier to invest pension funds in pro-union businesses, and cutting 
foreign tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has committed to resisting any weakening of  
worker protections in the upcoming round of World Trade 
Organization talks and enforcing such safeguards in other trade 
agreements.

<HEADLINE> Verdicts Out in Two Oil Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A jury rejected California's claim that Exxon  
Corp. owed the state up to $750 million for underpricing oil pumped 
from public lands during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar case, a subsidiary of Los Angeles-based Occidental  
Petroleum agreed to pay $7.3 million to settle claims that is 
undervalued oil it pumped from federal land, the Justice Department 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Exxon case, a Superior Court jury deliberated 16 days  
before deciding Monday that California received fair royalty 
payments for oil taken from the 8,000-acre Wilmington field near 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors also said Exxon did not act in bad faith or manipulate  
oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	California claimed that the company had shortchanged the state  
about $350 million for oil pumped from 1981 to 1989. With interest, 
that sum would have grown to $750 million, said Larry Feldman, a 
Santa Monica attorney who represented Irving, Texas-based Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision showed there was no basis for the state's  
allegations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A jury looked at this for three long weeks and concluded that  
there was no basis for this suit,'' Feldman said. ``I hope this 
sends a message that the government's argument is plain wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision also could discourage future royalties lawsuits,  
said Martin Brian McMahon, an attorney for the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The state argued Wilmington crude oil was sold at up to $4 per  
barrel less than Alaska's North Slope crude oil. That oil was 
purchased by the same refineries that bought the Wilmington crude 
oil. The state said in a competitive market, prices should have 
been the same after adjustments for quality differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon said other factors, such as shipping costs, can affect the  
price. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco, Union Oil, Mobil Oil and Shell Oil had already paid the  
state $345 million to settle the same claims stemming from their 
operations at the Wilmington field. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Occidental case, Oxy USA Inc. was accused of undervaluing  
oil pumped between 1988 and 1997 from federal lands. The lawsuit 
was filed in U.S. District Court in Lufkin, Texas.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Army Claims Indian Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Indian soldiers crossed the volatile  
Kashmir border into Pakistan to try to capture a military post, but 
were repulsed, the Pakistani army said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	India denied launching an attack.  
</P>
<P>
	A statement from the Pakistani army said Indian soldiers, backed  
by heavy artillery fire, entered Pakistan Monday to launch a ground 
assault on a post in Shyok-Turtok. That is near Kargil, where 
Pakistani and Indian soldiers waged a bitter battle this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``A large number of enemy troops were killed and injured,'' the  
army statement said. It said three Pakistani soldiers were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	An Indian army spokesman, Col. Shruti Kant, said ``no such  
attack was launched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, India rejected Pakistan's demand for $60 million  
in compensation for shooting down a naval surveillance plane three 
weeks ago, killing 16 Pakistani personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a combat aircraft. It was on a military mission,''  
Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh told reporters. ``It was violating 
Indian air space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan says the plane was on a routine training mission and  
that India shot it down inside Pakistan's air space. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations are uneasy between the world's newest nuclear  
neighbors. They are locked in a protracted dispute over Kashmir, a 
Himalayan state divided between Pakistan and India after British 
rule in the region ended in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	New Delhi accuses Islamabad of supporting Muslim insurgents in  
Kashmir, who are waging a decade-old war demanding either outright 
independence or union with Islamic Pakistan. Pakistan says it gives 
only political and diplomatic support. 
</P>
<P>
	Kashmir has been the flash point of two wars between Pakistan  
and India. It came very close to sparking another war this summer 
after Pakistan-backed militants took control of Indian military 
posts in the Kargil sector of Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan ordered the militants to withdraw, but tension between  
the two neighbors remained high. Then, on Aug. 10, India shot down 
the Pakistani military aircraft. Pakistan has demanded a United 
Nations-sponsored investigation as well as the financial 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Singh said Tuesday he would probably meet with Pakistan's  
foreign minister at the United Nations, and was not laying any 
preconditions for the resumption of peace talks between the 
countries. But, he said, referring to the Kashmiri rebels, ``for 
reasonable, meaningful talks to take place between India and 
Pakistan, it is imperative for Pakistan to stop supporting 
terrorism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singh also accused Pakistan of encouraging a regional small arms  
and narcotics trade stemming from instability in Afghanistan.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks closed sharply lower on Tuesday,  
following an overnight drop on Wall Street and further weakness in 
the U.S. dollar against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 482.41 points,  
or 2.69 percent, to 17,436.56 at the end of daily trading. On 
Monday, the average closed up 319.60 points, or 1.82 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 110.78 yen, down 0.26 yen from its level of  
111.04 yen late Monday in Tokyo but higher than its late New York 
level of 110.73 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Tokyo share prices started lower as  
investor sentiment was damped by another overnight fall in New York 
and the weaker dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 176.04  
points to close Monday at 10,914.13, declining for the third 
consecutive session. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Japanese economic report showing worse-than-expected  
industrial production figures was also weighing on Japanese stock 
prices, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said production  
fell 0.6 percent in July from June after adjustment for seasonal 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had projected on  
average that industrial output would be up 0.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Retreats outnumbered gains 861 to 337 on the Tokyo Stock  
Exchange's First Section, while 100 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed down 40.92 points, or 2.73 percent, to 
1,457.02. The TOPIX closed up 19.56 points, or 1.32 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved as high as 110.95 yen  
early in the session after the Japanese government released the 
industrial output data. 
</P>
<P>
	But the greenback's gains were quickly pared on expectations the  
yen will strengthen as Japan's overall economy heads for recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 116.58 yen, up from  
116.09 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.9150 percent from Monday's finish of 1.9850 percent, 
driving its price up to 99.87 yen from 99.29 yen.

<HEADLINE> Truck Rollover System Tested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (AP) -- When a tractor-trailer begins a  
rollover, experts say its driver can be the last to know. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't tell when you lift a wheel off,'' said Scott  
Stevens, a researcher at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. ``The 
only thing you can tell is when you set it back down and you 
recover, or when the thing flips.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new warning system soon to undergo a yearlong test on  
truck-heavy Interstate 75 between Ohio and Florida could help 
reduce the 15,000 yearly rollovers on the nation's roadways by 
4,000, Stevens said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests, to be coordinated between the Oak Ridge lab and the  
Federal Highway Administration, will use sensors and cab computer 
readouts on three 18-wheelers to help alert the drivers about 
rollover dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chattanooga-based U.S. Xpress will put the high-tech rigs to the  
test when they start an 800-mile route from Dayton, Ohio, to 
Orlando, Fla. Oak Ridge researchers will monitor the drivers' 
braking records to see whether the warnings are effective. 
</P>
<P>
	As the center of gravity on their rig shifts, the early alarms  
will allow truckers to take corrective action, Stevens said. A 
computer screen in the cab will graphically display the impending 
turnover. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't do any good to wave alarms at him when he is  
turning over,'' he said. ``You want to tell him a few seconds ahead 
so he can slow down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Tennessee Department of Transportation will  
install radio transponders along dangerous curves on I-75 that will 
warn the truckers of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the truck knows how tippy it is, where it is with respect  
to the curve and how fast the curve is, then the driver can slow 
down in time to keep it up right,'' Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Truck rollovers are statistically rare and seldom deadly, but  
cost an estimated $3 billion in annual property damage, injuries 
and lost productivity, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Xpress trucks are already equipped with forward-searching  
sensors that spot cars and pedestrians that come dangerously close, 
said Russ Moore, the line's vice president of safety. In 1998, 30 
of the company's 6,000 drivers experienced rollovers while 
traveling a total of 500 million miles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Cochrane, a trucker educator with the American Trucking  
Association, said the sensors could make a big difference for 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are more trucks and more cars on the road today than  
there ever have been,'' she said. ``This kind of equipment... is 
going to make our lives that much easier.''

<HEADLINE> Beauty Queen Accused of Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- She was a beauty queen -- but not on the  
cheerleading team. Now 16-year-old Roni Lowe is neither. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-ager relinquished her title of Miss Lubbock Teen USA  
and withdrew from Frenship High School after she was suspended for 
allegedly threatening the cheerleading squad. 
</P>
<P>
	She allegedly declared in the lunch room: ``All of the  
cheerleaders will disappear from the face of the Earth and everyone 
will know who did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Lowe acknowledged mouthing off to one cheerleader, but  
denied that she threatened the entire squad or threatened anything 
more serious than a fistfight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I use my mouth as my hands,'' Miss Lowe said Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	A parent of one of the cheerleaders complained. After an  
investigation, school officials concluded Miss Lowe indeed made the 
alleged threat earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	She was suspended and given three months at an alternative  
campus for students with behavior problems. Miss Lowe instead 
withdrew from school last week and put down her crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``To avoid any further publicity that could possibly bring harm  
to Miss Lubbock USA and Miss Lubbock Teen USA and myself, I 
relinquish the title and crown of my own free will,'' Miss Lowe 
said in a statement released by the pageant. 
</P>
<P>
	After a series of shootings in schools nationwide, few  
administrators are laughing off any threats. Texas cheerleading has 
its own history of murderous intentions, drawing headlines in 1991 
when a mother was charged with trying to kill the mother of her 
daughter's rival for the squad. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, Wanda Webb Holloway was convicted of solicitation  
of murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison. She won a new trial, 
and pleaded no contest in 1996. She was sentenced to 10 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate, but there isn't any room for joking anymore  
when it comes to threats,'' said Paul Whitton, Frenship's 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the Miss Lubbock Teen USA pageant said that such  
threats, if proven, would violate the pageant system's strict 
behavior policies and a moral code signed by all contestants. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Vasquez, a Frenship High junior, will serve Miss Lowe's  
term as Miss Lubbock Teen USA 1999 and will get her prizes, 
including a $500 college scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Vasquez was runnerup in the February pageant and will  
compete for Miss Texas Teen USA in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Frenship students interviewed during their lunch hour  
Monday thought Miss Lowe got a bum deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone thinks she really meant it,'' said  
16-year-old Russ Lopez. ``People say stuff like this all the time 
and don't get in trouble. It just happened to get back and now 
she's in all this trouble. It's kind of stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Lowe contends she was punished so harshly because the  
principal's daughter is a cheerleader. Administrators refused to 
confirm or deny whether the daughter is on the squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Other students say there is an obvious lesson to be learned.  
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to watch what you say, even if it's just a joke,''  
said Amanda Thomas, 14. ``No one cares if you're kidding or not 
anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Indians' Gooden Activated From DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Dwight Gooden was activated from the 15-day  
disabled list by the Cleveland Indians on Tuesday, just hours 
before he was scheduled to make his first start since Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden was placed on the DL on Aug. 3, one day after he was  
removed from a start in Boston after just 2 2-3 innings because of 
a strained right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	In 21 appearances this season, 17 starts, the right-hander is  
3-3 with a 5.81 ERA. On Tuesday, he will start against Anaheim's 
Chuck Finley, the left-hander the Indians pursued before the July 
31 trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Gooden, the Indians optioned left-handed  
reliever Tom Martin to Triple-A Buffalo. He was 0-0 with a 9.00 ERA 
in two appearances since coming off a four-month stay on the DL 
following off-season shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, the Indians faced the possibility that Sandy  
Alomar's left knee may keep him out of the playoffs, acquiring 
catcher Tyler Houston from the Chicago Cubs for minor league 
pitcher Richard Negrette. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians added two other players to their 25-man roster in  
anticipation of Tuesday's midnight playoff roster deadline, 
purchasing the contract of lefty reliever Jim Poole from Double-A 
Akron and right-hander Sean DePaula from Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Poole, signed to a contract on Aug. 26 after being released by  
Philadelphia, is in his third career stint with the Indians. The 
33-year-old pitched for the Indians in 1995-96 and made 12 
appearances for Cleveland last season after being let go by San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1998 playoffs, Poole did not allow a run in six  
appearances against Boston and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Cleveland placed right-hander Jason Rakers on the  
60-day disabled list with a pulled groin, and right-hander David 
Riske on the 15-day DL, retroactive to Aug. 25, with a pulled 
oblique muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians also sent left-hander Jimmy Hamilton to Baltimore to  
complete the Harold Baines trade. Hamilton split the season between 
Akron and Buffalo, posting a combined 1-4 record in 51 games.

<HEADLINE> Handyman Confesses to Assaults </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A motel handyman who has confessed to  
killing a Yosemite National Park naturalist and three sightseers 
has also admitted to sexually assaulting the two teen-age victims, 
according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	In a previous jailhouse interview with a television reporter,  
Cary Stayner said he committed all four murders but denied that any 
sexual assault was involved. Authorities later confirmed that he 
had confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI affidavit filed Monday says that Stayner, 38, has  
admitted not only to killing sightseers Juli Sund, 15, and Silvina 
Pelosso, 16, but to sexually assaulting them in a room at the Cedar 
Lodge, where he worked as a handyman. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls, along with Juli's mother, 42-year-old Carole Sund,  
were last seen alive at the lodge in February. Their bodies were 
found weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	A search of the room yielded evidence including ``hairs in  
vacuum sweepings'' and ``possible bodily fluid stains on a blanket 
seized in the room,'' the affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit also says Stayner led the FBI to the knives he  
says he used to slash Juli's throat and to decapitate his fourth 
victim -- 26-year-old naturalist Joie Armstrong, who was killed in 
July. Investigators expected to lift fingerprints and other 
evidence from the knives, which have dried blood on them, the FBI 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner has been charged only with Ms. Armstrong's murder.  
</P>
<P>
	Following a hearing Monday, a judge ordered him to comply with  
the FBI's request to provide hair and bodily fluids. His federal 
public defender, Robert Rainwater, who had fought the request, 
declined comment Monday.

<HEADLINE> Calif. OKs Old Molestation Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The California Supreme Court has opened the  
door for prosecutors to try alleged child molesters for crimes they 
are accused of committing decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's 4-3 ruling Monday upheld a 1994 state law that  
allows molestation charges to be filed within a year of the case 
being reported to authorities, regardless of when the crime 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	In most other cases in California, prosecutors must file charges  
within six years of the alleged crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling, which is expected to affect dozens of California  
cases already in the legal pipeline, contradicted decisions by 
courts in some other states that such laws are unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	In his majority opinion, Justice Marvin Baxter wrote that the  
Legislature crafted the law out of recognition that ``young victims 
often have difficulty remembering and reporting traumatic abuse at 
the hands of adults, particularly adults who breach positions of 
trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The law, he wrote, does not violate the Constitution since it  
leaves the definition of the crime and length of potential sentence 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the law said it provided adequate safeguards  
against false accusations being brought forward years later. Among 
its provisions is one allowing prosecutors to file charges only 
when the accusation is supported by independent evidence, which 
cannot not consist of a psychiatric opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Sevilla, who represented the defense group California  
Attorneys for Criminal Justice, said the ruling would lead to 
prosecutions based on dubious evidence, including the 
scientifically questionable theory of recovered memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``As time passes, memory erodes, accuracy diminishes and biases  
and distortions cloud the accuracy of recall,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled specifically in the case of Raymond L. Frazer,  
charged in Mendocino County in 1996 with molesting a girl under age 
14 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadline for prosecution expired in 1990, but the  
prosecutor, relying later on the 1994 law, filed the charge within 
a year of the time the alleged victim came forward.

<HEADLINE> New Oil Head Named in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's president named a close  
ally Tuesday to head the huge state oil monopoly, a day after the 
company's old chief resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	President Hugo Chavez said the company's vice president, Hector  
Ciavaldini, would move up to the top post. He replaces Roberto 
Mandini, whom Chavez had appointed earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, who made the announcement early Tuesday before flying to  
Panama, indicated the change was linked to differences over 
production policies at Petroleos de Venezuela, known by its Spanish 
acronym PDVSA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within PDVSA there's a strategic change, started when this  
government took over,'' Chavez told reporters at Simon Bolivar 
International Airport. ``We've changed the erroneous policy of the 
previous government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the administration of Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera,  
PDVSA -- one of the world's largest oil companies -- embarked on an 
ambitious expansion plan, securing market share by making price 
subordinate to supply. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Chavez administration, which took office in February,  
has sharply curtailed that plan as part of Venezuela's policy of 
reducing output to raise prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for Venezuelan oil hit a 12-year low last year, but have  
since rebounded, largely because of cutbacks in production by 
Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Mexico. The drop in prices helped 
provoke one of Venezuela's worst economic downturns in years. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts say Mandini, who offered no specific reasons  
for his resignation, probably left the company because he disagreed 
with Chavez's policies. In addition, Ciavaldini is seen as a close 
ally of Chavez, who appointed him vice president in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciavaldini favors subordination of PDVSA to the state while  
Mandini wanted to keep the company open to the international market 
and preserve its independence, said Alberto Quiros, a former 
president of Shell de Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela competes with Saudi Arabia and Mexico as the No. 1  
foreign oil supplier to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Sun Eyes Software Transformation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sun Microsystems Inc. intends to transform the  
way everyday computer users do their word processing, spreadsheet 
operations and business presentations. But a not-so-small software 
rival stands directly in Sun's path: Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In the company's latest challenge to Microsoft's dominance of  
computer desktop software, Sun Microsystems disclosed Tuesday it 
bought a small maker of office productivity programs and intends to 
distribute the applications for free over the Internet, to anyone 
with a Web browser. That way, users don't have to load bulky and 
expensive programs directly onto their computer desktop. 
</P>
<P>
	But several analysts said Sun will be hard-pressed to wean  
computer users from Microsoft's overwhelmingly popular Office 
products, which include Word processing, Excel spreadsheet and 
PowerPoint business presentation software. Microsoft has sold at 
least 100 million Office licenses to legions of loyal users, and 
isn't likely to take the threat lightly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a direct challenge right in their face,'' said Kathey  
Hale, an analyst with the Dataquest high-tech research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said it was too early to respond but that it, too, may  
get into the Web-based application business. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun's chief executive, Scott McNealy, said his company's goal  
was to sell more heavy-duty computers that run Internet software. 
Moreover, he insisted that the company was not targeting Microsoft, 
just giving customers what they want. ``A lot of this has been 
written up wrong,'' he said at a news conference Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the announcement is the latest in a series of Sun moves  
that -- with limited success -- have tried to encroach on Microsoft's 
main businesses. A few years ago, Sun touted a new type of 
``network computer'' that lacked a harddrive and didn't run on 
Microsoft's Windows operating system. The move flopped. Sun also 
makes Java, a programming language for writing Web software that 
has met with some success but is not the Microsoft-killer that 
early backers had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Palo Alto, Calif.-based Sun did not disclose the terms of its  
new acquisition, Star Division Corp., a privately held software 
company in Fremont, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Star Division's package of office software has attracted a small  
but devoted following of users. But Sun Microsystems hopes to vault 
Star into the mainstream by transforming the product from an 
application that mainly resides on people's computers to Web-based 
software that users of portable devices, such as cellular phones 
with screens and laptops, can easily gain access to. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun is not the first company to try to crack the fledgling  
market for Web-based applications, though its move is the boldest 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for Web-based applications is growing fast as business  
customers try to cut costs of buying new software, which can run 
$400 and more a year per desktop computer. Instead of outfitting an 
entire department's machines, a corporate customer now can buy 
software on an as-needed basis by downloading it off a Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Major sellers of Web-based software applications now include  
Oracle Corp., the largest maker of corporate database software. 
Within four to five years, software makers could sell about 20 
percent of their software this way, up from virtually nothing now, 
estimated Hale, the Dataquest analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sun Microsystems is taking an unusually tough road. It  
intends to offer a relatively unknown brand of software to a market 
already dominated by another. In addition, downloading the complex 
business software could take users of conventional dial-up modems a 
frustratingly long time. For that reason, analysts said, people who 
have high-speed Internet access, such as through cable TV lines, 
will be the most likely users at first. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to have a great experience with applications being  
hosted over that slow link,'' said George Meng, group product 
manager for Microsoft's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Sun doesn't create a mass market for the Star software,  
Tuesday's announcement could help it portray itself as an Internet 
leader that knows a thing or two about technology's future. That 
strategy has helped Sun attract buyers despite growing threats from 
sellers of less expensive business computers that use Microsoft 
Windows operating software and Intel microprocessor chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors appeared to agree. Sun's stock price soared 5 percent  
Tuesday, rising $3.87 1/2 at $79.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
Microsoft inched up 31 1/4 cents to $92.56 1/4 a share.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Visit Unwelcome in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEOKUK, Iowa (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Orrin Hatch  
made an unexpected -- and unwelcome -- address to a meeting of area 
economic development officials from Iowa, Illinois and Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should not have been here,'' Paul Elgatian of the  
University of Illinois Extension Service said after Monday's 
meeting. ``I respect the senator, but I am disappointed that he was 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 70 participants were holding a brainstorming session on ways  
to develop and market value-added agricultural products from the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah senator spoke to the group for about 30 minutes,  
emphasizing the need to appoint conservative federal judges, and 
took questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Elgatian advised members to disregard Hatch's  
comments and not let them color their views. ``It taints the 
process,'' Elgatian said. ``It gets people thinking in a different 
direction, not their own perspective. You have to divorce yourself 
of those influences and it's not easy to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elgatian, whose party affiliation was not known, said he had not  
invited Hatch and did not know who did. 
</P>
<P>
	Des Moines County Supervisor Ben Diewold, the Democratic  
chairman of the Tri-State Value-Added Agricultural Marketing 
Committee, also said he had not invited the senator and that 
Hatch's speech ``took up a lot of our time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these people took time off from their work to be  
here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Diewold said Tuesday, ``No one said his visit was not  
appreciated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch's Iowa campaign director, David Wolfson, said the  
invitation was extended by an aide to Robert Ireland, CEO of 
Roquette America, which helped sponsor the meeting. 
</P>
<P>

	He said the Hatch campaign had called his office hoping to set  
up a tour of his plant, which turns corn starch into a variety of

attending the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels Sign Cease-Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) -- Congolese rebel leaders today signed a  
cease-fire to end the year-old Congo civil war, raising hopes for 
peace in Africa's biggest multinational conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-one founding members of the rebel group, Congolese Rally  
for Democracy, took part in the signing ceremony, ending six weeks 
of wrangling over whose names should appear on the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Emile Ilunga, head of the largest faction of the Congolese Rally  
for Democracy, added his signature to the accord, which was passed 
to the rebel leaders in alphabetical order of their names. His 
chief rival in the split group, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, was to be 
one of the last to sign in the ceremony at a Lusaka hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Rachid Lallali of Algeria, nominated as neutral head of a  
Joint Military Commission to oversee the cease-fire until 
international peacekeepers are in place, witnessed the signing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our expectations are very high...that the agreement will be  
fully implemented now that all political leaders are supporting it 
jointly,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The peace accord calls for a cease-fire within 24 hours between  
the rebels, Congolese President Laurent Kabila and the adjacent 
nations that support one side or the other. It also calls for the 
formation of a joint military commission headed by Lallali and a 
90-day political dialogue to be followed by free elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congolese Rally for Democracy, or RCD, had been the only  
group not to have signed the pact mediated by Zambian President 
Frederick Chiluba. 
</P>
<P>
	Bringing the seven warring parties to the peace table has  
consumed diplomatic efforts throughout Africa for the past year, 
starting with the first peace conference in Victoria Falls, 
Zimbabwe, last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiluba and Tanzanian and South African leaders have shuttled  
around the continent, trying to round up signatures from the six 
countries and two rebel groups involved in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Kabila and leaders from the countries that backed him --  
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- signed the peace accord, which calls 
for free elections on July 10. The leaders of Rwanda and Uganda, 
which have backed rebels trying to unseat Kabila, also signed. 
</P>
<P>
	But fighting continued in Congo as the two rebel groups -- the  
RCD and the Congolese Liberation Movement -- refused to sign the 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congolese Liberation Movement finally signed several weeks  
ago, but the larger of the two groups, the RCD, did not. It was 
split by a leadership dispute that spilled over into violent 
battles in the Congolese town of Kisangani in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congolese war has threatened development and security in  
central Africa, continuing the chaos that started when Kabila 
unseated former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, when the country 
was still known as Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations expects to deploy the first 17 military  
liaison officers in the capitals of Congo, Rwanda, Uganda and 
possibly Zambia by Saturday to prepare for a U.N. role in 
implementing the peace accord. Observers from the Organization of 
African Unity are also expected to be deployed. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials estimate a future peacekeeping operation could  
require a minimum of 25,000 soldiers. South Africa has already 
promised troops.

<HEADLINE> GOP Intrudes on Clintons' Vacation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKANEATELES, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton and the first lady  
came in for a little needling Tuesday during their vacation at the 
Finger Lakes when the Republican National Committee began airing a 
commercial touting the GOP's tax cut plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most folks in Skaneateles don't get to stay for free in  
multimillion-dollar vacation estates; don't get to travel free on 
planes paid for by the taxpayers,'' RNC chairman Jim Nicholson said 
at news conference in nearby Auburn, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad showed Nicholson seated next to an open briefcase with  
$10,000 in cash -- the amount he said an average New Yorker would 
save over 10 years if Clinton signed the GOP tax cut. ``Most folks 
never get to see what $10,000 looks like,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Airing only on cable television in Skaneateles, where the  
president and Hillary Rodham Clinton are spending the second week 
of their vacation with daughter Chelsea, the ad was unlikely to 
influence many voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson said it was intended primarily for the president's  
consumption, but the timing and placement suggested that its 
creators also hoped to rain a little on the Clintons' vacation, 
which has included several fund-raisers and public events to 
benefit Mrs. Clinton, who is likely to run for New York's open 
Senate seat next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Clinton ... won't you take a moment from your vacation to  
talk about real tax relief with Hillary and Al (Gore)?'' Nicholson 
said in the ad. ``You'll be glad you did when you're living in New 
York -- or whatever state you decide to call home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes also is running  
radio commercials in the area that criticize Vice President Al 
Gore's role in U.S.-Russia relations and urge Clinton to sign the 
$792 billion package of tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Jake Siewert said Mrs. Clinton's  
exploratory committee has paid for events that White House lawyers 
determined were political in nature, including a stop Monday at the 
New York State Fair. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's committee also has a separate advance team and  
spokesman working the area. Siewert said the rules Mrs. Clinton 
must follow for her own political endeavors are no different from 
rules previous first ladies obeyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The exact same rules applied, whether another first lady  
campaigned for another candidate or the party or her husband,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Siewert said Clinton still intends to veto the proposed tax-cut  
bill when Congress sends it to him because it wouldn't do enough to 
shore up Social Security or pay down the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Alluding to recent public opinion polls, he also suggested that  
Republicans have failed to garner much public support for the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the longer the Republicans talk about their  
tax cut, the less popular it seems to be,'' Siewert said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons didn't let the political back-and-forth interrupt  
their fun in the sun. The president played golf with Democratic 
fund-raiser Terence McAuliffe, who hails from Syracuse, and a few 
local political and business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton spent much of the day reading at the vacation  
house, a spokesman said. Chelsea went on a sightseeing trip through 
the village of Skaneateles and stopped to shake hands.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Olympic Budget Shrinks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympic organizers earmarked another $14  
million in budget cuts Tuesday for the scandal-heavy, sponsor-light 
2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation and interest adjustments accounted for most of the  
savings but a finance committee for the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee also cut transportation for the media and ``Olympic 
family'' by $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody's going to have to walk, said SLOC managers who figured  
fewer buses than originally budgeted will be needed to move 
athletes, team officials and the media. International Olympic 
Committee members will still get drivers and GM sport-utility 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is our numbers are going down, not up -- unlike  
most government projects,'' said Mitt Romney, president of the Salt 
Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney and his chief operating officer, Fraser Bullock, have  
recommended reducing a $1.453 billion budget to $1.33 billion, for 
a savings of $123 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller budget is expected to be adopted by the SLOC board  
Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	One cutback the SLOC won't be able to get away with is the $59  
million it owes Utah taxpayers for building Olympic facilities, 
said Ken Bullock, a SLOC trustee and executive director of the Utah 
League of Cities and Towns. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock complained that Romney has been unwilling to guarantee  
the payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said Tuesday the SLOC ``intends to pay all of its  
obligations'' -- if it can raise at least $179 million more from 
corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	The new SLOC regime has been struggling to raise money and  
contain expenses since a bribery scandal broke in December, 
triggering an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe's first criminal charge came Aug. 3 when Salt Lake  
businessman David E. Simmons admitted he hired the son of a 
powerful IOC official for a no-show job, then illegally wrote off 
the salary as a business expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake organizers trying to lower expectations are targeting  
frills and glitz usually associated with Olympic Games. Fewer 
banners will dress up Salt Lake City. Spectators will have to do 
without information booths. Athletes will find less entertainment 
and concerts at the Olympic Village. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials won't receive a subsidy for pricey hotel rooms and  
will have to get around venues on fewer golf carts. The SLOC plans 
to replace glossy color publications with fewer, black-and-white 
publications. 
</P>
<P>
	The cutbacks range far and wide, but staffing and inflation  
contingencies rank as the biggest targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found we could delay the hiring of staff by six months in  
many cases, saving tens of millions of dollars,'' Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC expects to employ 750 by games time, but delaying the  
hiring of many will save $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also plans to chop $48 million from what Romney  
said were overstated inflationary projections. Many Olympic 
expenses, he said, are fixed by contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the cuts are on a menu of possible spending restorations  
if enough money is raised. But the SLOC needs to raise $179 million 
from corporate sponsors just to balance its smaller budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC has attracted just one sponsor and four suppliers in  
the past eight months. But Romney has set an ambitious goal: 
winning a new sponsor or supplier -- and a $10 million commitment -- 
during each of the next 18 months.

<HEADLINE> Court Hears Case on Kerouac Estate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE (AP) -- The state Supreme Court heard arguments Monday  
on the tangled estate and literary archives of Jack Kerouac, whose 
1957 novel ``On the Road'' chronicled the restless spirit of the 
Beat generation. 
</P>
<P>
	After an hour of argument, the court gave no indication when it  
would rule on an appeal from a San Francisco Bay area writer who 
hopes to protect the disputed interests of Kerouac's daughter, the 
late Jan Kerouac. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughter had been in the midst of contesting the will of  
Kerouac's mother when she died in Albuquerque in 1996. The will of 
Kerouac's mother, Gabrielle Kerouac, left the Kerouac property to 
the author's third wife. The wife died in 1990, leaving the 
property in the hands of her relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerouac biographer Gerald Nicosia, who was named ``literary  
executor'' of the daughter's estate, maintains Kerouac's estate, 
including unpublished manuscripts, journals, and thousands of 
letters, which could be worth as much as $20 million. Jack Kerouac 
died of liver failure in 1969 at age 47. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicosia argued that Jan Kerouac's wishes for her father's estate  
deserve to be honored by courts in New Mexico and Florida, where 
the daughter had been contesting her grandmother's will. 
</P>
<P>
	She wanted to place her father's archives with the Bancroft  
Library at the University of California, Berkeley, where they would 
be available to scholars and writers, rather than having them sold 
piecemeal to collectors, Nicosia said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Sept. 1998, the New Mexico Court of Appeals had ruled  
against Nicosia, finding that he had no legal authority to make 
decisions about a lawsuit contesting the will of Kerouac's mother, 
who inherited her son's property when he died in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	That court ruling gave Jan Kerouac's ex-husband, John Lash of  
Brussels, Belgium, complete authority of her estate. Lash has 
sought to drop her 1994 Florida lawsuit challenging the will. 
</P>
<P>
	That effort is on hold pending a resolution in New Mexico  
courts. 
</P>
<P>
	If Nicosia's efforts are ultimately successful, Jan Kerouac's  
estate would receive one-third of her father's estate, her cousin 
would get one-third and the Sampas family retain one-third. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicosia's lawyer, Jerome Field, contended that Jan Kerouac's  
will made his client responsible for all decisions involving 
literary works and archival materials. 
</P>
<P>
	Lash's attorney, David Reynolds, argued that Nicosia's role was  
limited to serving as a ``literary agent'' and responsible for 
getting the ``best return'' on literary rights currently held by 
Jan Kerouac's estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides ``On the Road,'' Jack Kerouac was known for books such  
as ``The Dharma Bums'' (1958) and ``Desolation Angels'' (1965).

<HEADLINE> CompUSA Loss Less Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Shares of CompUSA fell today after it announced  
layoffs and posted a loss yesterday. The loss, however, was less 
than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking to remake itself as a leaner company in touch with its  
customers, CompUSA announced it is laying off 1,800 sales people 
and reassigning many of those who remain. 
</P>
<P>
	The cutbacks at the Dallas-based computer retailer were prompted  
by another money-losing quarter. The company posted a loss of $14.9 
million, or 16 cent a share, in the quarter ended June 26. Analysts 
had predicted a loss of 24 cents a share. In the same quarter last 
year, the company lost 19 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading today, shares of CompUSA dropped about 10 percent  
before recovering slightly. By late morning, shares were down 43 3/4 
cents to $6.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Jim Halpin acknowledged that the past year has  
been a difficult one. The Computer City stores that CompUSA bought 
are still underperforming, and the chain has been hammered by 
steadily dropping prices of its major commodity, personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Halpin said the cost-cutting should save $100 million a year,  
and while ``today, there's not too much we can do about employee 
morale'' amid all the layoffs, he vowed to communicate the 
company's strategy to the remaining employees, starting with 
broadcast presentations to store employees today. 
</P>
<P>
	Halpin said many of the workers being laid off at stores around  
the country worked with unprofitable corporate, government and 
education customers. Another 300 layoffs are coming, he said, which 
will bring the total since June to 2,700. 
</P>
<P>
	To get out of the tailspin, CompUSA is recasting itself as an  
all-around consumer electronics store, trying to copy the strategy 
of its more-successful rivals, Minnesota-based Best Buy and 
Virginia-based Circuit City. It will emphasize products such as 
handheld personal organizers, digital cameras and camcorders, and 
DVDs. 
</P>
<P>
	Halpin said he is pleased with progress of a company  
restructuring that was announced in June, and analysts seemed 
generally pleased with the company's recent moves. 
</P>
<P>
	``With a company as much in transition as CompUSA is, what's  
important is the direction they're headed,'' said Harry Katica, an 
analyst for Prudential Securities. ``I think they're reacting 
appropriately to very difficult industry circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings report had been delayed nearly two weeks while the  
company finished details of restructuring efforts. The company has 
closed four stores and Halpin said another 10 ``marginal'' stores 
could be closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The retailer reported net sales in the fourth quarter of $1.46  
billion, up 23 percent over a year ago, but sales at stores open 
one year or more rose just 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 1999 fiscal year, the company reported an operating loss  
of $54.2 million, or 50 cents per share, compared with operating 
income of $57.2 million, or 33 cents per share for fiscal 1998. 
Sales in stores open at least a year fell 3.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials also said they hope to spin off an Internet  
subsidiary, CompUSA Net.com Inc., first with a private offering and 
later a public offering. Halpin said the company will retain 
majority interest in the Internet operation even after a public 
sale of stock.

<HEADLINE> Lakers' West Hopeful on New Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Jerry West, a couple of days removed from  
completing reconstruction of the Los Angeles Lakers, paused Tuesday 
to contemplate the remarkable difference a year can make. 
</P>
<P>
	In a month, the Lakers will open camp with new, high-profile  
coach Phil Jackson, a stable roster to which the one missing piece 
-- a power forward -- is about to be added, all while preparing to 
move into a glittering new home and knowing they will be playing an 
82-game season. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the next couple of days, we will acquire another veteran  
player to help us up front,'' West said. ``The sooner, the 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers had been courting Charles Oakley, but he re-signed  
with Toronto on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	West would not specify whether he continues to pursue a free  
agent or work a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's too much talk and speculation as it is,'' the Lakers'  
vice president said. ``I prefer to keep it behind the scenes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But West, in Anaheim to bring attention to the Lakers' Oct. 28  
exhibition game in the Arrowhead Pond against the Utah Jazz, did 
not try to hide his enthusiasm for the coming season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always valued continuity, not having a lot of changes,  
and we're at that point in time,'' West said. ``I believe we have 
three of the top 25 players in the NBA. We already had the top two 
draws (Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant), then we added a premier 
shooter (Glen Rice). 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many reasons for hope and enthusiasm for our veteran  
players, and for fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, the NBA was barricaded by a lockout that would slash  
the season to 50 games. The Lakers endured more turbulence than 
most teams, going through two coaches, Del Harris and Kurt Rambis, 
and the weirdness of Dennis Rodman, on their way to being swept out 
of the playoffs by eventual champion San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a lot of people around the league come up to me and  
say that was the most miserable season they've ever went through,'' 
West said. ``But we had nothing to be ashamed of. As unsettling a 
year as it was, we were fortunate to win as many games as we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the summer, the Lakers re-signed Derek Fisher and Rick  
Fox to long-term contracts and quickly invoked their contract 
option on Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've definitely put together a team to pursue a  
championship,'' said Fox, who accompanied West to the news 
conference. ``We have the best players and the best coach to go 
with them. It's gratifying, to me, to know I'm in business with 
people who understand what's needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That, West reiterated, does not include Rodman, who recently has  
been trying his hardest to talk his way back into the Lakers' 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really think it's time to put Dennis Rodman behind us,''  
West said. ``If he were to come back, I'd welcome him with open 
arms because we now have a coach who can handle him. But I really 
think it's time to put that to rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers' appearance at the Pond, their final exhibition game  
of the preseason, will be their last southern California appearance 
before they play their first game at the new Staples Center. Los 
Angeles will open its season on Nov. 2 against the Jazz in Utah, 
then meet Vancouver at Staples on Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little depressing for us old folks,'' West said of the  
move out of the Great Western Forum. ``There are a lot of memories 
there. Every time I fly over it, it's very nostalgic, and I'll miss 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that (Staples) building is amazing, with all the  
amenities. ''

<HEADLINE> Juror Giuliani Hears Scalding Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- All eyes were on the jury box and the No. 1  
juror -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani -- as testimony got under way Tuesday 
in a state courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor was picked Monday to hear a $7 million civil case in  
which a man is suing his landlord claiming he was badly scalded 
while taking a shower. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Giuliani strolled from City Hall to the courthouse  
Tuesday, the former federal prosecutor said he was looking forward 
to jury duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is basically a fascinating experience to be on the other  
side,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 35 people watched portions of the trial and the court  
assigned four security guards to the case, three more than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't usually have that many people in the audience, and  
they're here, obviously, because your honor the mayor is here,'' 
Justice Elliot Wilk told jurors. ``Your focus must be on the case 
and not anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the testimony often included graphic language, the mayor  
remained impassive, his arms folded. He watched the attorneys and 
witnesses carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	New York passed a jury reform law in 1995 that eliminated  
exemptions for lawyers and other professionals. Giuliani was chosen 
as foreman of the six-member jury solely by virtue of his seat 
assignment.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Trade Beck, Houston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Last year, the Chicago Cubs were chasing the NL  
wild card. This year, they're dealing players like a spare parts 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
	With any hope of the playoffs -- or even a .500 record, for that  
matter -- dead for weeks, the Cubs traded closer Rod Beck to the 
Boston Red Sox and catcher Tyler Houston to the Cleveland Indians 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``From year to year you're going to have turnover on your  
roster,'' Cubs general manager Ed Lynch said. ``It's pretty clear 
that we're going to try to do the best we can to improve the club. 
</P>
<P>
	``More of a motivation for us,'' he added, ``when we have a  
chance to add quality arms, I think that's important that we 
continue to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs got reliever Mark Guthrie and a player to be named for  
Beck, and minor league pitcher Richard Negrette for Houston as 
clubs in the pennant race tried to beef up their rosters. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a solid, dependable reliever who can help us get the last  
couple of outs in the ballgame,'' Boston general manager Dan 
Duquette said. ``Beck is a reliable, dependable closer with playoff 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs wouldn't have reached the NL playoffs without Beck last  
season. He became the fifth pitcher with 50 saves, converting 51 of 
58 opportunities. But he faltered at the start of this year, going 
2-4 with four blown saves and a 10.54 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	He was placed on the disabled list May 17 with bone spurs and  
chips in his right elbow, and underwent surgery five days later. He 
was activated July 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``Naturally, had I been healthy all year, maybe things would  
have been different here,'' Beck said. ``I know I'm ready to go, 
but I'm also pleased that Boston had enough confidence in me to 
know what kind of player I am, that I am going to be healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has a 5.51 ERA and no decisions in 15 games since returning  
from the DL, though he pitched six scoreless innings in his last 
four outings. He has an overall record of 2-4 with seven saves and 
a 7.80 ERA this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch said he didn't try to trade Beck, but Boston sought him  
persistently over the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a case of they don't want me here,'' Beck said. ``But  
the Cubs aren't going to win anything this year and I figure with 
the lean free agent market this year, they need to fill a lot of 
holes on this ball club and the only way they're going to do that 
is through trades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck, 31, signed with the Cubs as a free agent in January 1998  
after spending seven seasons in San Francisco. He is 26-36 with 257 
saves and a 3.23 ERA in 528 major league games, all in relief. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a two-year, $9.5 million deal after last season, with  
a club option for 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I'm moving up quite a bit in the standings and have  
a chance to do some winning,'' he said. ``But when I signed on here 
for three years, I sort of figured I would play here for three 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck will report to Boston in time for Wednesday's game. He  
might be used as a setup man at first, though the Red Sox badly 
need another closer. 
</P>
<P>
	After Tom Gordon was lost for the season with an elbow injury in  
June, the Red Sox went to closer-by-committee with Derek Lowe and 
knuckleballer Tim Wakefield. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Bret Saberhagen was hurt earlier this month, Wakefield  
was moved back to the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time of the year, when you're going into the  
postseason, it's to a team's advantage to have two solid closers,'' 
Duquette said. ``Beck has regained the arm strength that made him 
one of the premier closers in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guthrie, a left-hander, is 1-1 with a 5.83 ERA in 46 relief  
outings this season. He is 35-38 with 12 saves and a 4.14 ERA in 
491 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old has pitched for Minnesota, Los Angeles and the  
Red Sox in a 10-year career. He went to the World Series with the 
Twins in 1991, and made it to the NL playoffs in 1995 and 1996 with 
the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians, facing the possibility that Sandy Alomar's left  
knee may keep him out of the playoffs, acquired insurance in 
Houston, who is hitting .233 with nine home runs and 27 RBIs in 100 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The versatile, left-handed hitter has appeared in 18 games at  
catcher and 63 games at third base. He has a career major league 
average of .260 with 23 home runs and 115 RBIs in 346 games with 
Atlanta and the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians will remove a player from its 40-man roster when  
Houston reports to Cleveland on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, hitting .317 with three homers and 16 RBIs in 82 at-bats  
this year, went on the disabled list May 21, had surgery 10 days 
later and has been rehabbing ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	Negrette, 23, is 1-3 with one save and a 6.15 ERA in 33 relief  
appearances for Double-A Akron this year.

<HEADLINE>  Ethnic Albanians Warned To Disarm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Saying racism is at the root of  
ethnic tensions in Kosovo, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke told ethnic 
Albanian leaders that congressional support will evaporate if they 
don't disarm their guerrilla army. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rains forced Holbrooke, newly confirmed as U.S. ambassador  
to the United Nations, to cancel a trip to Albania today for talks 
on ways to stabilize the southern Balkans after a 78-day NATO 
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he flew to Macedonia, where he met with Macedonian  
President Kiro Gligorov and praised his policies for keeping the 
country at peace in an area wracked by war. Holbrooke was scheduled 
to fly to Bosnia later today. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pristina, Holbrooke urged an end to the postwar ethnic  
violence blocking international efforts to establish normality in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me just stress again what ethnic differences in this  
region really are. They're just racism,'' Holbrooke said Monday 
after meetings with ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo. ``The Serbs 
of this region have a historic right to live here, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke was referring to attacks against Serbs by ethnic  
Albanians seeking revenge for the atrocities committed against them 
by Serb-led Yugoslav forces during President Slobodan Milosevic's 
18-month crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Those attacks have persisted despite the presence of 40,000 NATO  
and Russian peacekeepers who arrived June 12 in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke was joined Monday in the Kosovo capital by the ranking  
Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Joseph 
Biden. 
</P>
<P>
	Biden made clear that the Kosovo Liberation Army must cease to  
exist as an armed force by a Sept. 19 deadline set in an agreement 
between NATO and the ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it appeared as though the very forces ... and people we  
came to help were now not engaged on a path that was moving toward 
democratization, support from the U.S. Congress would evaporate 
overnight,'' Biden said at a joint news conference Monday with 
Holbrooke. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the KLA's military commander assured Holbrooke that  
the former guerrillas would honor the demilitarization agreement 
and meet the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the commander, Agim Ceku, also said the KLA would  
become a ``Kosovo army,'' an entity not provided for in the June 
demilitarization agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The KLA will transform in several directions, not just into a  
military guard,'' Ceku said. ``One part will become part of the 
police, one part will become civil administration, one part will 
become the Army of Kosovo, as a defense force. And another part 
will form a political party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke refused to comment on Ceku's remarks or explain how  
they would coexist with the conditions set down in the June deal 
that followed the NATO air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Biden said that despite ethnic violence, Washington remains  
committed to building a multiethnic society in this troubled 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see a short-term solution,'' Biden said. ``But I think  
it would be a mistake of historical proportions if the West 
concluded that there was no possibility of multi-ethnicity in 
Kosovo and there was de facto partitioning in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There has been little sign of reconciliation between Serbs and  
Albanians, who formed 90 percent of Kosovo's prewar population of 
2.1 million. As a sign of the bitterness, ethnic Albanians in 
Orahovac refused again Monday to lift the barricades they erected a 
week ago to prevent Russian peacekeepers from entering the town. 
</P>
<P>
	Albanians claim Russian mercenaries fought with the Serbs during  
the 18-month crackdown.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Backs Off Boycotting Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura was ``kidding'' when  
he said he planned to cancel his office's subscriptions to the 
Saint Paul Pioneer Press, his spokesman says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're going to be canceling any newspaper  
subscriptions,'' John Wodele said Monday. ``He was kidding when he 
said it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura on Friday called the state's second-largest newspaper  
the ``Saint Paul Pioneer Porn'' for running advertisements for 
X-rated movies and strip clubs in its sports section. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura was angered by criticism from the paper's editorial page  
staff and columnists after the governor's guest appearance Aug. 22 
at SummerSlam, a World Wrestling Federation event. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor said the newspaper was hypocritical by criticizing  
him for appearing at an event with choreographed violence, scantily 
clad women and vulgar language when, at the same time, it runs 
advertisements for X-rated movies and strip clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura felt the newspaper ``ought to take a look at their own  
policies'' if they were going to criticize professional wrestling, 
Wodele said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura told listeners during his radio show that he planned to  
cancel all subscriptions to the newspaper in the governor's office 
and deny interview requests from the paper's reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Wodele refused to comment Monday on whether Pioneer Press  
reporters would be granted interviews with the governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad he's changed his mind about canceling the Pioneer  
Press,'' said Walker Lundy, the newspaper's editor. Lundy, 
interviewed by CNN minutes after hearing the governor's latest 
comments, said he doesn't consider the situation with Ventura a 
feud. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added that if the governor ``attacks the newspaper  
inaccurately or unfairly,'' he wouldn't shy away from commenting on 
it. The newspaper maintains that it can't legally deny advertising 
space to sexually-oriented businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's predecessor also criticized him Monday for his attack  
on the newspaper, saying the state's chief executive needs to treat 
all members of the press equally and fairly. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't serve all people if you're going to eliminate  
certain media, because that eliminates their audience,'' former 
Gov. Arne Carlson said on a Minnesota Public Radio call-in show. 
</P>
<P>
	This wasn't the first time the governor took aim at the Pioneer  
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura criticized the paper in March when it published  
allegations of academic misconduct by University of Minnesota 
basketball players the day before the Gophers opened the NCAA 
tournament.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bank Promotes TV Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has  
approved a credit package worth nearly $600 million for one of 
China's largest television makers, the official newspaper China 
Daily reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The money, to be allotted over an unspecified number of years,  
will fund the development of multimedia products and digitalization 
of a cable television network, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank will provide Sichuan Changhong Electrical Appliance Co.  
loans, letters of credit and other forms of funding totaling 4.1 
billion yuan ($496 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Changhong used to be China's largest television maker, a title  
now claimed by rival Konka Group Co. Last week, Changhong announced 
a 32 percent drop to 434 million yuan ($52.5 million) in its net 
profit for the first half of the y ear ending June 30. The company 
attributed the poor results to ``a grim economic situation'' and 
intensifying competition in the domestic home appliances market.

<HEADLINE> Second Dragging Death Trial Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- Jury selection began Tuesday in the murder  
trial of a second white man accused of dragging a black man to his 
death in Jasper last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty prospective jurors for the case against Lawrence Russell  
Brewer, 32, were dismissed for legal or health reasons. Those who 
remained were given a three-page questionnaire to fill out. 
Individual questioning was to begin Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer is the second of three alleged white supremacists accused  
of abducting and beating James Byrd Jr., chaining him to a pickup 
truck and dragging him to pieces. Prosecutors believe he was killed 
as a way to recruit members to a new white supremacist 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer could get the death penalty.  
</P>
<P>
	John William King, the first to be tried, was convicted in  
Jasper last February and sentenced to death. The case against 
Brewer was moved to Bryan, 150 miles away, after the defense argued 
that the people of Jasper would be inclined to convict Brewer to 
redeem their town's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	No trial date has been set for the third defendant, Shawn Allen  
Berry.

<HEADLINE> Oakley Re-Signs With Raptors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Raptors added an important piece to  
their offseason puzzle Tuesday by re-signing power forward Charles 
Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial details of the three-year contract weren't announced,  
but Toronto had reportedly offered the 14-year veteran $6 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley, 35, was a free agent and had been courted by as many as  
eight NBA teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers and San Antonio 
Spurs. None had anywhere near enough salary-cap room to match 
Toronto's offer, yet Oakley was tempted by the possibility of 
joining a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspense ended Tuesday when the Raptors received a signed  
contract via courier from the 6-foot-9, 245-pound forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took a little bit longer than we hoped and I know Charles  
wanted to get it done earlier, too,'' general manager Glen Grunwald 
said via conference call from Orlando, where he was on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it was the first time in his long career that he had the  
opportunity to really decide where he wanted to play. I think you 
have to give the guy that benefit because he certainly deserved the 
right to choose where he wanted to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley wasn't available for comment Tuesday. He is scheduled to  
attend a news conference here on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oakley deal caps a hectic month for Grunwald. He also traded  
first-round draft pick Jonathan Bender to Indiana for veteran 
forward Antonio Davis, signed free-agent guard Dell Curry, 
re-signed center Michael Stewart and won an arbitration case 
freeing rookie center Alek Radojevic to join the team this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Re-signing Oakley, obtained prior to last season via a trade  
with the New York Knicks, was the key. Oakley's experience and 
leadership were instrumental in helping the Raptors post their best 
record ever (23-27) and contend for a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have a better team now than we did last year,''  
Grunwald said Tuesday. ``The key is making sure our younger players 
get better. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley averaged a career-low 7.5 rebounds and averaged 7 points  
a game. For his career, the Virginia Union grad has averaged 10.3 
rebounds and 10.6 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charles has had discussions with me, Butch and the coaching  
staff about what would be more effective for him and I think we'll 
incorporate some of those things,'' Grunwald said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a new situation here and I think we were all still  
working through it last year, trying to find what worked for the 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grunwald isn't concerned that the NBA's decision to clamp down  
on clutching and grabbing next season will diminish Oakley's 
effectiveness defensively. 
</P>
<P>
	``What people overlook is Charles is not just a tough guy. His  
ability to help his teammates on defense, make plays and make the 
right pass are very important and I think those things will 
continue.''

<HEADLINE> Fruit of the Loom CEO Steps Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Fruit of the Loom Ltd. CEO William Farley is  
stepping down as part of a corporate restructuring at the clothing 
company, though he will stay on as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based company also said yesterday that production  
and customer service difficulties will cause financial results for 
the rest of the year to fall significantly below analysts' 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Board member Dennis Bookshester will serve as acting chief  
executive officer of the company, best known for its underwear and 
active wear, until a replacement is found for Farley. The search is 
expected to take six to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Fruit of the Loom reported a second-quarter $2.3  
million loss as sales dropped 12 percent from the year-ago quarter 
to $551.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody's Investors Service earlier this month downgraded Fruit of  
the Loom's debt ratings, pointing to declining sales and earnings 
performance, a weak balance sheet and production and distribution 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Fruit of the Loom, in recent years, has transferred thousands of  
jobs to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean to save money. In 
addition it has transferred its financial base from Chicago to the 
Cayman Islands.

<HEADLINE> Rabid Bear in Iowa Spurs Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Health officials are trying to track  
down up to 400 tourists from as far away as Australia who played 
with a rabid bear cub at a petting zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease was discovered after the 5-month-old black bear died  
Friday. That sent officials poring through the guest registry at 
the Wild Midwest Petting Zoo near Clermont in search of everyone 
who may have had contact with the bear. 
</P>
<P>
	``This exposure by a rabid bear to innocent tourists and  
children we should take very, very seriously,'' said Dr. Steve 
Gleason, head of the Iowa Department of Public Health. ``We could 
have rabies deaths in Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota or any 
other states from which visitors might have come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 people had been called by Tuesday, but officials said  
many visitors probably didn't bother to sign the registry. 
</P>
<P>
	The bear also made an appearance at a barn dance near Dubuque  
before it died. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone who may have been exposed to rabies must get a $1,500  
series of five shots to prevent the fatal disease. Although saliva 
from the animal must penetrate the skin to transmit the disease, 
doctors warned that no chances should be taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with this virus is the minute you have symptoms,  
you're dead,'' Gleason said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of people were vaccinated Sunday and Monday at the  
hospital closest to the petting zoo. The hospital brought in extra 
vaccine to meet the initial rush. 
</P>
<P>
	State health officials said operators of the zoo broke no laws  
or regulations, because there was no way of knowning the animal had 
rabies before it died. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials examined other animals at the petting zoo for  
signs of rabies Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Jury: Exxon Doesn't Owe California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A jury has rejected claims that Exxon Corp.  
owed the state of California $750 million for allegedly 
underpricing oil pumped from public lands. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court jurors decided Monday that the state received  
fair royalty payments during the 1980s for oil taken from the 
8,000-acre Wilmington field off Long Beach. Jurors also said Exxon 
did not act in bad faith or manipulate oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In its 13-year-old civil suit against Exxon, California claimed  
that the company had shortchanged the state about $350 million for 
oil pumped from 1981 to 1989. With interest, that sum would have 
grown to $750 million, said Larry Feldman, a lawyer who represented 
Irving, Texas-based Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Brian McMahon, an attorney for the state, said he was  
``obviously disappointed'' with the outcome. He said the state had 
not yet decided whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The state argued Wilmington crude oil was sold at up to $4 per  
barrel less than Alaska's North Slope crude. The state said in a 
competitive market, prices should have been the same after 
adjustments for quality differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon said other factors, such as shipping costs, affected the  
price.

<HEADLINE> Woman Fined Over Ribbon Violation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELOIT, Wis. (AP) -- A woman who tied about 500 yellow ribbons  
around trees and utility posts to support the military in Kosovo 
has been found guilty of violating a city ordinance and fined $320. 
</P>
<P>
	Mieke Veneman was issued two citations in April for putting up  
``signs'' in the form of yellow ribbons in the public right-of-way. 
She was found guilty Monday and said on Tuesday she will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer had asked that the case be dropped because the  
ordinance does not specifically refer to yellow ribbons as signs. 
But the case prosecutor said the ordinance applied because a clause 
also refers to signs as devices to attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Oxford American Dictionary defines `sign' as `a device  
with a special meaning,'' Municipal Judge William Henderson said. 
``Under this definition, a white flag which is the universal signal 
for surrender would constitute a sign.''

<HEADLINE>  1 Dead, Dozens Hurt in Turkey Tremor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IZMIT, Turkey (AP) -- A strong tremor and aftershock hit  
northwest Turkey today, killing one person and injuring dozens, 
sending quake-damaged buildings crashing down in a shower of bricks 
and debris and terrifying survivors of the devastating quake two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	An Istanbul hospital confirmed a 30-year-old man's death from  
falling debris in the Sea of Marmara city of Izmit, and the 
Anatolia news agency cited other hospital officials as saying at 
least 166 people were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	In towns throughout the quake zone, frightened people wept,  
fainted and fled into the streets when the tremor hit. Some leaped 
from windows in panic. 
</P>
<P>
	At least seven buildings collapsed, Anatolia reported.  
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the walls cracking, the cupboard fell in front of me,  
and I was about to pass out -- I was scared,'' said 20-year-old 
Mustafa Kabil, who was in his house in the town of Kullar. 
</P>
<P>
	Istanbul's main observatory said the quake's magnitude was 5.2,  
the sharpest tremor since the hours just after the Aug. 17 
earthquake, which killed at least 14,202 people and left more than 
half a million homeless. Thousands of others were missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong tremor could be felt in Istanbul, 50 miles from  
Izmit. It came at 11:11 a.m., after a series of smaller aftershocks 
had rattled the quake zone overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Izmit, the quake and a 4.6-magnitude aftershock about 20  
minutes later created panic, with people rushing outside for fear 
that buildings would collapse. Even workers in the town's 
government-run quake crisis center abandoned their offices and went 
to work in tents outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of a depot at a tire factory collapsed in Izmit, and in the  
nearby town of Derince, a damaged 6-story building fell down, 
Anatolia reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ravaged town of Adapazari, where more than 1,500  
buildings are so badly damaged they are slated for immediate 
demolition, chunks of concrete fell as weakened buildings shook. 
Some of them shifted on their wrecked foundations. 
</P>
<P>
	Milling crowds of fearful people filled the streets, and the  
Adapazari governor's office made loudspeaker announcements calling 
for calm. One woman clutched her toddler, both of them weeping. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardens, parks and open spaces were crowded with people afraid  
to go indoors. Authorities urged people not to go back into damaged 
buildings to retrieve furniture or valuables. Some of those hurt 
had been trying to salvage belongings from damaged homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone lines were jammed and TV stations reminded people not  
to make any non-essential calls to or from the quake zone. Traffic 
backed up on the main highway out of Izmit. 
</P>
<P>
	Three smaller overnight aftershocks measured between magnitude  
3.1 and 3.3, the Istanbul observatory reported. More than 1,000 
aftershocks have shaken Turkey since the quake, some of them 
powerful enough to topple quake-damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 600,000 people have been left homeless, by government  
estimates, with most living in tents and shelters scattered 
throughout the quake zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Cold winter weather will set in beginning in another six weeks  
or so, and getting quake survivors into warm, winterized shelters 
is an urgent task. The 7.4-magnitude temblor, which devastated a 
wide swath of northwestern Turkey, toppled tens of thousands of 
buildings and caused an estimated $10 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign governments and aid officials have been working in  
recent days to assess quake damage and determine the amount of 
assistance to be provided. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright added a stop in Turkey on Sunday to her trip to the Middle 
East beginning Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mindful of dangers from new quakes, Turkey has been considering  
new preparation measures. The Milliyet newspaper reported today 
that the government would spend $3.1 million on an early-warning 
system for Istanbul, a metropolis of 12 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the system would provide early warning on potentially  
damaging shock waves, allows rapid assessment of damaged buildings 
and help prevent gas leaks that could cause fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Public anger in Turkey has been running high against contractors  
whose shoddily built apartment houses collapsed in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	In the town of Duzce, near Adapazari, prosecutors issued arrest  
warrants for 33 people held responsible for the collapse of several 
buildings where 1,117 people died and hundreds were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Those being sought included contractors, owners and engineers  
who worked on the buildings, prosecutor Bilal Gunduz told the 
Anatolia news agency. Sixteen were already in police custody.

<HEADLINE> Former NL MVP Mitchell Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Kevin Mitchell, the 1989 National League MVP,  
was arrested for investigation of felony battery after being 
accused of hitting his father during a dispute Tuesday, a police 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Mitchell was said to have slapped or punched  
Earl Mitchell, who suffered a one-inch cut to his head, police 
spokesman Dave Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Mitchell, 56, and his wife were being evicted from a  
house they rented from Kevin Mitchell and his grandmother in a 
neighborhood southeast of downtown San Diego, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute apparently was over failure to pay rent.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's stupid,'' Earl Mitchell said after his son was handcuffed  
and placed in a police car. ``He already called me to move out of 
his house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Mitchell, who grew up in San Diego, told officers he lives  
in Las Vegas, police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once among baseball's most-feared hitters, Mitchell last played  
for the Oakland Athletics. He was released on Aug. 3, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit 47 homers and had 125 RBIs with the San Francisco Giants  
in 1989 and was the NL's MVP. He hit .341 for the Cincinnati Reds 
in 1993 and .326 the following year for Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	The often injured outfielder played for seven major league  
teams, including half of the 1987 season with the hometown Padres 
before being traded to San Francisco. He was with the New York Mets 
in 1986 when they won the World Series.

<HEADLINE> Ripken Set To Come Off DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken, who has been frozen on 399 career  
homers and 2,968 hits since July 31, is expected to return from the 
disabled list Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baltimore Orioles' third baseman has been sidelined for the  
past month with nerve irritation in his lower back. He has been 
taking batting practice for several days and should be activated 
when the Orioles expand their roster beyond the current 25 players. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we did it today we'd have to take someone off the roster,''  
manager Ray Miller said Tuesday. ``He'll probably be activated 
tomorrow, but that doesn't mean he'll play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who turned 39 last week, played in a record 2,632  
straight games before voluntarily ending the streak last September. 
He went on the disabled list for the first time in his career April 
20 because of a bad back, missing three weeks, and returned to DL 
shortly after experiencing back pain Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In between he hit in 49 of 61 games, batting .352 with 15 homers  
and 43 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit his 399th career homer on July 25. Ripken will almost  
certainly hit his 400th homer this season, but he will be pressed 
to reach 3,000 hits. Even if he plays Wednesday, he will need 32 
hits in 31 games to join Tony Gwynn and Wade Boggs as the newest 
members of the 3,000-hit club. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander reliever Mike Fetters is finally ready to return to  
the Orioles after a lengthy stint on the disabled list with an 
elbow injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Fetters, who underwent shoulder surgery in June, completed a  
successful rehabilitation stint in the minors and will probably be 
activated Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fetters was 1-0 with a 5.48 ERA in 20 games before going on the  
DL. He didn't give up a hit in four short stints with Triple-A 
Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, starter Mike Mussina is still sporting an ugly bruise  
on his right shoulder, a reminder of the line drive that hit him on 
Aug. 22 in a game against the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	He will miss a second straight start Wednesday, but Miller hopes  
to use the right-hander Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at five days from now, but that's only in  
pencil,'' Miller said. ``We want to make sure he's ready and 
comfortable. You don't want him to hurt something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mussina (15-7) has never won 20 games. He was on track to reach  
that number this season until he turned into a line drive off the 
bat of Minnesota's Brook Fordyce in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles scored six runs in the bottom of the third and went  
on to an easy 9-4 victory.

<HEADLINE> Gay Awareness Film Sparks Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Third-graders in New York are seen debating the  
idea of gay marriage. Eighth-graders in San Francisco are heard 
firing questions at a gay man and a lesbian who visit their 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Storytime for first- and second-graders at a school in  
Cambridge, Mass., is shown to include the book ``Asha's Mums'' 
about a little girl who has two lesbian mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	All are excerpts from a controversial documentary, ``It's  
Elementary: Talking About Gay Issues in School,'' which first 
caused a stir when several public television stations decided to 
air it this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's being used by many school districts nationwide as a  
training tool for teachers -- unifying what some say is a growing 
move to incorporate gay and lesbian issues into school curriculums. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say talk about such issues belongs at home. But others  
argue it's a matter of dealing with issues that students already 
see every day in newspapers, on television, in movies -- and maybe 
even in their own communities or classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both schools and families have to address the issue somehow  
because it's there -- and it's not going back into the closet,'' 
said Tony D'Augelli, a psychologist at Penn State's College of 
Health and Human Development. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago school officials -- who stress that ``It's Elementary''  
will not be shown to students -- said last week that the district's 
589 principals would view the film beginning in September and 
receive a copy for their schools Today, however, officials said 
they have revised that plan, saying principals will be told about 
the film during training sessions and can request a copy for their 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	A city official who helped get the film into the district and  
who will conduct the training sessions said the decision to provide 
the film was aimed at fostering tolerance and, in turn, preventing 
violence against gay and lesbian students. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's practical. It makes good sense. It's about safety for  
children. I don't think anybody, regardless of their religious 
background, can argue with that,'' said Mary Morten, Mayor Richard 
Daley's liaison on gay and lesbian issues. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials in San Francisco, who also are using ``It's  
Elementary,'' have gone as far as imposing a ban on anti-gay slurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go stand on a playground. I guarantee you that you will hear  
within minutes kids saying, 'Oh, that's so gay. What are you, a 
fag?''' said Kevin Gogin, who counsels kids at the San Francisco 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
	Moves to address gay issues in the classroom are not, however,  
without opponents, among them tough-talking radio talk show host 
Dr. Laura Schlessinger and several religious groups who have made 
``It's Elementary'' a priority target. 
</P>
<P>
	Patti Johnson, a member of the Colorado Board of Education who  
has spoken out against the use of the film in her state, said she 
agrees with having a no-slur policy but said some teachers are 
going too far. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you have to go into big, deep explanations,  
especially when kids are little,'' Johnson said. ``It's kind of 
like when you want to stop a 2-year-old from running into the 
street. They don't always understand death or dying. But they 
understand a quick swat on the butt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Filmmaker Debra Chasnoff, who directed and co-produced the film,  
said she's simply providing resources to teachers who already have 
to deal with such issues in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just doesn't work to say, 'We're going to all be nice to  
one another. Don't use those words here.' I think you need to 
explain who those words are hurtful to,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Ducks' Coach Bellotti Gets Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Oregon football coach Mike Bellotti has  
agreed to a seven-year contract that could pay the Duck's 
fifth-year coach in excess of $700,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellotti, who has led the Ducks to a 30-17 record and three  
postseason appearances in his first four years, has accumulated 
more victories during that span than any other football coach in 
school history. 
</P>
<P>
	He has already fourth on Oregon's victory list, trailing Rich  
Brooks, Len Casanova and Prink Callison. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement runs through the 2005 season and calls for the  
first three years to be followed by a four-year annual rollover 
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact replaces a previous four-year deal that was to have  
expired following the 2001 season and could have paid as much as 
$470,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellotti, 48, will be paid a base salary of $150,000, the same  
as his current salary under his previous contract. He will be 
guaranteed an additional $250,000 in outside income, will receive 
$100,000 in deferred compensation plus an additional $20,000 in 
non-cash benefits, such as automobiles and club memberships.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Exits, Agassi Now Favored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. Open received a jolt today when  
four-time champion Pete Sampras was forced to withdraw before 
playing a match because of a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras suffered a small herniated disc in his back according to  
Dr. Brian Hainline, medical director of the Open. ``It's not 
allowing him to move as he should,'' Hainline said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras withdrew from a tournament in Indianapolis two weeks ago  
because of a hip injury. He apparently injured his back during 
practice on Sunday and asked Open officials to delay his 
first-round match until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Then today, he pulled out.  
</P>
<P>
	``The good part is that we discovered it early,'' Hainline said.  
``A large herniated disc could've jeopardized his future, so it's 
good we caught it early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The withdrawal of Sampras, the Wimbledon champion, makes Andre  
Agassi the tournament favorite. The second-seeded Agassi began his 
quest under the lights on opening night at Arthur Ashe Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always enjoyed playing at night,'' Agassi said after  
turning in an outstanding performance Monday night. ``I'm used to 
it. I love the energy of the crowd. It almost feels like theater 
out there. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just there to be entertained and enjoy.''  
</P>
<P>
	Seeking his third consecutive Grand Slam tournament final, the  
second-seeded Agassi capped the opening day of the year's final 
Grand Slam tournament Monday night with a 6-1, 6-1, 6-3 thrashing 
of Sweden's Nicklas Kulti. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi, who won the French Open in June and reached the final of  
Wimbledon in July, was in complete control against Kulti, making 
only four unforced errors in the opening set. He needed only 75 
minutes to grab a spot in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's never as easy as it looks,'' said Agassi, who equaled his  
best performance at the National Tennis Center. In 1997, he lost 
only four games in a second-round victory over Romanian Adrian 
Voinea 6-0, 6-2, 6-2.. 
</P>
<P>
	It definitely wasn't easy for 10th-seeded Marcelo Rios, who  
outlasted Martin Damm of the Czech Republic 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), 3-6, 
5-7, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one seeded player lost on Day One: No. 6 Amanda Coetzer of  
South Africa, who fell to Romanian Irina Spirlea 6-1, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Monday's winners in the women's singles were top-seeded  
Martina Hingis and No. 3 Venus Williams, Spirlea's on-court bump 
partner two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Agassi and Rios in the men's second round included No. 3  
Yevgeny Kafelnikov, No. 8 Carlos Moya and No. 12 Richard Krajicek. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Lindsay Davenport began the defense of her women's  
singles title when she took on Corina Morariu of Boca Raton, Fla. 
Tonight's key matches pit seventh-seeded Serena Williams, Venus' 
younger sister, against fellow American Kimberly Po and defending 
men's champion Patrick Rafter, seeded fourth, against Frenchman 
Cedric Pioline. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi was magnificent as he made center court his stage,  
slashing winners from every angle, outslugging his Swedish foe from 
the baseline, forcing his will on which way the points were to be 
played. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked easier than it is because it's never simple,''  
Agassi said. ``There's a lot of work that goes into making yourself 
play good tennis or focused tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I was adjusting to the conditions rather quickly,  
was moving well ... and was returning really well, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Striking the ball cleanly, Agassi made only four unforced errors  
in the 22-minute-long first set. Kulti played well, but Agassi had 
the perfect answer to every challenge the Swede presented. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love playing,'' Agassi said. ``This is what I do, it's what  
I love. I truly am enjoying this stage of my life. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis, who broke down in tears and had to be forced to return  
to the court for the trophy presentation after she lost the French 
Open, then was upset in the first round at Wimbledon, got off on 
the right foot in this Grand Slam event. She raced through the 
first set, then survived three breaks of her service in the second 
set to beat No. 74-ranked Czech Kveta Hrdlickova 6-1, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Wimbledon, Hingis won two of the three tournaments she  
entered. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, knocked out early at the French Open by a qualifier  
she underestimated, took no chances this time and romped past 
another qualifier, Tatiana Poutchek of Belarus 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't take it seriously,'' Williams said of her short stay  
in Paris. ``You can't do that. I've learned my lesson. I had to 
learn it the hard way, in a Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each player -- like today, I'd never seen her before -- I'm  
really going out there to be serious about her. I'm not sure who I 
play next, or who I have the possibility of playing, but I'm 
definitely going to go into the match as serious as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Williams made a big splash in her U.S. Open  
debut, reaching the final before losing to Hingis. In the 
semifinals that year, she bumped into Spirlea, literally, when 
changing sides during a tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
	In her victory over Coetzer on Monday, Spirlea made 31 unforced  
errors, three more than her opponent, but had 10 more winners, 
14-4.

<HEADLINE> New Nissan Exec Brings Some Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Former Renault executive Carlos Ghosn knows he is  
on a daunting mission -- reviving sputtering Nissan Motor Co. amid a 
culture of conservative management and distrust of foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ghosn believes Nissan's problems are so serious, it helps to  
be an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps to come from the outside because people don't see you  
as anybody involved in past decision-making,'' he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian-born Ghosn (pronounced GOHN) took over as Nissan's  
chief operating officer in July, after Renault SA of France agreed 
to buy a 36.8 percent stake in the cash-strapped Japanese automaker 
for $5.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghosn's arrival generated fears and headlines about  
Western-style layoffs in a society where major corporations have 
long abhorred such job cuts as ``beheadings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign heads of big corporations were unheard of in Japan until  
Ford Motor Co. bought a controlling stake in Mazda Motor Corp. 
three years ago, and brought in a former Ford executive to head the 
company. Ghosn, 45, has become one of the most closely watched 
executives in town. 
</P>
<P>
	But overall, the lively, bespectacled 45-year-old manager is  
managing to stir hopes for change not only at Nissan but also in 
Japanese industry overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan can use the change. Despite a reputation for quality  
engineering, the automaker hasn't had a hit car in ages. It has 
lost money in seven of the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghosn, who said Nissan will return to profitability in the next  
fiscal year, acknowledged the company had grown too complacent and 
failed to act on obvious problems such as the need to streamline 
its broad selection of models, cut costs, and design more 
attractive cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just the fact that a company cannot for so many years  
lose money and decline in market share without a strong reaction,'' 
he said at Nissan headquarters in Tokyo. ``The solutions to 
Nissan's difficulties -- they're inside the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed ``Le Cost Killer'' for his successful cost-reduction  
campaign at Renault, Ghosn promises to announce a far-reaching 
turnaround plan in October. That plan is expected to be radical by 
Japanese standards in possibly including plant closures. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of things we need to do even if we don't like  
the consequences,'' Ghosn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghosn has decided to reduce the number of suppliers and choose  
global suppliers on the basis of quality and cost, rather than 
sticking to related companies out of the loyalty that was once a 
pillar of how business was done in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	But his energetic, levelheaded approach -- such as setting up  
teams of workers to draw ideas from the younger ranks -- has won 
praise as a welcome departure from Japan's staid corporate world. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're under pressure to show results,'' said Shuji Yamagata,  
an executive who has been taking English lessons to keep up with 
Ghosn's meetings. ``We must now clearly state our goals and 
concepts. We have to also do our utmost to reach promised 
targets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Nissan has much to gain from joining with Renault.  
</P>
<P>
	Size alone in terms of production makes cost-slashing easier.  
Soon they will share basic auto parts as well as technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nissan people have gotten used to being losers for a long  
time,'' said Noriyuki Matsushima, auto analyst at Nikko Salomon 
Smith Barney in Tokyo. ``Whether that mindset can be changed in a 
year will be the test for Mr. Ghosn.''

<HEADLINE> Cocaine Seized in Fish Shipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- When U.S. Customs inspectors found more than a ton  
of cocaine stuffed between ice packs and fish filets in a cargo 
shipment from Ecuador, they waited to see who would pick it up. No 
one came. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arrow Airlines cargo plane carrying the strange shipment  
landed at 1:10 a.m. EDT Monday. Officials suspect workers at Miami 
International Airport may have been in on the smuggling job and 
called off the pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	``With that much cocaine and nobody coming to claim it,  
especially at that hour, it indicates to us that whoever is 
involved knew about the seizure,'' said John Clark, special agent 
in charge with the U.S. Customs service. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug seizure comes less than a week after 58 people, many of  
whom worked for American Airlines, were charged with smuggling 
drugs and weapons at the Miami airport. Clark did not say the two 
incidents were linked, but said there were similarities. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, from Guayaquil, Ecuador, contained 50 boxes of fish,  
22 of which were loaded with 2,720 pounds of cocaine, worth an 
estimated $21 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors found the cocaine wrapped neatly in waxed-paper  
packages, hidden under filets of grouper, congrio and tuna. One box 
contained 36 pounds of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	The drugs showed up in an X-ray during a routine inspection.  
</P>
<P>
	``Usually, the sort of organization that would be bringing in  
this quantity... would be pretty determined to recover it,'' Clark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Monday afternoon, the cocaine was still packed in soggy  
cardboard boxes at the airport, the fish spoiling in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``This particular airline has no coolers ... and this is a very  
perishable item,'' said chief inspector Mary Meier, noting that 
there were other shipments of fish aboard the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was immediately charged, though the investigation was  
continuing. Miami-based Arrow Air is cooperating with the customs 
service, said Michael J. Sheehan, a U.S. Customs spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Journalists' Privilege Restored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal appeals court has ruled that  
journalists are protected from revealing unused material from 
nonconfidential sources, except in special instances. 
</P>
<P>
	In its ruling Friday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court said  
journalists can block disclosure of nonconfidential materials, 
unless it can be proven they are not reasonably obtainable from 
other sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling stems from a case in which unbroadcast videotape for  
a segment on NBC's ``Dateline'' was subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court, while restoring the privilege for journalists  
it had taken away last September, said NBC must turn over the 
videotape because the material could not be obtained from other 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Weiner, a lawyer for NBC, said it was unusual for the  
appeals court to reverse its position. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because this decision restores the privilege, it will be more  
difficult to get news materials except in cases where litigants can 
satisfy the standards set by the court,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The network had refused to turn over unbroadcast videotape that  
was subpoenaed in a federal civil rights lawsuit a Hispanic couple 
filed against a Louisiana deputy sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
	A producer from the program videotaped the officer pulling over  
a rental car with out-of-state plates to test a theory that law 
enforcement officers in Louisiana were pulling over drivers because 
of race, nationality or out-of-state license plates. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC refused to release the complete tape to either party in the  
lawsuit, saying the First Amendment provided qualified privilege on 
material reporters get from nonconfidential sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry R. Sanders, a Lake Charles, La., lawyer trying to get the  
videotape from NBC, did not immediately return a telephone message 
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The court noted that judges in its region for nearly 20 years  
have consistently assumed that a journalists' privilege for 
nonconfidential materials exists. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the parties to any lawsuit were free to subpoena the press  
at will, it would likely become standard operating procedure for 
those litigating against an entity that had been the subject of 
press attention to sift through press files in search of 
information supporting their claims,'' the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court wrote that it now agrees there has been a  
qualified privilege in the past for journalists but said the 
privilege ``is less demanding than for material acquired in 
confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It said the ``wholesale exposure of press files'' would burden  
the press with heavy costs, damage its ability to do its job, 
encourage journalists to clean out files frequently and scare 
sources away or cause them to insist upon anonymity.

<HEADLINE> Ciccarelli Announces Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Dino Ciccarelli, one of just 10 players in NHL  
history to score 600 goals, announced his retirement Tuesday after 
deciding his ailing back couldn't take the punishment anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time all-star, a free agent since the Florida Panthers  
released him in July, made the announcement through the NHL 
Players' Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is with regret that I have to retire from the game I  
love,'' said Ciccarelli, a 19-year veteran. ``I have been fortunate 
to have a long career in the NHL and I will always appreciate the 
experience of playing in the NHL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ciccarelli played only 14 games for the Panthers last season,  
scoring seven points with six goals and one assist. He missed the 
first 10 games with back and ankle problems, then was sidelined 
later with a hairline fracture in his back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers bought out the final year of his contract in July  
to make him an unrestricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried skating a bit last week and the same soreness and  
stiffness was there,'' Ciccarelli told his hometown newspaper, the 
Sarnia (Ontario) Observer. ``There's no use kidding myself 
anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ciccarelli ranks ninth on the NHL's career list with 608 goals,  
two behind Bobby Hull and Vancouver's Mark Messier. He also had 592 
assists for 1,200 points, good for 28th place all-time. 
</P>
<P>
	The feisty 5-foot-10 Ciccarelli broke into the NHL with the  
Minnesota North Stars in 1981, setting playoff rookie records with 
14 goals and 21 points that still stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciccarelli also played in Washington, Detroit and Tampa Bay  
before being traded to Florida in January 1998. He scored his 600th 
NHL goal on Feb. 3, 1998, against Detroit.

<HEADLINE> `Hate Groups' Author in Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) -- In a well-kept cottage in a leafy  
neighborhood of upper-middle-class homes, a reclusive, white-haired 
author in his 70s turns out books, newsletters and essays that 
experts on hate groups say contribute to racist violence around the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Kelly Hoskins' 1985 book, ``War Cycles, Peace Cycles,''  
was found in the van of Buford O. Furrow Jr., the man accused of 
shooting up a Jewish community center in Los Angeles and killing a 
Filipino-American postal worker. Furrow, who was arraigned Monday 
in the Aug. 11 shooting, told police his actions were ``a wake-up 
call to America to kill Jews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``War Cycles, Peace Cycles'' and other writings by Hoskins make  
him one of the chief ideologues behind the Christian Identity 
religious movement, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center in 
Montgomery, Ala., which tracks hate groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The Christian Identity movement teaches that white Christians  
are God's true chosen people and Jews are impostors. Its followers 
consider non-whites to be beasts, or ``mudpeople,'' who must be 
exterminated. 
</P>
<P>
	On the advice of an attorney he would not identify, Hoskins  
declined a request for an interview by The Associated Press. In a 
written statement, he said: ``The unwarranted killing of innocent 
men, women and children is as grievous to me as it is to the rest 
of the country. I would never condone such acts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Roy, director of the intelligence project for the Southern  
Poverty Law Center, said there are an estimated 55,000 Christian 
Identity adherents in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those believed to be a Christian Identity member is Eric  
Rudolph, suspected in the 1996 Olympic bombing and the 1997 
bombings of an abortion clinic and a gay nightclub, all in Atlanta, 
and the 1998 bombing at a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic. 
Rudolph has eluded a manhunt in the rugged mountains of North 
Carolina for the past year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think everyone who reads one of Hoskins' books would  
go out and commit a crime,'' said Brittanie Zelkind, a spokeswoman 
for the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. ``But this type of 
incendiary writing, I think is a motivating factor for someone who 
is already prone to violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his 1985 book, Hoskins denounces usury, or the charging of  
interest by banks. He blames Jews for society's economic problems, 
wars and other social ills. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 1990 book, ``Vigilantes of Christendom: The Story of the  
Phineas Priesthood,'' Hoskins describes the Phineas Priesthood as 
Christian guerrillas who avenge Judeo-Christian traitors. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Vigilantes of Christendom,'' Hoskins supports the 1989  
acquittal of a North Carolina man who had been charged with killing 
homosexuals. He wrote that under God's law, homosexuality is a 
crime punishable by death. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoskins maintains a low profile in this industrial, Bible Belt  
city of about 66,000 amid the foothills of the Blue Ridge 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	He grew up in a prominent Lynchburg family, the son of a doctor,  
said Maury Hundley, 82, a former Army chaplain and distant cousin. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoskins published his first book, ``Our Nordic Race,'' in 1958.  
The book contends history demonstrates the inherent mastery of 
racially pure Nordics -- a euphemism for Northern European whites. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, Hoskins started publishing two newsletters. In his  
articles, Hoskins vehemently denounced integration and called on 
politicians to abolish usury, root out ``sodomites'' and outlaw 
racial interbreeding. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, after his newsletter began generating national  
publicity, Hoskins lost his job at a Lynchburg brokerage where he 
had once been a vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew he had some strange ideas,'' Hundley said. ``I've  
never read any of his books and don't plan to.''

<HEADLINE> Thai Elephant Playful After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- A playful Motola the elephant was  
recovering faster than expected today from surgery to save her 
mine-shredded foot. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in the two weeks since Motola arrived at the  
elephant hospital in Lampang, 317 miles north of Bangkok, she was 
showing no signs of pain today, said Preecha Puangkham, director of 
the Hang Chat Elephant Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been eating a lot of bananas and sugar cane this  
morning,'' Preecha said. ``She is in a very good mood and is 
starting to play with everything around her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Motola, a 38-year-old cow elephant, was foraging for food at a  
logging camp inside Myanmar's border with Thailand -- scene of 
decades of insurgencies -- when she stepped on a land mine. The 
blast destroyed her left front foot, but animal experts operated 
Saturday to remove the damaged parts and hope to fit the elephant 
with a prosthetic device so she can walk again. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion that crippled Motola has drawn new attention to  
the brutality sometimes inflicted on elephants in this region. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists say that in Thailand and neighboring  
countries, one common practice is the killing of wild cow elephants 
to capture their calves. 
</P>
<P>
	Around 200 elephants a year are sent from Myanmar, Laos and  
Cambodia to Thai tourist spots, Preecha said. Most are calves. 
</P>
<P>
	To get them, mothers are gunned down or seriously hurt falling  
into traps, Preecha said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surapol Duangkhae, deputy secretary general of Thailand's World  
Wildlife Fund branch, said elephants are viewed as a tourist 
commodity, trained to perform in shows or beg for donations in the 
streets of Bangkok, where they are frequently struck by cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Small elephants are preferred because ``they are cute and easy  
to train,'' Surapol said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale price for calves can reach nearly $7,000 -- twice the  
average annual wage in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	Other elephants are used as pack animals in logging operations.  
In Motola's case, blood tests showed that her owner had kept her 
fueled on amphetamines prior to the blast to make her work harder. 
The practice is common. 
</P>
<P>
	Soraida Salwala, the founder of Friends of Asian Elephants Fund,  
said the government should enforce a law to protect elephants and 
rehabilitate the forest area -- a necessity because deforestation is 
robbing elephants of their habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Otherwise, we will see the heartbreaking scenes of elephants  
in pain, like what we have seen on television for several days now, 
again and again,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Astros OF Alou Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros outfielder Moises Alou, recovering  
from major knee surgery, will be out for the season, general 
manager Gerry Hunsicker said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team hoped Alou, who fell off a treadmill before spring  
training and underwent major knee surgery that has kept him out all 
season, would be able to return to the team in September. A biking 
accident on Sunday caused another setback. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, the Astros improved their depth in the outfield  
by acquiring Stan Javier from the San Francisco Giants for 
24-year-old right-hander Joe Messman. 
</P>
<P>
	``While things look bleak, I'm still leaving the door open that  
Moises will be able to come back this season,'' Hunsicker said. 
``But the chances are slim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alou was riding his bike with his son Percio on Sunday when Alou  
stopped suddenly and fell off the bike and reinjured his knee. MRI 
results were negative and showed no structural damage occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	But the accident cause fluid to build up on the knee, leaving  
his return in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	Alou had a career year with the Astros last season. He hit .312  
with 182 hits, 38 home runs and 124 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Javier is a switch-hitter who can play all three outfield  
positions. In 112 games this season, he has made 45 starts in left 
field and 29 in right while hitting .276 in 333 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros also asked for unconditional release waivers on  
pitcher Sean Bergman, a former member of the team's rotation, and 
Alex Diaz on Tuesday. They recalled pitcher Jose Cabrera from 
Triple-A New Orleans of the PCL. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergman was 4-6 with a 5.35 ERA in 19 games and 16 starts this  
season. He spent time on the disabled list with tightness in his 
right forearm. Bergman had a 12-9 record for the Astros last 
season, a career high for victories.

<HEADLINE> Sun Micro Is Buying Star Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sun Microsystems Inc. launched a fresh assault  
today on rival Microsoft Corp.'s dominance of everyday desktop 
computer software. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of big business computers disclosed that it bought  
Star Division Corp., a small maker of office productivity software. 
The move is an attempt to shift how most people use popular 
software such as spreadsheets and word processing, onto the 
Internet and away from the personal computer desktop. 
</P>
<P>
	Star Division's package of office software has attracted a small  
but devoted following of users, but pales against the popularity of 
Microsoft's Office product line. But Sun Microsystems hopes to 
vault Star's products into the mainstream by encouraging people to 
download it off the Internet for free. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, Sun aims to change it from software that mainly  
resides on people's computers to a Web-based application that users 
of hand-held devices, such as cellular phones with screens, can 
easily gain access to. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun's chief executive, Scott McNealy, said his company's goal  
was to sell more heavy-duty computers that run Internet software 
that can be downloaded onto personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	He insisted that the company was not targeting Microsoft. ``Sun  
has never won any business for beating up Microsoft,'' McNealy told 
the CNBC financial cable television channel this morning. ``This is 
all about consumer choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, today's announcement is the latest in series of Sun moves  
that -- with limited success -- have tried to encroach on Microsoft's 
main businesses. A few years ago, Sun touted a new type of 
``network computer'' that lacked a harddrive and didn't run on 
Microsoft's Windows operating system. The move failed. Sun also 
makes Java, a programming language for writing Web software. 
</P>
<P>
	Big hurdles remain in the way of the latest initiative. Users of  
Microsoft's Office software, which includes the hugely popular Word 
processing and Excel spreadsheet programs, may be unlikely to 
switch to an untried product. And Microsoft is certain to strike 
back with aggressive moves of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Palo Alto, Calif.-based Sun did not disclose the terms of its  
purchase of Star Division, a privately held company in Fremont, 
Calif.

<HEADLINE> Barbara Bush Defends Son's Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Barbara Bush says she and her husband never  
asked their eldest son, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, if he has used 
cocaine. ``We had no need to,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with a Manchester, N.H., television station, the  
former first lady said it was ``fair'' for the news media to 
question her son about possible illegal drug use years ago, but she 
said he was right to refuse to go into details. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am proud of the stand he has taken,'' she said. ``The time  
has come to say, 'Enough.' Judge a man by what he has done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is irrelevant whether a presidential candidate ever used  
drugs, Mrs. Bush said, suggesting that the news media concentrate 
less on personal matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty-five, 30 years ago? I don't think it matters,'' Mrs.  
Bush said. ``That's ridiculous. ... Let's ask candidates about what 
they have done'' in public policy, pointing to her son's record as 
Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has acknowledged he once drank heavily and made  
``mistakes'' in his youth, there has been no evidence or even 
credible allegation that he ever has used cocaine or any other 
illegal drug. When pressed on the matter earlier this month, he 
gave varying answers and finally said he had not used illegal drugs 
in the past 25 years. He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor has said that he thinks parents should  
discuss drugs with their children. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the interview with WMUR that aired Monday, Mrs. Bush said  
she and her husband, former President Bush, ``never asked him. We 
had no need to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Bush fund-raising juggernaut continued. A senior  
official on his campaign staff predicted Tuesday that the campaign 
will report raising more than $50 million by the end of September -- 
more than any presidential candidate ever has had available to seek 
the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush had raised a record $37 million as of the end of June and  
has added steadily to it since. With a half dozen events in 
September, the campaign expects to reach at least $50 million 
before the next reporting deadline Sept 30. But the figure is not 
expected to reach $60 million, one senior Bush aide said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush campaigned Tuesday in Omaha, Neb., where he proposed the  
expansion of government-funded Head Start programs to include 
teaching preschool students to read. 
</P>
<P>
	``Head Start has done a good job in providing health needs,''  
the Texas governor said while visiting an Omaha elementary school. 
``I believe it ought to include an education program as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Head Start is a national program that provides development  
services for low-income, preschool children ages 3 to 5. Funding is 
provided through the Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe every child can read,'' Bush said. ``And I believe  
that ought to become the whole mentality of our education programs, 
and that we ought to expect the very best for everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Tuesday, Bush gained the endorsement of more than 100  
prominent Iowa farm activists, including backers in each of the 
state's 99 counties. Their backing is important in the caucus 
campaign, in part because the farm economy is suffering from 
historic low commodity prices, and many farmers face bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Mindy Tucker, a campaign spokeswoman, said Tuesday that Bush  
will miss the annual conference of U.S.-Mexico border state 
governors, set for Sept. 9-10 in Tijuana, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush had already set aside Sept. 9 to be the keynote speaker at  
an anniversary celebration for the Oak Cliff Bible Fellowship 
Church in Dallas. The church's pastor and co-founder, the Rev. Tony 
Evans, is a friend of Bush.

<HEADLINE> Reputed Russian Mobster Faults FBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A reputed Russian mob leader has denied any  
involvement in alleged money laundering through the Bank of New 
York, claiming in an interview published Tuesday that he is the 
victim of an FBI vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
	Semyon Mogilevich also suggested in the interview with the  
popular daily Moskovsky Komsomolets that the money laundering case 
was rooted in American politicians' resentment of Russia's 
increased clout since the conflict in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Mogilevich repeated a previous assertion that he didn't have  
anything near the $4.2 billion to $10 billion that news reports say 
investigators believe was funneled through the Bank of New York. 
The reports have said investigators believe Mogilevich was 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Mogilevich, who has never been prosecuted for his alleged role  
in Russian organized crime, alleged the FBI sought to tie him to 
the scandal because of the agency's failure to find evidence 
linking him to criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
	His implication in the case was ``career tricks by some FBI  
agents who want medals and credit,'' Mogilevich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``American special services have many times raised the question  
of why haven't I been arrested yet,'' said Mogilevich, who lives in 
Hungary. ``To which Hungarians always said: We would arrest him in 
a moment, but give us at least the slightest reason for us to do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mogilevich also claimed some U.S. officials were using the  
scandal to undermine Russia's global influence. ``After the swift 
deployment of our paratroopers in Kosovo ... Russia has 
strengthened its position in the world. And many don't like that,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about his personal fortune, Mogilevich said it was ``less  
than $10 billion. ... When I came home after the first report about 
the (scandal), we had an awful fight at home. My wife was yelling 
that she wanted a new rug, and I had been telling her that I had no 
money,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an earlier interview, Mogilevich said he had only laundered  
money once in his life: When he inadvertently left five dollars' 
worth of Russian currency in a pocket of his shirt before washing 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest interview, Mogilevich dismissed other accusations  
leveled against him in recent years -- including involvement in drug 
trading, commissioning murders, running a prostitution ring, and 
controlling the arms industry in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of New York scandal has been described as potentially  
one of the biggest money laundering affairs ever uncovered in the 
United States. Money laundering is the process of moving ill-gotten 
gains through a series of bank accounts until they appear to be 
profits from legal businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged with any crime in the case.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a major Russian oil company whose chairman has  
reportedly been linked to the scandal issued a statement Tuesday 
saying that Russia's failure to begin an intensive investigation 
into the case could cause all Russian businesses to be seen as 
criminal and ruin their relations with the West. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless something is done, Russian companies could face a full  
blockade,'' the company, Yukos, said in a statement carried by the 
Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's top prosecutor has called for an investigation of the  
charges.

<HEADLINE> McCain's 'Straigt Talk' Faces Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANCASTER, N.H. (AP) -- John McCain considers himself a  
blunt-speaking, pull-no-punches political maverick, but he is 
discovering aboard his ``Straight Talk Express'' campaign bus that 
he may have difficulty living up to his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential candidate, opening a four-day tour  
of this initial primary state, stands accused of waffling on 
abortion to court moderate voters. And even as he cedes no ground 
on two other issues -- campaign finance reform and foreign policy -- 
McCain acknowledges that his tough talk could fall on deaf ears 
during the 2000 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm addressing issues that I think are important to America,''  
he said in an interview. ``Whether it resonates with the public is 
not something I can control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is a critical state for McCain, who plans to bypass Iowa's  
caucuses to focus on what he suspects is a more independent-minded 
New Hampshire electorate. His poll numbers have steadily climbed 
from the low single digits to the teens in New Hampshire, though 
front-runner George W. Bush is still far ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's strategists hope his support will creep above 20  
percent, within 10 percentage points or so of Bush, after he 
highlights his personal history this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	A prisoner of war in Vietnam, McCain soon begins a book tour to  
promote ``Faith of my Fathers,'' a poignant memoir of his time in 
captivity and the standards set by his father and grandfather -- 
both war heroes and Navy admirals. 
</P>
<P>
	The book does not hide McCain's warts; he writes of his temper  
and provides a colorful accounting of his fast-living past that 
eventually led to destruction of his first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has a history of getting in trouble with his quick and  
cutting wit. He entertained reporters Tuesday with a litany of his 
blunders, including an ineffective joke he told last year about 
Chelsea Clinton, which McCain said was ``insensitive, stupid and 
cruel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview earlier, McCain said life is too short to watch  
every word. ``I get in trouble all the time and I will continue to 
get in trouble. I say what's on my mind to the frustration of my 
campaign people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Littleton, N.H., he chastised a man who challenged his  
open-trade policies, telling Jerome Danin that he is selling 
himself and his children short with protectionism. ``I did not know 
that your ambitions ... for your children were to work in a textile 
mill,'' McCain said. ``I would rather have you work in a high-tech 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told voters in rural Lancaster that sacrifices come with  
making ``lifestyle choices'' to live in a rural community, 
including reduced access to health care. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the congressional tax-cut plan an ``exercise in  
political kabuki,'' criticizing GOP leaders for a bill that gives 
immediate tax cuts to special interests and delays reductions to 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He answered all of my questions, which I respect, even if I  
wasn't crazy about all the answers,'' said Paul Smith, one of 120 
people who came to a veteran's hall to hear McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	But on abortion, McCain has shown that he's not above hedging  
his bets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona senator surprised his staff and angered  
anti-abortion allies by appearing to suggest last week that he 
would not support repealing Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court 
decision legalizing abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure, McCain tried to clarify his views with written  
statements saying he favors working to overturn the ruling while 
trying to reduce abortions through adoptions, counseling and other 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain was still struggling with the abortion issue this week.  
</P>
<P>
	``The issue of abortion is incredibly difficult and I believe  
life begins at conception,'' McCain told a small crowd in Dixville, 
N.H., late Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	That was as far as his staff expected him to go.  
</P>
<P>
	``But,'' he said, drawing an audible gasp from a senior aide,  
``I also want the Republican Party to be an inclusive party ... and 
we cannot impose a litmus test on this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The answer left him open to criticism from voters on both sides  
of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw his campaign bus on the way in here, but this wasn't  
straight talk. He was evasive,'' said Carol Roberts, an 
abortion-rights supporter from Winthrop, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidate tangled Tuesday with anti-abortion protester  
Arthur Morrill, who accused McCain of straddling ``both sides of 
the fence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People want a choice. They want a clear choice. They want more  
than a 10 cents difference from Clinton,'' said Morrill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry you misinterpreted my remarks,'' McCain replied  
briskly. 
</P>
<P>
	After broadening his portfolio all summer, McCain returned this  
week to his signature issue: Reforming campaign finance laws. 
</P>
<P>
	On foreign affairs, McCain says China and Russia are simmering  
troublespots mishandled by the Clinton administration. He wants to 
close military bases and increase military spending elsewhere, 
particularly on missile defense systems and on military pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the McCain team is unsure whether the issues will play in  
the campaign. Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, who joined McCain on 
the bus tour, said he considered running for president himself but 
determined that the timing wasn't right for a candidate who wanted 
to talk about the dire challenges facing America. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a kinder and gentler period,'' Thompson said. ``People  
don't want to face up to things that they should face up to.'' 
Straight talk, he said, can be hard to stomach.

<HEADLINE> USOC's Schultz To Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- A proposed sweeping  
reorganization of the hierarchy of the U.S. Olympic Committee will 
claim executive director Dick Schultz, who announced he will step 
down next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz lauded the recommendations for restructuring but said at  
a press conference on Monday that he will not seek the new position 
of president and CEO, which would replace his current job. He said 
it would require a longer commitment than he is prepared to make. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, the USOC executive committee adopted a preliminary  
report from a USOC public-sector task force and from an independent 
consulting firm intended to put it more in line with how major 
corporations function. 
</P>
<P>
	A principal recommendation of the report calls for creation of a  
new professional staff position of president-CEO to lead the USOC. 
It also would change the role and definition of the USOC's 
volunteer president, making it a new position of chairman of the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was invited to apply for president-CEO, Schultz  
said, ``I certainly had the option of applying. But as it was laid 
out by McKinsey &AMP; Co. and the public-sector group, this is going to 
be a three- to five-year commitment. I'm not ready to commit that 
kind of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be 70 years old here in another week. I've been  
in this business 49 years. I've hardly had any weekends off. I have 
grandchildren I haven't seen. For me to think about going another 
three to five years after Sydney (the 2000 Summer Games) is just 
not appealing to me at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz drew criticism shortly after Bill Hybl became USOC  
president in 1996, with growing concerns that his low-key style was 
resulting in a lack of leadership. Those troubles escalated this 
spring, when Hybl and other members of a volunteer board of 
directors were caught flat-footed when John Krimsky resigned as 
deputy executive director and marketing chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl will assume the job of chairman. His current job is limited  
to one four-year term expiring at the end of 2000, but there 
apparently would be no limit on his tenure as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	While a search begins for a new president-CEO, Schultz will  
devote more time to fund-raising, particularly for the 2002 Winter 
Games in Salt Lake City, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz, formerly executive director of the NCAA, said  
fund-raising efforts are improving after being disrupted by the 
Olympic bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be spending a lot of my time doing that in the  
next 12 to 14 months,'' he said. ``I will stay on until the job is 
finished, through 2000. If we have a shortfall or something and 
it's important for me to continue to be involved after that, I'll 
be willing to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how long he will continue as executive director, Schultz  
said, ``It depends on how fast the search committee can do its work 
and how quickly the board of directors will approve the 
constitution and bylaws changes. We're probably looking at five to 
six months minimum, but hopefully it will be quicker than that. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I do have a contract through 2002, my commitment to the  
USOC was to go to 2000 and then I would make a decision. If I'm 
happy and healthy, I'll go on through Salt Lake and that's the end. 
The way I feel right now, at the end of the Sydney Games in 2000, 
that's enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he will receive no severance package. ``I'm just going  
to serve out my term,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl insisted Monday that the executive committee has been  
``very pleased with many of the things that have gone on'' under 
Schultz's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision was Dick's,'' Hybl said. ``Even after there is a  
new president and CEO, Dick will be involved with fund-raising in 
the most significant way. The executive committee has confidence in 
Dick, and we've asked him to be part of the search process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The completed report of the recommended restructuring will be  
presented to the USOC board of directors, which meets Oct. 23-24. 
Formal approval will be sought at a subsequent special meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The earliest it could be done is probably late January,'' Hybl  
said. ``We will announce within a week or so the search committee. 
It is our intention to expedite this process so the president and 
CEO will have some time with Dick and also time before the Sydney 
Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McManus Jr., chairman of the USOC Public Sector task  
force, said his report did not single out Schultz or any other 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our conclusion is that the USOC, which has gotten so big,  
needs to be run like a corporation, so you have a chairman who has 
a vision and a president-CEO who will carry out those policies on a 
day-to-day basis,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Fehr, head of the Major League Baseball players' union  
and member of the public-sector board, said most organizations are 
focused ``on today's problems. We must be sure the USOC is 
structured for the next 10-to-20 years. In Washington, they call it 
`the vision thing.'''

<HEADLINE> NTSB Urges Child Safety Seat Check </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The peace of mind offered by child car seats  
can be deceptively deadly when they are not properly used, and the 
government's chief transportation safety official says few are. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board,  
asked states Monday to get moving on setting up ``fitting 
stations'' where parents go to have child restraints installed and 
checked. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to state highway safety officials in San Antonio, Hall  
offered a variety of proposals coinciding with the busy driving 
period of Labor Day holiday week. Several were driven by the 
knowledge that car accidents are the No. 1 killer of children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Safety advocates know that children should be in child  
restraints up to the age of 4, in booster seats to the age of 8, 
and in the back seat,'' said Hall -- speaking in a state where 
2-year-olds can be legally restrained by nothing other than a seat 
belt. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``not one of the 50 states has a child restraint law with  
all of these requirements in it.'' Indeed, no state requires 
booster seats for children 4 to 8, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the NTSB asked all states to set up fitting  
stations. So far, two are doing so, New York and South Carolina. 
Three others -- Hawaii, Idaho and Indiana -- are establishing sites 
where motorists can get trained in using the seats, according to 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, DaimlerChrysler AG is setting up fitting stations in  
Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., Denver and Sacramento, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall also urged states to pitch the value of seat belts to black  
youths, who he said are half as likely as whites and Hispanics to 
use them. If seat belt use were universal among young blacks, that 
could save 1,300 lives a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He held out New Mexico's graduated licensing law as a fitting  
model as the number of young people behind the wheel increases an 
expected 22 percent by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	The law requires a learning permit followed by an intermediate  
license, both restricting night driving and the number of young 
passengers allowed. A full license is granted only with a clean 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall praised DaimlerChrysler, but said ``states shouldn't wait  
for automakers to do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to take the lead by coordinating the establishment  
of permanent fitting stations'' -- perhaps at repair shops, 
firehouses, health centers or places where cars are annually 
inspected for safety, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the federal government is not weighing in with much money  
to help. About $90,000 is available for fitting station 
demonstration grants for two or three states in the next fiscal 
year, said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Surge on Crop Downgrade / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures soared Tuesday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade after a government report unexpectedly downgraded the 
quality of the upcoming crop. Other grain prices also rose. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans led the gains after the U.S. Department of Agriculture  
said only 47 percent of all U.S. soybeans were in good to excellent 
condition -- a decline of one percentage point from a week ago. It 
was the sixth straight week the rating had declined. 
</P>
<P>
        Dry weather forecasts this week for the heart of the Midwest,  
along with a weaker U.S. dollar, also supported the gains. It was the 
highest close for soybeans since Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn followed suit, though not to as great an extent, on news  
that there have been no improvements in that crop. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat got a boost from the rally in soybeans and news that  
Egypt had placed an order to buy soft red winter wheat from the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery rose 5 1/4 cents to $2.82 1/4 a  
bushel; December corn rose 2 1/2 cents to $2.19 1/4 a bushel; December 
oats rose 2 cents to $1.16 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 12 
1/2 cents to $4.83 cents a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  
while pork futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
        October live cattle fell .35 cent to 67.60 cents a pound; October  
feeder cattle fell .20 cent to 78.85 cents a pound; October lean hogs 
rose .03 cent to 45.80 cents a pound; February pork bellies fell .70 
cent to 58.75 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Chides Clinton on Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley  
added his voice Tuesday to the political chorus criticizing the 
Clinton administration's Russia policy in light of the Russian 
money-laundering scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley also included the Bush administration in his assessment  
that ``American assistance and lending policies toward Russia have 
been misdirected and ineffective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities are investigating whether Russian gangsters,  
some with ties to the U.S.-supported government of President Boris 
Yeltsin, funneled international loans and other foreign aid through 
the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia is struggling with its transformation to an open,  
free-market nation. Several factors, including shortsighted U.S. 
policy, have contributed to this struggle,'' Bradley, a former New 
Jersey senator, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our assistance and lending policies have done very little to  
further our strategic goals, the needs of the Russian people, or 
the cause of Russian reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Further, Bradley said, the U.S. policy toward Russia policy  
since the early 1990's ``has failed to properly address such issues 
as control of nuclear weapons, environmental degradation, ethnic 
disputes, and foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who is competing with Vice President Al Gore for the  
2000 Democratic nomination, did not single out Gore for blame as 
have his Republican opponents, Steve Forbes and Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in New Hampshire, Sen. John McCain of Arizona said  
the United States should insist that the International Monetary 
Fund hold off on further loans to Russia until Moscow gets its 
house in order. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously that money has gone directly from the IMF to  
Switzerland banks and U.S. banks and has not helped the Russian 
people -- only the 'kleptocracy' and the mafia, the Republican 
presidential candidate said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, both GOP presidential hopefuls noted Gore's unique  
and hands-on role in U.S.-Russia diplomacy -- a role long and loudly 
celebrated by the vice president and his aides -- as part of their 
argument that he bears special responsibility for the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore aides have had little comment, except to emphasize that the  
vice president has a consistent record of pressing Russia to crack 
down on corruption and implement economic reforms as a condition of 
continued aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said his candidate was speaking  
from 20 years of involvement in Soviet and Russia policy, and had 
no intention of assigning special blame to Gore.

<HEADLINE> Ravens Release Webster Slaughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- The Baltimore Ravens released veteran  
wide receiver Webster Slaughter on Tuesday, getting down to the 
league-imposed 65-man roster limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Pro Bowl defensive end Michael McCrary remained  
absent from camp, frustrated with his efforts to negotiate a 
contract extension with the Ravens. McCrary, who had 14 1/2 sacks last 
season, left the Ravens before their exhibition game against 
Carolina on Saturday in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	McCrary has practiced sparingly with the Ravens since the  
beginning of training camp while recovering from offseason knee 
surgery, but he was expected to play in Friday's preseason finale 
against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to make progress as best we can, we're not going  
to comment on it anymore,'' first-year coach Brian Billick said. 
``As of right now, there's nothing to report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slaughter, who turns 35 in October, was signed in June and was  
one of a large number of receivers the Ravens took to training 
camp. Billick cited Slaughter's experience and the fact he coached 
Slaughter at San Diego State as prime reasons for signing the 
13-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Slaughter was unable to distinguish himself during  
training camp and caught just three passes for 11 yards in the 
preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very tough,'' Billick said. ``And he handled it with  
the typical class and professionalism that is Webster Slaughter. He 
was great for us while we were in camp. He was great for those 
young players. It's tough because he was a good friend, but he 
understands the nature of the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slaughter's career began in 1986 when he was drafted in the  
second round by Cleveland and played for the Browns through the 
1991 season. Slaughter also played for the Houston Oilers, Kansas 
City, the New York Jets and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	After catching at least 30 passes for over 400 yards in his  
first 11 seasons in the NFL, Slaughter did not play in 1997 and 
made just eight catches for 93 yards with the Chargers last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaughter has 563 career receptions for 8,111 yards and 44  
touchdowns.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Seeks Four Hamas Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan issued arrest warrants today for  
four top Hamas leaders, a day after police raided offices used by 
the Palestinian group in its fight against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve Jordanians working for the Iran-backed Islamic militant  
movement were arrested for questioning during the raids, a senior 
government official said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin condemned the crackdown at a news  
conference in Gaza City today, saying Jordan's action was an 
obvious move to satisfy Israel just days before Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright's visit to the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened in Jordan is part of a U.S. plan to pressure  
Hamas to join the peace process and of course we see that process 
as an attempt to liquidate the Palestinian cause,'' Yassin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Jordan's King Abdullah II to ``stop this campaign, and  
to work at deepening brotherly ties with Hamas, and the Palestinian 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamas opposes peace between the Israelis and Yasser Arafat's  
Palestinian Authority. It advocates the annihilation of Israel and 
has claimed several suicide bombings in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Islamic militant movement does not have government  
permission to work in Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with 
Israel in 1994. But the Jordanian government had long tolerated it. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the four Hamas leaders who face arrest is Khalid Mashaal,  
the head of the Hamas political bureau and its most senior official 
in Jordan, security and judicial sources said on condition of 
anonymity. Mashaal survived an assassination attempt by Israeli 
secret agents in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Mashaal and another two are believed to be abroad and the arrest  
warrants could serve to keep them out of Jordan. A fourth is 
believed to be hiding in Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	The four worked out of the offices, mostly commercial  
establishments, of Jordanian sympathizers. Those offices were 
raided and their doors sealed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's largest social and religious group, the Muslim  
Brotherhood, condemned the raids. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement, the Brotherhood said the crackdown  
``insults the feelings of Jordanians, Arabs and Muslims who 
consider Hamas to be the advance guard of the Arab nation in 
fighting the (Israeli) occupation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Mashaal, security and judicial sources said, the  
others wanted include: Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghosheh and 
political bureau members Mohammed Nazzal and Moussa Abu Marzuk, who 
was deported from the United States in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The four men are being sought for belonging to an illegal group,  
the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the United States have  
frequently urged Jordan in the past to curb the activities of 
Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
	But a senior Jordanian official said the crackdown was not in  
response to any special request by the Israelis and the 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	It could, however, have been ordered now because a final  
Israeli-Palestinian settlement appears to be turning into a 
reality. If Hamas remains a threat, the peace process could be 
hampered. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright visits the region this week in an effort to push peace  
negotiations forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jordan ... wants to live in peace and security with Israel and  
with its Arab neighbors, and therefore to take steps against Hamas 
is a very positive and clever step from the Jordanian government,'' 
Israeli Cabinet member Haim Ramon told Associated Press Television 
News today. ``Any terrorist group, and Hamas is a terrorist group, 
is a threat to peace and security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General  
Command, a dissident faction of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization based in Damascus, also condemned Jordan's action, 
saying it was a ``pre-paid present'' to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud 
Barak's government. 
</P>
<P>
	``The act is an introduction to other liquidation acts against  
anyone who fights the Zionist enemy,'' the group said in a 
statement issued in Damascus.

<HEADLINE> TV Faces Scrutiny on Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Broadcast television is facing tough scrutiny  
for its nearly all-white slate of new fall series. Here's something 
else to ponder: It's more off-color as well, according to a new 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	A Parents Television Council survey released today found network  
TV programs in the earliest hour of prime time, 8-9 p.m., contained 
significantly more foul language and references to sex than a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Violent content also has risen, according to the council, part  
of the Media Research Center, a conservative watchdog group. 
Overall, content deemed objectionable in the survey is up 75 
percent to a rate of nearly seven incidences per hour of network 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
	So much for the notion of an early evening ``family hour,'' said  
Mark Honig, executive director of the Los Angeles-based Parents 
Television Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the coming season promos are any indication, it's going to  
get even worse,'' Honig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Broadcasting Co. already is braced for (or eagerly awaiting,  
depending on one's perspective) the reaction to ``Action,'' a racy 
spoof of Hollywood with conspicuously bleeped four-letter words. 
</P>
<P>
	Honig blames the situation on the TV ratings system, implemented  
in 1997 to alert viewers to a show's content with labels like 
TV-PG. Additional notations including ``S'' for sex or ``L'' for 
crude language also may be applied. 
</P>
<P>
	``The networks push the envelope further. They're saying, 'It's  
rated, now we can do whatever we want. All bets are off,' '' Honig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a two-week May period, Fox's shows were the most sex-laden,  
followed closely by NBC's, the survey found. CBS, home of action 
series including ``JAG,'' had few steamy shows but more violence, 
compared to a February 1998 council report. 
</P>
<P>
	Language once frowned on in polite society is a TV staple,  
according to the study. ``Bitch,'' for example, was used on WB's 
``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' and on Fox's 
``That '70s Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the racy-jokes department, the study cited an episode of  
NBC's ``Mad About You'' whose story line was sustained largely by 
the persistent effects of a Viagra pill. 
</P>
<P>
	As for violence, a burning corpse was part of an episode of  
NBC's ``The Pretender,'' while ``JAG'' showed a shooting victim's 
bullet-riddled chest, the council found. 
</P>
<P>
	A CBS spokesman responded that the network makes ``every effort  
to schedule and label all of our programs in a responsible 
manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The major networks are being pounded by critics, including the  
NAACP, for the lack of ethnic characters in most new series. 
Networks have reacted by rushing to add nonwhite actors. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Parents Television Council claims to have  
gathered more than 300,000 responses to full-page ads it has run 
throughout the nation since last fall urging viewers to complain 
about offensive TV content. 
</P>
<P>
	If anything is changing in family-oriented programming, it may  
be partly because advertisers are becoming more assertive. 
</P>
<P>
	This month, the WB network announced a partnership with 11  
sponsors to create ``family-friendly'' series. Procter &AMP; Gamble, 
Johnson &AMP; Johnson and General Motors are among those providing $1 
million to develop pilots for WB's 2000-01 season. 
</P>
<P>
	While supporting family shows may earn companies points for  
social responsibility, it also makes business sense: Parents and 
kids represent the young, high-consuming viewers many sponsors are 
eager to reach. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot fund is a boost for a fledgling network like WB, said  
Jordan Levin, executive vice president for programming. He said 
that while the money must go to create family shows, sponsors are 
``not dictating creative content.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a healthy gesture on their part to give us credibility to  
go to the creative community and say, 'We're serious about this 
kind of programming' ... and we have support on Madison Avenue,'' 
Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
	WB has enjoyed success with clean-scrubbed fare like ``7th  
Heaven,'' about a minister's family, and is intent on finding more 
such shows, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There's another carrot being extended to the TV industry: the  
new Family Program Awards, which will be held Sept. 9 in Los 
Angeles to honor new shows and old ones, including ``The Cosby 
Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Family Friendly Programming Forum, representing TV  
advertisers, is launching the awards. 
</P>
<P>
	The notion of family-oriented series might strike some as a  
formula for bland, innocuous television. But one industry veteran 
disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Family-friendly programming does not have to be devoid of  
thought. It doesn't have to be syrupy, sugary or empty-headed,'' 
said William Blinn, who wrote the landmark miniseries ``Roots.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Feds Seek Way To Prepare for Storms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Margaret and Charlie Highfill faced Hurricane  
Dennis in their Carolina Beach, N.C., home with a confidence born 
of having used the lessons of one storm disaster to protect 
themselves from another. 
</P>
<P>
	Now federal recovery experts are evaluating the experience of  
the Highfills and others like them to learn how to prepare 
communities for severe storms. 
</P>
<P>
	Through its Project Impact, the Federal Emergency Management  
Agency is teaching people how to protect their lives and property 
in advance of a hurricane rather than just waiting for the storm to 
hit and then helping them rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	For the New Hanover County region of North Carolina that faced  
Dennis, damage prevention efforts got really serious after 
batterings by Hurricane Fran in 1996 and Bonnie last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think because of that, they're probably going to have  
minimal damage'' this time, said FEMA Director James Lee Witt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Highfills bought an older home on the beach in 1996 and  
seven days later Fran swamped it in four feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than simply cleaning up and fixing up, the Highfills  
elevated their home on pilings, strengthened the roof and upgraded 
the windows and siding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We spent a good bit of money,'' Charlie Highfill said in a  
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's worth it in the long run, because you don't have to  
do it again,'' his wife added. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what saved us,'' her husband said, recalling the  
arrival of Hurricane Bonnie last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had virtually no damage. The houses on either side of us  
and across the street that were still on the ground had as much 
damage'' as in Fran, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stayed in our house'' Sunday night during Hurricane  
Dennis,'' added his wife, ``it was rocking and rolling.'' But the 
home and the Highfills weathered the storm well. 
</P>
<P>
	Witt would like more people to follow their example.  
</P>
<P>
	``If each of us take our responsibilities seriously, and  
individuals, too, then we'll have fewer deaths and a lot less cost 
in the recovery part of disaster. And that's the goal, because it 
will eventually save lives, strengthen the communities and save 
jobs,'' the FEMA director said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witt recalled touring the panhandle of Florida after 1995's  
Hurricane Opal. ``You could literally see the houses that were 
built after they had adopted local building codes and standards, 
because they survived, and the houses that were built before did 
not survive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Debbie Reed, the Project Impact coordinator for the area where  
the Highfills live, said the effort is paying off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people in the community have taken mitigation measures,  
including elevation of their homes to take them out of harm's way 
from storm surge damage,'' she said. Some 80 to 90 homes are 
elevated at Wrightsville Beach, and there are 50 more at Carolina 
and Kure beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Using corporate partners, Project Impact has organized storm  
shelters and weather stations, improved the emergency 
communications system, rewired sewer pump stations to use 
generators in emergencies, moved the police and fire station off 
the flood area and made other changes. As a result, residents of 
Carolina Beach began receiving a 15 percent discount on flood 
insurance in April. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just hurricane-prone regions that can benefit. Project  
Impact is working in more than 120 communities across the nation, 
including Tulsa, Okla., where major efforts have gone into 
protecting from floods. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes it isn't even worthwhile to build better or stronger,  
Witt acknowledged. Instead it's best to admit that nature has won 
and move. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1993, FEMA has worked with state and local governments to  
buy out more than 25,000 pieces of property nationwide because of 
repeated flooding. One community in Missouri had been flooded 31 
times when FEMA arranged to buy out and move the town's 18 
businesses and 142 residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every dollar we've done this for we've saved $2 in future  
losses. But we've saved more than that. We've saved the pain and 
the anguish and the grief that people have gone through so many 
times,'' Witt said.

<HEADLINE> ZCMI Managers Say Sale Not Certain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The company that calls itself America's  
first department store may be on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Though managers at ZCMI insist there are no offers on the table,  
they would not deny the possibility of a sale in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just say that ZCMI's looking at every possible  
alternative to taking the company forward,'' Executive Vice 
President and CFO Keith Saunders said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Any decision on a sale would fall to the Mormon church, which  
has 51 percent ownership in ZCMI, a chain of stores founded in 1868 
as Zion's Cooperative Mercantile Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Bills, a spokesman for The Church of Jesus Christ of  
Latter-day Saints, said church leaders were referring all questions 
about a possible sale to ZCMI's management. 
</P>
<P>
	And ZCMI President, Chairman and CEO Richard Madsen said his  
only response to reports of a possible sale was, ``Well, we had a 
poor year in 1998.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the company lost $8.46 million last year, and the board  
of directors voted not to pay a dividend for the fourth quarter. An 
annual report released in April placed 1998 sales at $247.5 
million, $10 million below the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company embarked on a cost-cutting plan, which called for  
limiting some specialty departments like wedding shops and credit 
offices to the flagship store in downtown Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had some success at boosting sales by returning to  
store floors some administrative staffers who had been promoted 
because of good sales records. ZCMI did not begin layoffs, but new 
hires slowed and an early retirement option was offered. 
</P>
<P>
	But that may not be enough to keep ZCMI afloat as consumers  
increasingly turn to catalogues, the Internet, specialty stores, 
factory outlets and big retail chains. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very, very competitive business and we feel that we are  
a survivor'' in the face of increasing consolidation countrywide, 
Madsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the same time, Saunders said, a sale is not out of the  
question, even though ``firming up our lending agreement and going 
forward'' is still an option. 
</P>
<P>
	ZCMI, which is an over-the-counter security, has approximately  
4,000 employees at 12 stores in Utah, one in Pocatello, Idaho and 
one in Idaho Falls, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	The store was formed 131 years ago at the suggestion of Mormon  
church president Brigham Young, who urged Utah residents to form a 
community-owned merchandizing organization.

<HEADLINE> Indians 14, Angels 12  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Richie Sexson drove in five runs, including a  
two-run single and a three-run homer in a 10-run eighth inning, to 
give the Cleveland Indians a 14-12 victory over Anaheim Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sexson's 25th homer finished off the scoring and came on a 1-2  
pitch by Troy Percival (3-4) as the team lost its seventh straight 
and blew its sixth consecutive save opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Percival hit the next batter, David Justice, in the side with a  
pitch, triggering a bench-clearing brawl. Justice threw his helmet 
at Percival as he charged the mound. Percival, Justice and Anaheim 
manager Terry Collins were ejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Sexson's two-run single off Mark Petkovsek started Cleveland's  
rally from a 12-4 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Enrique Wilson's RBI single made it 12-7 and kept the bases  
loaded with none out. 
</P>
<P>
	Two outs later, Roberto Alomar lined a two-run single to make it  
12-9. Pinch-hitter Harold Baines then slapped a two-run single to 
left to make it 12-11. Percival then walked Jim Thome, setting the 
stage for Sexson. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Poole (1-0), recalled from the minors earlier in the day,  
got the win. Paul Shuey pitched the ninth for his fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third time this season that the Indians overcame an  
eight-run deficit. The Indians defeated Tampa Bay May 8 after twice 
trailing by eight runs and overcame an 8-0 deficit July 3 against 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	In a bizarre twist following the brawl, shortstop Omar Vizquel  
played right field in the ninth for Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Troy Glaus hit two home runs for Anaheim, which lost its seventh  
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Angels starter Chuck Finley, the subject of trade talks with  
Cleveland before the July 31 trading deadline, gave up four runs -- 
one earned -- on 10 hits over seven innings. He walked one and 
struck out six. 
</P>
<P>
	Manny Ramirez singled in two runs to give Cleveland a 3-1 lead  
in the third inning. That gave Ramirez 135 RBIs, most in the 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaus lined his 23rd homer, a two-run shot, to tie it at 3 in  
the fourth off Dwight Gooden. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden, who was activated from the disabled list prior to the  
game, allowed three runs and five hits in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Garret Anderson gave Anaheim a 1-0 lead with an RBI single in  
the first. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Thome tied it with a solo homer in the second.  
</P>
<P>
	Tim Salmon hit a two-run homer, his 11th, in the seventh.  
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Cleveland catcher Sandy Alomar, on the disabled list since  
May 11, caught a simulated game with a brace on his sore left knee 
in the afternoon and reported no pain. ... Cleveland acquired 
catcher Tyler Houston from the Chicago Cubs for minor league 
pitcher Richard Negrette and purchased pitchers Jim Poole from 
Double AA Akron and Sean DePaula from Triple AAA Buffalo. DePaula 
made his major league debut in the eighth. ... Cleveland has used 
50 players this season, three off the 1991 team record. ... Anaheim 
released outfielder Reggie Williams. ... It was Glaus' second 
two-homer game of the season.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Call Up Eduardo Perez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals called up Eduardo Perez  
on Tuesday night, just in time for his father to perhaps see him 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Perez is the assistant general manager of the Florida  
Marlins, who conclude a three-game series Wednesday night in St. 
Louis. Eduardo Perez, a first baseman like his father, batted .322 
for Triple-A Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to see him,'' Tony Perez said. ``He went down,  
worked hard and had a good year. The Cardinals are very excited 
about what he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis also recalled catcher Marcus Jensen and right-hander  
Mark Thompson from Memphis. General manager Walt Jocketty said 
there will be several more callups after Memphis' season ends Sept. 
6. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, 29, led Memphis with 18 home runs and 82 RBIs in 118  
games, and was second on the team with 31 doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Jensen, 26, batted .291 with eight homers and 44 RBIs in 72  
games. He also played for the U.S. team in the Pan American Games 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 28, was 2-6 with a 5.13 ERA in 11 games for the  
Cincinnati Reds' Triple-A affiliate in Indianapolis before being 
released. He appeared in nine games with Memphis, eight of them 
starts, and was 4-2 with a 2.94 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson has a 16-20 career major league record with a 6.12 ERA  
with the Colorado Rockies from 1994-98.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Drug Chief Eyes Collaborators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Continuing cross-border drug flows are more  
the product of corrupt foreign companies and individuals than 
governments, says retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the White House 
counter-narcotics chief. 
</P>
<P>
	And McCaffrey said Monday he favors Senate-approved legislation  
to impose sanctions against offending companies and individuals who 
collaborate with drug kingpins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time for the United States to stop talking about  
our problems with the government of Mexico, Peru, et cetera, and 
start talking about our problems with individuals and businesses 
who are involved in drug-related crime and hold those people 
responsible for their actions,'' said McCaffrey, who recently 
visited Brazil, Bolivia, Peru and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	When Congress returns from its summer recess next month, a  
House-Senate conference committee will work out the final shape of 
the legislation, which would authorize the president to take a 
series of measures against foreign companies or individuals linked 
to the drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions include barring U.S. citizens from doing business  
with such companies or individuals and freezing their U.S. assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the bill's co-sponsors are Sens. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.,  
chairman of the Foreign Relations subcommittee on Western 
Hemisphere affairs, Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Mike DeWine, 
R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation expands a 4-year-old presidential order aimed at  
Colombian drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill has generated concern in Mexico that innocent people  
could be misidentified as collaborators with drug chieftains. 
McCaffrey acknowledged this was a concern and said safeguards must 
be written into the law to prevent such abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his reservations, McCaffrey said he finds the proposal  
to be ``enormously compelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the legislation, the Treasury Department would develop a  
list foreign traffickers active in any of the 28 countries listed 
as major drug source or drug transit countries. The sanctions would 
carry penalties of up to $500,000 per violation for corporations or 
$250,000 for individuals, as well as 10 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Warrant Issued for Sports Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A judge has signed an arrest warrant  
for sports agent Sean Alfortish, who is accused of funneling money 
to former University of Florida players. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief assistant state attorney Bill Cervone said the  
Louisiana-based agent has agreed to turn himself in to authorities 
in Gainesville within the next two weeks. Alfortish will be charged 
with violating Florida's agent law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Times-Union cited sources Tuesday as saying the  
state attorney had proof that Alfortish bought former Florida 
player Tim Beauchamp wheel rims valued at $1,500. The sources also 
said Alfortish is accused of paying Beauchamp and former player 
Dock Pollard up to $500 per month. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfortish's attorney, Rick Stanley, released a statement saying  
his client is innocent. Alfortish is the first agent charged in the 
10-month investigation by University Police. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officials said the investigation involving agent Tank  
Black is ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Illegal agent activity is punishable in the state of Florida by  
a maximum of five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Coach Unaware of Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- In his first interview about the traffic stop that  
led to his brush with the law, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones 
said Tuesday he had no idea police were pursuing him after he left 
the scene of a traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The series of events began Sunday when Jones drove away as a  
Highland Park police officer was writing a traffic ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had considered charging Jones with fleeing the scene of a  
traffic stop but decided on a charge of interference with public 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Both charges are Class B misdemeanors, carrying a maximum  
penalty of a $2,000 fine and 180 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview on KLIF Radio in Dallas, Jones said he saw no  
police car behind his car after he and his family left his security 
detail to deal with the traffic ticket and headed to his grandson's 
baptism. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the first inkling of trouble was when a police officer  
pulled up behind him at a church in neighboring University Park and 
ordered him back into his car. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mental picture of me driving through Highland Park with an  
officer behind me with lights on is not correct. As a matter of 
fact, there was nobody behind me from the initial stop (in Highland 
Park) to the church. I got out, my family got out. Then a police 
car drove up,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys owner said the police officer, who was different  
from the one who was writing the ticket, told him to get back in 
his car. Jones said he drove around a nearby corner to get out from 
in front of the church. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when he proceeded to tell me that we had an obvious  
disagreement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said his security men were driving the two family vehicles  
when the speeding stop was made, and that he believed they were 
capable of providing the police with all the information the 
ticketing officer needed without his help. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, he repeated his regret for the incident, in which  
he's been charged with misdemeanor interference with public duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Highland Park Director of Public Safety Darrell Fant has said  
Jones was clearly agitated in his encounter with the officer, 
saying he had an emergency and asking to speak with a supervisor. 
However, Jones said all involved were courteous -- including 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said a police video of the incident won't be made  
public until the case is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has been assigned to Dallas County judge Ralph Taite, a  
police spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Soybean, Grain Futures Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Soybean futures surged Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade  
amid concerns the coming crop may be smaller than expected despite 
badly needed late-summer rains. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, copper futures enjoyed their biggest  
single-day gain since July and cocoa futures advanced sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in soybeans came on the heels of a U.S. government  
report which showed a sixth straight weekly decline in the crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 47 percent of all U.S. soybeans were in good to excellent  
condition, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture report 
issued late Monday -- a decline of one percentage point from a week 
ago and well under the 65 percent rating of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned that crop yields will fall this year, investors sent  
soybean futures to their highest closing price in nearly three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just continued to gradually deteriorate in our crop  
despite the rain,'' said Don Roose, president of Iowa-based U.S. 
Commodities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasts of dry weather this week for the heart of the Midwest,  
along with a weaker U.S. dollar, also buoyed the gains. As the 
dollar declines against other major currencies, U.S. crops are less 
costly in foreign markets, making it easier to increase exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures also rose after the weekly report showed a slight  
decline in its crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn for December delivery rose 2 1/2 cents to $2.19 1/4 a bushel;  
November soybeans rose 12 1/2 cents to $4.83 cents a bushel; wheat for 
December delivery rose 5 1/4 cents to $2.82 1/4 a bushel; December oats 
rose 2 cents to $1.16 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures jumped after a three-month rally had stalled  
recently. Analysts said announcements by Germany and France that 
their economies will grow faster in 2000 would boost copper sales 
in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	After sinking to a 12-year low in May, copper prices have  
rebounded 27 percent amid a string of mine closures in North 
America and buoyed by stronger demand in Asia and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's rise was the highest since July 30 and followed a  
price dip last week over news that the Highland Valley mine in 
British Columbia was poised to reopen. Some investors feared that 
its annual production of 170,000 tons would have an adverse affect 
on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper is used in wiring and plumbing.  
</P>
<P>
	High-grade copper for December delivery rose 3.10 cents to 79.20  
cents per pound on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Technical reasons appeared behind the advance in cocoa prices.  
</P>
<P>
	September cocoa rose 24 cents to $9.13 a ton on the on the  
Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange division of the New York Board of 
Trade.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopeful About North Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --The Clinton administration hopes a new round of  
talks with North Korea next week will help ease Cold War tensions 
on the divided peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James Foley said Tuesday that recent  
statements by the Pyongyang government show a willingness to 
improve relations with the United States and other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the public statements by the North Koreans have given  
us hope that North Korea is taking seriously the path to better 
relations with the U.S. and the international community,'' Foley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. envoy Charles Kartman and North Korea's Vice Foreign  
Minister Kim Gye Gwan will meet in Berlin Sept. 7-11. Washington's 
top priority in the talks is to persuade the North Koreans to forgo 
testing a long-range missile, which threatens stability in 
Northeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently bowing to threats of economic and diplomatic  
penalties by the United States, Japan and South Korea, North Korea 
said last week it was willing to resolve the missile dispute 
through negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley said that in the Berlin talks Kartman will stress ``the  
advantages to North Korea of taking steps to improve relations,'' 
including the United States lifting economic sanctions against the 
isolated communist country. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, said Monday after a four-day visit to  
North Korea that the Pyongyang government ``wants to not only 
negotiate, it (also) wants us to continue food aid and lift 
sanctions. If we do that, they will respond in a favorable way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall was speaking in Seoul, South Korea. Foley said  
administration officials plan to discuss his talks with the North 
Koreans when Hall returns to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Western military analysts believe the North is poised to test an  
advanced version of a long-range missile it fired over Japan a year 
ago. The United States, Japan and South Korea have warned that 
another launch could trigger economic penalties against North 
Korea.

	FBI Wants Independent Waco Probe  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- FBI Director Louis Freeh is pushing for an  
independent investigator to head the probe into why it took his 
agency six years to acknowledge using incendiary tear gas canisters 
in the waning hours of the Branch Davidian siege. Amid concern over 
the appearance of the FBI and Justice Department investigating 
themselves, Freeh has told Attorney General Janet Reno she should 
appoint an outsider to head the inquiry, an FBI official confirmed 
today.

	Record Bush Funds Are Expected  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush's GOP presidential  
campaign expects to report within a month that it has raised over 
$50 million so far. That would be a record pre-nomination total. It 
might even surpass $60 million, a Bush adviser said today. ``I know 
there are some who are talking about my capacity to raise money, 
particularly some of my opponents,'' Bush said while campaigning in 
Omaha, Neb. ``I would suggest that if you ask them, they would like 
to trade places.''

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met in a  
secret location Tuesday to try to resolve disagreements blocking 
the way to peace in the region. Israeli envoy Gilead Sher and 
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat have already made some progress 
on deadlines for an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the West 
Bank. Both have expressed optimism that a deal may be set before 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrives in the region 
Thursday.

	Hurricane Drifts Off N. Carolina  
</P>
<P>
	NAGS HEAD, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis weakened and slowed to a  
near halt today just off the coast, leaving relatively sparse 
property damage along the North Carolina seaboard. A hurricane 
warning for the North Carolina coast was downgraded to a tropical 
storm warning. But Dennis could linger without moving much through 
Saturday, said Rod Gonski, forecaster at the National Weather 
Service in Raleigh. Because of the uncertainty, people have started 
calling oceanfront hotels in southeastern Virginia to cancel 
reservations for Labor Day weekend.

	Wildfires Burn Parts of West  
</P>
<P>
	APPLE VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- Firefighters today struggled to  
contain active forest and brush fires that have burned 150,000 
acres in the West. The largest uncontrolled blazes were being 
fought in Idaho, Montana, Utah and California. Fires were contained 
in Nevada and Washington. The biggest concentration of firefighters 
worked to tame a 50,000-acre blaze that has destroyed 12 homes 
since Sunday about 80 miles east of Los Angeles, near the resort 
town of Lake Arrowhead.

	IZMIT, Turkey (AP) -- Survivors of Turkey's powerful earthquake  
on Aug. 17 were rattled again today when a strong tremor struck the 
northwest part of the country, killing one man, injuring at least 
166 other people and knocking down quake-weakened buildings. 
Today's 5.2-magnitude shock came just two weeks after the 
devastating earthquake that killed more than 14,200 people.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- A powerful explosion rocked a crowded shopping  
mall near the Kremlin today, injuring at least 30 people, police 
said. Police said a video game machine apparently exploded in the 
Manesh underground mall. A Moscow police spokesman said it was 
unclear whether the evening blast was a bomb or an accident.

	Child Car Seat Rules Set  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Child car seats take on a new look starting  
tomorrow, when stricter head protection standards take effect. That 
means most seats will come equipped with a tether strap that 
anchors the top of the seat more securely so children move less in 
a crash. There are hundreds of thousands of child seats already in 
use, and parents should not abandon them. Seat manufacturers and 
automakers are offering kits to add the tethers and new attachment 
points.

companies. The Dow industrials fell 84.85 to close at 10,829.28. On 
the NYSE, losers led gainers 1,671-1,316. The Nasdaq rose 25.13 to 
2,737.82 as technology stocks benefited from a wave of new deals

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pete Sampras, the world's No. 1 tennis player,  
withdrew from the U.S. Open before his first match today because of 
a back injury. The four-time champion has a small herniated disc. 
He apparently reinjured himself during practice Sunday. ``We caught 
it early and he should recover fully,'' said Dr. Brian Hainline, 
U.S. Open medical director.

<HEADLINE> Ciccarelli To Announce Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARNIA, Ontario (AP) -- Right wing Dino Ciccarelli is apparently  
hanging up his skates after 19 NHL seasons, according to a 
published report. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old will announce the end of his playing career  
Wednesday, he told his hometown newspaper, the Sarnia Observer. 
</P>
<P>
	Troubled by a back injury last season, Ciccarelli had six goals  
and one assist in only 14 games for the Florida Panthers, who 
bought out the final year of his contract in July to make him an 
unrestricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always heard people say you will know when it's time to  
call it quits. I know for sure it's time for me to go,'' he said 
from his home in Yale, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciccarelli is ninth on NHL's career goal-scoring list with 608  
goals -- two behind Bobby Hull and Vancouver's Mark Messier. He also 
had 592 assists in 1,232 NHL games, good for 28th place on the 
career scoring list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm retiring because of my back injury,'' he said. ``I tried  
skating a bit last week and the same soreness and stiffness was 
there. There's no use kidding myself anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The feisty 5-foot-10 Ciccarelli broke into the NHL with the  
Minnesota North Stars in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	He also played in Washington, Detroit, and Tampa Bay before  
being traded to Florida last year.

<HEADLINE> Former GM Supervisors Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- Three former General Motors supervisors were  
charged with scheming to get more than $2 million in kickbacks and 
gifts from companies that did business with the automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the suspects, who no longer work for GM, told  
suppliers to raise prices on goods and services and submit fake 
bills. The suppliers were then paid by GM and kick backed a payment 
to the three suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	The vendors also gave the supervisors gifts such as trips to Las  
Vegas, motorcycles and a tanning salon membership to keep GM 
business, investigators told The Flint Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Arthur A. Busch said Tuesday that the charges against  
the men include commercial bribery, racketeering, embezzlement, 
unauthorized use of a transaction device and extortion. They worked 
at two GM plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The activities uncovered by the prosecutor's office are  
``clearly against our company policies and they (the suppliers) 
risk losing business with General Motors,'' said Pete Ternes, a 
spokesman for GM's Metal Fabricating Division.

<HEADLINE> China Airlines Reducing Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- China Airlines is cutting 68 flights in  
September, mostly on its lucrative Hong Kong-Taipei route, as part 
of a temporary reorganization following a deadly crash in Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwanese airline has come under pressure from Taiwan's  
Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) to tighten up on safety and 
cancel some flights since one of its McDonnell Douglas MD-11 jets 
flipped and burst into flames Aug. 22 while landing in a tropical 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were killed and over 200 were injured in the crash  
of Flight CI642 from Bangkok, Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of the plane and increased safety checks on other  
aircraft have reduced the number of passengers China Airlines can 
carry, airline spokesman Steve Chen said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Because September marks the beginning of the slower travel  
season, financial losses from the cancellations will not be too 
heavy, Chen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Canceled flights include one daily Taipei-Hong Kong round trip,  
or 60 total flights for the month, he said. Two round-trip flights 
between Taipei and San Francisco and two between Taipei and Los 
Angeles also will be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	All will resume in October, the airline said.  
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the Hong Kong accident remains under investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	The crash was the third major disaster to strike China Airlines  
in less than a decade, reigniting a debate over safety standards at 
the Taiwanese state-controlled airline.

<HEADLINE> Teen Accused of Killing Relatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- A 14-year-old girl recently released  
from a mental hospital and a friend were charged with killing two 
of her relatives and wounding two others in a shooting and stabbing 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence came Sunday night after Ashley Jones was grounded  
by her grandfather for staying out too late, The Birmingham News 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the two teens killed Miss Jones' grandfather and  
aunt and seriously wounded her grandmother and 10-year-old sister, 
who was stabbed more than a dozen times. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Jones and 16-year-old Geramie Hart were charged Monday with  
two counts of capital murder and two counts of attempted murder. 
She was being held at a juvenile detention center and Hart was in 
the county jail without bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were found at the single-family home of Miss Jones'  
grandfather, Deroy Nalls, 78. Officers said the suspects tried to 
burn the house down after the attacks. A fire was burning when 
authorities arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends said the Nalls tried to help Miss Jones after she was  
released from a mental hospital. The Birmingham News reported that 
she had been accused of stabbing her parents when her mother was 
eight months pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl's parents recovered from their injuries, Dorothy Hale,  
a friend of the Nalls, said Tuesday. It wasn't clear if Miss Jones' 
hospitalization had stemmed from the reported attack on her 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney David Barber said he could not discuss the  
girl's past because she is a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants under age of 16 are not eligible for the death  
penalty. But Hart, who is charged as an adult, would be eligible 
for the death penalty if convicted. Barber said he had not decided 
whether to seek it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. F.D. Scott, pastor to some of the girl's relatives,  
said she was ``a little problem child all her life'' and recently 
was released from a psychiatric hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``She obviously didn't stay long enough,'' he said.
