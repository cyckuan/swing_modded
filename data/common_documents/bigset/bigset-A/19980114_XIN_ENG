<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Calls For Greater Electronic-Information Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng told a
national conference on the electronics industry in Guangdong
Province's Zhaoqing city that China should give priority to
developing its electronic-information industry.
</P>
<P>
The industry has played a very important role in the country's
socialist modernization drive, he said, calling on people in the
industry to hold the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory high, to
increase reforms, open up wider, speed up the restructuring, and
increase the ability to develop new products.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu Qili, minister of electronics industry, China's
electronic-information industry had rapid growth in 1997, with 250
billion yuan in sales.
</P>
<P>
The industry had a 13 percent growth in profits, exports, and
added value goods in 1997, and PCs, programmable exchanges, and
color television sets were produced in large quantity in keeping
with market needs.
</P>
<P>
State-owned electronics companies increased restructuring
efforts through mergers and re-organization, and the industry
structure was improved somewhat last year.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that, in 1998, the industry will grow at about 20
percent to provide a sound foundation for development in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
This year, it will focus on developing digital and network
products, he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Considers Partial Lifting of Ban on British Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission is
deliberating on whether or not to recommend lifting the worldwide
ban on British beef. Discussion on the issue commenced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ban was imposed 21 months ago and may be lifted on meat
from "certified" herds in Northern Ireland, where computerized
records have been kept.
</P>
<P>
England, Wales and Scotland must wait until a computer tracking
system is in force and working to European Union (EU)'s
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said there were also signs of progress on
a British plan to allow the ban to be lifted for meat from cattle
born after August 1996.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture commissioner Franz Fischler was expected at
Tuesday's commission meeting to table a plan, under which the
commission would propose that beef from cattle between six and 30
months old could be exported so long as they were from herds free
of mad cow disease for at least eight years.
</P>
<P>
If approved, Fischler's plan will be put to veterinary experts
appointed by each of the 15 EU member states for approval. If the
EU veterinary experts agree by a qualified majority, or 70
percent, the ban could be eased immediately without being put
before the agricultural ministers of the 15 EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Without a qualified majority, the plan will have to be referred
to the next meeting of the council of agricultural ministers who
need only a simple majority of the 15 to approve it.
</P>
<P>
More than 132,000 farmers in Britain have been asked to fill in
forms recording their cattle by January 26 to ensure that the
database contains accurate information.
</P>
<P>
All the forms have to be checked before the tracking system can
be activated.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Most South Koreans believe the
solution to the country's current economic crisis is
President-elect Kim Dae-jung's main task and believe he will
succeed in handling the problem.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the President-elect's power takeover team
last week showed a consensus among 1,019 citizens over 20 years of
age.
</P>
<P>
The results of the survey, released Tuesday, show that some
92.4 percent of the respondents described tackling the current
economic crisis as Kim's priority task, while 29.2 percent chose
fighting widespread corruption and 19.4 percent opted for
uprooting regional antagonism.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of the respondents said Kim is dealing
properly with the economic problems, while less than 12 percent
said he is mishandling the situation.
</P>
<P>
Some 88 percent said they believe the President-elect will
handle the economic crisis well, and 3.7 percent doubted his
capability.
</P>
<P>
On Kim's pledge to honor the IMF bailout conditions, 65 percent
of respondents said it is an inevitable choice.
</P>
<P>
Kim, 72, who won the 15th presidential elections in December
1997, will be sworn in as the president of the Republic of
Korea. He has come into the center of South Korea's politics
against a backdrop of the nation's worst economic crisis in
decades.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Strategic Reserve Grain Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The state-controlled Grain
Marketing Board of Zimbabwe today said the low deliveries of
maize to the board was a cause for concern as this affected the
strategic grain reserve stocks, standing at 541,883 tons.
</P>
<P>
The board said it received only 248,000 tons of maize in 1997
out of the expected 600,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The amount of strategic reserves would be reduced if export
commitments were met this year.
</P>
<P>
Export commitments had to be revised from 300,000 tons to
260,000 tons amid suggestions from some sectors that Zimbabwe
should not export before local requirements were met.
</P>
<P>
''The situation is a bit difficult because people were very
careful not to sell all their grain to the Grain Marketing Board
so they hung on to their maize but no one knows for sure how much
each family will suffer if rains are not good this year,'' a
government official said.
</P>
<P>
The national Grain Loan Committee is expected to meet this
week to assess the amount of food assistance required countrywide
this year following widespread reports of people needing food
aid.
</P>
<P>
The committee will also determine whether it would be
necessary to declare a national disaster warranting emergency
operations in the provision of food aid.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is one of many southern African countries facing the
threat of an El-Nino-induced drought which might endanger the
1997/98 crop.
</P>
<P>
However, above-average rains have been received since the
beginning of January and this has rekindled the hope of most
farmers that the early planted crop might recover.

<HEADLINE> China Sets New Oil, Gas Production Goals For 1998 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China plans to produce 143
million tons of crude oil and 16.5 billion cu m of natural gas
from land wells this year and verify 600 million tons of oil
reserves and 50 billion cu m of gas.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yongkang, president of of the China National Petroleum
Corp (CNPC), told a national meeting that steps will be taken to
stabilize oil production in the East and to explore the West,
placing equal emphasis on oil and gas production.
</P>
<P>
Exploration will be given top priority this year to increase
oil reserves and oil output. Existing oilfields in the eastern
part of China will try to maintain their present production
level, and the western areas will work even harder to increase oil
and gas production.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said the Daqing Oilfield will expand its oil production
scale, speed up oil exploration in new areas and ensure an output
of 56 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The Shengli Oilfield in Shangdong Province will increase
exploration this year and try to slow decreases in production to
maintain an annual oil output of 28 million tons.

The Liaohe Oilfield in northeastern China will work hard to
hold output at 15 million tons, and the Jilin Oilfield will
enlarge production capacity and plans to produce 3.8 million tons
of crude oil this year. The Huabei, Dagang, Zhongyuan, and Jidong
oilfields will try to find new oil reserves and make sure that oil
production will be stable or grow.
</P>
<P>
High hopes are being placed on exploration and development in
western areas and these are expected to become important oil
production bases for future oil production.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang and Changqing oilfields in western China will
increase oil exploration and reserves this year, and will produce
8.7 million tons and 3.2 million tons of oil, respectively. The
Tarim Oilfield is expected to produce 4.4 million tons of oil, a
1.3-million-ton increase from 1997. The Turpan-Hami Oilfield is
likely to find new oil reserves and will produce three million
tons of oil this year, according to Zhou.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas exploration and development will focus on Sichuan,
Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces, and the Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang
Uygur autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
This year will see rapid development of gasfields in northern
Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces, with a production capacity of 1.5
billion cu m and 2 billion cu m, respectively.

<HEADLINE> French Government to Hold on to Policy in 1998: Jospin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin said on Tuesday that the government will hold on to its
fixed socio-economic policy in 1998 despite mounting pressure from
the unemployed and emerging differences within his left-wing
coalition.
</P>
<P>
"Change this policy which has been approved by Parliament
or disrupt the economic and budgetary balances, because a number
of social services were occupied (by protesters), it would be to
condemn all hope of success and thus the creation of jobs," said
Jospin.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who answered questions at a meeting with
the press, referred to protests being staged by anti-unemployment
militants who demand the government raise minimum social welfare
aid and tackle the 12.4 percent unemployment rate with more
radical measures.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist government has rejected the demand, saying that
it would cost tens of billions of francs and would overwhelm the
budget designed for cutting public deficits and joining the
European single currency.
</P>
<P>
Jospin argued that all the policies on European integration,
reducing work week to 35 hours, seeking economic growth with all
means, emphasizing social protection, and creating jobs for the
youths with government fund are aimed at cutting unemployment.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Congress Ratifies 1998 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Congress has
finally ratified the country's 1998 budget of 540.8 billion pesos
(12.6 billion U.S. dollars), which will be soon signed into law by
President Fidel Ramos, the Philippine Presidential Press Office
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 budget was approved by both the Senate and the House
of Representatives late Monday night, the press office said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Lower House Speaker Jose de Venecia hailed the budget as a
"landmark measure" designed to meet the current challenges of a
regional currency crisis, globalization and the El Nino weather
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The approved budget gave priority to the education sector,
which was given 80.8 billion pesos (1.8 billion dollars), followed
by the Department of National Defense with 50.9 billion pesos (1.2
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Other priority sectors are the Department of Public Works and
Highways with 47.1 billion pesos (1.1 billion dollars) and the
Department of Interior and Local Government with 30 billion pesos
(700 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
An early congressional passage of the budget as called for by
Ramos will help the government cope with the lingering currency
crisis, economists said.

<HEADLINE> US Records Small Inflation Growth in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States recorded
consumer price increase for all of 1997 to just 1.7 percent, the
best performance in 11 years, the Labor Department reported here
today.
</P>
<P>
Prices moved a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent higher in
December, the same as in November, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The annual rate fell to slightly more than half the 3.3 percent
increase of 1996, thanks to the sharpest decline in energy costs
in six years and the smallest growth in food costs in five years.
</P>
<P>
Inflation hasn't been smaller since 1986, when a plunge in oil
prices held the rise in the overall Consumer Price Index to 1.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
A key price decline, prices excluding the volatile food and
energy sectors, also underwent improvement in 1997. These
so-called core prices rose 2.2 percent, down from 2.6 percent in
1996 and the lowest since 1965.
</P>
<P>
In December, energy prices fell 1.6 percent. For the year,
they were down 3.4 percent as against an 8.6 percent increase the
year before. The decline last year was the largest since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline cost 6.1 percent less than a year ago. Fuel oil fell
11.7 percent for the year and electricity 1.3 percent. But,
natural gas costs rose 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Food fell 0.1 percent in December and rose 1.5 percent for the
year, the smallest increase since 1992, after rising 4.3 percent
in 1996. Poultry cost 1.6 percent less than a year ago; pork, 1.5
percent; beef and veal, 0.7 percent; dairy products, 0.5 percent;
and fresh fruit, 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, coffee shot up 16.9 percent over the year and fresh
vegetables cost 13.2 percent more.
</P>
<P>
Prices excluding food and energy rose 0.2 percent in December.
For the year, their increase was restrained by a 0.9 percent drop
in new vehicle prices, a 3.1 percent decrease in auto finance
charges due to lower interest rates and a 1.4 percent decrease in
airline fares. The drop in vehicle prices was unmatched since
1971.
</P>
<P>
The cost of medical care rose 2.8 percent. While somewhat
higher than the overall inflation rate, that's the smallest
increase since 1965. The inflation rate for medical costs has
become smaller each year since registering a 9.6 percent increase
in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Harare Residents Protest Against Price Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Harare's Mabvuku
residents today staged an incident-free protest against the
recent price hikes on almost all basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
Basic commodities, including mealie-meal, cooking oil and
bread were last week hiked by an average of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators called on President Robert Mugabe to
intervene and reintroduce subsidies on essential goods.
</P>
<P>
Producers attributed the price hike to the 17.5 percent rise
in sales tax from the 15 percent toward the end of last year and
the devaluation of the Zimbabwean Dollar which has constantly
lost to major currencies over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators said they expected the rest of the country
to join and trigger a national consumer boycott.
</P>
<P>
"We are appealing to President Mugabe to intervene and save us
from continued suffering. We are the ones who put that
government in power and hence it should be seen to protect our
interests," a resident said.
</P>
<P>
"What hurts us most is that these hikes are unnecessary as
most of the raw materials used in the production of these things
are found locally in Zimbabwe. This is too much and we are saying
we can not take this any longer," the resident said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information, Posts and Telecommunications Chen
Chimutengwende last week said the government was aware that some
whites were bitter about the land redistribution exercise and
were trying to use every possible means to discredit the
government.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the government could soon impose price controls
on basic commodities to curb the price hikes.

<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Severe storms in Europe and huge
discounting among rival high-street retailers have been blamed
for the slow start to post-Christmas travel bookings in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Up to December 31, the market was around 2 percent down on the
same period in 1996 but it is likely to have slipped further
behind following poor sales recently, a conference was told here
today.

Going Places managing director Peter Shanks said at the EMU For
The Travel Industry conference that sales were disappointing and
the retailer was reviewing its discount levels.
</P>
<P>
The Multiple is featuring the lowest headline discounts at 15
percent, while Lunn Poly and Thomas Cook are offering up to 25
percent off. Core discounts are 10 percent. Carlson Worldchoice is
combining a 10 percent discount with free insurance.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the conference said Airtours has suffered the most
with sales down more than 30 percent. Thomson blamed the bad
weather after reporting sales down slightly.
</P>
<P>
Sunworld, Flying Colours and First Choice are believed to be up
30 percent, 29 percent and 19 percent respectively, they added.

<HEADLINE> UK Financial Services Firms Expect Slower Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Financial services companies
have become pessimistic about the outlook for business for the
first time in two years, according to a confidence survey.
</P>
<P>
Of 230 companies surveyed by the Confederation of British
Industry's quarterly survey, 25 percent said they were less
optimistic about the overall business situation in their sector
than they were three months earlier. Some 16 percent were more
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
The negative balance of 9 percent compared with a zero balance
three months ago and a positive balance of 61 percent a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Banking was among the gloomiest sectors, reflecting a belief
that banks' business could not continue to grow and that the
industry's current health was too good to continue.
</P>
<P>
But building societies and life assurance companies were much
more confident, with many expecting to increase employment over
the next three months.
</P>
<P>
Increased business at building societies, securities traders
and insurance brokers helped offset a fall reported by finance
houses and general insurers.
</P>
<P>
Sudhir Junankar, CBI associate director of economic analysis,
said, "Expectations are the least positive since mid-1995,
suggesting that financial services companies are set to see a
fairly subdued pace of expansion compared with the buoyant
conditions enjoyed over the previous year."

<HEADLINE> Canada Backs Down on Salmon Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada is prepared to weaken its
position on Pacific salmon quotas and is willing to resume talks
with the United States, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
The country will also work with the U.S. to establish
short-term peace in the North Pacific by setting interim fishing
quotas until a permanent agreement can be reached.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Fisheries Minister David Anderson made the
conciliatory remarks following the release of a report by two
special envoys Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report called on the two countries to adopt two-year
arrangements for commercial salmon fishing and to negotiate the
issue government to government.
</P>
<P>
Canada would begin immediate and direct talks with the U.S. to
resolve the salmon dispute, said Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd
Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
"Political will is necessary on both sides to ensure we achieve
the goals of conservation and equity enshrined in the treaty,"
Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the two countries have failed to achieve any progress
on the salmon issues after years of talks when the 1985 Pacific
salmon treaty expired.
</P>
<P>
Canada alleged that U.S. fishermen have been stealing its
salmon fish, worth millions of dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, angry Canadian fishermen seized a U.S. ferry boat
to protest the U.S. insincerity at resolving the salmon dispute.

<HEADLINE> Number of Asylum Seekers Drops in Germany in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of asylum seekers
coming to Germany dropped by 10.3 percent from the 1996 level to a
total of 104,353 in 1997, continuing a trend registered since
1992, the German Interior Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The biggest ethnic group seeking asylum in Germany last year
were Turks, numbering about 17,000, a drop of nearly 30 percent
compared with 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of asylum seekers from Iraq shot up by
nearly 30 percent last year to almost 15,000.
</P>
<P>
Among a total of 170,800 asylum seekers who had their cases
examined last year in Germany, only 4.9 percent of them were
granted the asylum status, the Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Germany moved to tighten its liberal asylum law in 1993 by
deciding that asylum seekers who arrive from states listed by Bonn
as "safe" are not eligible to the asylum status in Germany and
could be turned back to their original countries.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the number of asylum seekers has dropped by about
75 percent over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the trend, the German Interior Ministry stressed
today that it would urge the European Union to put more emphasis
on common immigration controls and would ask the EU to work out a
list of required asylum policies for eastern European countries
which are seeking EU membership.

<HEADLINE> China Continues Housing Development Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China built 300 million sq.m. of
housing in urban areas last year, and 650 million sq.m. in the
countryside, the largest amount of housing construction for the
past decade, according to Minister of Construction Hou Jie.
</P>
<P>
Hou says the housing industry has helped national economic
development and become a major focus of consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
There has been rapid growth in housing development and
improvements in housing conditions from 1992 to 1997, and annual
urban housing construction is above 200 million sq.m., and the
figure for rural housing is 600 million sq.m.
</P>
<P>
As part of the housing development and reform effort, China has
introduced commercial housing, publicly-pooled housing funds,
individual home mortgages, and other measures.
</P>
<P>
The 1.6 billion sq.m. of urban and rural housing built between
1992 and 1997 solved housing problems for over six million
households, and about 25 percent of the urban households have
moved into new housing.
</P>
<P>
The country's average per-capita urban living space has grown
to nearly 9 sq.m., and the figure for rural areas is nearly 18
sq.m.
</P>
<P>
The "Adequate Housing Project" is in effect in more than 200
cities, and has added over 25 million sq.m. of housing.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of housing cooperatives has increased
fund-raising means and benefited low- to medium-income households.
</P>
<P>
Construction departments have made a great effort to improve
infrastructure for water supplies, drainage, heating, roads,
bridges, highways, tree-planting, and environmental protection
systems and the effort has greatly helped improve the standard
of living.
</P>
<P>
Housing construction for urban areas is expected to account for
about four percent of the country's GNP between 1998 and 2000, Hou
says, and plans for the rest of the century call for nearly a
billion sq.m. of housing.

UNITED NATIONS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) has launched a 1.2 million U.S. dollar
project to protect civilians in Somalia, said a release from the

The program is already being implemented in northwest Somalia.
Its chief goal is to promote the country's social and economic
recovery by reestablishing a secure and stable environment.
</P>
<P>
In the area of demining, the UNDP plans to provide training and
equipment so that Somalia can manage their own demining
activities.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Conditions on Troop Pullback Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian official
Tuesday rejected an Israeli Cabinet decision that conditions
Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank on Palestinian
fulfillment of a list of obligations.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi, adviser on Israeli affairs to Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat, was quoted by Israel
Radio as blasting the Israeli move as further proof that Israeli
government is doing everything to ignore the existence of signed
agreements.
</P>
<P>
In the document adopted unanimously by ministers, Israeli
Cabinet lists a number of obligations it demands the PNA fulfill
before Israel carries out the second redeployment in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
These obligations include completing revising the Palestinian
Charter calling for Israel's destruction, fighting terror and
preventing violence against Israel, restricting the number of
Palestinian police force as well as PNA activities in Jerusalem,
and extraditing Palestinian terror suspects.
</P>
<P>
Meeting former United States Secretary of State George Shultz
in his office Tuesday, Netanyahu said the cabinet decision was
not an ultimatum, rather a question of honoring the Note for
Record attached to the Hebron agreement signed last January.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said if the PNA lives up to its commitments, there is
no doubt that Israel would move forward with the troop
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Tibi insisted that the Palestinians had no plan to hold
additional deliberations on the Palestinian Charter since it has
already been revised at the last meeting of the Palestine National
Council.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Palestinian side has a list of its own
detailing the violations of signed agreements by Israeli
government, and Arafat intended to present it to U.S. President
Bill Clinton when they meet late this month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
An inter-ministerial committee was set up at Tuesday's Cabinet
meeting to monitor the PNA's fulfillment of the listed
obligations. No timetable was set in the document for the PNA's
fulfillment, but Netanyahu has said earlier that he favored a
five-month trial period to assess the PNA actions.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Cabinet will continue discussions Wednesday and
Thursday on troop redeployment and guidelines for the final-status
talks with the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has promised to determine the scope of the overdue
second troop redeployment before his departure January 19 for
talks with Clinton in Washington.

<HEADLINE> France Expresses Regret Over Iraq's New Blocking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed regret
over the decision of the Iraqi government to block a United
Nations arms inspection team (UNSCOM) headed by an American from
carrying out its mission.
</P>
<P>
"France deeply regrets the decision of the Iraqi authorities
which counters the U.N. Security Council resolutions giving the
UNSCOM the unconditional right to send to Iraq all inspectors,"
said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
Iraq stopped a UNSCOM team from working Monday because it was
headed by former U.S. marine officer Scott Ritter and because it
consisted of too many American and British inspectors.
</P>
<P>
France asked Iraq to "re-consider" the decision and allow the
inspectors to resume their work.

LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The British government
criticized here today Iraq for halting a mission of the United
Nations arms inspectors, saying "Iraqi claims of bias are clearly
false."
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement issued
this afternoon, "It is for the Executive Chairman of UNSCOM
(United Nations Special Commission on Iraq), not Iraq, to dictate
the composition of the inspection teams."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government announced Monday that it would bar an
inspection team headed by an American and warned that the
suspension would remain in effect until the composition of the
team is changed.
</P>
<P>
"The present round of inspection is being carried out by 44
personnel from 17 countries. Iraqi claims of bias are clearly
false," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary said that his government would discuss
"the latest position with its EU (European Union) partners."

Council that Iraq should implement its resolutions scrupulously,"
the statement added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 500,000 residents
in the northern and northeastern United States remained without
power as a result of last week's ice-storms that also struck large
areas of Canada.
</P>
<P>
More than 400,000 people in Maine, about 16,500 homes and
businesses in New Hampshire and 6,000 residents in Vermont were
still left without electricity, an Associated Press report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an estimated 116,500 customers in northern New York
were without power and utility officials estimated that more than
275,000 people were affected. About 9,000 people have to stay in
120 emergency shelters.
</P>
<P>
Last week's storms caused floods across the South and spread
thick ice across the Northeast of the United States and eastern
Canada, leading to 19 deaths in New York, Maine, Tennessee, North
Carolina, South Carolina and Kentucky, as well as 15 deaths in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Maine governor Angus King, who said that the storm
has cost his state nearly 6.2 million U.S. dollars, asked for
federal emergency relief.
</P>
<P>
Utility workers from both local and outside states are busying
with the restoration work, but cold and snowy weather dragged
their work on the heavy damages of power lines and structures.

<HEADLINE> US Backs Afghan Mujahidins Before Soviet Invasion: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. presidential advisor
for national security affairs Zbigniew Brzezinski said in a French
weekly published today that the United States began to support the
Afghan mujahidin guerrillas before the Soviet Union invaded
Afghanistan on December 24, 1979.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the weekly Nouvel Observateur, Brzezinski
said that former U.S. President Jimmy Carter signed his first
order to the CIA on providing secret aid to anti-government
guerrillas in Afghanistan on July 3, 1979.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States did so in order to "increase the
probability" of a Soviet intervention.
</P>
<P>
"We did not push the Russians to intervene, but we consciously
increased the probability that they do it," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also described the secret operation in aiding the Mujahidins
as "an excellent idea," because it made Russians fall into the
"trap" of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The United States officially admitted aiding the Mujahidins
from 1980.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Reports Lower-Than-Expected Federal Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Germany saw a better chance to
meet the fiscal requirements for joining the single European
currency Euro after the federal government in Bonn announced
today that its 1997 budget deficit was lower than early planned.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Theo Waigel said in a statement today that
Germany's government budget deficit at the federal level totaled
64.6 billion marks (35.5 billion US dollars) last year, lower than
the 70.9 billion marks (39 billion dollars) planned in November.
</P>
<P>
"Germany's federal budget has made its contribution to meeting
the Euro budget target," Waigel said.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest figures did not include the budget deficits
of the country's local governments, which should also be taken
into account in Euro membership consideration. The data from the
local levels are expected to be released in February.
</P>
<P>
Under the European Union Maastricht Treaty, countries wishing
to join the Euro club must bring their total 1997 budget deficit
to no more than 3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Waigel had expected in November that Germany would run a total
budget deficit of about 110 billion marks (60.4 billion dollars),
which should exactly meet the 3-percent Euro budget target.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Tackle Turkish Provocations with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will tackle Turkish
violations of its air space with serious and responsible
self-restraint, government spokesman Manolis Christofides said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was commenting on Monday's violations by four
Turkish aircraft on two separate occasions of Cyprus' air space
and Nicosia Flight Information Region (FIR).
</P>
<P>
A Defense Ministry spokesman said earlier that two Turkish
RF-4 fighters entered Nicosia FIR before noon Monday and flew over
Cyprus' air space 10 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Early Monday afternoon, another two aircraft violated Nicosia
FIR and entered Cyprus' air space 40 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish violations are believed to be a response to a
Cypriot government announcement that an air base, near the
western coastal town of Paphos in the Greek Cypriot-controlled
south, will be ready for delivery later this month.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said: "We have the possibility to deal with the
Turkish provocations. Cyprus and Greece tackle this with a lot of
self-restraint, in a serious and responsible manner."
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that the joint Greco-Cypriot defense
pact sends the right message about these provocations in the best
possible manner. Cyprus and Greece signed in November 1993 a joint
defense pact, under which Greece will provide Cyprus with military
assistance in case the Mediterranean island is attacked.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the Paphos air base will "provide
facilities for aircraft to be stationed there, as part of our
defense deal with Greece and the Treaty of Guarantee."
</P>
<P>
The 1960 treaty for the establishment of the Cyprus Republic
stipulates that Greece, Britain and Turkey have the rights to
safeguard the Republic's independence and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said the Cypriot government was making all
necessary representations to international fora about Monday's
violations of air space by Turkish warplanes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Cypriot daily Kibris reported Monday that
the violations were part of Ankara's measures to counteract the
imminent operation of the Paphos air base.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash have
previously warned they would take countermeasures if the Paphos
air base becomes fully operational and Greek fighters are there
on a permanent basis.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Optimism Expressed at N.Ireland Talks Over New Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's politicians
spoke of optimism today as they met at Stormont to debate a new
peace plan put forward by the British and Irish governments
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The moderate Catholic nationalist Social Democratic and Labor
Party (SDLP) gave the proposals a cautious welcome by saying the
plan was a cause for "hope." Major Protestant parties also voiced
optimism over the proposals.
</P>
<P>
The proposals are for a new Northern Ireland Assembly, an
inter-governmental council, and a North-South Ministerial Council
to oversee islandwide cooperation on economic, trade, and other
matters.
</P>
<P>
Under the new proposals, Northern Ireland would remain under
British control while a majority in the province were so desire,
and Dublin would amend its constitutional claims over the disputed
territory.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said the ideas were not
set in stone, but "I hope it allows us to start talking."
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political arm of IRA guerrillas, voiced concern
about a fresh British-Irish strategy for bringing peace to
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"The... document produced by the governments yesterday is, they
have claimed, an attempt to get substantive negotiations on
board," Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin was quoted by local
reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Others, many I think, see it as a sop to the unionists and the
loyalists. Sinn Fein intends to test that, and test it very
rigorously," McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
Eight parties are taking part in the talks, along with British
and Irish ministers.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Northern Cyprus Sign Cooperation Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and northern Cyprus
Tuesday signed a protocol to elevate political and economic
consultation, Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was signed in the Turkish Cypriot-controlled part
of Nicosia by northern Cyprus' "Foreign and Defense Minister"
Taner Etkin and Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Korkmaz
Haktanir.
</P>
<P>
It foresees establishment of political and economic
consultation committees which will convene at the level of
"ministers and undersecretaries," according to the report.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, the Turkish official said northern
Cyprus should be recognized as an "independent and democratic
state" in the world, adding that the installation of peace and
stability in eastern Mediterranean depends on that.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared a "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus" in 1983, which is recognized only by Turkey, the
political, economic and military supporter of those Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Thousands in UK at Risk From Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Air pollution may contribute to
the deaths up to 24,000 people with asthma and breathing
difficulties a year in urban Britain, according to a government
report released today.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were already suffering from severe disease
and would not have survived for more than a few weeks or months in
any event, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution was
commissioned by Britain's Department of Health to investigate the
short-term impact of the high levels of pollution which occur in
cities, especially on calm days.
</P>
<P>
It concluded that of the three major pollutants, high levels of
sodium dioxide hastened the death of 3,500 people a year, ozone
possibly as many as 12,500 and particulates 8,100.
</P>
<P>
Ministers are under renewed pressure to cut traffic fumes after
figures showed the terrible consequences.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show between 14,000 and 24,000 hospital
admissions may be linked to poor air quality.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed that the committee had looked only at
British cities, where some 430,000 people die every year, and had
made no attempt to assess the effects of long-term exposure to the
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
"If estimates made elsewhere, particularly in the United
States, do apply in the UK, they suggest that the overall impacts
may be substantially greater than those that we have as yet been
able to quantify," it said.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Help Achieve Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain will make efforts to
help achieve the implementation of the U.N. Security Council
resolution 425 requiring Israel to withdraw unconditionally from
south Lebanon, British ambassador to Lebanon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
David Maclennam, whose country will assume the presidency of
the European Union (EU) starting from this month for a six-month
term, made the remark after a meeting with Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is good that Israel admitted the principles
stipulated in the resolution 425. "But we need to see if it can
apply it," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be very difficult. So we are going to help
promote it through our efforts designed to advance the Middle
East peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Israel admitted for the first time the
resolution 425 since it was adopted by the U.N. in 1978, saying
that it will withdraw from its occupied south Lebanon provided
arrangements are agreed by Lebanon to protect its security.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the offer, saying the Israeli withdrawal
is conditional and its aim is to drive a wedge between Syrian and
Lebanese tracks in the peace talks and to spark strife inside the
country.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 to protect its northern areas from attacks
by Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the visit to Lebanon by French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine two days ago, the ambassador said that
Britain's viewpoint on the Middle East peace talks is close to
that of France and the two countries will cooperate within the EU
to advance the stalled peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Trade Minister Meets Russian Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed
Mehdi Saleh today met with visiting Vice Chairman of the Russian
Liberal Democratic Party Ghotsrev and his accompanying delegation,
the Iraqi news agency INA reported.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Saleh expressed Iraq's keenness to expand
economic and trade cooperation with Russia, saying that Russian
companies would be given priority to conclude contracts with Iraq
within the Iraqi-U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced last week that it was ready to conclude
contracts after U.N. chief Kofi Annan approved its food
distribution plan under the third phase of the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Ghotsrev said his country would fulfill all its commitments
toward the contracts it had signed with Iraq within the second
phase of the oil-for-food deal and in a way that would help
alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Russian companies are seeking new contracts for the export of
foodstuffs to Iraq and the purchase of Iraqi oil, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to export 2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its people.
</P>
<P>
Ghotsrev said that the Russian Liberal Democratic Party would
continue its effort to help lift the embargo on the Iraqi people,
adding that a number of its party members would take direct
flights between Moscow and Baghdad in February and March to
extend medical aid to the Iraqi people and convey a number of the
Iraqi sick for treatment in Russian hospitals.
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the U.N., a Russian Liberal Democratic
Party delegation flew to Iraq at the end of last year on board a
plane carrying 5 tonnes of medicines for Iraqi children on
board. This was the first foreign civil flight to the country
since 1991 when the U.N. imposed sanctions and a travel ban on
Iraq against its invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Two London Bombing Suspects Go on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Two men who were accused of
planning the Irish Republican Army (IRA) explosion in the
Docklands area of London two years ago went on trial today.
</P>
<P>
The explosion in February 1996, which killed two people and
devastated London's Canary Wharf area, was caused by a bomb
concealed in a lorry and marked a major escalation in the IRA's
campaign of violence.
</P>
<P>
Both Patrick McKinley, 34, and James McCardle, 29, have denied
conspiring to cause an explosion.
</P>
<P>
McCardle has also denied murdering the two men who died in the
blast.
</P>
<P>
The bombing marked the end of an IRA cease-fire that had lasted
18 months.
</P>
<P>
Prosecution lawyer John Bevan told the court that, while
warnings of the explosion were received, they were inaccurate and
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
"Those warnings did not begin to give the police sufficient
time to warn and evacuate the many thousands of people at work and
leaving work in the area," he said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Jordan for Talks with Hussein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat arrived here Tuesday evening for
talks with King Hussein in the run-up to the coming meeting
between Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Arafat proposed the talks with Hussein on the stalled Middle
East peace process to prepare his position when he meets Clinton
on January 22 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will meet with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu separately in Washington in an effort to
reactivate the peace process. His meeting with Netanyahu falls on
January 20.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is expected to brief Hussein on the outcome of last
week's mission by U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross,
according to Jordan's Minister of State for Information Affairs
Samir Mutawi.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, said to be "extremely worried and concerned" over the
lack of progress in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and the
apparent right-prone Netanyahu government following last week's
resignation of dovish Foreign Minister David Levy, wants to know
what Arafat will tell Clinton, local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit had been arranged during a telephone
conversation between Arafat and Hussein on Saturday but was
postponed due to the stormy weather.
</P>
<P>
Many believe Clinton's meetings with Arafat and Netanyahu will
be the last chance to save the peace process, which came to a halt
after Israel began construction of a Jewish settlement in Arab
east Jerusalem last march.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want east Jerusalem, seized by Israel in 1967,
to be the capital of their future state.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Residents Call for Withdrawal from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli residents living
along Israeli-Lebanese border Tuesday called for withdrawal of
Israeli troops from south Lebanon, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the residents' representatives met Tuesday
with Israeli Knesset (parliament) members in Jerusalem, insisting
that the confrontation in south Lebanon could be solved by the
pullout of Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that although northern Israeli residents have
been living under Hezbollah attacks from south Lebanon, the best
way to lower Israeli casualties in south Lebanon is to implement
troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The representatives, some of them have served in Israeli army
in south Lebanon, noted that a number of senior Israeli army
officials also support the withdrawal and they have plans to
maintain the security along the northern border.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said last week that
Israel is willing to implement the U.N. Security Council
Resolution 425, which calls for Israeli troop withdrawal from
Lebanon unconditionally and the restoration of peace and security
in the region.
</P>
<P>
But he also stressed that the pullout is contingent on
Lebanese authority's obligation to fight Hezbollah in south
Lebanon and eliminate cross-border terror attacks against Israeli
residents.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer zone in
south Lebanon to protect its northern border from guerrilla
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Guerrilla groups, principally the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
are fighting to oust Israel from the zone. And more than 200
Israeli soldiers have been killed in south Lebanon since the
establishment of the buffer area.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Rise in Smoking by UK Young Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- There was a 6 percent rise in
smoking by British young men between 1993 and 1996 to nearly 40
percent, according to an official survey today.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 Health Survey for England published by the Department
of Health said that smoking by men aged from 16 to 34 increased
from 33 percent to 39 percent. Women smokers rose to just under 35
percent from just over 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 16,000 adults and 4,000 children found that men
smokers in all age groups rose from 28 percent to 30 percent while
women stayed about the same at 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bill O'Neill of the British Medical Association said that while
the focus had been laid on young women because of the risks to
their fertility and of smoking in pregnancy, smoking by young men
had been neglected.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Guardian/ICM poll published today found that there
is overwhelming public demand for government-endorsed smoking bans
at work and in restaurants and bars. There is even majority
support for a ban in all public places.

<HEADLINE> US to Concert Action With Allies on Iraq: White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The White House said today
that the United States would like to concert its action with its
allies in dealing with Iraq's decision to bar a U.N. weapons
inspection team led by an American, but would not rule out
unilateral action when needed.
</P>
<P>
"It is always better to act in concert with others when we can,
but there is never any reluctance to act alone if we must," White
House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton said Monday that he expected the U.N.
Security Council would take "strong and appropriate" action if
Iraq enforces its decision to block the weapons inspection team,
headed by American Scott Ritter, today.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced the decision Monday to prevent the Ritter-led
team from inspecting weapons of mass destruction on the ground
that he was spying for the United States and it also complained
that the composition of the team was not fairly balanced as it was
composed with nine Americans, five Britains, one Russian and one
Australian.
</P>
<P>
While exerting efforts to press its concerns over Iraq's
challenge on weapons inspections within the U.N. Security Council,
the United States is closely monitoring the situation in the Gulf
"day in and day out" in case there is any incident to be
occurring, McCurry said.

<HEADLINE> German Exports to Eastern Europe Surge in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Germany's exports to central and
eastern Europe has surged 19 percent to more than 85 billion marks
(46.7 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, the East Committee of German
Economy announced today.
</P>
<P>
With the latest figures, Germany also saw its exports to the
region nearly doubled within the past four years, the committee
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the Federal Association of the German
Industry (BDI), Poland was Germany's largest market in central and
eastern Europe in 1997, with its imports of German goods surging
to a record high of nearly 20 billion marks (11 billion dollars),
up about 20 percent from the level of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Germany's exports to the Czech republic also expanded by 15
percent to 15.9 billion marks (8.7 billion dollars). Its exports
to Russia were up more than 25 percent to 14.5 billion marks (8.0
billion dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Germany's imports from the central and
eastern European region totaled 72 billion marks (39.6 billion
dollars) in 1997, up 14 percent from 1996, the BDI said.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the German federal statistics office announced that
Germany's exports to the United States jumped 28 percent to 55.5
billion marks (30.5 billion dollars) in the first nine months last
year. Its exports to Canada crept up 54 percent to 4.8 billion
marks (2.6 billion dollars) during the same period.
</P>

About 9 percent of Germany's total exports went to North
America, the statistics office said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Sell Two Tons of Elephant Tusks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A Mozambican wildlife official
has said the country might sell two tons of elephant tusks soon
under the arrangement of the Convention on International Trade of
Endangered Species (CITES).
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Noticias today quoted Sansao Bonito, director
of the National Bureau for Forest and Wild Animals, as announcing
the news here Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a group of CITES experts will visit
Mozambique this month in a bid to be acquainted with the
situation of the country's accumulated tusks since 1989, when
tusk sale was first banned.
</P>
<P>
Individuals and institutions who own tusks must make their
sale to the National Bureau for Forest and Wild Animals or to
other relevant provincial agencies, Bonito said.
</P>
<P>
"Inspection measures will be implemented, under which those
violating the rules will be punished," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Bonito revealed that those allowed for sale include raw tusk
as well as tusk products. They could be sold after appraisal by
international experts.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the efforts by the international community to
restrict tusk trade, especially in African countries.
</P>
<P>
"When some of the countries still have a large reserve of
tusks, there could be no talking about a complete ban on tusk
trade," said the director.
</P>
<P>
The investigation results by the CITES experts will be
announced at an international meeting in March, when decisions on
the ways of tusk sale are made.
</P>
<P>
Bonito indicated that there might be two ways for the sale,
one to sell them to Japan, which is a potential consumer of
tusks; the other is to make the sale to donors' group before they
are destroyed.

ATHENS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Greece will begin this year to
remove thousands of landmines in the Grammos mountain region on
the northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia-Thrace Minister Philipos Petsalnikos said today that
the Greek government intended to turn the region into a tourist
destination.
</P>
<P>
He said that funds from the third community support framework
and the Greek National Defense Ministry have already been
allocated for the project.
</P>
<P>
The landmines, which were laid in the region during the
1947-1949 civil war between communist-backed resistance fighters
and allies-backed troops, have left dozens of people dead and many
more injured in the past years.

<HEADLINE> Music Sales Start to Slow Worldwide: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) - The global music industry is
entering a period of slower growth over the next five years, a
study said.
</P>
<P>
After a decade in which the music market doubled in value,
retail sales of albums and singles will show real growth of 26
percent by rising from 40.2 billion US dollars last year to 50.7
billion US dollars in 2003, according to the study compiled by MBI
World Report.
</P>
<P>
Sales will continue to show robust growth in developing
markets, notably eastern Europe and Latin America. However, the
increases from these regions are unlikely to counter the
sluggishness of larger, more mature markets such as the US,
Germany, France and Japan, it said.
</P>
<P>
MBI claimed that the balance of power in the industry has
changed. It estimated that PolyGram of the Netherlands is still
the world's biggest record company with a 17 percent market share.
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the success of Celine Dion and Oasis, Japan's Sony
moved ahead of Warner Music to take second place with 15.7 percent
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Warner, the US entertainment group, fell to third place with
14.5 percent. Best-selling artists such as Puff Daddy and Toni
Braxton propelled BMG, the German media company, into fourth
position with 14 percent.

BONN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Daimler-Benz AG

Mercedes-Benz has since been refitting about 10,000 A-Class
cars with an electronic balancing system as well as lowered
bodywork and wider tires.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 13 (Xinhua) -- This year should become the
first year of stable economic growth in Russia and its gross
domestic product (GDP) must rise by 2-4 percent, Russian President
Boris Yeltsin said today, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Boris Nemtsov, the first deputy prime minister, in
Valdai, where the president is vacationing, Yeltsin said the
government should aim at scaling back taxes and adopting a new
tax code, cutting down nonpayments, streamlining social safety
measures and reducing lending rates to revive economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The president also noted the Cabinet should as well concentrate
on repaying debts to the defense industry and providing homes to
discharged servicemen.
</P>
<P>
He said that in total, 210,000 apartments for discharged
military servicemen will be needed over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Nemtsov also discussed the pace of repayment of
state debts to budget-financed organizations. In the president's
opinion, the release of federal budget funds for this purpose
should be under strict control.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Relocates Refugees in Flooded Eastern Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was forced to relocate more
than 3,500 refugees in the Dagahaley camp in eastern Kenya as
heavy rains continue to fall in the area.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here today, UNHCR said that
thousands of refugees in the nearby Ifo camp were relocated last
November when that camp was flooded.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR is airlifting fuel daily from Kenya's port city of
Mombasa to Dadaab, which have been cut off due to flooding since
mid-November last year.
</P>
<P>
World Food Program (WFP) has undertaken an airdrop operation
with two C-130 Hercules aircrafts since December 24 for 80,000
refugees in Dagahaley and Ifo camps.
</P>
<P>
Two WFP DC-3 planes are transporting food to Hagadera camp,
which has been cut off due to flooding.
</P>
<P>
The release noted that UNHCR was conducting aerial spraying in
the region to combat the rise in malaria-carrying mosquitoes in
order to prevent mass outbreaks of deadly malaria among the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists recorded 500 percent rainfall above normal in
the region in November, 1997 and rains have continued since then,
making the 110 km road from the Provincial capital of Garissa to
Dadaab area unusable.
</P>
<P>
The refugee camps of Ifo, Dagahaley and Hagadera together
shelter some 125,000 refugees mainly from Somalia, Ethiopia,
Sudan and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Differences Delay UN Team's Visit to S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A planned visit to Sierra Leone
by United Nations special envoy Francis Okello and a fact-finding
team has been delayed over where he should stay, a report
reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The dispute focuses on whether Okello and the team would stay
at Lungi, where the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) is
based, or in the capital Freetown, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"The problem of where the UN special envoy to Sierra Leone
will stay and work from in Sierra Leone remains a problem that
has not yet been resolved," junta spokesman Amadou Bailoh Bah was
quoted as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the junta wanted Okello based in
Freetown proper.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome his permanent transfer from Guinea to here. What
we are against is his position of coming to Sierra Leone and
setting up his office in Lungi," he said.
</P>
<P>
Okello has said earlier that it is irrelevant wherever the
team operates from.
</P>
<P>
Any place it choses would just be a liaison office, the
Ugandan-born assistant secretary-general said in Conakry, capital
of Guinea, last weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the team is to monitor development in Sierra
Leone and to work closely with the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) and ECOMOG, and to be in contact with the
regime in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The team, which had been due in Freetown on Friday, has
arrived at Conakry.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the United Nations, ECOMOG and the junta
were discussing where Okello should be based.
</P>
<P>
At present, the peace process in Sierra Leone has stalled as
the junta said it would be unrealistic to step down by April 22
as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Under the Conakry peace plan signed last October, the junta
agreed to hand over power at that date to elected president Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah ousted in the coup last May.
</P>
<P>
But the junta lately insisted on renegotiating the peace
accord with the delay in disarmament and delivery of
international aids, which were due to start in December.
</P>
<P>
The military regime also wanted Nigeria's role in ECOMOG
diminished, its army kept outside the disarmament process and the
former rebel leader released from detention in Nigeria before
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Okello also noted that the peace plan was still feasible and
the terminal date could be stuck to although the problems
remained unsolved.

<HEADLINE> Guinea to Recall Troops in ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Guinea has decided to recall its
troops serving with the west African peacekeeping force known as
ECOMOG in Liberia and Sierra Leone by the end of February.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted military sources in
Conakry, capital of Guinea, as saying that the pullout from
Liberia is in line with the departure of the force under a peace
plan that ended the seven-year civil war there.
</P>
<P>
One source said that the departure from Sierra Leone was to
save money, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Guinea, which has an estimated 600 soldiers in ECOMOG, must
hold a presidential election by December, its second since the
advent of multi-party politics in 1992.
</P>
<P>
A phased withdrawal of the 11,000 strong ECOMOG force from
Liberia has already begun. Last month, the first contingent of
1,205 Nigerian soldiers returned from Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
The pullout is expected to complete next month according to
the appeal of the Liberian government.
</P>
<P>
The force is currently enforcing international sanctions in
Sierra Leone where the elected civilian government was overthrown
in a coup last May.

<HEADLINE> Iran Voices Readiness to Develop Ties with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran Tuesday expressed its
willingness to develop ties with Russia, the Iranian official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between Iran, Russia and other countries will help
bolster stability in the region, Iran's first Vice President
Hassan Habibi said during a meeting with Russian ambassador to
Iran Knostantine Shuvalov.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the region needs peace and security more than
any other things.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that the meeting took place when the United
States sent a special envoy to Moscow, trying to persuade Russia
to stop its nuclear cooperation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Washington has voiced concern over Moscow's assistance of
nuclear technology to Tehran, which Russia has denied.
</P>
<P>
Shuvalov said that Russia attaches importance to the bilateral
relations, which he termed as "developing."
</P>
<P>
He said the cooperation between Russia and Iran will have
positive effect on restoring regional peace and stability, and
called on other states in the region to join the process.
</P>
<P>
Habibi attacked U.S. military presence in the Gulf, which he
said is detrimental to the regional security.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn the presence of foreign forces in the Persian
Gulf. We believe that their presence will solve no problem but
disturb the stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian vice president also denounced terrorism in all its
forms, saying that Iran neither is a terrorist state, nor supports
terrorism. Iran believes that terrorism, especially state
terrorism, should be brought to an end, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador appreciated Iran's denunciation of
terrorism and its stand on eliminating weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced Moscow's readiness to cooperate with Tehran to
clarify the status of the Caspian Sea.

<HEADLINE> Aboriginals Account for 3 Pct of Canada's Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The aboriginal population
accounts for about 3 percent of Canada's total population,
Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
Canada had a total of 799,010 aboriginal individuals, according
to a new release from the 1996 census.
</P>
<P>
Two thirds of them were North American Indians, one quarter
were Metis and one in 20 Inuit.
</P>
<P>
But due to different census questions, the 1996 census data
cann't compared with data from the previous ones, the statistics
agency noted.
</P>
<P>
As a result, there is no way to tell what percentage changes
Canada's aboriginal population have experienced in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed that Canada's aboriginal population is
continuing to grow more rapidly, though its fertility rate is
declining. And aboriginal's birth rate is 70 percent higher than
the general population.
</P>
<P>
The aboriginal population in 1996 was 10 years younger on
average than the general population. "Over the next two decades,
this will be reflected in large increases within the aboriginal
working-age population," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The release also indicated that one third of Canada's
aboriginal people had an aboriginal language as mother tongue. But
about 68 percent of them had English as mother tongue, while 6
percent French.
</P>
<P>
Among all provinces, Ontario had more North American Indians.
Alberta had the largest Metis population, while the Northwest
Territories had the largest Inuit population.
</P>
<P>
About three of every 10 aboriginal people lived on rural
reserves. Half of them lived in urban areas and the rest in
isolated northern communities, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Preparing to Capture Disputed Islands: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Botswana is preparing to
capture two more islands in southeastern Caprivi for the erection
of military bases, according to reports from Windhoek, Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Johan Mabuku, Namibia's regional councillor for the Caprivi
region, has confirmed this latest development surrounding the
disputed islands, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted Namibian newspapers and radio's reports as saying
that negotiations between delegates of Namibia and Botswana had
reached deadlock.
</P>
<P>
A world court decision on the status and ownership of Kasikili
Island, called Sedudu in Botswana, is being awaited.
</P>
<P>
But even before this problem was sorted out, ownership of two
more islands has become a bone of contention between Namibia and
Botswana. These are Situngu and Luyondo islands situated in the
Linyanti and Chobe rivers on the Namibian side of the border.
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago an agreement was reached between the Botswana
district commissioner and the governor of the Caprivi region,
allowing Namibian farmers on the islands to continue ploughing
their lands unhindered until the dispute was resolved.
</P>
<P>
Mabuku, however, said that even as the meeting dispersed,
Botswana officials continued with claims that Situngu Island in
southeastern Caprivi was theirs.
</P>
<P>
Botswana reportedly wants to establish a military base on the
island to prevent Namibians from farming the land, he said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denounces Terrorism in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today strongly condemned terrorism in Algeria on the heels
of the bloodiest carnage in Algeria's six years of violence.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt stands against crimes that intimidate innocent civilians
in Algeria and any other society," Moussa told reporters, adding
that efforts should be taken to halt the brutal slaughter.
</P>
<P>
He said that Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid
had dispatched a special envoy to Algeria to convey a message that
all the Arabs are against terrorism and crime against innocent
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The message, sent to Algerian President Liamine Zeroul today,
stressed the League's support to the Algerian people and
government against terrorist groups that killed some 1,000 people
over the past 12 days.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based League also rejected "attempts to interfere in
the internal Algerian affairs for whatever reasons and
justifications."
</P>
<P>
Terrorists killed 103 people and wounded 70 in a village south
of Algiers overnight, in the worst carnage announced by the
authorities in six years of conflict.
</P>
<P>
More than 65,000 people, including members of security forces
and terrorists, have been killed since early 1992 after the
authorities scrapped a general election when an Islamic party was
poised to win.

<HEADLINE> All Suspected Assassins of Iraqi Diplomat Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 13 (Xinhua) - A senior Jordanian official said
here Tuesday that all the suspects in the January 3 assassination
attempt on an Iraqi diplomat in Amman have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir Mutawi told the
press after a regular cabinet meeting that the suspects are
holding Iraqi passports and belong to the same family.
</P>
<P>
But he did not give the total number of the new arrests. Local
informed sources, however, put the number at five.
</P>
<P>
On Monday he told reporters that six people had been arrested
in connection with the murder attempt and the police were tracing
down the others.
</P>
<P>
The suspects attacked Rahim Taher, commercial councillor at the
Iraqi Embassy here, not for political reasons, but for family and
financial disputes, according to Mutawi.
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects had confessed to the police that he fired a
shot at Taher when the diplomat was starting his car before his
residence. The bullet missed the diplomat and his son, but hit his
car.
</P>
<P>
Another suspect said he was driving the car carrying the gunman
in the shooting, and the others said they were involved in tracing
Taher and finally locating his residence.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, Taher laid the blames on "either the Iraqi
opposition or Israel or the United States." Iraqi Ambassador to
Jordan Nouri Al Weiss said the attempt was carried out "by some
elements who do not want to see any rapprochement in relations
between Jordan and Iraq taking place."
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two neighbors soured after Iraq executed
four Jordanians convicted of smuggling car parts worth about 850
U.S. dollars on December 8, 1997. Jordan recalled its charge
d'affaires from Baghdad and expelled seven Iraqi diplomats.
</P>
<P>
However, ties improved somewhat in late December when Iraq
agreed to renew a contract to sell oil to Jordan at below-market
prices.

signed with the Palestinians."

<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Lords in the upper
House will be stripped of their privilege of voting in the House
of Lords, a government official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A committee, charged with reforming the upper House, has
planned to remove the right to vote from Lords who have inherited
their seats.
</P>
<P>
"Removing the voting rights of hereditary peers was the first
thing the committee discussed and legislation will be drawn up
during this parliament," the government official was quoted by
Reuter as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The primary aim of the committee is to remove voting rights
and the inbuilt Conservative Party majority and try and make the
House of Lords more representative," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The plan was part of Prime Minister Tony Blair who has forced
the pace of constitutional change in his 8-1/2 months in power to

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Producer Inflation Falls in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
year-on-year producer price index for last November dropped to
4.7 percent, further down from the 26-year low of 4.9 percent in
last October, the Central Statistical Services (CSS) said today.
</P>
<P>
The monthly increase in the index was 0.3 percent against the
0.2 percent for October 1997, the South African Press Association
quoted CSS as saying.
</P>
<P>
The monthly growth resulted from fluctuations in the price
indices of petroleum and coal products, metal products transport
equipment and electricity.
</P>
<P>
The annual increase in the PPI for locally produced goods slid
to 5.3 percent, the lowest since 1972, the CSS said. This was 0.4
percentage points down from the corresponding annual rate of 5.7
percent in October.
</P>
<P>
Imports witnessed a higher annual rate with a rise of 2
percent in November, compared with the 1.3 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the 4.7 percent year-on-year growth was
higher than their forecast of 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the year-on-year PPI growth for December
1997 would decline further to 4.4 percent, and the average 1998
production inflation ould drop by nearly one percentage point to
6.3 percent.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration once again marshaled its
international allies on Tuesday to present a unified front against
iraq as Baghdad carried out its threat to block a U.S.-led weapons
inspection team and reignited a crisis.
</P>
<P>
-- White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles announced that
he planned to stay in his job for another year, thus spoiling
the year-long guessing of a replacement for him.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's cabinet decided that there would be no further
troop withdrawals from the West bank unless the Palestinians
satisfied a series of conditions. Few expected Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to accept.
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton's initiative on race, after
struggling for months to overcome poor planning, an uncertain
mandate and wriness from some White House aides toward what they
saw as a politically risky undertaking, has turned a corner.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Indonesia's financial turmoil will pose the biggest threat
to lenders from South Korea and Japan, who must now add
Indonesia to the list of problems they already face in their
home markets.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. inflation all but evaporated in 1997. After climbing
only 0.1 percent, the consumer price index for the year climbed
just 1.7 percent -- half the 3.3 percent increase in 1996.

STOCKHOLM, January 14 (Xinhua)--Presidents of Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania will join U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday in
signing the U.S.-Baltic Charter in Washington, D.C., the press
here reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Baltic charter has been described as a "framework" for
U.S. support for Baltic integration in Western institutions,
such as the EU and NATO.
</P>
<P>
The charter will not, however, give the Baltic states security
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, leaders in the region are also strengthening
the economic and political cooperation among themselves.
</P>
<P>
Early next week, the Baltic Sea Business Summit will be held in
Stockholm. The most prominent business leaders in the Baltic Sea
countries will take part in the summit.
</P>
<P>
On January 22-23, a summit of government leaders from the 11
countries surrounding the Baltic will be held in Riga, capital of

<HEADLINE> US Urged to Pressure Israel Committed to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Wednesday urged the United States to
pressure Israel into carrying out the signed peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after their talks, Jordanian Prime
Minister Abdul Salam Majali and PNA President Yasser Arafat warned
that If Israel fails to fulfill its commitments, the Middle East
will be in danger of violence and instability.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he would ask U.S. President Bill clinton during
their scheduled meeting in Washington, which he said is "the last
chance" to save the peace process, to persuade the Israeli
government to abide by all the peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
Arafat added that Clinton was expected to find a solution to
the current deadlock of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks after
his meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
January 20 and with the Palestinian leader on January 22
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed hope that Clinton will convince Netanyahu to
stop unilateral actions, including expanding Jewish settlements in
East Jerusalem and carrying out troop pullback in the West Bank in
one phase rather than three phases.
</P>
<P>
Israel's unilateral actions have paralyzed the peace process,
the region is in danger and the U.S. has to do something now, said
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned if the peace process fails, all possibilities,
including renewed chaos, may turn into reality in the region, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Prime Minister Majali also called on the U.S. to work
seriously to save the peace process.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. does not make efforts to revitalize the peace
process, which he said is in real danger in these days, the region
may witness a comeback of violence, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Amman Tuesday evening on a two-day visit and
left here this morning after having consultations with Jordanian
King Hussein and Crown Prince Hassan.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian leaders have expressed their support to the
Palestinian struggle for restoring their national rights, but also
stated that any final solution of the Palestinian issue must take
into consideration the kingdom's national interest. Jordan ruled
from 1950 to 1967 the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem,
territories on which the Palestinians are struggling to establish
their independent state.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and Belgium
signed an agreement on reciprocal promotion and protection of
investments Wednesday to strengthen economic cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed here by Philippine Trade and Industry
Secretary Cesar Bautista and visiting Belgian Vice Prime Minister
and Minister of Finance Philippe Maystadt and witnessed by
Philippine President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Maystadt said the agreement is a signal that the Belgian
business community maintains confidence on the Philippines despite
the current financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
In their meeting earlier, Ramos and Maystadt discussed ways to
promote bilateral ties between the two countries and ways to cope
with current currency crisis in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Ramos agreed with Maystadt, who is on a two-day working visit
to the Philippines, that Asian nations need a "second line of
defense" to protect their economies.
</P>
<P>
Maystadt called for international solidarity to quickly solve
the financial meltdown because "this is not only a problem of this
region but the problem of the whole world."
</P>
<P>
The monetary problem has stalked the Asian region with
currencies of Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines
tumble like dominos since July last year.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the Philippines and Belgium reached 400 million
U.S. dollars last year, according to the Department of Trade and
Industry.
</P>
<P>
Belgium has been engaged in small and medium enterprises in the
country and Belgian companies are keen to invest in bigger
projects like information technology, infrastructure and silver
ware.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Condemns Violence in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government today condemned violence in Burundi and welcomed a
decision of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to urgently
dispatch a mission to that country.
</P>
<P>
"The South African government wishes to voice its serious
concern regarding the security situation and lack of stability in
Burundi and is deeply shocked by the latest massacre of over 100
people including women and children near Bujumbura," the Foreign
Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The massacre brought the number of persons reportedly killed
in armed clashes in the country to over 300 since the New Year,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"In light of this serious situation in Burundi, the South
African government welcomes the decision by the OAU to urgently
dispatch a high-level mission to that county."
</P>
<P>
The mission, composed of representatives of three member
states of the OAU mechanism for conflict prevention, management
and resolution, would be led by an ambassador of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
In addition to visiting Burundi, the mission would also visit
Uganda and Tanzania in order to consult with the respective
leaders and to emphasize the need for the Arusha peace process to
resume its activities aimed at bringing about a just and peaceful
solution in Burundi, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
An international conference was held in Arusha, Tanzania last
year to discuss ways of ending conflict in the Great Lakes
region.
</P>
<P>
"The South African government wishes to express its strong
support for both the OAU mission and the regional Arusha peace
process, which is led by Mwalimu Nyerere (former president of
Tanzania).
</P>
<P>
South Africa, through its special envoy on the Burundian
issue, ambassador Welile Nhlapo, will continue to play an active
role in international efforts aimed at bringing about national
reconciliation and lasting peace in Burundi," the Foreign
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement, South Africa also condemned the
killing of nine Roman Catholic nuns in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria accused the Hutu rebels of sabotaging peace and
stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The Rwandan government, through its activities has clearly
demonstrated its commitment to peace and reconciliation. However,
the very forces who were responsible for the genocide in Rwanda
in 1994 are now intensifying their terrorist campaign."
</P>
<P>
"It is vital that the international community takes urgent
action to support the Rwandan government and isolate the
extremists," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two statements were released one week ahead of an
international conference on conflict prevention in Africa to be
held in Arusha.

<HEADLINE> France Calls for International Intervention in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The French Minister of Economy
and Finance Dominique Strauss-Kahn said Wednesday that
international intervention is needed to help Asian countries
control the on-going financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The markets cannot regulate the evolution alone," said
Strauss-Kahn during a meeting with the press.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the international community intervene occasionally
to see that things are being corrected in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"There is no perfect market. We need to intervene periodically
to make sure things are correct," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the financial situation in South Korea is almost
under control, although it is difficult to predict to which degree
"other elements in the Asian puzzle are susceptible to capsizing."
</P>
<P>
He said the French economy will be hurt by the Asian crisis,
but not greatly.
</P>
<P>
"One cannot fear a colossal effect on (French) exports, but one
cannot pretend to think that there will not be a considerable
effect," he said.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth in France could exceed three percent this year
if there had not been a crisis in Asia, he said. And if "other
major explosions" take place in Asia, the whole world will have to
review the perspectives of its growth.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Optimistic About Peace Accord with Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Wednesday expressed optimism that the government and leftist
rebels will sign a peace agreement before he steps down from
office on June 30, this year.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks after meeting with Luis
Jalandoni, chief negotiator of the National Democratic Front (NDF)
who made a courtesy call at the Presidential Palace Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jalandoni arrived in Manila Tuesday to confer with local NDF
members in the country on the on-going peace talks with the
government in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Jalandoni said he and Ramos discussed the agreement on human
rights and international law.
</P>
<P>
Ramos told a press conference that he was optimistic that a
peace accord will be signed soon "since we have also hurdled the
major obstacle which is the aspect on human rights and
humanitarian law" during the two panels' discussion in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The government and the NDF have made progress on issues of
human rights and international law during their on-going peace
talks, but some disagreements still remain.
</P>
<P>
Jalandoni said that while the peace talk is going on, the New
People's Army, the military wing of the NDF, will increase its
tactical military operations against the Armed Forces of the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The NDF, the political wing of the Communist Party of the
Philippines, has been engaging in peace talks with the government
sporadically since 1992 in the Netherlands, where most rebel
leaders live.
</P>
<P>
The NDF has fought against the government for more than three
decades and still has a presence in many hinterland areas in the
country, including some rural villages around metropolitan Manila.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Call for More Science Magazines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Publishers in China are being
asked to provide more popular science magazines to improve science
and technology education.
</P>
<P>
A random survey by the Chinese Institute of Popular Science
(CIPS) of 4,311 periodicals from all over China has shown that
two-thirds of them deal with science, but only 20 percent are
popular science magazines. This is far from enough to meet the
demand of workers, farmers, and youngsters without a higher
education but who make up a large portion of the total population,
according to Yuan Zhengguang, head of CIPS.
</P>
<P>
Popular science magazines should account for 40 percent of
periodicals to maintain a balance between supply and demand, he
explains, and suggests that the government push for as many as
five popular science magazines like the American's "Science."
</P>
<P>
This will attract more Chinese to science magazines, he
concludes, adding that popular science periodicals are an
important channel of scientific information and should play a more
active role in increasing people's understanding of science and
education.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Cut Back on Overseas Diplomatic Missions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Foreign Ministry
will shut down 15 of its 145 overseas diplomatic missions as part
of a cost-saving effort to overcome the nation's current financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, which has been under pressure to streamline
its overseas missions, will report its plan to President-elect Kim
Dae-jung's takeover team, a ministry spokesman said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Embassies that are most likely to be closed are those in
Africa, South America and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The consulates-general in Miami, United States, Berlin,
Germany, Kobe, Japan, Karachi, Pakistan, Jeddah and Saudi Arabia
will also be closed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the country's Defense Ministry announced
its decision to close its military attache offices in Venezuela,
Greece, Austria, Myanmar and Morocco. The move came amid a shortage
of foreign currency caused by the financial crisis gripping the
nations since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, South Korea has closed eight diplomatic missions
but set up 14 missions, mostly in Eastern European countries and
the former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's overseas diplomatic network is made up of 100
embassies, 38 consulates and seven missions as of last March.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus up 91.8 Percent in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
in November increased 91.8 percent from a year earlier to 1,282.3
billion yen (about 9.64 billion U.S. dollars), the Finance
Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry attributed the November increase to the decline in
imports and the services account deficit.
</P>
<P>
The November rise made it almost certain that, after three
consecutive years of decline, the politically sensitive current
account surplus for all of 1997 will exceed that of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Exports increased 6.1 percent to 4,093.3 billion yen (about
30.78 billion U.S. dollars), while imports declined 5.0 percent to
2,844.6 billion yen (about 21.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In goods and services trading in November Japan registered a
surplus of 879.8 billion yen (about 6.6 billion U.S. dollars), up
187.6 percent from a year before, the ministry said in a
preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in merchandise trade grew 44.6 percent to 1,248.7
billion yen (about 9.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In service trade, including tourism, Japan posted a deficit of
368.9 billion yen (about 2.77 billion U.S. dollars), down from the
557.5 billion yen (about 4.19 billion U.S. dollars) deficit of a
year earlier.

The current account balance measures the flow of goods and
services as well as investment and other monetary
transfers.

BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The northern Chinese city of
Tangshan, where more than 240,000 people died as a result of a
devastating earthquake on July 28, 1976, is now helping the
victims of another earthquake in the same province, Hebei.
</P>
<P>
Shangyi and Zhangbei counties were hit by a magnitude 6.2
earthquake on January 10, leaving 49 dead, over 2,000 injured, and
over 150,000 houses damaged. Shortly afterwards, the local
government of Tangshan began to ask people and institutions to
make relief donations.
</P>
<P>
The city has so far sent more than a million yuan worth of
relief, including 110,000 items of cotton-padded clothing and
quilts and more than 50 tons of food.
</P>
<P>
Tangshan's New District, which was built on the ruins of the
1976 quake, has donated hundreds of tents, two tons of rice, two
tons of flour, 1,000 items of down clothing, and a truck-load of
medicines.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> EEB Disappointed With UK Presidency Work Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Environmental
Bureau (EEB) Wednesday expressed its disappointment with Britain's
European Union (EU) presidency work program for the environment.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said it was disappointed that the British
government takes as its starting point the union's minimal
objective of an 8-percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
It said the more radical target, a 15-percent reduction EU
proposed at the beginning of last month's Kyoto climate change
conference, should be maintained.
</P>
<P>
The EEB also said it expected to find in the British work
program an initiative for ecological taxation and public transport.
</P>
<P>
The British presidency program was criticized for the absence
of a draft document on strategic environmental impact assessment
which the EEB takes as a test for the British government's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
"We also see it as essential that environmental considerations
are at the heart of the discussions from the outset on the reform
of the common agricultural and structural funds policies," said
EEB Secretary General John Hontelez.
</P>
<P>
The bureau, however, reacted favorably toward the British
government's plans during its six-month presidency of the EU
council of ministers to work toward a better integration of the
environment into other community policies.
</P>
<P>
The EEB also suggested focusing on environment-related issues
such as the follow-up to the Kyoto conference on climate change,
the environmental aspects of EU enlargement to central and eastern
Europe, a strategy for biodiversity, sustainable transport and
further emission reductions to curb air pollution.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Produce 51-53 Million Tons of Unhusked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
predicted that unhusked rice production in the 1997/98 planting
season will reach some 51 million to 53 million tons, an increase
of about 4 to 7 percent from last year's 49.3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"To date, some 2.6 million hectares of rice fields had been
planted," Agriculture Minister Sjarifuddin Baharsjah said here
Wednesday after meeting with President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
He said that rainfall in rice-production areas like West Java
this month has been normal, a situation ensuring that yield would
be good.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the country's acreage of rice fields
will be increased in stages to reach up to 11 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
On the import of rice carried out by the country's logistics
agency, Baharsjah said the move is prudent as it aims to ensure
there is enough rice stock for the people.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Indonesia imported about one million tons of rice
from Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan and India.

HAIKOU, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A national conference of
directors of drought and flood-control departments in China opened
today in Haikou, the capital of China's island province of Hainan.

In a written instruction to the conference, Vice-Premier Jiang
Chunyun, a member of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee Political Bureau, praised the departments for their
contributions in dealing with last year's disasters.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China had severe droughts and floods but had a good
harvest in spite of them, contributing to economic development and
social stability. Jiang went on to ask departments to do an even
better job in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the conference, Water Resources Minister Niu
Maosheng said that 1997 was unusual in water conservation work,
because both the Three Gorges and Xiaolangdi projects, the two
largest dam projects in China, had succeeded in their work.
</P>
<P>
Last year also saw the founding of the Water Conservation Fund
and the adoption of the Law on Flood Control and water
conservation policies, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, local flood and drought-control authorities
need to be prepared for possible major flooding and droughts near
the Yangtze, Yellow, Haihe and Huaihe rivers.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Keeps Fireworks Ban For Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital won't lift
its ban on fireworks during this year's Spring Festival, the
Chinese lunar new year, the municipal government announced today.
</P>
<P>
There have been rumors in Beijing that the government would
loosen its controls on fireworks, which have been in effect since
1993, for the holiday, which falls on January 28 this year.
</P>
<P>
Ji Shijian, a municipal government engineer, said today that
the rumors are absolutely groundless, and that there will be no
changes this year. He said a survey of 80,000 Beijing residents
prior to the ban, found that 86 percent approved of it.
</P>
<P>
The number of people injured by fireworks during the
five-to-seven-day holidays, fell from over 540 in 1993 to 86 in
1997, and the number of fire alarms went from 238 to 166. The
amount of noise at midnight of New Year's Eve has also gone down
sharply to 54.2 decibels from 92.
</P>
<P>
But, the municipal government will designate a number of sites
in suburban areas for fireworks and will organize fireworks
displays in some places.
</P>
<P>
Fireworks have been an indispensable part of Chinese
celebrations for thousands of years, and are believed by some to
be able to drive away demons, but they have been banned in most
large and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who sets off fireworks in Beijing can be fined up to 500
yuan (about 60 US dollars).

<HEADLINE> HK Takes Measures to Maintain World Shipping Center Status (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the session, Ip also gave specific data to indicate that
Hong Kong still maintains the status as an international shipping
center.
</P>
<P>
He said that apart from being the busiest container port in the
world for six successive years, Hong Kong also sees a large number
of ocean-going and river trade vessels entering and leaving every
year with the number of voyages totaling 500,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
The shipowners and shipping companies of Hong Kong have in
their possession or control ocean-going vessels (including those
registered overseas) with dead weight tons (DWT) up to 55 million
tons, accounting for eight percent of the total tonnage in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 shipping and related companies operate in Hong Kong,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, "our independent shipping register, though having a
short history of seven years, has already gained recognition from
the shipping industry as being one of the best internationally and
has a total fleet of 488 vessels at present".
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong's superiority in comparison with the shipping
centers in other countries and regions, Ip said the most important
advantage of Hong Kong is that "we have many experienced
shipowners who control a high international fleet based in Hong
Kong."
</P>
<P>
They have not only made significant contributions to the
development of Hong Kong as an international shipping center, but
also provided favorable conditions for future development.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said being an international shipping center, Hong
Kong has a simple tax regime with low tax rates and provides

<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese health workers plan to
provide a booklet with information on sex and the acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) as part of an education campaign.
</P>
<P>
The book will be available in June and tried out by some
middle school teachers in September, according to Sun Jiangping,
deputy director of Beijing Medical University's Children's Health
Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
The institute, which will cooperate with the State Education
Commission on the book, does not believe that they are ready to
provide these books directly to children, and that teachers need
to be trained because the AIDS situation in China is critical.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health announced last week that 8,303 HIV cases
had been detected by the end of October, ten percent of them in
people younger than 18. And, because of drug abuse and
prostitution, it is estimated that the real number of cases in
China is between 150,000 and 200,000, and that is expected to grow.
</P>
<P>
A major part of prevention is getting people to avoid risky
behavior, Sun said, emphasizing that schools should play an active
role in this.
</P>
<P>
Education authorities have asked middle schools to provide
information about sexually transmitted, but there is no national
textbook, Sun says.

<HEADLINE> Pak Economy Improved despite Difficult conditions: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Despite a shortfall against
revenue target and slow industrial growth, the economy responded
in a positive manner, recording an improvement of 1.6 billion U.S.
dollars in external balance in the first half of the current
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, Finance
Minister Sartaj Aziz said that during the first six months,
government bank borrowing amounted to 26 billion rupees (590
million dollars) against the target of 48 billion rupees (1.1
billion dollars) while it was at 68 billion rupees (1.55 billion
dollars) in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Giving details of the positive features in the first half
fiscal year, the Finance Minister said, the External Current
Account Deficit recorded a net improvement of 1.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
This included an improvement of 600 million dollars in the
trade deficit, increase in remittances by 300 million dollars and
a raise of 550 million dollars in the Foreign Currency Accounts
(FCA).
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit in the first six months of 1997-98 fiscal
year was 1.1 billion dollars compared with 1.7 billion dollars
over the same period last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange reserves has increased from 722 million
dollars in November 1996 to 1.2 billion dollars in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Minister claimed that the government has been successful
in curbing the inflation rate which had been running at a double
digit rate of 11 to 13 percent in the past four years while it has
slowed down to an annualized rate of 8.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said, despite difficult situations both on the
internal and external sides, the growth prospective remained
positive.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Pakistan will achieve the growth target of
five to 5.5 percent required by the International Monetary Fund
though "we may not be able to achieve the set target of 6%
growth."
</P>
<P>
Sartaj Aziz said the agriculture sector is expected to achieve
the target growth rate of five percent in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
However, cotton production will be reduced by one million bales
and less than the last year's 9.4 million bales due to the
unprecedented rains in October 1997, said the Minister.
</P>
<P>
The higher support price coupled with other incentives are
expected to push the production of wheat to a record level of 19
million tons, compared to 16.65 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
While the growth rates are negative in a number of industries,
the growth rates have turned positive in a number of important
industries, he added.
</P>
<P>
The banking reforms, Aziz said, made good progress in terms of
reducing administrative expenditure, recovery of stuck-up loans
and improving efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The availability of credit to the private sector was ahead of
the target of 54 billion rupees (1.2 billion dollars) for the
first six months of the current fiscal year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Karachi Stock Exchange 100-index, which was 1486 on November
11, 1996, and improved to a record 2056 on October 21, 1997. "It
has, however, received setback during the current month due to the
upheaval in regional markets. This is a temporary phenomena," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Regarding lessons from the financial crisis of the countries of
South East Asian region, Sartaj Aziz said, the economic
fundamentals of these countries were still good and it was
primarily the problems in the banking sector which dragged them
into the present crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Minister, therefore, observed that if the banking
reforms remained healthy and corporate sector show positive signs,
"You can avoid the risk."
</P>
<P>
The Finance Minister termed the debt as the major problem, but
said there was some relief for the government as far as domestic
debt is concerned.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said, the total foreign debt now stands at 30
billion dollars and reduction of three to five billion would
substantially ease the pressure.

<HEADLINE> Steps Taken to Prevent Cholera's Outbreak in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Minister of Health
Bincent Biruta today announced a package of hygienic measures
aimed at countering the outbreak of cholera that is gripping
Rwanda's neighbors, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
These measures include the maintenance of hygienic standards
in households, hotels and restaurant, and the banning of the
selling of non-properly packed food items.
</P>
<P>
Biruta said the country faces a serious threat of cholera
epidemic since it has already created havoc in neighboring
Tanzania, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
"Since we have similar food habits, same manners, the same
hygienic problems, it is fear that cholera might break out here
too," Biruta told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Biruta urged Rwandans to respect instructions given, otherwise
the country might face the same tragedy as its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports show that in Tanzania for instance, over 8,700
cases with 500 deaths have been registered since October 1997,
while in Uganda 1,400 cases have been depicted in Kampala, and
2,600 others in other regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
The reports of cholera outbreak in Kisangani in neighboring
Democratic Congo has increased fears that Rwanda will not be
spared.
</P>
<P>
So far, only a few cases of cholera have been registered in
some neighborhoods of the Rwandan capital Kigali.
</P>
<P>
"Two people have so far died here," Biruea said, explaining
that a crisis committee regrouping the government's officials and
different aid agencies has been established to monitor the
situation.

<HEADLINE> US Ambassador to Cairo Urges Confidence in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- New U.S. Ambassador to Egypt
Daniel Kurtzer Wednesday urged more confidence in the future of
the Mideast peace process despite the current difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Kurtzer made the appeal at his first press conference since
arriving here ten days ago to replace his predecessor Edward
Walker who has been appointed U.S. ambassador to Israel.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite important that parties involved in the Mideast
peace process remain confident that the current obstacles can be
overcome and (the peace process) make progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is especially important to restart peace
process on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks as quickly as possible
so that a more comprehensive peace process can move forward.
</P>
<P>
The veteran diplomat also called for the adoption of an
attitude to "look forward as well as look back" when passing
judgement on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We have to put in context where we are now (by examining) how
far we have come," Kurtzer said, mentioning the situation that
things were less in shape than nowadays when the peace process was
first started several years ago.
</P>
<P>
He characterized as "of great importance" the meetings
U.S. President Bill Clinton to hold with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat later this month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. would offer proposals on having talks between
the Palestinians and Israelis that focus on accelerating the final
status talks, a time-out on the Israeli settlement activities on
the ground, implementation of Israel's further troop redeployment
and ensuring security for all the people in the region.
</P>
<P>
"But there are still some difficult decisions required from the
two sides," said the U.S. ambassador, expressing hope that talks
on all the four issues could be moved ahead instead of activating
just one side and one part.
</P>
<P>
His words came just a day after Israel decided not to carry out
a troop pullback in the West Bank until the PLO meets commitments
made a year ago in a U.S.-brokered document, primarily to combat
terrorism and revise the Palestinian National Charter that calls
for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Denying any deterioration in ties between Cairo and Washington,
Kurtzer vowed to strengthen the strategic partnership and
alliance. Kurtzer, a Jew, has been in his diplomatic career for
21 years, including two years' service in the U.S. Embassy in
Cairo since 1979 and five years' service at Embassy in Israel
since 1982.
</P>
<P>
Back to Washington, he was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary
for Near Eastern Affairs in 1989, with responsibility for the
Mideast peace process and U.S. relations with Israel, Egypt,
Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians.

LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) - The British unemployment rate
continued to fall in December to its lowest level in 17
years, according to official figures released here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of people out of work and claiming benefits reached
1,411,200. The decline for the month of December numbered 28,700.
The figures have been declining for 22 consecutive months.

showed that average earnings increased by 4.75 percent last year
up to November, a rise of 0.25 percent on the revised rate for
October.
</P>

Economists here believe the stronger than expected earnings
growth is bound to revive speculation that the Bank of England
will raise interest rates next month.

<HEADLINE> HK Takes Measures to Maintain World Shipping Center Status (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A series of measures are
being implemented to strengthen Hong Kong's position as an
international shipping center.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Ip Shu-Kwan, secretary for economic services, made the
remarks in a reply to a question on whether there are any plans to
consolidate Hong Kong's position as an international shipping
center at a Plenary Session of the Provisional Legislative Council
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, he said that an exercise is under way to review and
simplify the shipping registration fees and procedures so as to
reduce the costs to ship owners and attract more vessels to
register in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, "we are actively studying the proposal of the Hong
Kong Shipowners Association, which seeks to improve our freight
tax arrangements and alleviate local shipping companies of their
tax burden overseas."
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, he said: "we are considering holding promotional
activities overseas to encourage more overseas shipping companies
to set up offices here," together with the Hong Kong Shipowners
Association and the Trade Development Council.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, to meet the need arising from Hong Kong's port
modernization process, the scope and mode of operation of the Hong
Kong Seamen's Training Center are being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to encourage more young people to join the shipping
industry through the offering of new courses," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fifthly, "we are lobbying some of the international maritime
organizations and associations such as the Asian Shipowners Forum
to set up their respective secretariats here, and bring together
the shipowners associations in Asia to consider the feasibility of
setting up an insurance market for vessels in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that these measures can attract more vessels to
register here to further strengthen our position as an
international shipping center," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Develops New Amino Acid Fertilizer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A new non-toxic, pollution-free
amino acid fertilizer developed on the island province of Hainan
is now being used in other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
The product was developed by scientists at the Hainan Shenlong
Amino Acid Fertilizer Company. It contains 18 types of amino acid
needed by plants and various trace elements like nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium.
</P>
<P>
Because the amino acids can be absorbed by plants without
photosynthesis, the fertilizer is more efficient and can be used
as a substitute for chemical fertilizers that deplete the soil and
affect plant species through overuse, and crop output can increase
15 percent to 20 percent at no greater cost.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Ministry scientists say the fertilizer could
improve the quality of species, soil, and the ecology, while
increasing output.
</P>
<P>
A fertilizer factory with an annual production capacity of
30,000 ton's has already been set up in Jiangsu Province's
Kunshan, and the Agriculture Ministry has approved a Beijing plant
that can produce 300,000 tons of amino acid fertilizer each year,
and plants in the cities of Guangzhou and Chengdu.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Makes Efforts to Solve Layoff Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam urged his cabinet Wednesday to pass a bill that would
implement mass layoffs in order to meet stringent conditions tied
to an international Monetary Fund (IMF) rescue loan of 57 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bill will be submitted to an extraordinary session of the
National Assembly (parliament) next Thursday. Mass layoffs are
expected to start within the ailing financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from labour unions, business and politics will also
meet on the same day to discuss the issue of forthcoming
large-scale unemployment.
</P>
<P>
President-elect Kim Dae-jung, who is to be sworn in as
president in February, voiced optimism that the issue will soon be
solved. His power takeover team and labour leaders are edging
closer to an agreement and a comprehensive solution.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus appealed to
South Korea to legalize mass layoffs in order to restore the
nation's financial credibility, which is essential to the influx
of foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the 11th largest economy in the world, is
suffering from an economic crisis produced by political corruption
scandals, bankruptcies of conglomerates and bad loans by financial
institutions since late 1997. As a result, the country's per
capita income has dropped to 9,400 U.S. dollars from the previous
10,548 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the crisis will worsen this year as the country,
under an agreement with the IMF, will have to open its financial
markets completely, shut down ailing financial institutions and
restructure its economy.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Again Bans Work of American-Led UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 14 (Xinhua) -- For a second day, Iraq
Wednesday again refused to allow an U.N. arms inspection team
headed by Scott Ritter, an American, to carry out their
inspections.
</P>
<P>
Ritter Wednesday told reporters that the Iraqi government had
decided to provide no Iraqi companions for his team, and that
this refusal means that his team would be unable to carry out any
inspections.
</P>
<P>
He added that he had no other option but to delay arms
inspections in Iraq, and that he would submit a relevant report to
Richard Butler, head of the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) on dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, who is
due to visit Baghdad next Monday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the UNSCOM Baghdad Constant Surveillance and
Verification Center announced that the other UNSCOM inspection
teams carried out their missions Wednesday as usual, accompanied
by some Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Iraq decided to stop any arms inspections by the
UNSCOM team led by Ritter starting from Tuesday, announcing that
it would block the inspections of the team until the team is
recomposed through a balanced participation by permanent members
of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has accused Ritter, a former U.S. Marine captain, as a
spy, and criticized the team, with nine Americans, five Britons, a
Russian and an Australian, for not being balanced in composition.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi move is again setting the country in a collision
course with the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Iraq ordered the expulsion of the U.S. inspectors on November
13 in its last standoff with UNSCOM. The Americans were allowed to
return, together with their colleagues who then pulled out to
protest the eviction, only after Russian mediation a week later.

<P>
LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) - Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto Wednesday appealed to British people for their
forgiveness for Japan's maltreatment of British prisoners in World
War II.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's edition of The Sun, Hashimoto repeated the "deep
remorse and heartfelt apology for the tremendous damage and
suffering of that time," which he told British Prime Minister Tony
Blair during Blair's visit to Japan earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
"This will not bring back the dead, but I hope the British
people will see it in the spirit in which it is intended, one of
reconciliation and peace and hope for the future." said Hashimoto
in the biggest-selling daily of Britain.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto stressed that the ties between Japan and Britain have
grown close since 1945, saying "we have shared commitment to
peace and democracy."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ducks, Chickens Might Be Segregated to Prevent Avian Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government is
actively exploring the possibility of segregating ducks and
chickens as a way to prevent the spread of the H5N1 virus, or the
bird flu, an official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Acting Administrative Secretary Michael Suen confirmed that the
government had received the surveillance results on poultry from
Hong Kong University.
</P>
<P>
The results indicated that ducks on local farms were not
infected with the H5N1 virus, but some samples of chickens, ducks
and geese collected at markets before the year-end slaughter
exercise were positive of the virus, Suen noted.
</P>
<P>
According to scientists, infected chickens are amplifying host
and will develop disease and die. But there is little risk of
infected ducks dying of this infection since they are only
intermittent carriers.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the differences between chickens and ducks to this
virus, the Government Task Force on H5N1 has drawn a preliminary
conclusion that no killing of ducks at local farms is necessary at
this stage," Suen said.
</P>
<P>
But, to protect public health, the government is considering a
number of options to ensure that live chickens and ducks are
handled separately at all levels, he continued.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary view is that live chickens should be allowed to
reach retail outlet for slaughtering on purchase, but live ducks
should not, the official explained, adding the task force is
exploring a number of options on how to handle ducks to achieve an
effective segregation from chickens.

<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji told a
national banking conference Tuesday afternoon that he is confident
the yuan, the Chinese currency, will remain stable, and that will
contribute to the stability of other Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that this year China's economy will maintain its rapid
growth, with GDP expected to grow by more than eight percent, and
price increases kept slower.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the devaluation of Southeast Asian
currencies could pose severe challenges to China's exports and
influx of foreign funds, China's exports have their own unique
advantages and competitiveness and can meet these challenges.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is politically stable, and with its strong
currency, every-improving investment environment, and lowered
import duties, China will become an Asian center of overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, China's foreign debt structure is
rational, with over 85 percent of the debt in medium- and long-term
loans, and a repayment and debt ratio far below the international
danger line. China's international balance of payments will
maintain its surplus.

<P>
He said that China's economy in 1997 was the best since the
country began its reforms and opening up and progress was made in
the shift from a planned economy to a socialist market
economy. It has gone from "high growth, high inflation" to "high
growth, low inflation".
</P>
<P>
The market has become a buyers' market, he said, and both grain
and foreign exchange reserves are at their highest level ever,
providing good conditions for sustained and rapid economic
development.
</P>
<P>
China has found new growth areas in its economy, which include
agriculture, water conservancy, railways, highways, technological
improvements, new and high-tech industries, and residential
housing, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also discussed the turmoil Asian countries suffered in the
second half of last year and expressed confidence that the steps
they've taken to deal with the monetary crisis will have the
expected results and Asia's will remain the most dynamic economy
in the world.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) adopted effective measures to maintain its economic and
monetary stability and has a quite rational economic structure, a
stringent monetary monitoring system, and sufficient foreign
exchange reserves to withstand monetary risks.
</P>
<P>
He said the central government supports all the measures
adopted by the SAR government to stablize its financial market,
including pegging the HK dollar to the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
He said that financial work in 1998 should be directed by Deng
Xiaoping Theory and the spirit of the 15th Party Congress. An
effort should be made to accelerate financial reforms, tighten
supervision by the central bank, and establish a modern monetary
management system.

</P>
<P>
The 100-stock Composite Index moved between a low of 530.21 in
the morning and a high of 545.35 in mid-afternoon, before ending

<HEADLINE> NGO Slams Italy for Detaining Somali Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A local human rights
organization has condemned the detention of a Somali man by the
Italian police in Rome for his alleged involvement of murder.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ismail Jumale Human Rights Center (Dr. IHRC) said Tuesday
that the detention of Hashi Omar Hassan is part of a plot by the
Italian government to block the human rights violations committed
by the Italian UNOSOM forces during their operation in Somalia in
1993-94.
</P>
<P>
According to the Italian police, Hassan was among seven Somali
gunmen who allegedly ambushed and killed Elaria Alpi and her
video cameraman working for RAI in March 1994 in North Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The detention of Hassan is contrary to the reason of his
invitation to Italy, said Hassan Shire Sheikh, one of the
co-chairpersons of Dr. IHRC.
</P>
<P>
The center expressed concern that the detainee won't have a
fair trial in Italy and has called on the Italian authorities to
immediately issue, if there are any, charges against Hassan in a
neutral country.
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that the Italian army officers who were
confirmed guilty in violating the basic human rights of some
Somali citizens are still free in Italy," said Shire Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
"The investigative committee has got evidence for cases of
killing, rape and torture in North Mogadishu, Balad and Mahadday
areas of Somalia. However, they failed to bring any of the
accused to the justice," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dr. IHRC said Hassan and his 10 other colleagues including a
woman who were taken from Mogadishu to Italy four days ago are
now in a military camp in the town of Livorno of Italy.
</P>
<P>
The Italian appointed investigative committee is expected to
enquire the 11 Somalis. However, some of them are reported to
have refused to testify the human rights violations unless their
fellow friend, Hassan, is released.
</P>
<P>
The legal advisor of the Somalis in Italy, Hassan Duale, said
they will no longer cooperate with the investigative committee if
the accusations against Hassan are not made clear before the
courts very soon.
</P>
<P>
Hassan told the journalists before his departure from
Mogadishu that he's the only survivor of a group of seventeen
Somalis allegedly drowned in the Indian Ocean by the Italian
armed forces in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"We were tied up at the back together with ropes and sacks of
sand before we were thrown into the sea," said Hassan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The snow that has fallen in
Beijing since yesterday afternoon has made the air crisp and
clean, but has increased the number of traffic accidents and
problems.
</P>
<P>
Urban traffic department officials say that by two this
afternoon, they had received about 700 reports of traffic
accidents, most of them minor ones caused by icy conditions, and
no serious accidents or traffic fatalities have been reported.
</P>
<P>
However, six major highways, including those from Beijing to
Tianjin and Beijing to Shijiazhuang, have been closed temporarily.
</P>
<P>
The snow has not delayed any flights at Capital Airport, as
workers rapidly cleared the ice and snow from the runways.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists say the snow will end tomorrow, by which time
there is expected to be an accumulation of five centimeters. The
amount of snowfall in the city proper is now four
centimeters. Temperatures in Beijing tomorrow will be two to three
degrees below zero Centigrade at the most.
</P>
<P>
Li Futing, of the Beijing Meteorology Bureau, says that when
the snow stops, cold and windy weather will set in and will
probably last a week, and snow will remain on most streets for
awhile.

JAKARTA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have agreed to increase the use of
their currencies in regional tourism transactions in a bid to
reduce dependence on the US dollar, a senior official here said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during the first ministerial meeting
of the ASEAN Tourism Forum (ATF) held recently in the Philippines,
Antara News Agency reported Wednesday quoting Minister of Tourism,
Post and Telecommunications Joop Ave as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN groups Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the
Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos.
</P>
<P>
He also said the agreement was not expressed in a memorandum of
understanding, but in an understanding followed by a plan of
action.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, he said, will require an ASEAN member to accept
the currencies of other members as payment for transactions in
tourism.
</P>
<P>
He did not say when the agreement will be put into effect.
</P>
<P>
The present monetary turmoil, which has hit a number of ASEAN
countries and caused their currencies to slide against the US
dollar, has promoted the ASEAN to increase the use of their
currencies in the region to reduce their dependence on the US
dollar, he added.

PARIS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The unemployed of France once again demonstrated in several
cities on Tuesday. Faced with the determination of the protesters,
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin firmly ordered his cabinet ministers to
maintain solidarity of the government and asked the protesters to
``be respectful of the social rules and the law.''
</P>
<P>
-- The plan by Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the European Commissioner
in charge of finance, to run in the regional election in Bretagne in
France has been strongly criticized by British and American
newspapers, which said that a European commissioner cannot have
``any other occupation'' during his mandate. The Wall Street Journal
Europe further pointed out that Silguy is ``not the only one in the
French elite who think that rules are only applied to small men.''
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac met on Tuesday mayors from 12 cities
-- nine of them from the Paris region -- which are faced with the
problem of insecurity. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
announced an innovation of his policy on cities. Among the measures
to be taken by the government are the creation of a state secretary
in charge of cities, and a plan to promote social integration in
cities which will be presented to the parliament in February.
</P>
<P>
-- Five French employers' associations Tuesday ``solumnly''
warned the Socialist government against the negative consequences
that could result from the reduction of work week time to 35 hours,
as is planned by the government for the year 2000. Apparently
irritated by the demand from the bosses, Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin replied that if the bosses stop laying off workers, he will
stop the 35 hour work week plan.

<P>
CAIRO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
left here Wednesday for Damascus, Syria, on a few hours' visit
during which he will meet with Syrian leaders on Middle East peace
process, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks will deal with the recent developments of the Middle
East peace process and efforts exerted to salvage it out of its
impasse.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is accompanied by a delegation including Prime Minister
Kamal el-Ganzouri, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, and ministers of
information, economy, international cooperation and industry.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's unannounced visit came a day after Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad told visiting French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine that Syria was ready to resume peace talks with Israel
from the point where they left off with the former Israeli
government.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad also encouraged an effective French and European role
in the region that would help achieve a just and comprehensive
peace.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks have been put on ice since February
1996. Syria has conditioned the resumption of talks on a full
return of the occupied Golan Heights as promised by the former
Israeli Labor government, a request the incumbent Likud government
has rejected.

<P>
ZHANGBEI (Hebei Province), January 14 (Xinhua) -- The
earthquake that rocked a village in China's Hebei Province last
Saturday did not keep a young couple from marrying here today in
the falling snow and the debris.
</P>
<P>
The bride, An Yulian, and her boyfriend He Rubin had already
set the date for January 14, but the earthquake destroyed their
village and left them homeless.
</P>
<P>
But, when People Liberation Army (PLA) troops who were doing
rescue work there heard their story, the soldiers offered to help
by putting up a tent for them last night and gave the couple a
padded quilt, a woollen blanket, and a framed mirror as wedding
gifts.
</P>
<P>
"This is the most important day of my life and I owe all this
to the (Chinese Communist) Party, the government, and the PLA
soldiers," An said, to which her husband added, "The warmth we
have received will encourage us to rebuild our homes with our own
hands."
</P>
<P>
The magnitude 6.2 quake, that hit Zhangbei and Shangyi counties
some 220 kilometers northwest of Beijing, the Chinese capital,
left 49 people dead, more than 10,000 injured, and some 150,000
houses collapsed or walls cracked.

BRUSSELS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Germany
along with England, Italy and Spain were given a boost as they
were to be drawn into five-team instead of six-team preliminary
groups at the 2000 European Soccer Championship.
</P>
<P>
Scotland, Yugoslavia, Romania, Russia and Norway were also
seeded teams as 49 of UEFA's 51 members will be drawn into nine
groups for the 2000 championship which will be held for the first
time in history in two countries.
</P>
<P>
Belgium and the Netherlands are exempt from the draw as
co-hosts while Bosnia and Andorra will be competing for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
Only one of the five other seeds will be drawn into a five-team
group whereas the remaining four will be drawn into six-team
groups, according to the organizing committee of the 2000
championship.
</P>
<P>
Johan Cruyff of the Netherlands and Paul van Himst of Belgium
will represent the co-hosts and help make the draw that will be
held on Sunday in the Belgian city of Gent.
</P>
<P>
The nine group winners plus the best runner-up from the
round-robin preliminary tournament will join co-hosts Belgium and
the Netherlands in the grand finale.
</P>
<P>
They are to be later joined by the four teams that win the
two-legged playoffs between the eight other runners-up from the

</P>
<P>
The qualifying tournament starts in September 1998 and ends in
October 1999
</P>

Four quarter-finalists from the previous championship did not

Republic and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
France is the most notable absentee from the seeding list.
UEFA Secretary General Gerhard Aigner said last month: "The
seedings were based on the co-efficient used for the World Cup in
the United States in 1994, Euro1996 and qualifying for
France1998. As France did not compete in the United States nor
need to qualify for the World Cup finals in France, there was no

<HEADLINE> Annan Suggests Extending UN Observers' Tenure in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today suggested extending the tenure of the U.N.
observation mission in Angola for another three months.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan asked to keep the
U.N. observation mission in Angola till the end of April and at
the same time cut down the number of its officials, military
personnel, observers and police from 2,100 to 1,200.
</P>
<P>
The decision to send the observation team on the basis of the
third UN Angola Inspection Mission, was made in late October
1997. The tenure of the team was scheduled to end by January 31,
1998.
</P>
<P>
The delays in carrying out the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol is
said to be the reason for Annan's new suggestion for extending
the stay of the UN observers in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The UN head said that there should be a mutual trust
atmosphere in Angola so that the peace process can proceed in an
enabling environment.
</P>
<P>
Annan demanded that the Angolan government and the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) make greater
efforts for earlier realization of peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he was happy that UNITA has decided to move its
headquarters from Bailundo and Andulo to Luanda and that UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi will soon meet Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos, noting that the summit would help consolidate national
reconciliation and democracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
He called on UNITA to continue its effort to turn itself into
an un-armed political party.

ABU DHABI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The oil slick resulting from
the sinking of an oil barge in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
waters last Wednesday has spread across at least 40 kilometers of
the Gulf country's coastline.
</P>
<P>
UAE's authorities related to the clean-up task have been told
to spread booms across the entire area to stop the slick which has
polluted four of the UAE's seven emirates, the UAE's Wam news

The barge which is lying on its bottom at a depth of about 20
meters has 30 tanks.
</P>
<P>
The oil spill has highlighted the need for water conservation
and the UAE government has urged residents near the polluted

<HEADLINE> New AmCham Chairman Vows to Promote HK's Competitiveness and U.S.-China Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Jeffrey Muir, new chairman of
the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (AmCham), said here
Wednesday that the first of his three top objectives to accomplish
in 1998 is to promote Hong Kong's competitiveness as an
international business center.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his first address as AmCham Chairman at a special
inaugural luncheon, Muir highlighted two aspects of the
competitiveness issue in 1998 -- trimming the costs of doing
business in Hong Kong and maintaining the pegged exchange rate
between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"Survey after survey shows that AmCham's members believe that
the cost of doing business in Hong Kong is very high," Muir said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong must respond to the pressure of trimming costs
positively or risk that international business will seek lower
cost alternatives elsewhere in Asia, Muir said.
</P>
<P>
"It will be difficult to attract companies back once they have
left," he added.
</P>
<P>
AmCham agree with the SAR government's efforts to moderate real
estate costs by expanding land supply and increasing housing, Muir
said.
</P>
<P>
Effective management of the Hong Kong dollar peg is also
critical to maintain Hong Kong's competitiveness, Muir said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government's use of high interest rates to stave
off speculator against Hong Kong dollar has worked thus far, but
at the cost of substantial declines in the property and stock
markets, Muir said.
</P>
<P>
However, unpegging the Hong Kong dollar would unleash a
speculative attack on the currency from both outside and inside
Hong Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the peg, Hong Kong will have to suffer hardship for
a period of time, but it will defeat the speculators in the end,
Muir said.
</P>
<P>
The second issue related to Hong Kong's competitiveness is the
importance of diversity, Muir said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is a very Chinese city, but it is also a very
international city that has integrated selected Western styles and
practices into people's lives.
</P>
<P>
The evolution in Hong Kong's political and social environment
has greatly enhanced Hong Kong's competitiveness as a place to
live and do business in Asia, Muir said.
</P>
<P>
Muir said that the second of his three primary objectives in
his term is to encourage progress in China's World Trade
Organization (WTO) accession talks and to persuade the United
States' government to offer permanent most favored nation trading
status (MFN) for China.
</P>
<P>
The chamber, as well as American business in general, has
devoted tremendous resources to argue that renewal of China's MFN
status is in U.S. strategic interests, Muir said.
</P>
<P>
Ending the annual debate on whether to offer China MFN status
would provide a huge boost to bilateral relations and would allow
business, the Administration, and Congress to devote their
energies to more constructive pursuits, Muir said.
</P>
<P>
AmCham will try to achieve a more important objective -- to
help China obtain its accession to the WTO, Muir said. If
achieved, it will bring a host of benefits to American companies
doing business with China.
</P>
<P>
Muir said that his last objective is to expand local
participation in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
Without abandoning the chamber's commitment to promote American
business interests, AmCham must recognize that an increasing
number of its members are non-Americans, and that making AmCham
relevant to that group is critical for the chamber's long-term
success.
</P>
<P>
"We need to demonstrate that participation in the chamber helps
its Chinese members to better understand U.S. business interests
and policies, making them more effective in their jobs," Muir
said.
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Muir, external director of the Seagram Asia Pacific,
was elected to lead the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong,
the most influential American Chamber of Commerce outside the
United States, throughout 1998 at a general meeting held on
December 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Muir has been an active member of the American Chamber of
Commerce in Hong Kong since 1979.
</P>
<P>
He has served as vice chairman, vice president and governor as
well as chairman of the China Business Committee (1983, 1986),
Indochina Business Committee (1991) and Government Relations
Committee (1996).
</P>
<P>
Muir joined Seagram Asia Pacific in 1996 as the director of
external affairs for the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
A native New Yorker and Princeton University graduate in
Chinese Studies (1973), Muir has lived in Hong Kong since 1975.

<HEADLINE> Bus Fares Hike in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 14 (Xinhua) -- South Koreans here are to feel
another squeeze from the depreciation of won as the city
government planned to increase bus fares by more than 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul Metropolitan Government announced Wednesday that the
fare of an ordinary bus will jump to 500 won (about 26 U.S. cents)
from 430 won, beginning from Thursday, due to the leap in
petroleum prices following won's sharp depreciation against the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The city government said the fare of a deluxe bus is to rise to
1,000 won form 850 won while the fares for junior and senior high
school students will be 340 won and primary school students, 200
won.
</P>
<P>
At late night, the fares of luxury and airport coaches are to
grow to 1,100 won from 1,000 won.
</P>
<P>
More and more South Koreans are using the public transport
system in the wake of the ongoing financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Seoul's intra-city buses and subway served more than 70 percent
of commuters last December while the number of cab and private car
users declined sharply.
</P>
<P>
South Korea relies heavily on oil imports to meet fuel demands.
</P>
<P>
The heating fuel is also expected to rise due to increasing oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
The country's briquette production rose 38.2 percent to 217,00
tons last December from the previous month's 157,000 tons,
according to the Korea Federation of Fuel Supply Cooperatives.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 14 (Xinhua)-- Visiting Greek President C.
Stephanopoulos Wednesday called for enhancing the existing
Indo-Greek economic and trade ties and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting organized by the Confederation of Indian
Industry (CII) here, the president, who came here Tuesday on a
7-day state visit to India, said that the level of economic
cooperation and trade flows his country had with India was less
than optimum and his country had identified many important fields
for profitable cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the identified fields included telecommunications,
foodstuffs, machinery, construction materials and pharmaceuticals,
etc.
</P>
<P>
"In order to increase our bilateral commerce, there should be
more mutual business visits and information on the possibilities
of the Greek and Indian economic cooperation as well as greater
participation in the international fairs organized in the two
countries," he said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Beginning from the end of
this month, people can travel between Hong Kong and Shenzhen by
taking a non-stop express train, according to Kowloon-Canton
Railway Corporation (KCRC) officials.
</P>
<P>
KCRC has decided to start a temporary express service between
Hunghom, Kowloon, and Lowu which separates Hong Kong and Shenzhen
in Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The new non-stop train service was introduced because the
Kowloon-Canton Through Train service to Guangzhou has been delayed
and will not be operational until the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Passengers can complete immigration procedures at Hungkom and
use a special exit at Lowu to enter Shenzhen.

A newly-introduced model of train will double the passenger
seating capacity to 1,200 and shorten the 110-minute trip to
Guangzhou by 15 minutes when traveling at a speed of 160
kilometers an hour, KCRC officials said.

<HEADLINE> 51 Taliban Killed in Plane Crash: Taliban Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 51 Taliban,
including six crew members, on board a Russian-made plane were
killed when the aircraft crashed late Tuesday night in Pakistan's
Balochistan Province.
</P>
<P>
This was told by Taliban Spokesman Abdul Rehman in the southern
Afghan city of Kandhar Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Rehman said all passengers on board the ill-fated plane were
Taliban who were going from Kandhar to Herat in the northwest. The
plane crashed because of the bad weather and diminishing fuel,
said the Taliban spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The dead bodies are being transported to Kandhar, he added.
</P>
<P>
Reports appearing on the local press Wednesday said as many as
80 people, most of them Afghan nationals, died during the plane
crash.
</P>
<P>
The Plane crashed at 10:30 p.m. (local time) near Chaman, about
110 kilometers north of Quetta, provincial capital of Balochistan
due to inclement weather, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft took off from the Kandhar Airport in southern
Afghanistan for the northwest province of Herat Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
However, when it reached near destination, it could not land
due to inclement weather. The plane then returned to Kandhar, as
the weather of Kandhar was also foggy, it could not land there
either, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Later the pilot moved the plane towards Pakistan informing the
Quetta airport control about the situation and requested to allow
for emergency landing. The civil aviation authorities on an
information arranged emergency landing for the ill-fated passenger
carrier.
</P>
<P>
The plane was on its way to the Quetta airport when it crashed
in Khojak pass's hilly track because of darkness and cloudy
weather, killing all the passengers and crew.
</P>
<P>
The local authority in Chaman said Wednesday that they arranged
rescue teams immediately after getting the news and tried their
best to reach the spot. However, due to darkness and the rain,
they could not start relief operation.

<HEADLINE> Multinationals Help Transform China's State-owned Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, a leading industrial
base in north China, has used investment by multinationals to help
its large and medium-sized state-owned firms as an increasingly
important way of helping local economy, Vice-mayor Ye Disheng said.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin had an average of 3.38 billion US dollars worth of
overseas investment annually from 1993 to 1996, Ye said, and the
city is planning a complete overhaul of all medium-sized or large
companies in the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
The city is popular because of its good investment environment,
industrial production, labor resources, and market potential, Ye
explains.
</P>
<P>
Major multinationals like Republic of Korea's Samsung and the
LG Group, and the US's Otis Elevator and Motorola have cooperative
ventures with state-owned firms in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June of last year, 195 of these companies were
involved in 299 mechanical, automobile, electrical, chemical,
medicine, or communications project in Tianjin, at a total cost of
seven billion US dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
By drawing technologically-advanced and multinationals with
market savvy the city has developed a number of name-brand
products that do well on the international market.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the GDP has grown at more than 14 percent for
three consecutive years. The national average was 8.8 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The gross industrial output and pre-tax profits of
overseas-funded firms accounted for 43.2 percent and 52 percent of
the city's total, respectively in 1996, to which multinationals
contributed 90 percent and 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
Co-operation between domestic state-owned enterprises and
multinationals has greatly improved the city's foreign trade. It
had four billion US dollars in exports in 1996, and will surpass
five billion US dollars for 1997, Ye said. Exports of
overseas-funded firms have accounted for 60 percent of the city's
total, to which multinationals occupy 96.3 percent.

PERTH, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese swimmer Yuan Yuan and her

</P>
<P>
The local shares had rebounded on Tuesday, after a consecutive

<P>
NEW DELHI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral left here Wednesday afternoon for Dhaka to
participate in Bangladesh-India-Pakistan summit to enhance
economic and trade cooperation among the three countries.
</P>
<P>
There was a need to collectively visualize emergence of a
community of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC), and SAARC had already set a target for itself to move to
a free trade zone in the region by the year 2001, he told
reporters before his departure.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in 1985, embraces Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The three-nation summit was first proposed by Bangladesh Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina at the SAARC summit in Male, capital of the
Maldives, in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Gujral said that the three nations would review the progress
made so far and would discuss how to work out an agenda so that
free trade zone is achieved.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions, Gujral said that he would hold
separate talks with other two prime ministers on the sidelines of
the summit on bilateral relations.

BRUSSELS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana is expected to visit in the coming weeks several countries
interested in joining the western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the NATO headquarters said Wednesday that Solana
intends, during his trip to the three accession candidates of
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, to drop by Slovenia and
Slovakia in a gesture that NATO remains open to those who aspire
to join it.
</P>
<P>
Solana will kick off his promise-keeping trip next week.
</P>
<P>
The sources said NATO wanted to reassure its partners of the
serious nature of its open-door promise by continuing intensified

expansion of the western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
NATO has promised to remain open to further eastward expansion,
but there is no decision on any of the countries for the second
wave of the expansion. NATO is expected to review the issue at
its Washington Summit in the spring of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Panel to Boost Bilingual Legal System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the Justice
Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
government have outlined a plan to establish a high-level
committee to oversee the implementation of a fully bilingual legal
system in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Bilingualism is the department's long-term goal and the Chinese
language will be given equal emphasis, officials of the Department
said.
</P>
<P>
The committee is to address policy issues including the role of
Chinese and English in the legal system, the speed at which
bilingualism should proceed and training of law students.
</P>
<P>
It will be composed of representatives from the Department of
Justice, Legal Aid, the Education and Manpower Bureau, the
Official Language Agency, the legal profession and three lay
members to be appointed by SAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which is to be set up soon, will be chaired by
Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung Oi-sie.
</P>
<P>
And the translation of the laws into Chinese will be a top
priority, a provisional councilor said.
</P>
<P>
But experts, who spoke before the Provisional Legislative
Council panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services on
Tuesday, stressed that the role of a bilingual legal system is
more important than just translating laws. It should produce
original legislation in both English and Chinese, they
noted.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Provisional
Legislative Council has approved the creation of a permanent post
for a Chinese law expert in the Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
In proposing the new post of deputy government counsel, the
department's Legal Policy Division is aimed at coping with
increasing demand for expertise in laws of China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Legislative Council's Administration of Justice
and Legal Services panel was told on Tuesday that the need for
advice on mainland laws has considerably increased since the
handover.
</P>
<P>
Members of the public would seek advice when they have
misunderstandings about the legal system in China's mainland, said
Stephen Law, director of administration and development at the
China Law Unit.
</P>
<P>
The number of cases involving written advice on mainland laws
went up to 200 last year, compared with just 78 in the previous
year, and they involved mainland constitutional law as well as
criminal, family and nationality laws, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new officer will be answerable to the deputy solicitor
general and responsible for training counsels in mainland laws in
the Department of Justice.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The year 1997 was the wettest
year since records began in 1884, with rainfall amounting to
3,343.0 millimeters, the local press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The year's extremely heavy rainfall was 51 percent above normal
level and exceeded the previous record set in 1982, said the Hong
Kong Observatory.
</P>
<P>
It coincided with an exceptionally strong El Nino event in the
equatorial Pacific. The first tropic cyclone to affect Hong Kong
did not come until the last day of July, which was the latest in
any year on record, said the observatory.
</P>
<P>
The passage of Typhoon Victor on August 2 necessitated the
hoisting of the Increasing Gale or Storm Signal No. 9, which was
the highest warning signal since Typhoon Ellen in 1983.
</P>
<P>
The year's total duration of bright sunshine of 1,558.2 hours
was the shortest recorded. Also, the annual mean temperature was
23.4 degrees making 1997 the fourth warmest year on record.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Export Zone Delays Taking off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Shortage of investors has
delayed the commissioning of Nigeria's first and only export
processing zone, The Guardian paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Although more than 90 percent of the zone had been ready after
six years of construction, there were not enough foreign
investors for it to take off, Emmanuel Udugu, Minister of
Commerce and Tourism, complained.
</P>
<P>
At present, only two investors, one producing garments and the
other producing wood work, have installed their machines at the
zone.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 16 companies, both local and foreign, have received
the approval to invest at the zone, but they have not come to
start business, said Grace Ekanem, Commissioner of Commerce,
Tourism and Business Development.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister, who made an inspection to the zone last
weekend, promised that efforts to commission the project are
still going on.
</P>
<P>
The foundation stone of the project, located in southern
Nigeria's rivers state, was laid in November 1991. It had in the
past been slated for commissioning over six times but was later
canceled.
</P>
<P>
The zone was initially to be completed with 800 million Naira
(about 10 million U.S. Dollars) but by 1995, and now more than
3.4 billion Naira (43 million Dollars) had been spent.
</P>
<P>
A high-power delegation of the ministry recently visited some
Asian countries in a bid to canvass investors there.

SHIJIAZHUANG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- With a heavy snowfall over
north China's Zhangjiakou City, earthquake-relief supplies from
nearby cities rolled along a highway resembling a black belt to
Zhangbei and Shangyi counties.
</P>
<P>
At 5 a.m. today on the Zhangbei-Zhangjiakou section of the
state 207 highway, truck lights flashed in the dark. About every
five minutes, a truck with relief goods ran through Zhangjiakou
City and headed for the quake-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
By his truck headlights driver Li Mantang, who had just
returned from the disaster scene, counted the vehicles by their
license plates: "Zhangjiakou, Baoding, Beijing ...".
</P>
<P>
Li told reporters that the trucks he recognized were from a
dozen cities in north China.
</P>
<P>
The Traffic Police's patrol cars could be seen here and there
with red lights flashing. Sometimes, the police cars stopped at
the roadside and helped drivers restart failing engines.
</P>
<P>
Lu Qingguang, director of the Traffic Police Department of
Zhangjiakou City, said that more trucks are expected to arrive at
the quake-hit areas today despite the heavy snowfall.
</P>

BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Shao Yueling, 47, who formerly
worked as a clothing designer, found new positions for herself and
all colleagues declared redundant by a factory in north China's
Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Shao was one of over 100 workers who lost their jobs when the
unprofitable Renqiu Clothing Factory closed in early 1993. Shao
decided to help by signing a contract to operate the factory.
</P>
<P>
Hard work, improved efficiency and teamwork revived the
factory, with the factory earning a profit of 46,000 yuan by
finishing its first order in only four weeks, a task which
normally required six weeks.
</P>
<P>
Shao was appointed as deputy director of another Renqiu garment
factory in 1996, and all workers have since returned to
work. Shao's new factory has hired 36 new employees, many of
suffer from disabilities.
</P>
<P>
The People's Congress in the south China city of Guangzhou
introduced a special reemployment fund. The fund, set up with
an allocation of 50 million yuan, has provided effective
guarantees enabling the local government to implement the
reemployment project.
</P>
<P>
The city government has also allocated 7.2 million yuan from
the fund to provide job training for 8,000 laid-off workers, with
some 60 percent of the trainees finding new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Community employment organizations have been asked to introduce
new jobs to all people currently relying on the unemployment
relief fund on a cost-free basis over the next three
months. Related individuals can also receive either free or

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: China's 1998 Economy Witnesses Fast, Stable Beginning (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Xinhua Writer Zhou Zongmin
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China's economic locomotive,
fresh on the heels of a "soft landing" in 1997, is steaming ahead
on a fast-track robust rate of growth, with the year's GDP
expected to rise by eight percent.
</P>
<P>
The government and Chinese economists have expressed optimism
about this year's economic outlook, and fully expect the current
momentum of high growth and low inflation, the hallmark of
strength, to continue.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the State Planning Commission, State Statistical
Bureau and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences forecast a rate
of 1-2 percentage points higher than the government target.
</P>
<P>
However, this will depend on a number of factors. For
example, the fast pace of growth depends a great deal on fiscal
control levers, and the impact of international financial turmoil
cannot be underrated.
</P>
<P>
Central authorities have fully considered the restrictive
stance of the 1998 fiscal policy and appear unwilling to push this
year's economic growth rate above last year's level of 8.8
percent. They instead intend to pursue a healthy path which will
more easily promote structural optimization, raise efficiency and
promote the reform of state-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
Government sources say that China expects a desirable mixture
of growth, inflation, unemployment and deficit reduction -- four
major indicators of the national economy -- to strike the keynote
for 1998, the 20th anniversary of the reform and opening drive in
the world's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
This year's government plan calls for inflation rate to remain
within the range of three percent, despite a 1.2 percent hike in
prices for water and raw materials, The unemployment rate will
remain below 3.5 percent.

<P>
Growth in fixed asset investments, retail sales and exports --
key forces driving the national economy -- are in place and will
hopefully add handsomely to the economy. Fixed asset investments
and retail sales are targeted to jump by 10 percent this year,
with projections calling for exports to hit 8 percent. The budget
deficit is expected to fall by 10 billion yuan (approximately 8.3
yuan equals one US dollar).
</P>
<P>
Enterprise reforms continue to go forward, with forecasts
calling for increasing unemployment pressure and a surge in the
number of laid-off workers. The Chinese government has vowed to
launch massive reemployment programs to reduce the annual
unemployment rate to 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that China must extend great effort to ignite
the lukewarm buyer's market, nurture consumer satisfaction and
promote various poles of economic growth, burgeoning pillar
industries in particular. A bullish consumer market will be
pivotal to steady economic growth.
</P>
<P>
China's economy currently offers a solid footing for
sustainable growth, including beneficial factors such as easing
bottlenecks, savings deposits totalling 4,700 billion yuan, good
harests for three consecutive years, and foreign exchange reserves
of over 140 billion U.S dollars.
</P>
<P>
Forecasts for this year call for increased agricultural
production, a key element of inflation. China produced 490 million
tons of grain in 1997.

<P>
Foreign trade, an area which adds great vigor to the national
economy, stands out in view of modest demand on the domestic
market. Forecasts call for considerable growth in foreign trade
during 1998, with imports growing and exports slowing somewhat.
</P>
<P>
China's effort to open wider to the outside world has enabled
its economy to merge more extensively with the international
business community. At the same time, however, the nation is
becoming increasingly vulnerable to the outside environment.
</P>
<P>
Economists suggest that China should adopt effective measures
to remove outstanding snags in the economic locomotive, especially
bad debts, and should earnestly guard against banking risks.
</P>
<P>
Despite the possibility of occasional fluctuations, the
economic locomotive will continue on the fast-track throughout
1998 if macro-economic control measures adopted in the mid-1993
are pointedly enforced and carried out in a timely manner to
prevent the possibility of any derailment.

<HEADLINE> Allegations of Thai Guerrillas Being Trained in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The umbrella organization
for six Muslim liberation fronts in Thailand has categorically
denied the allegations by Thai authorities that their guerrillas
are being trained in Malaysia, according to the Malaysian national
news agency Bernama Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The denial was made by the Patani Malay Consultative Congress
known as MPRMP based in Hamburg, Germany, in letter sent to
Bernama which was received here Wednesday, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
"We are responsible for all activities of our guerrillas in the
Malay provinces of southern Thailand," the letter signed by
Mohamad Haris Hadafi, Press Secretary of the MPRMP President, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
MPRMP is said to be the umbrella organization for the Patani
Islamic Liberation Front, National Revolutionary Front, National
Revolutionary Front-Congress, Patani Mujahidin Movement, Patani
Ulama Movement and Patani United Liberation Organization (PULO).
</P>
<P>
There were reported allegations from the Thai authorities
recently that Malaysia was a training ground for PULO rebels.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar and Deputy
Inspector-General of Police Norian Mai both have denies the
charge.
</P>
<P>
However, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said
Tuesday after meeting Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand
Paribatra that he was open to discussing the allegations with his
Thai counterpart Surin Pitsuwan at their meeting expected to be
held here next month when Surin will pay his first official visit
to Malaysia since his appointment as foreign minister in last
November.
</P>
<P>
If Thailand has any information or evidence of this matter,
then it will be discussed by Surin and myself during Surin's
visit, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Malaysia's policy was not to interfere with the
internal affairs of another country and likewise it did not want
to be a base for such groups from other countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin said
here today his municipality will further improve efforts to open
itself to the outside world and expand its open economy.
</P>
<P>
Jia made the remarks during a government report to today's

</P>
<P>
The congress will summarize the work of last term's local
government, elect a new leading group, and formulate work goals
for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Jia said Beijing will introduce overall improvements to its
multi-level opening framework in various fields, formulate related
work for the service sector, and draw more overseas funds for key
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The city will strive to convince more overseas financial
institutions to set up branches in Beijing, introduce
foreign-funded retailers, and establish jointly funded
Sino-foreign or cooperative tour agencies in accordance with the
relevant state laws and policies, said Jia.
</P>
<P>
He noted that emphasis will be placed in intensifying the
future direction of industry, and that new policies will be
introduced to encourage foreign businesspeople to invest in a
number of sectors, including the hi-tech industry, infrastructure,
the transformation of dilapidated housing, tourism and modern
agriculture.

Jia went on to say that the municipal government will expand
the use of foreign capital by selecting a group of state-owned
enterprises to introduce overseas funds through transfers of
property rights and the reorganization of capital.
</P>
<P>
The city used overseas funds totalling 9.75 billion US dollars
during the previous five years, including investments by 146 of

</P>
<P>
In terms of foreign trade, Jia said the city will adhere to its
diversified market strategy and win market share by offering high
quality products.

The city will increase exports of hi-tech, machinery and
electronics products, as well as agricultural goods, and will
extend greater effort to exporting electronic information
processing and name brand products. He said the city will increase
exports of machinery, electronic and textile products to countries
in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will also accelerate efforts to reform its foreign
trade system, reorganize the capital structures of foreign trade
enterprises and form large foreign trade groups, according to Jia.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that foreign-funded enterprises will be
encouraged to increase exports, and more industrial enterprises
will enter international markets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jia said, Beijing will adopt various methods to open
new channels for foreign funding over the next five years, and
will steadily enter the world capital market. The city will also
vigorously develop its service and technical trade sectors, and
will increase the proportion of the foreign trade volume to GDP,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Jia's report also pointed to the need to increase economic and
technical cooperation with Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, and to
boost the common economic progress of both sides of the Taiwan
Straits.

<TEXT>
<P>
After meeting with President Soeharto at his residence along
Jalan Cendana, Central Jakarta, visiting U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said that the U.S. government believes that
Indonesia will be able to regain public confidence in its economy.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who arrived here Tuesday for a three-day visit, said
that U.S. President Bill Clinton has given his support to
Indonesia's economic and financial restructurization program.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Indonesia's economic recovery program is on the
right track, Cohen said, "I am here not as an economic expert."
</P>
<P>
He said during the 40-minute talks, they did not talk about the
sale of U.S. arms to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia last year canceled the purchase of nine U.S F-16 jet
fighters to protest against what it claimed to be "wholly
unjustified criticism of the country's human rights record by the
U.S. congress.
</P>
<P>
The government then decided to buy 12 Sukhoi warplanes and 8
helicopters from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian Defense Minister Edi Sudradjat, who
accompanied Cohen, said the government has canceled the purchase
of military equipment due to the ongoing monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah (national currency) fell to a historic
low last Thursday after plunged to 10,000 against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The government recently decided to postpone the purchase of the
12 Sukhoi jet fighters and the 8 helicopters from Russia due to
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sudradjat said Indonesia has the right to decide from which
country it will buy its military equipment.

<HEADLINE> Negotiations Underway to Create Arab Common Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations are currently
underway to reach a final settlement among Arab countries for the
creation of an Arab common market, head of the Association of
Lebanese Industrialists Jacques Sarraf has said.
</P>
<P>
Sarraf made the remarks following his meeting with Lebanese
Economy and Trade Minister Yassin Jaber Tuesday, local newspaper
the Beirut Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sarraf just returned from Cairo where a delegation of the
general confederation of the Arab chambers of commerce headed by
Lebanese Chamber of Commerce President Adnan Kassar held talks
with Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid on the
region's economic situation, especially the creation of an Arab
common market.
</P>
<P>
Sarraf said that in Cairo, Kassar delivered a memorandum to
Abdul-Meguid, which calls for more effective measures to be taken
by Arab governments to ensure that the Arab common market is
created swiftly.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that "a decision will be made today by the Arab
League concerning the creation of an unified Arab economic
community," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Sarraf said that Lebanon was one of the countries in total
support for the creation of the market, adding that "Lebanon is
keen on opening up to all Arab markets."
</P>
<P>
Prior to the establishment of the common market, Lebanon is to
conclude bilateral agreements with other countries, specially the
two major consumer markets in the region, Egypt and Syria, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The idea of a common market has been circulating since the
1950's. An Arab summit in 1996 further called for the
acceleration of the creation of the free market.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1997, the Arab League launched a regional free
trade program which is considered as an important step that could
lead to the creation of a common market. Eighteen countries in the
region have agreed to join the program.

<HEADLINE> EU in Quest for Community Strategy on Climate: EU Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is expected
to start seeking a community-wide strategy on climate change as
proposed by its environment commissioner Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ritt Bjerregaard outlined in a document to her European
Commission colleagues that the EU member states have to evaluate
the precise content of the commitments made in the Kyoto climate
conference last month before drawing up a community strategy for
the implementation of the commitments.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said that the member states had to start
preparing for the signing of the Kyoto protocol.
</P>
<P>
A council meeting of EU ministers is slated for March when a
detailed report specifying the real commitments the Kyoto protocol
represents for the union will be worked out.
</P>
<P>
The member states will then start ratifying the protocol, but
Bjerregaard said the ratification would require the development of
a post-Kyoto strategy.
</P>
<P>
The strategy will concern such sectors as energy efficiency,
promotion of renewable energy resources, transport measures,
sustainable management of forests, limiting or reducing methane
emissions through better waste management, new forms of
sustainable agriculture and modifications in the production,
transport and distribution of energy.
</P>
<P>
The strategy will also specify the implications for the member
states of new targets for reducing emissions of six gases instead
of three and the impact of burden-sharing among EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also raised the question of whether the union
should settle on the 8-percent target laid down in the Kyoto
protocol or commit itself unilaterally to a higher figure of 15
percent as it proposed in its negotiating position in Kyoto.

SINGAPORE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continue to
surge on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index shot up by 86.75 points to close at 1243.27
points on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said market sentiment was boosted by optimistic
comments by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and U.S.
officials that economic reform in Indonesia will kick-start a
regional recovery.
</P>
<P>
They added that stable regional currencies shored up market
sentiment, along with the second consecutive gain on a resilient
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume increased to 578.56 million units,
valued at 832.68 million Singapore dollars (about 478.55 million
US dollars). Advances overwhelmed declines by 369 to 48, while 195
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Renong Bhd was the most actively traded counter as it
registered a turnover of 62.75 million units. It was followed by
Wing Tai which had 37.89 million of its shares traded. DBS
(Development Bank of Singapore) Land was next with 23.4 million of
its shares changed hands.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market
was winched 1.5 percent higher Wednesday, clawing back the rest of
Monday's 2.3 percent slide after strong gains in the U.S., Japan
and Hong Kong combined with a better gold price to steady investor
confidence.
</P>
<P>
The resources sector rallied, also driven by an announcement by
the world's largest miner, Rio Tinto, that it plans to buy back up
to 10 percent of its shares.
</P>
<P>
Blue-chip industrials also posted healthy rises Wednesday,
helping the all ordinaries index to a close of 2,605.3, up 40
points.
</P>
<P>
"Rio's rally was the big contributor to the strength in the
resources sector on top of the bullion price jumping," Shaw
Stockbroking's Jamie Spiteri said.
</P>
<P>
Improved industrial stocks were largely a carry-over from
Tuesday's market performance, further spurred by the 84.95-point
rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average overnight to 7,732.13,
Spiteri said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Japan continued their recoveries with the Hang
Seng up 523.2 points to 9,243.2, while in Tokyo, the Nikkei firmed
366.04 points or 2.5 percent to a close of 15,121.98.
</P>
<P>
Locally, the resources index jumped almost four percent or 41.8
points to 1,097 and the all industrials index rose 42.5 points to
4,491.5.
</P>
<P>
The gold index surged 3.5 percent or 33.9 points to 995, just
shy of the 1000-point barrier. In Sydney, spot gold was trading at
285.30 US dollars an ounce, up 7.20 from late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Telstra installment receipts edged up six cents, Coles Myer
added 15, Qantas ended nine stronger, CSL jumped 40 and Coca-Cola
gained eight cents.

<P>
National turnover topped 310.1 million shares, worth 916.7

outpaced falls 679 to 414.

<P>
CAIRO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Finance Ministry plans for the first time
to issue 30-year bonds on the United States capital markets,
according to a report of The Jerusalem Post Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the bond issue is part of a plan to
raise 3 billion U.S. dollars in foreign currency in 1998 within
the framework of Israel's 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israeli government is planning to ban imports
from Malaysia and Indonesia, which compete with and pose a threat
to its domestically-made products, Wednesday's Jerusalem Post
quoted a senior government official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Malaysia and Indonesia have placed high
tariffs on Israeli imports. Meanwhile, he added, the ban will also
be justified by the devaluation of Indonesia's currency by 70
percent in the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanese Arch Financial Group has announced the
purchase of a 76 percent stake in al-Mughtareb, a small Beirut
bank valued at 14 million U.S. dollars, Beirut Times reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Arch is a new Lebanese holding company with a capital of 16
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Monday, the company said that it
intends to raise its capital to 50 million dollars by the end of
March.
</P>
<P>
The firm is working on buying a number of other banks to be
merged in one entity called United Bank of Lebanon, according to
the newspaper.

<P>
BRUSSELS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is

goods, people, service and capital; agriculture; economic and
monetary policy; common commercial policy; public health and
trans-European networks.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Appraises TB-Control Program in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- About 50,000 tuberculosis (TB)
patients, 96 percent of the total in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province, have recovered because of loans from the
World Bank, which sponsored an anti-tuberculosis program in the
province, official sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang has the country's third highest incidence of TB,
next to Xinjiang Uygur and Tibet autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, by the end of 1997, 150,000 people in the
province were found carrying the TB virus, 52,000 of which are TB
patients.
</P>
<P>
The 5.3 million U.S. dollars in loans from the World Bank from
1993 to 2000, plus 45 million yuan aid from the country, has
enabled the province to control the disease.
</P>
<P>
Local health departments sent TB-control staff members to give
face-to-face treatment to TB patients, who received their daily
drug dosage under the staff's supervision to ensure that they took
the medicine for the required three-to-five months.
</P>
<P>
The no-interest loans from the World Bank provided treatment
for many TB-sufferers who cannot afford the medicine or get
on-time treatment.
</P>
<P>
The program financed by World Bank was also conducted among 560
million people in 11 other provinces and autonomous regions in
addition to Heilongjiang.
</P>
<P>
Tuberculosis was previously curable. However, it re-emerged as
a major world health problem in recent years, mainly due to
improper treatment and the emergence of multi-drug resistant
strains of TB.
</P>
<P>
The number of TB patients in China accounts for one-fourth of
the world's total, and more than 250,000 people die from TB each
year in the world.
</P>
<P>
Citing TB as a serious epidemic, the World Health Organization
declared the disease a global health emergency in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Bounces Over One US Cent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar soared
as much as one-and-a-half US cents Wednesday, peaking above 65.00
US cents, as Asian currencies rebounded and the gold price firmed.
</P>
<P>
Despite losing some of its gains in afternoon trading, the
currency held on to close almost one US cent higher at 64.94,
compared to 63.98 late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It earlier reached a high of 65.40 US cents when it hitched on
for a ride with other Asian currencies as the Japanese yen surged
against the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
A strong bounce in the gold price added to the bullish tone.
</P>
<P>
Gold bullion in Sydney closed at 285.95 US dollars per fine
ounce, 7.70 US Dollars higher than the previous close.
</P>
<P>
Traders said a report from US investment bank Goldman Sachs
which suggested the local unit was at "an extreme level of
under-valuation" against the US dollar also bolstered the
currency's rise early in the session.
</P>
<P>
Goldman Sachs' weekly analysts' report said the Australian unit
was 19.8 percent below its assessment of fair value.
</P>
<P>
"If stability ever returns to Asia and commodity prices were to
recover in 1998, the Australian dollar could reverse some of this
substantial disequilibrium," it said.
</P>
<P>
While those factors all gave support to the beleaguered
Australian unit, traders said attempts to aggressively buy the
currency and push it up through 65.50 US cents were thwarted by a
rebound in the US dollar against the yen.
</P>
<P>
While talk that the Asian crisis might be near bottom swept
markets Wednesday, analysts said it might take more than a day or
two of good news to substantially alter the negative sentiment
surrounding the region.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended Wednesday at 85.17 yen from 84.96
and at 1.1879 marks from 1.1656.

<HEADLINE> Old Industrial Center Absorbs More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 2.8 billion
U.S. dollars in direct foreign investment was used in northeast
China's Liaoning Province in 1997, according to Vice-Governor Gao
Guozhu.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the contractual volume of foreign funds to be
used in Liaoning's projects during the year hit 4.5 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gao revealed the figures at a conference on Liaoning's use of
foreign investment now in session in the provincial capital of
Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of foreign funds the province used through
various forms during the past five years hit 20 billion U.S.
dollars, or an average of four billion U.S. dollars a year, said
Gao.
</P>
<P>
As an old heavy industrial base in China, the province approved
1,506 overseas-funded enterprises in the first 11 months of last
year, with the total contracted volume standing at 4.1 billion U.S
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Large state-owned enterprises in Liaoning formed 53 joint
ventures with overseas partners last year.
</P>
<P>
A local auto industry company has joined hands with Mitsubishi
Company of Japan to produce parts for light-duty vehicles. The
first phase project has a designed annual production capacity of
150,000 automobile engines, with projections calling for its
annual output value to hit 4.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The province signed 16 infrastructure construction contracts
valued at 800 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This year, the province will use overseas funds to upgrade the
technology of state-owned enterprises in the metallurgical,
petrochemical, electronics and automobile manufacturing sectors,
according to Gao.

SHANGHAI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. opened a
technical support center Tuesday in China's leading industrial
city of Shanghai with nearly 10 million U.S. dollars of investment.
</P>
<P>
Steve Ballmer, the company's deputy chief executive officer,

The other four were established in the United States, Japan,
Australia and Europe.
</P>

</P>
<P>
He added that the new center has been equipped with advanced

<P>
Microsoft chose to establish its technical support center in
Shanghai because it is China's top economic center with many

</P>
<P>
Ballmer said the opening of the center will promote the spread
of Microsoft's master software in China as well as the development
of the country's software industry.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Hands over Diamond Mine to Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Angola's former rebel movement
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
has formally handed over the diamond mine in Cuango to the
government.
</P>
<P>
a government delegation headed by Higino Carneiro, Vice
Minister of Administration of Territory, attended the handover
ceremony held in Cuango in the northeastern province of
Lunda-Norte. Isaias Samakuva, head of the UNITA
delegation in the Joint Committee of Peace Process also
attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Jose Dias, General Manager of the state-owned Angolan Diamond
Corporation, said to the press after the ceremony that the
diamond mine will increase the country's earning in foreign
currency and help revert its deficit and creat more jobs for the
Angolans.
</P>
<P>
Cuango, one of the major diamond producing areas in Angola,
was occupied by UNITA at the end of 1992 after the civil war
restarted in the country.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the mine could yield an annual income of
over 600 million dollars, which had been a major economic source
for UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said diamond mines had always been a critical
issue in the Angolan Peace Process. The handover of the mine
has been regarded as an important achievement in the peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Top Academy Faces Shortage of Scholars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-five percent of the
leading scholars of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS)
will retire before 2005, said Wang Renzhi, vice president of the
academy.
</P>
<P>
At the academy's annual work meeting today, he said that half
of its 500 leading scholars will retire before 2000, and another
35 percent before 2005.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the academy's most influential scholars are
57 or older. A crisis of succession can be attributed to the
so-called "Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976) which halted
university education. In addition, during the 1980s many poorly
paid scholars quit academia for more lucrative jobs.
</P>
<P>
The CASS, a think tank for the central government, launched a
program last year to cultivate young scholars. More than 200
outstanding young people have been chosen to inherit the academic
legacy.
</P>
<P>
Wang revealed that young and middle-aged scholars' housing
problems have been eased and they can get quick promotions.
</P>
<P>
The academy this year will take more steps to attract
first-rate scholars from other research institutions and
universities, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Ru Xin, another vice-president, said the academy will try its
best to provide young scholars with opportunities to study abroad
and attend international seminars.
</P>
<P>
"All these measures will lay down a basis on which China's
top-rate scholars will be born in the 21st century," he said.

SINGAPORE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Managing Director Michel Camdessus Wednesday expressed his
hope that a second letter of intent will be signed with Indonesia
on Thursday in a joint effort to restore confidence in the
country's market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here before he left this
afternoon for Jakarta, Camdessus said, "The immediate priority and
the very purpose" of his visit to the Indonesian capital is to
"arrest and turn around the tremendous loss of confidence and
stabilize the market through monetary disciplines and a dramatic
acceleration of the long overdue structural reforms."
</P>
<P>
"We have in our program a very significant list of measures,"
said the IMF chief, who arrived here on Tuesday en route to
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
He said that what he looks forward to and what he hopes the IMF
could achieve is a new letter of intent to be signed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new letter of intent will not only demonstrate that the
Indonesian government and president are fully supportive of
implementing those reforms, but also demonstrate this by
accelerating and strengthening the implementation, he said.
</P>
<P>
If this could be achieved, he said, then people could see, in
Indonesia, the long-awaited strengthening of the exchange market
being put on "a more steady path of recovery."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that for re-establishing confidence in Indonesia
after doubt which has been generated by some hesitation in
implementation of the initial letter of intent, we see the need
for the authorities not only to reaffirm that 'we do that', but to
demonstrate their determination by action," the IMF chief said.
</P>
<P>
He also added that no better action could be found than the
strengthening and acceleration of the structural reforms, which
were already embedded in the initial letter of intent signed by
the two sides last year.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, where the local
currency and stock markets suffered sharp losses in the past
week, Camdessus said Singapore is a place which is no doubt
receiving the impact of the turmoil around it.
</P>
<P>
But he was quick to add that Singapore has managed the
situation very well, based on sound macroeconomic policies, a
strong financial position of its financial institutions as well as
continuous effort to introduce more transparency.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Aviation Industry Loses to Harmattan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's aviation industry is
expected to lose over 100 million Naira (1.3 million U.S.
Dollars) due to flight disruptions to the northern parts of the
country caused by Harmattan Haze within the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
At least 200 flight schedules to the capital Abuja in the
middle of the country have so far been cancelled due to poor
visibility caused by the seasonal hot, dry, sand-laden wind, This
Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
Flight cancellation does not bring losses to airlines but also
to aviation oil companies, maintenance and other related service
companies, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
As the situation has not improved, Abuja travellers have no
resorted to buying up to three tickets with the hope of using
whichever airline that is available to the capital.
</P>
<P>
The problem, many travellers have complained, is attributed to
the poor equipment situation due to under-funding at the
country's domestic airports.
</P>
<P>
According to Finance Minister Anthony Ani, the Federal
Airports Authority of Nigeria, which oversees the country's
airports and also a huge loser to harmattan, has got the money
for the development of the airports.
</P>
<P>
The Aviation Ministry has kept silent at the latest
development so far.
</P>
<P>
International fligths have not been affected.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Tent Families in Quake-hit Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- In Zhangbei and Shangyi
counties in North China's Hebei Province, "makeshift families" are
forming in tents among villagers who lost their homes in the
January 10th earthquake.
</P>
<P>
At Xingjialiang Village of Dahe Township near the epicenter,
Xing Renzhi's family and another six households now dwell in a
large tent set up by the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
Xing, 31, said that on the second night after Saturday's quake,
she and her fellow villagers moved into tents.
</P>
<P>
Outside Xing's tent, snow is falling and the temperature is 15
or 16 degrees below zero Centigrade (3-to-5 degrees Fahrenheit).
</P>
<P>
But in the tent, a burning stove keeps the temperature at about
10 degrees Centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Xing's tent houses about 30 people. "At night, the children and
women sleep first while the men sit till dawn due to the limited
space in the tent," she said. "Although it is crowded, it is quite
warm."
</P>
<P>
At one corner of the tent is a pile of quilts. Several kids are
sitting or lying on the canvas. Xing's four-month-old baby is
falling asleep near the stove.
</P>
<P>
"We are planning to retrieve some grain from our collapsed
houses when we are told the aftershocks are over," Xing
said. Since they moved into the tent, Xing said the women prepare
a meal each day for the tent-family which consists of seven
households.
</P>
<P>
"Other meals in a day are instant noodles," she said. "Every
other day, we get some food from the PLA soldiers."
</P>
<P>
Near the tent, collapsed houses are scattered on the
snow-covered ground with furniture and kitchenware protruding from
the ruins.
</P>
<P>
About 20 PLA men are in the process of pitching new tents for
the villagers.
</P>
<P>
Xing's mother, who is in her 70s, said that without aid from
the PLA and the government, the quake-hit people would suffer more
from the cold.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Industrial Exports Up 8.2 Percent in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel's industrial exports
in 1997 reached 18.5 billion U.S. dollars, an 8.2 percent increase
over that of 1996, The Jerusalem Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted statistics released by Israeli Industry and Trade
Ministry Tuesday as saying that Israel's net exports of polished
diamonds in 1997 increased at the relatively moderate rate of 2.3
percent, amounting to 4.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ministry noted that the last quarter of 1997 saw a
significant decline in diamond exports mainly as a result of the
economic crisis in Asia, which constitutes an important market
for this sector.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Israel's industrial exports, excluding diamonds, grew
10.1 percent in 1997, after a 6.3 percent growth in 1996. And the
highest rate of growth was in the high-tech industry, whose exports
rose 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, export by traditional industries fell in almost
every sector, with the exception of the wood and paper sectors
and the mining and non-metal mineral sectors.
</P>
<P>
The United States remains Israel's biggest export market, with
exports rising 14 percent in 1997, while Israel's exports to
Britain, the third largest market, rose 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Israel's second largest export market is the Palestinian
National Authority, which imported some 1.75 billion dollars in
goods from Israel last year.

<HEADLINE> Firms to Fund On-line Education Program in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Five firms have agreed to
pool 3.75 million U.S. dollars to sponsor an on-line education
program in California, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The program, the California Virtual University (CVU), will
list, via the Internet, 500 courses offered at any of the state's
301 accredited colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
So far, 65 schools have joined the program offering college
degrees from certificates to doctorates.
</P>
<P>
As enrollment at California's higher education institutions is
expected to grow by half a million over the next 10 years, the CVU
will play an important role in offering local residents the
education they need without adding additional students on campus.
</P>
<P>
California Governor Pete Wilson has proposed in his 1998-1999
budget that the program be expanded with 14.1 million dollars. He
also proposed that all public high school students receive
computing training and all public high schools be linked to
Internet within four years.
</P>
<P>
On-line education programs, or computer-mediated distance
education, have been in the ascendant in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 40 percent of the country's colleges and
universities have or are developing distance education programs to
supplement their array of education offerings.
</P>
<P>
The idea is that wherever or at any time, students can log into
a virtual classroom where from desktop or laptop, e-mail
assignments can be sent and received.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rains in kenya to Be Followed by Drought: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- This year's long rains season,
which should start in Kenya late March, may be replaced by a
spell of drought, the East African Standard newspaper today
quoted the Meteorological Department, as saying.
</P>
<P>
If the long rains come at all, they will be poor as an
aftermath of the El Nino weather phenomenon, said the
department's Assistant Director Joshua Wairoto on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Research shows that an intense El Nino is always most
likely to be followed by a reverse dry spell called La Nina, he
said, responding to the mounting anxiety over the rains which
have pounded most parts of the country since October.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains Tuesday washed away a police station, a U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees field office, a tree nursey and Dadaab
refugee camp in Eastern Province. All livestock belonging to the
refugees were dead.
</P>
<P>
Rains already claimed scores of lives, disrupted transport,
destroyed bridges, caused landslides, swept away homes and crops,
prompted cholera and malaria outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
Global forecast indicated that the El Nino has been on a
downward trend from December and is likely to end in May.

<HEADLINE> Schools in Quake-Hit Areas to Reopen on Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- An official from quake-stricken
areas in Hebei Province says the provincial education department
will allocate sufficient funding to ensure that the schools in
affected areas can reopen as scheduled next term.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,326 school houses in Zhangbei and Shangyi counties were
destroyed during the devastating January 10 earthquake which
measured 6.2 on the Richter Scale, according to the local
education department. Fortunately, schools in both counties were
on winter vacation at the time, with the new term scheduled to
begin on March 6.
</P>
<P>
Yang Qian, deputy-governor of Hebei Province, said that
priority will be placed on ensuring that local farmers have
adequate food and housing, as well as on rebuilding schools.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hebei Education Commission, teachers in
seriously affected areas have been granted allowances of 300 yuan
each. In addition, a Hong Kong education foundation founded by
famous film producer Run Run Shaw, has pledged to rebuild two Hope
Project schools in the area.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that construction work will begin in May due to
prevailing adverse weather conditions. Therefore, numerous classes
will be held in tents, and a number of structurally sound houses
will be transformed into classrooms.
</P>
<P>
Officials note that many of an additional 3,100 tents which
will be transported to the earthquake-stricken area will be used
as classrooms.

<HEADLINE> 1998 to Be Tough Economic Year for Zimbabwe: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- This year is likely to be an
extremely difficult one to Zimbabwe as it has started amid
persistent deterioration in the economic environment and
plummeting business confidence, a senior Zimbabwean business
official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned... 1998 will be another extremely
difficult year given the harsh economic environment, punitive
lending rates, upward inflationary pressures emanating from
devaluation, an unsustainable budget deficit and huge borrowings
from the domestic market to finance war veterans payments," said
Danny Meyer, President of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of
Commerce (ZNCC).
</P>
<P>
It is not surprising that many of ZNCC members are shelving
crucial investment projects until the economic climate recovers,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Depressed activity in the private sector also made a mockery
of the major objectives of economic reform programs which aim at
creating an investment-led and export-led sustainable
socio-economic development, Meyer noted.
</P>
<P>
The harsh economic environment, he said, would certainly push
many companies to the wall, leading to widespread retrenchments
and worsening the unemployment problem estimated at between 45 to
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, said the ZNCC president, hope is not lost since
Zimbabwe's economic base is still strong and what is needed is
political commitment to rebuilding the country's battered image.
</P>
<P>
Suggesting ways of rebuilding confidence, Meyer said, the
government needed to enter into serious dialogue with all
stakeholders in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Citing the budget deficit as one of the greatest causes for
current macro-economic instability, Meyer said the government
should take bold decisions to restructure the public sector so as
to resolve problems.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Hewlett-Packard Co., one of
the largest U.S. computer makers, said Tuesday that it had cut
list prices on its notebook personal computers by 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The list price of new HP OmniBook 3000CTX, which has an Intel
233 MHz mobile Pentium processor, was cut to 4,075 dollars and is
expected to sell for 3,670 dollars in retail shops, the Palo Alto,
California-based company said.
</P>
<P>
The list price of HP OmniBook 5700 CT, with a 166 MHz Pentium
processor, was cut to 2,820 and is expected to sell for 2,540
dollars, while the list price of HP OmniBook 2000 CT was cut to

Industry analysts say that the battle to capture home buyers of
personal computers will heat up with Hewlett-Packard cutting list
prices on both desktop and notebook personal computers.

<HEADLINE> 92,000 Kenyan Children Under Age Five Die Yearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Out of 1,027,000 live births,
92,000 children under the age of five in Kenya die annually due
malnutrition and attendant diseases, the East African Standard
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
And for every 1,000 births in east Africa's Uganda and
Tanzania, 141 children die of the same causes, said Ratemo
Michieka, Vice Chancellor of the Jomo Kenyatta University of
Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), at an ongoing international
food workshop here.
</P>
<P>
Many parts of Africa had in recent years experienced acute
food shortage and serious famine, leading to major cases of
malnutrition, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that about 200 million children under the age
of five in developing countries are malnourished and incapable of
fighting diseases.
</P>
<P>
The three-day workshop, with the theme of "Formulation and
Implementation of Nutrition Programs," is jointly organized by
JKUAT and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

<HEADLINE> New Mode of Sino-African Trade Cooperation Shows Potential (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Sino-African economic and trade
cooperation made marked progress last year and the new mode used
in the 1990s by the two sides has vast potential for future
development.
</P>
<P>
These remarks came from a senior official in charge of
Sino-African trade in the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has supported and helped African
countries develop their economies since the 1960s, providing aid
without any extra political conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government reformed and adjusted its aid mode based
on the changed situation of the two sides in recent years to
further expand cooperative spheres, help improve economic
advancement on the African continent, and diversify the mode of
economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The new mode integrates aid, trade, contracted labor and
investment to improve economic and trade cooperation, and such a
mode has ushered in a new stage in Sino-African economic and
trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the import-export volume between the two
sides was 4.031 billion U.S. dollars in 1996, up 2.7 percent over
the previous year and 4.3 times that of 1990.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volume reached 4.012 billion U.S. dollars from
January to September last year, an increase of 44.7 percent over
the same period of 1996. The export volume for the same period
was 2.154 billion U.S. dollars, up 24.9 percent; and the import
volume was 1.858 billion U.S. dollars, up 77.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two sides totaled 5 billion U.S.
dollars last year, a major increase over 1996.
</P>
<P>
China has also achieved marked results in the contracted labor
business. Chinese companies had signed 6,983 contracts with
African countries by last October, with a total contract volume valued
at 9.297 billion U.S. dollars.

<P>
To help Chinese enterprises explore the African market, China
has decided to set up investment and trade development centers in
10 African countries to provide consulting and other services.
</P>
<P>
The centers in Egypt, Guinea, Cameroun, Cote D'Ivoire, Gabon
and Mali have already been put into operation, while the centers in
Nigeria, Mozambique, Zambia and Tanzania are still in the
preparation stage.
</P>
<P>
Sino-African economic and trade cooperation has been extended
to the fields of mining, agriculture, timber, water conservation,
and construction.
</P>
<P>
The MOFTEC official said that exchanges of visits by senior
leaders of China and African countries have further
strengthened friendly cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited six African countries in
May of 1996. During his African trip, Jiang proposed building
long-term, stable, comprehensively cooperative Sino-African
relations that are oriented toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng visited seven African countries last
May. Leaders of a great number of African countries visited China
last year.
</P>
<P>
China is the largest developing country and Africa is
considered the largest developing continent in the world.
</P>
<P>
The MOFTEC official said that the common historical tasks,
development goals and interests have put the cooperation
between the two sides on the basis of equality.
</P>
<P>
He said this cooperation is not only of significance for the
development of Asia and Africa in the next century, the
"South-South" cooperation and peace and stability of the world,
but also for pushing China's reform and opening-up drive to
broader areas and greater dimensions as well as adding vigor to
its economy.

<HEADLINE> Experts Identify Killer Disease in Northeastern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Tests have confirmed that the
disease that has claimed more than 350 lives and killed hundreds
of livestock in Kenya's North-Eastern Province is Rift Valley
Fever, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Peter Tukei, a virologist at Kenya medical Research Institute,
said analyses he had carried on 41 human and animal sample
specimens from the affected areas "strongly" indicated the killer
is the rare Rift Valley Fever as 30 samples had tested positive
for the disease.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, another seven were positive for Haema
Agglutination Assay while four were positive for Polymerase Chain
Reaction.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, South African scientists have conducted tests in
Johannesburg with similar conclusion.
</P>
<P>
"Two-third of the people had Rift Valley Fever. The others
were probably something else," said Bob Swanepoel, head of
Johannesburg's National Institute for Virology on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross Health Coordinator Saade Abdala said in Garissa, a
major affected area, on Monday that the disease was under control
as those affected were being offered medical attention and were
not dying as quickly as before.
</P>
<P>
Most victims got the disease from handling ailing livestock,
she noted, suggesting that local residents burn all carcasses.
</P>
<P>
The disease, whose victims have symptoms of vomiting,
headache, diarrhoea and bleeding from body orifices, was
communicable from livestock to human beings, said Abdala.
</P>
<P>
Fresh rains continued to pound the region in the past two
weeks and flooded the area again, making the disease, which
had actually subsided, recur.
</P>
<P>
Rift Valley Fever is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes
and is predominantly found in domestic animals. It can also
affect human beings exposed to heavy infection by direct contact
with infected animals.
</P>
<P>
In 1977, it suddenly flared up as a human infection in Egypt
involving 200,000 people, out of whom 600 died.

<HEADLINE> Major Tanzanian Railway Resumes Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Central
Railway resumed services today after three weeks of suspension
which was caused by devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the Tanzania Railways Corporation
(TRC) today said that the resumption of the much-awaited
services follows the repairs of nine bridges in the
Bahi-Makutupora section.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to resume train services to and from Dodoma,
Kigoma, Tabora and Mwanza.
</P>
<P>
Resumption of the services will make it possible for the
company to transport 60,000 tons of goods monthly, a great relief
to the stranded cargo, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
After completing the rehabilitation of the Bahi-Makutupora
stretch, engineers are ready to concentrate on repairs of the
railway section between Ruvu and Mnyusi where six bridges have
been damaged by floods.
</P>
<P>
Completion of the section will enable TRC to send to the
Mwanza Region 400 wagons and engines stranded in Dar es Salaam
and the Kilimanjaro Region, the company officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Railway built by Germans in the 19th century, and
the Tanzania-Zambia Railway constructed with the aid from China
in the 1970s, are the two major railways in the country.

<HEADLINE> Afghan War Mars Pakistan's Trade With Central Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The long-running armed
conflict in Afghanistan has become a major obstacle in the
development of trade between Pakistan and Central Asian states.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show the average annual trade between
Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and
Kirghizstan is below 48 million U.S. dollars in spite of the fact
that these countries have a potential annual trade of more than 1
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's exports to Uzbekistan in the last four years were
worth 103 million dollars while imports from that country in the
same period stood at only 4.995 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistan's exports to Kazakhstan in the last four
years were recorded at 40.51 million dollars and imports from it
remained at around 7.44 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local economists are of the view that Pakistan's external trade
with Central Asian states can be enhanced rapidly provided certain
measures are taken to facilitate trade with that region via
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
They believed that Pakistan and the Central Asian states, which
became independent in 1991, had not made serious efforts to boost
their trade to exploit the existing potential.
</P>
<P>
Both sides should either pacify the warring factions in
Afghanistan to put an end to the long-running war or initiate
cargo service on subsidized rates, they said.
</P>
<P>
Since there is no other land route in this region except that
passing through the valleys of Afghanistan, the volume of trade
between Pakistan and Central Asian states are expected to remain
low as long as war lingers on in Afghanistan and cargo service is
not kicked off.

<P>
TOKYO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- World number one Dong Jiong of
China suffered the biggest upset at the Japan Open badminton
tournament here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The all-England champion was defeated by Malaysia's Rashid
Sidek 15-8, 15-18, 15-7.

In a day of surprises, Liu En-Hong of Chinese Taipei caused the
second upset of the day when he toppled world champion and
defending champion Peter Rasmussen of Denmark 18-15, 15-12 in the
men's singles second round.
</P>
<P>
Sidek, bronze medalist in Atlanta Olympic Games, resorted to
his effective baseline strokes and a series of quick attacks at
the net to savor his victory.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy because he is the second seed. I'm no seed, I've got
nothing to worry about," said Sidek, who avenged his loss in the
Atlanta Olympics semi-finals against Dong, the silver medallist.
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen was tied with Liu at 13-13 in the first and 12-12 in
the second, but the 32-year-old veteran player won the coming
points to seal the competition in one hour.

<P>
Malaysian Roslin Hashim scored a 15-12, 15-5 upset victory over
1993 world champion Joko Suprianto of Indonesia.

<P>
HARARE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- About 30 percent of Zimbabwe's

to HIV mothers die within two to three years, a medical
technologist said here last night.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of the book titled Monitoring
Transmitted Clinics in Zimbabwe, Alexio Mashu, a chief medical

The rate of HIV infection had increased from 18 percent in
1990 to 30 percent in 1996, Mashu said, adding that most babies

<HEADLINE> Malta PM Meets Chinese Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VALLETTA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Malta Prime Minister Alfred
Sant said here Tuesday that Malta is willing to further promote
its friendly and cooperative ties with China in all fields.
</P>
<P>
During the talks with visiting Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen, Sant said there exist healthy and sound
relations between Malta and China. Malta is eager to further push
forward the economic and trade cooperation between the two
countries in the future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of the China-Malta ties, Qian said that
relations have been developing smoothly since the two countries
established diplomatic ties 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts by the present and previous governments
of the two countries, China and Malta surmount their differences
on national conditions and the long distance between them and
develop their bilateral cooperation, Qian added.
</P>
<P>
"During my talks with Malta Foreign Minister George Vella, I
had an impression that China and Malta are certain to further
cooperate with each other closely," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister said that the present cooperation
should adapt to the ongoing economic reforms in the two countries
and enable enterprises to play leading roles in China-Malta
economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
And the big changes in the world situation called for the
adoption of new forms in nation-to-nation cooperation, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that China and Malta can find new cooperative ways
which meet the demands of the two countries," Qian added.
</P>
<P>
Sant said Maltese enterprises were anxious to strengthen
contacts and cooperation with Chinese firms.
</P>
<P>
Malta is also reforming its economic system in a bid to further
diversify its foreign contacts, Sant said. Malta hopes to broaden
its friendly cooperation with other countries including China.
</P>
<P>
Sant believed that Qian's present visit to Malta would surely
contribute to the enhancement of Malta-China economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that the Chinese and Malta governments should create
opportunities for the two countries' enterprises to promote their
mutual understanding and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Sant agreed. He said the two countries should attach importance
to the function of the market in their cooperation and make
far-sighted, cooperative strategies.
</P>
<P>
Both Qian and Sant hoped that the meeting of the China-Malta
mixed committee on economic and trade cooperation, to be held this
year, would further reinforce the development of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the financial turmoil in Southeast Asia, Qian said
the globalization of the world economy has brought about both
positive and negative results.
</P>
<P>
In this situation, it is important for a country to establish a
healthy economic frame and financial system, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
On the effect of the market crisis on Hong Kong, Qian said Hong
Kong is able to stand the impact because it has solid economic
fundamentals, a sound financial system and close links with
China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
Sant briefed Qian on Malta's foreign policies and relations,
especially its ties with the European Union and Arab countries
south of the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister noted that Malta has been devoting itself to
maintaining peace and stability and promoting development and
cooperation in the Mediterranean region.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China appreciates the neutral policy pursued by
Malta. The two countries often share similar views on
international issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian arrived in Malta on Monday for a three-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, Qian also met Malta Minister of Trade Leo
Brincat, Minister of Tourism Karmenu Vella and Minister of
Industry John Montalto.

<P>
XI'AN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi Province, home of the
"Terra Cotta Warriors," plans to attract 600,000 overseas visitors
and make 250 million U.S. dollars from international tourism in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The northwest Chinese province also expects 25 million domestic
tourists to generate 7.4 billion yuan (891.56 million
U.S. dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 the province, one of the most popular tourist
destinations in China, received a record 540,000 overseas tourists
and more than 25 million domestic visitors, an increase of 8
percent and 9 percent over 1996, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The province has designated tourism as one of the pace-setting
sectors to make breakthroughs this year.
</P>
<P>
Li Jianguo, provincial head of the Communist Party of China,
recently called for improving the management and marketing of
tourism.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Andong, governor of Shaanxi Province, called for more and

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Coping With Unusually Warm, Wet Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Residents in China's leading
industrial city of Shanghai are experiencing a warm and rainy
season this winter.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologist Shi Youhao said that it is the 10th consecutive
warm winter in Shanghai. The average daily temperature in the
first 10 days of January was 7.3 degrees Centigrade (45.1 degrees
Fahrenheit), 3.9 degrees higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
Shi added that the average monthly temperature in December in
1997 was 8 degrees Centigrade, 2.1 degrees higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
If the average temperature in the three-month winter season
(December-February) in Shanghai is one degree higher than normal,
he explained, the winter can be classified as warm.
</P>
<P>
Another major characteristic of this winter is Shanghai's
rainfall, which was 102.5 millimeters in December, triple the
historic average.
</P>
<P>
He said December's rainfall was Shanghai's third-highest
since 1873.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jiaxin, deputy head of Shanghai Meteorological
Station, attributed the warm rainy weather to a relatively strong
humid southwest front and a weak northern cold front creating
stable atmospheric conditions over the area.
</P>
<P>
Department stores and shops in Shanghai have reduced the price
on fur coats and thick overcoats because the unusually warm
weather has hurt sales.

<HEADLINE> Thai Official Urges U.S. to Open Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Foreign Minister
Sukhumbhand Paribatra has urged the United States to help Thailand
by opening its market.
</P>
<P>
Another thing that the United States can do is improve
conditions for investment in Thailand, Sukhumbhand was quoted by
the Bangkok Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thailand would not ask the United States for financial support
as the Clinton administration is known to be under pressure from
the congress, the paper also quoted government sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sukhumbhand was commenting on a brief visit to Thailand by U.S.
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who is scheduled to
call on Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports say it is up to Summers to come up with a proposal for
the Clinton administration to help speed up the recovery of Asia's
troubled economies.
</P>
<P>
Since Thailand began suffering financial turmoil last year, it
has got no financial assistance from the U.S. government except
that through the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which arranged
a 17.2 billion U.S. dollar bailout program for the country.
</P>
<P>
Some Thai sources suggested that the United States increase
contributions to the IMF, whose funds are fast depleting, or
encourage international organizations such as the World Bank to
beef up assistance to affected countries in terms of social safety
net programs or technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They also expect the U.S. government to convince the G-7 Group
of Western industrialized countries to help Asian countries find
ways out of the economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sukhumbhand revealed on Tuesday that the Philippines
has proposed to hold a special meeting on the region's economic
crisis, to be attended by ministers of finance, commerce and
foreign affairs of five ASEAN members -- Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.

<HEADLINE> State-Owned Enterprises Get Head Start in Recruiting Graduates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- State-owned enterprises in
north China's port city of Tianjin have begun recruiting qualified
college graduates nearly half a year before the end of school.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the city's Hebei District,
government bodies and state-owned enterprises are seeking 150
graduates in 20 majors including law and business administration.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Tianjin human resources department
attributed this year's early recruitment to reforms in state-owned
enterprises. Some enterprises have signed contracts with
universities to train professionals.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, recruitment would not start until March or
April. Most enterprises recruiting employees through job markets
are foreign-funded or privately owned. State-owned enterprises
that recruit employees in job markets constitute less than 10
percent of the total.

<HEADLINE> American Scientist Stresses Sino-US Technological Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- An American scientist has
called for more Sino-U.S. scientific and technological cooperation
in personnel training and information exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation in the two fields would help China "revitalize the
country with science and education" and keep up with international
scientific developments, Chang-Lin Tien said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tien, former chancellor at the University of California at
Berkeley in the San Francisco Bay Area, is the first foreign
academician in the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. educator said he is deeply concerned with scientific
progress in China. As a member of the American Academy of
Engineering and the Governor of the Committee of One Hundred, he
has put forward some useful proposals on Sino-U.S. co-operation to
the American president.
</P>
<P>
"The policies for cultivation of foreign scientific and
technological personnel are quite flexible in the United States,"
he said. "Chinese students and researchers are welcome to use the
abundant information resources and advanced facilities in American
universities and institutes to improve their studies."
</P>
<P>
UC Berkeley has received many students from the Asia-Pacific
region, especially from China, Tien said. The school began
cooperation in 1970 with Qinghua University, Beijing University
and other universities in personnel training and academic
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Tien said that information exchanges, which can help scientists
from both countries share their research findings and academic
results, can play a vital role in Sino-U.S. scientific
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said the opening of the China server of the American
Magazine "Science" on the Internet was an example of progress in
this field.
</P>
<P>
An authoritative scholar on heat transmission, Tien is
currently working on cooperative projects concerning the studies
of heat transmission with the State Natural Science Fund
Committee, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Qinghua University.

<HEADLINE> Impoverished Area Making Gains Under Market Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The long-secluded mountainous
Dingxi Prefecture in northwest China's Gansu Province, known as
the country's most impoverished area, is reportedly doing better
under a market economy, and eager to embrace the outside world.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s the area had nearly two million people
living below the poverty line, but that number now has been
reduced to 500,000. The prefecture plans to help the remaining
poor farmers rise above the poverty line by 1999, a year earlier
than the state-designated deadline.
</P>
<P>
Colorful advertisements along the region's 312 Highway and
French fries on farmers' tables take some visitors by surprise.
</P>
<P>
The residents of Dingxi once relied heavily on potatoes to
survive famines, but they have changed them into a major product
for export.
</P>
<P>
In the past, thousands of local farmers would leave the region
to go begging, but 300,000 rural laborers now earn 3 billion yuan
annually by working on construction sites in urban areas. Some of
these rural laborers have returned to their hometowns with
entrepreneurial ideas, setting up village businesses and making a
good living.
</P>
<P>
Cash crops also have become very popular. For example, the
herbal medicine Chinese angelica produced in the region accounts
for 70 percent of both the total output and exports in the
country. Local people also are working toward building Dingxi into
China's largest production and processing center for potatoes.
</P>
<P>
More investors have begun showing interest in the area as it
has opened wider to the outside. Fourteen joint ventures have
settled in Dingxi investing 8 million U.S. dollars, said Shi
Zuofeng, the prefecture's Party secretary.

<HEADLINE> Indian Auto Parts Industry Opposes Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 14 (Xinhua)-- India's domestic automobile
components industry is deeply perturbed at the tendency of global
car manufacturers to encourage 100-percent-owned subsidiaries of
components suppliers, local car components industry sources said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fears have been expressed that this would have adverse impact
on the domestic industry which had been gearing up to meet the
demands of global automobile players.
</P>
<P>
Leading auto components manufacturers have said that the
government should discourage the setting-up of 100 percent
foreign-owned subsidiaries in this sector. They asserted that the
domestic industry has the capacity and capability to supply enough
qualified auto components, adding that technology upgradation and
expansion of capacities have been underway to meet the new
challenges.
</P>
<P>
India's auto components industry has been growing at a fast
pace, though total revenue from it is only 0.7 percent of the
world components industry. The industry said it would prefer joint
ventures and technological collaborations so as to upgrade itself
and emerge as a global player.

<HEADLINE> URGENT: 80 Die as Afghan Plane Crashes in Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 14 (Xinhua) -- As many as 80 people, most of
them Afghan nationals, are reported to have died when a
Russian-made Afghan plane crashed late Tuesday night in Pakistan's
Baloshistan Province.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports Wednesday the plane crashed
near Chaman, about 110 kilometers north of Quetta, provincial
capital of Balochistan due to inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
The plane took off from the Kandhar Airport in southern
Afghanistan for the northwest province of Kerat Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
However, when it reached near destination, it could not land
due to inclement weather. The plane then returned to Kandhar, as
the weather of Kandhar was also foggy, it could not land there
either, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Later the pilot moved the plane towards Pakistan informing the
Quetta airport control about the situation and requested to allow
for emergency landing. The civil aviation authorities arranged
emergency landing for the ill-fated passenger carrier.
</P>
<P>
The plane was on its way to the Quetta Airport when it crashed
in Khojak pass's hilly track because of darkness and cloudy
weather, killing all the passengers and crew.
</P>
<P>
There are other reports saying the crash of the Afghan plane
took place late at around 10:30 Tuesday night when the plane with
more than 90 people on board were on their way to Quetta from
Kandhar. But due to some technical fault and diminishing fuel, the
plane could not continue its journey and crashed in Chaman area.
</P>
<P>
The local authority in Chaman said Wednesday that they arranged
rescue teams immediately after getting the news and tried their
best to reach the spot. However, due to darkness and the rain,
they could not start relief operation.
</P>
<P>
Further details are awaited.

</P>
<P>
Meeting with members of the Myanmar Industrial Development

Peace and Development Council and patron of the MIDC, also
stressed the need to manufacture quality products of export items
and enhance the role of private industrial sector, the official

The MIDC, formed in July 1995, was reorganized recently to
accelerate implementation of the country's industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's industrial growth
reached 5.2 percent in the 1996-97 fiscal year, the first fiscal
year of the present five-year plan. The country has set a target
of 10.7 percent growth for the industrial sector in 1997-98, the
second year of the five-year plan.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bangkok, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The economic slump in Thailand
has resulted in the first drop in more than a decade in the
country's oil product demand, according to the Department of
Commercial Registration.
</P>
<P>
Demand fell by 0.1 percent in 1997 compared with 1996, to an
average of 112 million liters a day, the department was quoted
Wednesday by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, Thailand's oil consumption had risen by
an average of more than 10 percent a year, fuelled by a booming
economy. Thailand had one of the highest energy consumption growth
rates in the world.
</P>
<P>
Increased domestic refining capacity and the slowdown in demand
have boosted the country's export of oil products to neighboring
Indochina and Singapore by 38 percent to 15 million liters a day.

<P>
SHANGHAI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's technology exports
surged 23.6 percent to a record high of 664 million US dollars in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Increased export of high technology is the major driving force
behind the rapid growth, according to a municipal official.
</P>
<P>
Official data show that Shanghai exported more than 300
varieties of high-tech products last year, with exports of such
products surging 37 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
In one case, infrared sensors manufactured by a research
institute of this economic center of China accounted for 70
percent of global sales last year.
</P>
<P>
The rapid increase in Shanghai's technology exports is also
attributable to more active technology trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Currently the Shanghai Technology Exchange alone has
established business ties with technology transfer centers in 14
countries, including Japan, the United States and
Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Share-holding Revives State-run Brewery in Lhasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Lhasa Beer Co. Ltd., which
grew on the basis of the state-run Lhasa Brewery, scored a pre-tax
profit of 10 million yuan (1.2 million US dollars) in 1997 since
the new share-holding company was set up last May.
</P>
<P>
The company is located in Lhasa, capital city of China's
plateau Tibet Autonomous Region. It is one of the country's 100
experimental enterprises, and the only one in Tibet, which adopts
a modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
The brewery began a depression in early 1995, with losses
standing at 10 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Joining hands with a company from nearby Sichuan Province, the
brewery was turned into the Lhasa Beer Co. Ltd., with the two
parties holding 61 percent of the new company's stocks. And the
remaining stocks are held by several state-run and private
businesses and individuals.
</P>
<P>
Practices have shown that the share-holding method proves to be
an effective way out for state-run enterprises like the Lhasa
Brewery, said Xu Mingyang, vice-chairman of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials in charge of the region's economic
restructuring, state-run businesses in Tibet hold total assets of
more than six billion yuan. However, many of them are in dire
operation and need to be revitalized.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that pillar state-run enterprises in Tibet
will be transformed into share-holding companies, and smaller ones
can be sold out, leased out, annexed, auctioned, or go
bankrupt.

<P>
The Foreign Minister, on Monday and Tuesday, met European
banana importers and representatives of protesting groups who have

His tour is part of a government effort to counteract a
campaign fostered by Costa Rican and European organizations
against alleged violations to workers` rights, and to
environmental norms, by banana companies in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican authorities and companies have claimed that working
conditions in local plantations are much better than those in
other banana-producing countries.

<HEADLINE> Solar Eclipse Provides Clue to Earliest Chronological Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have put the
country's earliest chronological record half a century ahead
through studying ancient documents on solar eclipse.
</P>
<P>
Previously China had no chronological record before 841 BC, or
the first year of Gong He, when two famous ministers joined
efforts to support King Cheng of the Zhou Dynasty (about 11th
Century-221 BC).
</P>
<P>
This had not been broken until recently when the experts found
a clue in documents of earlier solar eclipse.
</P>
<P>
According to the documents, people in Zheng (present-day Xi'an
in northwest China's Shaanxi Province) saw daybreak twice one day
in the first year of the Reign of King Yi of Zhou. But which year
was that?
</P>
<P>
By studying reports from 18 different locations in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region for observing a solar
eclipse on March 9, 1996, the experts found that observers from
the western direction could see the phenomenon of daybreak twice
during the eclipse.
</P>
<P>
The experts then searched for all solar eclipses happened
during 1,000-840 BC and figured out the areas where two daybreaks
might have been observed.
</P>
<P>
At last they found two solar eclipses, on April 21, 899 BC and
October 6, 871 BC, separately, may result in two daybreaks in
Zheng. The year 871 BC, however, was not possible to be the first
year of the Reign of King Yi according to other historical
evidences.
</P>
<P>
Thus the experts determined that the year 899 BC was the first
year of the Reign of King Yi. It is the oldest chronological
record ever found in China.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Peso Rallies on Bank, Govt Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso rallied
Tuesday for the fourth straight session as a result of the Central
Bank and the government's efforts to curb the recent free fall of
the currency.
</P>
<P>
The peso strengthened by 0.75 percent to 43.62 pesos to the
U.S. dollar from Monday's 43.95 pesos. Trading ranged from 43.75
to 43.51 pesos to the dollar on a volume of 86.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since last Thursday, the peso has been gaining strength, rising
by a total of 4 percent from last Wednesday's weighted average of
45.42 pesos to the dollar to the current level.
</P>
<P>
The local stock market also reversed and performed well due to
the surge of the peso. The 30-share composite index soared 58.02
points, or 3.8 percent, to close at 1,590.99 points Tuesday after
rising 14.97 points on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The peso and the stock market index had been faltering since
the very beginning of the year. The currency dropped to an
all-time low of 46.53 pesos per dollar during last Wednesday's
intra-day trading and the index nose-dived by 138 points, or 8.3
percent, to close at 1,518 points last Friday, the lowest in the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts and dealers attributed the rebound of the peso to
various measures taken by the Central Bank and the government
recently.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank raised its overnight lending rate to 16
percent Tuesday from 15.4 percent on Monday, but held its key
overnight borrowing rate at 12 percent, to ward off currency
speculators.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the bank also began selling through commercial banks
a new kind of dollar hedge facility, the non-deliverable forward
(NDF) contracts, to ease pressure on the peso.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few weeks, companies with dollar-denominated
debts have been buying the greenback heavily in anticipation of a
further fall of the beleaguered peso, pushing the peso to
consecutive new lows.
</P>
<P>
By using the NDF facility, corporate borrowers can buy dollars
at the pre-determined exchange rate, thus substantially reducing
demand for the greenback on the current market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Central Bank is considering ordering the banks
to fully disclose their pertinent details including securities
holdings, trading accounts, updated profits, amounts of bad loans
and detailed investment portfolios.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the banks to set aside a two percent reserve
against possible default loans as soon as possible and mulled
stiffer penalties for violations of foreign exchange rules.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the austerity drive launched by President Fidel
Ramos at the end of last year also helped underpin the peso,
giving a boost to investors' eroded confidence.
</P>
<P>
According to Ramos' order, any government departments or
agencies, including state-run colleges and corporations, must cut
at least 25 percent of their spending this year.
</P>
<P>
To attain this target, new capital or huge infrastructure
projects, purchase of new cars, travels abroad by government
employees and all unnecessary celebrations would be suspended this
year.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also urged his fellow countrymen to buy local products
instead of foreign brands and convert their dollars into pesos to
help the country weather the financial storm.
</P>
<P>
However, many analysts and traders remained unconvinced that
the rebound could be sustained for long, as the overall regional
situation has not shown any signs of improvement.
</P>
<P>
Deogracias Vistan, president of the Commercial Banks
Association, said the recovery of the peso may be good news for
some sectors, but banks were worrying that the behavior of the
spot currency market might again attract "global speculators."
</P>
<P>
He said the peso's fast appreciation amid the continued plunge
of other regional currencies, including the Thai baht, was
worrisome, as it might make the Philippines' exports uncompetitive
against other countries whose currencies continued to fall.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the Central Bank intervene in the market and buy
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank governor Gabriel Singson turned down the idea,
saying the peso, which once fell by 76 percent from the original
level of 26.2 pesos to the dollar, has been undervalued.

<P>
HEFEI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE)
will seek to list more big and well-performing companies this
year, a senior exchange official has said.
</P>
<P>
The SSE will attract more well-performing companies for listing
this year in order to serve the national efforts to reform and
develop the state-owned enterprises, Wu Yalun, Deputy General
Manager of SSE, said recently at the exchange's 1997 annual
meeting on listed companies in Huangshan City, Anhui Province.
</P>

the SSE will this year beef up efforts for market construction,
such as updating its computer and information systems.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Canadian Mining Company Withdraws from Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian mining company has
decided to withdraw from Nicaragua after two years of business
there, a senior official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Mines Department of Nicaragua's Economy
Ministry, Jorge Luis Prendiz, denied that the withdrawal of the
Canadian Western Mining Corp. had anything to do with the recent
discussion over the property rights of mines by the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He said that the major reason triggering the company's
withdrawal was the recent sudden drop of gold price at the
international market, which, he added, had a damaging effect upon
the operative profitability of the Canadian company.
</P>
<P>
In July 1997, the gold price was 364 U.S. dollars per ounce. By
November, it lowered to 320 dollars and the current tariff was 284
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Western Mining Corp. has reportedly found some gold veins
in Nicaragua's Atlanta, an autonomous region along the Atlantic
coast.
</P>
<P>
A spokesmen of the company said that they might resume its
business in the central American country in two or three years.
</P>
<P>
Before the withdrawal from Nicaragua, the company has already
ended its business operation in Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Capital Funds Highway Construction in Anhui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province has
over the recent years increased its use of overseas capital in
highway construction.
</P>
<P>
The province has built 6,661 km of highway since 1992, raising
the total highway mileage to 37,000 km, according to official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Anhui's combined highway length, which includes 300 km of
expressway, means a highway density of 25 km on an area of 25 sq
km.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the rapid growth in highway construction in
the east China province partly to increased use of overseas
capital, the sources of which range from the World Bank, the
United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Construction of transportation facilities has become a new
destination for overseas investment in Anhui, the experts note.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Borrow to Boost Foreign Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Monetary Board
has authorized the Central Bank to borrow one billion U.S. dollars
to boost its dwindling foreign exchange reserves, the local
newspaper Manila Bulletin reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Five international investment banks, including JP Morgan and
Merrill Lynch, have already offered a total of 3.8 billion U.S.
dollars to the Central Bank, bank officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the Monetary Board has decided to tap only one billion of
the sums, said the officials, adding that the excess amount would
be treated as "reserve funds" which can still be availed of if the
dollar reserves are seen not enough to counter future currency
speculations.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank prefers a direct loan from the banks rather
than a bond floatation due to difficulties in attracting investors
in the wake of the regional currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The loans are expected to come in next month to boost the
country's gross international reserves (GIR) to 10 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The GIR, which consists of the Central Bank's gold holding,
foreign exchange, investments and the so-called special drawing
rights, has been tapped by monetary authorities to infuse dollars
in the currency market to fight speculative attacks on the peso.
</P>
<P>
From more than 12 billion dollars before the de facto peso
devaluation on July 11, 1997, the GIR fell to only about nine
billion at the start of 1998, due to futile efforts of the Central
Bank to defend the currency.

<HEADLINE> French Minister Worries About World Cup Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- French transportation minister
Jean-Claude Gayssot Tuesday expressed his worries about World Cup
traffic blocks for the newly-built State de France stadium.
</P>
<P>
The stadium will be open to the public for the first time on
January 28 when France plays Spain in a soccer friendly, which
expects an inflow of 80,000 spectators.
</P>
<P>
Gayssot considered the friendly as the major test of the
transportation arrangements as parking lots around the stadium can
only satisfy one third of the estimated 12,000 cars driven by the
fans.
</P>
<P>
The minister thus advised soccer fans to resort to public
vehicles instead of personal cars to avoid traffic chaos.
</P>
<P>
For the January 28 friendly, as well as the June 10 World Cup
opener between Brazil and Scotland and the July 12 final,
organizers offer free passes for the ticket-holding spectators and
a earlier entrance by three hours in advance and hope to disperse
the post-game audience in 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the completion of the stadium, many a Frenchmen had
complained of the lacking of parking lots which undermines the
inconvenience in future.

<P>
LIMA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The fruit fly damages 30 percent
of fruit production in Peru, causing annual losses of 100 million
U.S. dollars to farmers.
</P>
<P>
The plague harms Peru's fruit exportation because other
countries are banning the imports from Peru, according to the
Chairman of Peru Foundation, Fernando Cilloniz, quoted on Tuesday
by the local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cilloniz said that most citrus products are being damaged by
the fly, which resides inside the fruit and rots it.
</P>
<P>
The fly, at its larval phase, can be fought while being
inside the fruit through thermic of "freezing" treatments, but
such procedures also damage the products, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Peru is undergoing a process of extermination of the fruit
fly, with rather uneven success depending on the region of the
country where treatments are applied", Cilloniz stated.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that Peru wishes to succeed in getting rid of the
plague thanks to a program called "Citrus Survey", launched more

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Promises Bigger Financial Aid for Yangtze River Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China's largest economic
center of Shanghai will provide bigger financial support for
economic growth in the Yangtze River region, according to a senior
financial official.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will seek to promote economic growth in the area with
syndicated or special loans, said Wang Huaqing, deputy governor of
the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China (PBC), the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that 20 percent of the loans granted by
the licensed overseas banks in Shanghai has been directed to areas
along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Last year PBC Shanghai launched bill discounting in nine cities
in the Yangtze River Valley, which has greatly promoted economic
exchange between Shanghai and other areas in the Yangtze River
Valley.
</P>
<P>
While more national and regional banks and non-banking
financial institutions have set up subsidiaries in Shanghai, and
Shanghai in turn has also accelerated its pace to tap business
opportunities in areas along the Yangtze River and in cities in
other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Shanghai-headquartered Bank of Communications,
Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, Shenyin and Wangguo Securities
Co. Ltd and Haitong Securities Co. Ltd have set up branches in a
number of cities.
</P>
<P>
Capital export is a sign of Shanghai's amplifying power to the
economic belt in the Yangtze River Valley. Official statistics
show that lending to out-city clients through the Shanghai Fund
Center has totaled 261.6 billion yuan since the second half of
1991. Since 1994 more than 80 percent of the lending has gone to
clients in the Yangtze River Valley.
</P>
<P>
The capital market of Shanghai has also gained in importance in
aiding economic development in the Yangtze River Valley. Turnover
at the Shanghai securities market amounted to more than 1.8
trillion yuan in the first half of 1997 alone. More than 90
percent of the 59 companies listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange
in the first six months of 1997 were from other provinces and
municipalities.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A regional computer system to
clear transactions has been set up in Guangzhou, the capital of
South China's Guangdong Province, to help update capital
circulation and avoid financial risks.
</P>
<P>
The system is in use in only a few places like the U.S,
Switzerland, and Hong Kong, according to local bank officials.
</P>
<P>
The system connects local commercial banks with a national
satellite network of the People's Bank of China, the central
bank. Commercial banks can use electronic data to help settle
accounts with customers and the central bank within minutes.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the system had handled 330,000
transactions since March, 1997, valued at more than 90 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
All Guangzhou branches of the Agricultural Bank of China, the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, and
Communications Bank of China are connected to the network, and the
Guangzhou City Cooperative Bank is expected to join this "bankers'
club" this month.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials estimate that daily transactions will reach
three billion yuan when all local banks join this year.

BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build seven
major highway arteries by the end of this century, linking Beijing
with Zhuhai, Shenyang and Shanghai, and connecting Tongjiang with
Sanya, Lianyungang with Horgas, Shanghai with Chengdu, and
Chongqing with Beihai.
</P>
<P>
And in 1998, the country will add 2,370 km of new lines,
including 800 km of expressways and 540 km of Category-A and
Category-B highways for special use, Minister of Communications
Huang Zhendong said here today.
</P>
<P>
Huang said China's ports will add a handling capacity of 4.7
million tons this year, and nine deep-water berths will be built.
</P>
<P>
He said that as an effort to commemorate the 50th anniversary
of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Ministry of
Communications will build ten key projects, such as the
Beijing-Luohe section of the Beijing-Zhuhai expressway, the
Jiangyin Yangtze highway bridge, and the harnessing project for
the Jiangsu part of the North-South Grand Canal.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that China's transport "bottleneck" is still
there, and transport conditions are expected to meet the demand of
national economic and social development in 2020, and by the
mid-21st century, the country will have a modern transportation
network.
</P>

Statistics show that by the end of last year, the country's
highway mileage reached 1.21 million km, including 4,735 km of
expressways.
</P>

people last year, down from 942 million in 1996, and the amount of
cargo delivered kept the same level of 1996 to stand at 1.62
billion tons.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more travelers have turned to highway or air
transport from railway for faster or more comfortable service.
</P>
<P>
A report from the State Planning Commission said that the
demand of highway and railway transport will increase as a result
of national economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
The demand of passenger and cargo transport on highways will
increase by 5 and 4 percent, respectively, this year, and that of
passenger transport on railways will be up 2 to 4 percent, and
that of cargo transport on railways will maintain the same level.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of air travelers rose by 10.4
percent to reach 59 million last year. Waterways transported 220
million passengers, down 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Major ports handled nearly 1.3 billion tons of goods last year,
a rise of 1.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> China's Coastal Provinces Most Competitive Economically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The coastal areas of China have
become the most competitive in the country, according to the State
Statistics Bureau (SSB), which ranks Shanghai, Guangdong, Beijing,
Tianjin, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Fujian, Liaoning and Hainan
as the ten most competitive regions.
</P>
<P>
This is based on eight basic economic factors for economic
force, market openness, government efficiency, finances,
infrastructure, management, science and technology, and labor
force.
</P>
<P>
The competitiveness of the country's 30 province-level regions
reflects the rapid change in different areas since the reforms and
opening-up began in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Two decades ago, the top ten regional economies were Shanghai,
Beijing, Liaoning, Tianjin, Guangdong, Shandong, Jiangsu,
Heilongjiang, Hebei and Hubei, most of them inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The imbalance in economic competitiveness of coastal and inland
areas has become worse and the income gap between the two regions
has widened. Coastal and inland areas should therefore try to
build a reciprocal economic relationship to improve the
competitiveness of the whole nation, the SSB report says.

<P>
MONTEVIDEO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Rains and floods caused by
the El Nino climatic phenomenon have prompted losses of over 30
million U.S. dollars in destruction of crops and roads in Uruguay,
authorities said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As the summer comes in, continuous rains have pounded specially
the Northern territory and the coast, causing damage to crops,
cattle and infrastructure, the sources said.

<P>
It also said that damage to highways has amounted to 10 million
U.S. dollars so far.
</P>
<P>
Local weather experts have forecast three to four added
months of storms due to El Nino.

The Uruguayan government is setting up a package of measures to
lower the losses brought about by natural disasters.

<HEADLINE> Dutch FA Criticizes World Cup Ticket Allocation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch Football Association
Tuesday joined its Belgian counterpart in criticizing the ticket
allocation plan of the coming World Cup tournament.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Football Association spokesman Rob de Leede said in
Amsterdam: "We have written to FIFA saying we are not happy with
the situation. The demand is three to four times the size of our
ticket allocation."
</P>
<P>
World Cup organizers gave the Dutch association 5,800 tickets
for the country's opening match against Belgium in Paris'
80,000-seater Stade de France stadium.
</P>
<P>
Belgium was given 5,400 tickets for the same match though
Belgian Football Association officials said that they had been
overwhelmed with 120,000 requests for tickets for the June 13
match.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch are given 4,700 tickets for their match against South
Korea on June 20 in Marseille and 2,200 tickets for the match
against Mexico on June 23 in St. Etienne.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch association is selling its World Cup allocation
through the Orange Supporters Club which currently has 28,000
members.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of the 2.5 million World Cup tickets are
reportedly designated for French fans.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands and Belgium were drawn into the same group in
the first-phase of competition of the 32-team World Cup
tournament. In last year's qualifying tournament, the two teams
also played in the same group.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch won their games both at home and away, with scores at
3-1 and 3-0.

WELLINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A New Zealand doctor has
volunteered to inject himself with a modified strain of the HIV
virus as part of a research to find a cheap vaccine against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
A local press report said Wednesday Dr Charles Farthing has
told his mother Ngaire Farthing about his plan.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted his mother as saying: "I'm not happy about it
but I feel very confident that he knows that he's doing. I don't
think he'd do it if there was a major danger."
</P>
<P>
Farthing, 44, an internationally-known AIDS researcher and
director of the Hollywood-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation, has
asked other medical professionals to join him in injecting
themselves with a weakened form of the HIV virus as part of an
effort to find a cheap protective vaccine against AIDS, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
But he still needs permission from the American Food and Drug
Administration for the injections, and the permission could take
up to a year to come.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Hardens Drought In Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A drought reinforced by the El
Nino phenomenon will prompt limited-water supply for the coming
months in Costa Rica's capital of San Jose, authorities said here
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the Costa Rican Institute of Water Supply and
Sewage System, Ana Gabriela Ross, said the city's water reserves
are at a very low level.
</P>
<P>
Between November and March, San Jose endures a rainless season
which affects the central area of the country, but this year the
El Nino phenomenon has hardened the lack of water.
</P>
<P>
"People have not yet understood how serious the problem is" and
over the last days consumption of water has increased all over the
city, Ross said.
</P>
<P>
"If consumers do not collaborate in saving water, we will have
to put into place a tight rationing", she asserted.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Falls as Asian Stock Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell against
the Japanese yen and German mark Tuesday as Asian stock markets
rebounded after Indonesia's president promised to take measures to
mend the country's troubled economy.
</P>
<P>
Stock markets across Asia rebounded, led by a 9.1 percent rise
in Indonesia's main stock index. The rally boosted the yen against
the dollar and the mark, forcing the U.S. currency lower.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 131.72 yen, down from 132.69 late
Monday. It also settled at 1.8200 marks, down from 1.8211.
</P>
<P>
The new official report indicated that the U.S. inflation rate
of 1997 stood at 1.7 percent only, down from 3.3 percent in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also was hurt by fears of a possible interest rate
cut by the Federal Reserve, as well as concerns that international
central banks could join in an effort to sell dollars on the open
market to boost slumping Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (Xinhua)-- An Afghan cargo plane carrying
as many as 90 Afghan fighters slammed into a mountain Tuesday in
southwestern Pakistan, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft apparently strayed off course because of bad

The Afghan cargo plane, a Russian-made aircraft refitted to
carry passengers, had tried to land in the western Afghan city of
Herat, 150 miles west of Kandahar but had to turn back because of
bad weather, the APP reported.
</P>
<P>
The pilot apparently was trying to return to Kandahar when he

<HEADLINE> Albright Challenges Congress on U.S. Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright today urged Congress to approve a host of
legislations on foreign policies ranging from paying the U.S.
debts to the United Nations and NATO's expansion.
</P>
<P>
In a year-end major foreign policy speech, Albright said one
of the legislative tests in 1998 for Congress is "whether we will
pay what we owe to the United Nations and the International
Monetary Fund."
</P>
<P>
"This matters because the United States cannot solve every
problem that affects us on our own, nor would we want to try,"
she noted.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers, she said, had created "a truly ridiculous" impasse
by refusing last year to repay U.S. debts to the United Nations
during a confrontation with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The victims of this act of legislative blackmail are the
American people," Albright said. "The best America is a leader,
not a debtor."
</P>
<P>
On Bosnia, Albright said that the evidence is growing that
peace will be sustained in the country only when the U.S. troops
stay.
</P>
<P>
"Quitting is not the American way," she said. "The mission in
Bosnia should determine the timetable, and not the other way
around."
</P>
<P>
"The NATO-led effort to build peace in Bosnia reflects the
importance of a second test for 1998, which is to gain the
Senate's agreement to the proposed enlargement of that alliance
(NATO)," she noted.
</P>
<P>
The speech before the Center for National Policy, a private
group, is in part reflective on her first year as the secretary of
state while also a direct appeal to the Republican-controlled
Congress, which has the final word on Bosnia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
The extension of U.S. peacekeeping operations and the
alliance's expansion to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic, three former Soviet allies require congressional
approval.
</P>
<P>
Both the moves by the administration are criticized in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers are concerned about risk to U.S. troops if
ethnic conflict should break out again in the Balkans and whether
the United States has a vital security interest in the region.
</P>
<P>
The alliance's expansion plan also makes some congressman
worry about a new division in Europe between the alliance and
those outsiders including Russia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Concerted Action, but may also Act Alone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The White House said on
Tuesday that the United States would like to act in concert with
its allies in forcing Iraq to back down in its decision to bar an
American-led weapons inspection team, but would not rule out
unilateral action when needed.
</P>
<P>
"It is always better to act in concert with others when we can,
but there is never any reluctance to act alone if we must," White
House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton said on Monday that he expected the U.N.
Security Council would take "strong and appropriate" action if
Iraq enforces its decision on Tuesday to block the weapons
inspection team, headed by American Scott Ritter.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on Tuesday blocked the Ritter-led team from inspecting
weapons of mass destruction on the ground that he was spying for
the United States and it also complained that the composition of
the team was not fairly balanced as it was composed with nine
Americans, five Britains, one Russian and one Australian.
</P>
<P>
While exerting its effort to press its concerns over Iraq's
challenge on weapons inspections within the U.N. Security Council,
the United States is closely monitoring the situation in the Gulf
"day in and day out" in case there is any incident to be
occurring, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also made
clear that Iraq must back down in its decision and let weapons
inspectors do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important... that unconditional access by UNSCOM
(the U.N. Special Commission) must be the bottom line," she said
in a speech to the National Policy Forum think tank.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to be vigilant and determined and we do not
rule out any options," she said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has maintained 21 warships, including two
aircraft carriers, about 350 aircraft and 28,800 military
personnel in the Gulf region since last November when a weapons
inspection crisis erupted as a result of Iraq's decision to expel
American inspectors within the U.N. teams.
</P>
<P>
Bill Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, raised
military threat anew following Iraq's latest challenge in weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you, patience is running out in a lot of Security
Council capitals. The Iraqis are really pushing this to the
brink," he told ABC's "Good Morning America" in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"It's very important that Saddam Hussein be constrained," he
said. "We have our forces in the Gulf, we have not ruled that
option out," he added.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen said in Kuala Lumpur,
malaysia, that the United States would continue to pursue
diplomatic initiatives until that option was exhausted. "We have
not reached that point yet."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lifts Moratorium on Home Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday lift a moratorium put in place in September that barred
new home health care providers from entering the Federal Medical
insurance program -- Medicare.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Clinton said The Department of Health and Human
Services is removing the moratorium because those new tougher
regulations are in place to root out fraud and abuse in the home
health industry.
</P>
<P>
The FBI and federal prosecutors have been assigned to
investigate health care fraud across the board. Clinton said
convictions have gone up 240 percent and the federal government
has saved an estimated 20 billion dollars in fraudulent claims.
</P>
<P>
Home health care is one of the fastest growing expenditures in
Medicare, rising from 2.9 percent of all payments in 1990 to
nearly 9 percent now.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations require all home health agencies to secure
surety bonds of 50,000 dollars, or 15 percent of annual Medicare
payments received, whichever is greater. The regulations also
require that new home health providers have enough funds to
operate for at least three months before they start accepting
Medicare patients.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks rose today,
led by the battered technology sector, after several Asian markets
began to rebound from a series of sharp slides over the past week.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 84.95 to 7,732.13,
trimming January's loss back toward 2 percent. It was Dow's best
performance in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Other indexes also posted sizable gains, with the rally
accelerating just before the closing bell.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where NYSE volume totaled 645.68
million shares as against 682.90 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 12.92 to 952.13, and
the NYSE composite index rose 6.14 to 497.75.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index jumped 34.04 points to 1,541.62, and
the American Stock Exchange composite index rose 9.47 to 655.88.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 7.56 to
418.44.
</P>
<P>
Stock markets across Asia also rebounded today, led by
Indonesia, where stocks rose 9.1 percent. Singapore's market
jumped 8 percent after seven days of steep losses and Malaysia's
climbed 5.5 percent. In Hong Kong, stocks rose 7.4 percent today
after tumbling to a three-year low on Monday.
</P>
<P>
There was little market reaction to a report showing that U.S.
consumer prices edged just 0.1 percent higher in December. The
small increase held inflation for all of 1997 to only 1.7 percent
-- about half the 3.3 percent increase of 1996 and the best
performance in 11 years.

<HEADLINE> White House Top Aide Bowles to Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Erskine Bowles said Tuesday
he would remain as White House chief of staff rather than return
to the business world.
</P>
<P>
Bowles announced his decision at a meeting Tuesday of the White
House senior staff, according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
In his year on the job, Bowles was reputed to be the driving
force behind President Bill Clinton's pursuit of a balanced-budget
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Making no secret of his desire to leave, Bowles had been edging
toward the door for months but was reportedly stopped by Clinton's
insistence that he stay.
</P>
<P>
Bowles said he would try to dissuade other senior staff from
leaving. "I think this team is functioning well," Bowles said.
"I'm going to do my best -- it's my job to try to keep as many of
them here as I can."
</P>
<P>
Bowles acknowledged that his change of heart was prompted in
part by the prospect of a balanced budget and the opportunity for
Clinton to be a more activist president.
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton's State of the Union would demonstrate the
administration is committed to investing in education, training,
early childhood programs, technology and infrastructure programs,
as well as developing global markets.

<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all stopped their recent decline and ended firmer Tuesday, boosted
by Wall Street's firm opening today and the overnight rebounds in
Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
Britain's leading shares managed modest gains as markets
attempted to recover from recent rumblings in the Far East, with
the FTSE 100 index ending up 15.1 points or 0.3 percent at
5,083.9.
</P>
<P>
But dealers warned that the Asian financial crisis was far from
over and would continue to unsettle western markets.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street's robust opening helped underpin a cautious London
market. UK inflation figures today were in line with forecasts and
had little impact.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares closed with a gain of 1.76 percent
or 72.12 points at 4,159.40 on the DAX-30 index which fell 3.53
percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index in Paris finished higher for the first time in
six days, closing 40.39 points or 1.41 percent up at 2,902.93.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Delegation Leaves for US for More Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Jordanian
delegation left here today for the United States to seek help for
finding alternative oil source other than Iraq as well as more
U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
Jordan will ask the U.S. to help it reduce dependence of oil
supply on Iraq, which has been the sole oil provider for the
kingdom for years, said Foreign Minister Fayez Tarawneh, who
headed the delegation.
</P>
<P>
An informed source here said the delegation either expects the
U.S. would pressure Saudi Arabia to sell Jordan oil at
below-market rates, or hopes Washington would give more money to
enable Jordan to pay for Saudi oil at regular prices.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, also including Minister of Planning Rima
Khalaf, still plans to secure U.S. aid to the kingdom in 1998,
which is estimated at 225 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In October 1997, the U.S. congress approved a sum of 225
million dollars in aid package to Jordan to be included in the
1998 fiscal budget.
</P>
<P>
Iraq agreed to renew a deal with Jordan to supply it with 4.8
million tonnes of oil and oil products at reduced prices in 1998
after a ranking Jordanian delegation visited Baghdad for
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh visited Saudi Arabia last month in an attempt to
persuade it to sell oil to Jordan at reduced prices.
</P>
<P>
Jordan received from the U.S. 120 million dollars in direct
economic aid and 30 million dollars in military assistance in
1997.

<HEADLINE> Iranian MP Favors Restoring ties with US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian Majlis (parliament)
member Tuesday voiced his support for the resumption of the ties
between Iran and the United States, the official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
The improved relations of the two countries will serve the
interests of the two nations if the international standards and
mutual respect are observed, Majid Ansari was quoted as saying by
the news agency.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "Iran is willing to have relations with all
the states except the usurper regime of Gods (Israel)."
</P>
<P>
Referring to a proposal for a referendum on resuming
Iran-U.S. relations, Ansari said that if the referendum is held,
the result absolutely will be negative.
</P>
<P>
Since Iranian President Mohammad Khatami expressed readiness to
hold dialogues with the American people on December 14 last year,
most participants of a hot debate on the media over the relations
between Tehran and Washington have opposed rapprochement with the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
Many Iranian officials have even rejected the referendum
proposal, maintaining that the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei is the top authority to decide whether to start talks and
resume relations with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Ansari, the Iranian MP, also criticized the media, the state
television in particular, for "an inappropriate reflection of
President Khatami's interview with CNN."
</P>
<P>
In his interview with the American Cable News Network on
Thursday, the Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said that Iran
"feels no need to have diplomatic ties with the U.S." since
Washington does not change its policies towards Iran.
</P>
<P>
But he called for cultural dialogues between the Iranians and
the Americans to pave the way for a "better future for the two
nations and countries."
</P>
<P>
Ansari blamed the television for not raising the positive
aspects of the interview and failing to provide the public with
the political analysis of the statements made by Khatami.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time in a week that Iran's senior political
and religious figures attacked the country's media for "prejudice
against the president."
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, a Friday prayer leader in Isfahan in central Iran
Ayatollah Jalaloddin Taheri lashed out at the country's Radio and
Television Organization for its prejudice against Khatami.

<HEADLINE> TRC to Seek Court Ruling Over Amnesty to ANC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) today announced that it will seek
a ruling from the High Court on the validity of a blanket amnesty
granted to 37 African National Congress (ANC) leaders.
</P>
<P>
"We shall, as a matter of urgency, approach the High Court to
seek a declaratory order to ascertain whether or not the decision
made by the Amnesty Committee (of the TRC) conformed with our
governing act," TRC Chairman Desmond Tutu said today in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The committee granted a blanket amnesty to 37 ANC leaders,
including Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, late last year,
triggering controversy among political parties.
</P>
<P>
White-based opposition parties like the National Party (NP)
criticized the TRC of double standard in its handling of the
cases of ANC leaders and former NP leader and state president P.
W. Botha, who has been prosecuted for refusing to appear before
the TRC.
</P>
<P>
Tutu made the announcement after a meeting of the commission
on Robben Island off Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Tutu said his commission came to the unanimous decision after
careful consideration of the matter and with close discussions
with the Amnesty Committee, several members of which have been
present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Tutu also reaffirmed the commission's "full confidence" in the
Amnesty Committee and its operation.
</P>
<P>
The committee supported this course of action and both the
commission and the committee would abide by the court's decision,
Tutu said.
</P>
<P>
Both the ruling ANC and the NP welcomed the TRC decision to
refer the issue to the High Court.
</P>
<P>
ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said: "We hope that the courts
will lay the matter to rest once and for all, particularly in the
light of concerted efforts from certain political quarters to
undermine the integrity of the TRC and thereby bring the entire
truth and reconciliation process into disrepute."
</P>
<P>
He also promised that the ANC will respect the ruling of the
court, whatever it will be.
</P>
<P>
NP leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk said his party welcomed the
move of the TRC and that his party believEed that the granting of
the amnesty to ANC leaders was illegal.

WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. aircraft carrier
Independence will replace the Nimitz, which has been deployed in
the Persian Gulf since last October, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Independence, which is now close to Japan, will join the
George Washington, the other carrier in the Gulf region, but the
deployment order has not been signed out, Pentagon spokesman
Mike Doubleday said. "Soon as that happens I'd be glad to let
everybody know," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Doubleday said the United States had 21 warships, about 350
aircraft and 28,800 military personnel in the region. "We will
continue to maintain that force as long as needed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has maintained such mighty military force
since last November when a crisis erupted over U.N. weapons
inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A new confrontation took place on Monday when Iraq decided to
bar a U.N. weapons inspection team headed by an American whom
Iraq branded as a spy from carrying its work of dismantling arms
of mass destruction. Washington said it would act in concert
with its allies within the U.N. Security Council, but would not
rule out the use of military force to punish Iraq.

LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain, the current European
Union (EU) president, said here today that the EU would go ahead
with the planned EU delegation as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement issued
this evening: "We have agreed today with our EU partners that we

officials should visit Algeria at the earliest opportunity."
</P>
<P>
The so-called Troika delegation includes the current, the
immediate past and the next EU presidency state.
</P>
<P>
"We have also agreed that the objective of the Troika mission
will be to convey to the Algerian government the public opinion
felt in Europe at the massacres," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the other objective of the EU mission is to
"explore with them what can be done to end the violence, and what
the EU can do."
</P>
<P>
"We are now contacting the Algerian government to discuss the
timing and program for the proposed visit, with a view to the
Troika reporting back to the General Affairs on January 26," Cook
added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some 1,000 Algerian civilians have been
killed by some unidentified armed guerillas since the beginning of

</P>

chamber has opposed the U.S. embargo for decades.

<P>
"An open economy is the first step to democracy. The best thing
we can do is send 1,000 American business people to cut deals and
make it happen," he said.
</P>
<P>
Representative Esteban Torres, D-Calif., called the
restrictions on food and medical sales unconscionable. "This has
to stop," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former Representative Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., who headed the House
Ways and Means Committee, said the U.S. embargo against Cuba is
the cruelest ever imposed against any country.
</P>
<P>
They all argued that the nearly four-decade embargo has done
nothing to Cuba's government, instead, U.S. business and their
workers bear the burden of lost market opportunities to other
competitors.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Inspector to Begin Talks in Baghdad on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. chief weapons
inspector in Iraq Richard Butler said here today that he will go
to Baghdad over the weekend and begin talks with Iraqi officials
to find solutions to the latest clash between the United Nations
and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Butler, who has briefed U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
Security Council on what happened to U.N. inspection team in Iraq,
told reporters that he hoped that Iraq will change its mind and
allow the inspection to go on.
</P>
<P>
Issues on the agenda of his talks with Iraq remain those of
access to presidential and sovereign sites which Iraq disallows
the U.N. team to inspect, Butler said.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad's insistence on seeking to remove from the team certain
inspectors on the basis of nationality is not acceptable, he said.
</P>
<P>
The team headed by Scott Ritter and formed on Tuesday comprises
of 31 members from 12 nations, Butler said.
</P>
<P>
It "represents multiplicity of nations" and its members are
"all inspectors" and "all of the relevant disciplines, drawn from
nuclear, missile, chemical, biological and export/import...", he
went on.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing Iraq's charge that Ritter is an American spy, Butler
said Iraq is waging an "unrespectable campaign" against a
"perfectly competent individual" who is "a professional arms
control inspector".
</P>
<P>
Butler put Ritter as a man previously with the functions
"that were to do with the verification of the Intermediate
Nuclear Force Treaty between the United States and former Soviet
Union".
</P>
<P>
Iraq on Monday said it would bar the Ritter's team from
operating on the ground that it was dominated by American and
British members. It said the suspension would stand until the team
has a balanced composition.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council is meeting today on the Iraqi issue.
