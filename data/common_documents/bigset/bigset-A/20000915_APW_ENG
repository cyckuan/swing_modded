   LAWRENCE, N.C. (AP) -- When the ceiling-high floodwaters receded
from the Batts Chapel Missionary Baptist Church, members discovered
that a century and a half of history had floated away.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient pulpit Bible, old photos and books in the brick
church north of Princeville were destroyed by Hurricane Floyd's
floods. Half a dozen coffins were unearthed from the low-lying
cemetery adjoining the rural crossroads church.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Job in the Old Testament, the church's 60 adult
members didn't pause to seek an explanation from God.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we wasted time saying why. We began to think,
'What do we do to rebuild?''' said Sandra Jones, a member at Batts
Chapel for 40 years. ''God has taken care of us and he will
continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Batts Chapel, dozens of churches stricken by Floyd a year
ago found the strength to thrive -- not just survive -- holding
services in the buildings of other churches or with other
congregations. A year later, the congregations are stronger and
eager to minister to their home communities again.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw the mighty hand of God at work. ... We've come out of
it much stronger,'' said the Rev. Pat Kilby, pastor of Adamsville
Baptist Church in Goldsboro, which had up to $200,000 in damages
after a foot of rain covered its Sunday school classrooms and
fellowship hall last Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd brought up to 20 inches of rain, covering homes and
businesses in the region in several feet of water. The storm was
blamed for $6 billion in damages and 52 deaths in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many churches were damaged in Floyd's aftermath is
unclear. Dozens of Methodist, Southern Baptist and Episcopal
congregations received help from their denominations. More than 100
congregations -- many small or independent -- were helped through the
innovative Church2Church program.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Crime Control and Public Safety created
the program as a clearinghouse where distressed congregations could
be matched with other churches ready to help them rebuild. In the
weeks following the storm, Church2Church received more than 400
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were totally overwhelmed,'' said John Williams, who
directed the program. ''It turned out to be a larger need and a
larger outpouring than we ever believed.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven Springs Baptist Church resumed services at its small
sanctuary three months after the floods, thanks to workers and
money from congregations in Shelby, Indian Trail and Pittsboro.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wouldn't have happened without the Church2Church program,''
said the Rev. Ashley Summerlin, pastor at Seven Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Predominantly white St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Raleigh and
Olive Chapel Baptist Church in Apex were matched with historically
black Batts Chapel, which had completed thousands of dollars in
renovations just days before the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty people from the three congregations gathered on a Saturday
in November to begin rebuilding. It took eight people to remove
waterlogged pews. A piano that had been submerged fell to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we walked in the door, nothing had been touched,'' said
Kevin Pease, an Olive Chapel member and remodeling contractor. ''We
gutted the whole place in the day.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the renovations didn't begin until March, when the
building dried out completely. The three churches worked together
on 12 Saturdays through last month, hammering in new wallboard,
laying carpet and painting.
</P>
<P>
   Flood insurance helped pay to fix classroom space and the
fellowship hall, but not the sanctuary, Jones said. The church had
to borrow to complete the renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Batts Chapel members, who had been meeting nearby, returned to
their sanctuary Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just tremendously emotional,'' Jones said. ''I was just
about to burst. I was filled up. I can't find any other way to
describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The three congregations plan to celebrate the return with a
dinner on church grounds Saturday -- the anniversary of Floyd's
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   At Adamsville, Kilby found it hard at first to accept help,
especially because the church had been financially independent for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   There, too, strangers spent Saturdays knocking out rotting
wallboard and repairing toilets -- which taught Kilby a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ''God uses other people. It's easy to give but it's hard to
receive. It was a hard thing for us to do,'' he said after a recent
Wednesday night service.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday school classes and potluck dinners resumed in the
repaired education wing in March. An anonymous donor in western
North Carolina has agreed to pay $20,000 to repair a youth
classroom space and lounge.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding put priorities in focus, said Jim Dixon, an
Adamsville member.
</P>
<P>
   ''It helped people put their lives in order,'' Dixon said. ''I
think a lot of them were awed to the fact that you could lose it
all in a moment.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the futures of many churches remain unclear. More
than 20 congregations decided to relocate or start over, according
to Church2Church. In Princeville, the town hardest hit by the
flooding, eight churches have yet to return to their buildings,
said Kim Burwell, a town spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway Church of Heaven for All People is meeting again in
Princeville, while St. Luke's Church of Christ and Macedonia
Baptist Church are completing new buildings, said the Rev. James
Brown, St. Luke's pastor.
</P>
<P>
   It took months before the old building at St. Luke's could be
razed. St. Luke's also had to get approval for a loan for a new
$1.2 million complex.
</P>
<P>
   ''Depression set in for some members after seeing the old
building stand for so long,'' Brown said. Now the foundation has
been laid and plumbers have installed pipes. The 350 congregation
members, 80 percent of them left homeless by flooding, hope to
return to the new church next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tell people, 'God can put this mess back together,''' Brown
said. ''I believe it's going to look even better than it was
before.''

<HEADLINE> Riley Pitches Academy for Teachers  </HEADLINE>
By ARLENE LEVINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A ''West Point for principals'' is one solution
U.S. Education Secretary Richard Riley proposes to solve a looming
shortage of school administrators.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to be delivered Friday at Columbia University's
Teachers College, Riley also pitched the Clinton administration's
call for a $40 million investment in state or regional training for
school leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The tools of school reform need leaders to put them to use, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the school and district levels,'' Riley said in prepared
remarks, ''someone needs to nurture, engage and orchestrate the
teachers, parents, staff, community and students to use these tools
well and work as teams.''
</P>
<P>
   He was to speak at a daylong National Conference on School
Leadership sponsored by the nonprofit Wallace-Reader's Digest
Funds, which promote education.
</P>
<P>
   There is constant demand for people to run the nation's more
than 125,000 public schools, and a turnover of at least 40 percent
is forecast for the nation's principals in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The task is not simply to cultivate a new generation of
administrators, but to find candidates who want the job.
</P>
<P>
   While teacher quality -- and quantity -- has drawn lots of
attention, only recently has the short supply of administrators
become evident, partly because there's no lack of certified
professionals. Many teachers return to graduate school to boost
their qualifications and salaries. They end up with licenses to
work as principals, but never do.
</P>
<P>
   Alarms began to be sounded in recent years when superintendents
began reporting that instead of the 70 applicants they sifted
through to fill principal slots, they were getting five, 10, maybe
15, said Gerald Tirozzi, executive director of the National
Association of Secondary School Principals.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't reform public education one classroom at a time,''
Tirozzi said from his office in Reston, Va. ''Without strong
leaders in the schools, you can't have school reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers blame a host of reasons for lack of interest in the
top school jobs: long hours, increasing accountability for student
performance, more responsibility for school safety, pay not much
better than teachers make, the lure of better pay in other careers.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's speech noted some of these issues. He lauded efforts to
recruit leaders from outside education, and a North Carolina
scholarship-loan program where newly minted principals pay off
their debt by serving as a principal or assistant principal in a
public school.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of the School Leadership Institute. Proposed in the
federal education budget now before Congress, the institute would
create 20 state or regional centers to train 10,000 school
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The role of administrator needs to be redefined as well, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the future,'' Riley said, ''if we are still scrambling for
principals and superintendents and then asking them to take on
Herculean tasks, that leave them little time to focus on the
curriculum and improving instruction, then we will have failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said if the institute comes to fruition, thought should be
given to creating a ''National Academy for School Leadership'' akin
to West Point. ''Good schools are vital to our prosperity and our
national security,'' Riley said. A national academy could make
fostering school leaders a national priority.
</P>
<P>
   He also endorsed a plan under way by national principals and
superintendents groups to set national standards for school
administrators.

<HEADLINE> U.S.Deploys Warship in East Timor  </HEADLINE>
By HEATHER PATERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Backed by four U.S. Navy ships, hundreds
of heavily armed Marines moved onto the convulsed island of East
Timor Friday to deliver humanitarian aid -- but ready to defend
against any threat by militia gangs.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military operation comes less than a week after the
militias killed three U.N. aid workers in neighboring West Timor.
Other gangs have killed two U.N. peacekeepers in East Timor in
recent clashes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to provide aid and we don't want anyone getting in our
way,'' said Marine spokesman Lt. Jeff Landis, who was on the scene.
''Any militia activity that goes on in our presence, we won't
tolerate. We will basically get the aid to where it needs to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Landis said about 4,000 troops arrived Thursday aboard the
ships, which include the guided missile carrier USS Bunker Hill and
three amphibious vessels: USS Tarawa, Delouth and Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of those troops spent several hours Thursday ferrying
tons of building materials and food from the ships to the island.
The aid was provided to humanitarian groups, which will distribute
it to the island's needy.
</P>
<P>
   The troops spent Thursday night aboard their vessels and resumed
their task on Friday. Landis said they would leave East Timor
waters on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Marine spokesman Lt. David Nethers said the
troops -- members of the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit, based at
Camp Pendleton, Calif. -- would defend aid workers and ''assess the
threat and take appropriate precautionary measures.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. navy ships have brought in aid to East Timor several times
in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   However, Landis said that a warship was now needed to protect
the aid and the Marines delivering it from possible militia attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''If fired upon we are allowed to fire back in kind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The militias are the same gangs who opposed East Timor's
independence from Indonesian rule last year.
</P>
<P>
   At that time they went on a rampage, killing hundreds and
destroying thousands of buildings. The mayhem only ended when
international peacekeepers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the militias have fled to Indonesian West Timor where
they have used border refugee camps as bases for attacks into East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The Tarawa, with helicopters and Harrier jump jets, is
delivering aid to the capital, Dili.
</P>
<P>
   The Delouth is anchored near the southern border town of Suai,
and the Anchorage and Bunker Hill are off the isolated enclave of
Oecusse. Both Suai and Oecusse have seen rising militia activity in
recent times.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are here for humanitarian reasons and we feel that there's
no reason why we should have to use any force to get the aid
through,'' said Landis, a native of Sunbury, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. aid effort is operating independently of East Timor's
current U.N. administration, which is preparing the territory for
full independence within two years. It is also separate from a U.N.
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really about us trying to lend a hand to the East
Timorese for their transition to independence and help them rebuild
their country, and have a stable government and democracy,'' said
Landis.

Reno To Push for Puerto Rico Vote
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday
the Justice Department will take ''appropriate steps'' to deal with an effort by
residents of Puerto Rico to gain the right to vote in the upcoming presidential
election. A group of residents filed lawsuit in U.S. District Court for Puerto
Rico pushing for the right to vote. The judge hearing the case in August ordered
that Puerto Rico's government ''act with all possible expediency'' to enable
islanders to vote for president as a constitutional right. The Justice
Department filed its appeal Tuesday.

mission on the devastated island, a military spokesman said. Last week, militias
killed three U.N. aid workers in neighboring West Timor and other gangs have

Cruise Ship Criticized for Waste

   JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Gov. Tony Knowles lambasted the cruise ship industry
Thursday, saying recent tests of the sewage and wastewater dumped by ships show
disgraceful violations of state and federal pollution standards. Preliminary
results found that all 36 samples of treated sewage taken from 12 ships this
summer exceeded federal standards for fecal coliform bacteria, according to the
Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation and the Coast Guard. And more
than 70 percent of samples of gray water -- the unregulated and untreated waste
stream from sinks and showers -- exceeded those standards. Complete results are
pending.

Maytag Predicts Lower Earnings

   NEWTON, Iowa (AP) -- Maytag Corp. said Thursday that second-half results will
be lower than expected because of significant disruptions for retail home

would be $3.80, but as of late it has downplayed the likelihood of meeting that
estimate. Maytag said Thursday it expects earnings-per-share in the second half
to be down 8 to 10 percent from last year's second half results of $1.74 per
share. Maytag indicated earnings per share in the second half would be uneven,
with third quarter performance expected in the mid-70-cents range and fourth
quarter expectations in the low-to-mid 80 cents range.

<HEADLINE> Texas To Lose Federal Highway Funding  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas leads the nation in alcohol-related
traffic deaths and will lose $96 million in federal highway
construction funds over the next two years because state law is not
tough enough on drunken drivers, a state official said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cross, a spokesman for the Texas Department of
Transportation, said federal law requires the state to divert the
money from construction to traffic-safety efforts because Texas
doesn't ban open containers of alcohol in vehicles or automatically
jail repeat drunken drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's money that we would have used for construction and
traffic congestion and mobility'' projects, Cross said in
Thursday's editions of The Dallas Morning News.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Texas had 1,734 alcohol-related traffic fatalities,
about half of all driving deaths in the state that year, according
to figures from the U.S. Department of Transportation. California
was second with 1,351 alcohol-related driving fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, about 38 percent of all traffic deaths are
alcohol-related, according to federal figures.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen other states also will lose some of their federal
highway construction funds by Oct. 1 under a 1998 federal law that
withholds the money unless states ban open containers of alcohol
and strongly punish repeat offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Texas State Rep. Fred Hill, who has tried five times to pass
legislation banning open containers in vehicles, said he would try
again when the Legislature convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time the Texas Legislature fails to pass this, people
die,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Pushes Celebrity Politicking  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Al Gore pushed celebrity politicking to dizzying
heights Thursday as he traded laughs with TV's David Letterman over
rival George W. Bush's recent goofs, and raised millions with Bette
Midler, Paul Simon and company.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who strode onto Letterman's unpredictable soundstage to
the tune of Prince's ''Kiss,'' booed the talk show host's
suggestion that he had an anti-Clinton motive in mind when he laid
a passionate kiss on wife Tipper at the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to be chasing interns. That's really what it
said,'' Letterman said.
</P>
<P>
   Replied the vice president: ''C'mon, c'mon. Boo. Give me a
break.''
</P>
<P>
   In a video snippet and ''Top Ten'' list produced just for the
occasion, Gore poked fun at Bush for recently uttering a vulgarity
about a reporter into a microphone that he didn't know was live.
</P>
<P>
   Gore offered, among his list of rejected campaign slogans, ''We
know when the microphone is on.'' Another, referring to running
mate Joe Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, was: ''With Lieberman on the
ticket, you get all kinds of fun new days off. Vote for us, we're
going to work 24/6.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential candidate's coziness with movie
mogul Harvey Weinstein -- in the same week that Gore launched a
fresh crusade against Hollywood smut -- had Republicans crying,
''Hypocrite.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein opened his Upper West Side apartment to Gore and
Lieberman for a VIP reception with Harrison Ford and Salma Hayek,
and then caught a ride in Gore's motorcade to a Radio City Music
Hall extravaganza that, under the supervision of Weinstein and
Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner, bagged more than $6.5 million
for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   After saying nothing on the issue to the group in Weinstein's
apartment, Gore won lame applause at Radio City when he admonished:
''I'll be straightforward and honest about this. It is wrong to
market inappropriate material to children. I believe this very
deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   Performers following Gore to the grand stage made jokes of the
Democrats' latest campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Midler, who makes her TV sitcom debut this fall, said, ''Joe
Lieberman is smiling at me now. Just wait until sweeps. He's going
to be coming after me with a broom.''
</P>
<P>
   Comic actor John Leguizamo cracked that the fund-raising cast
''had to take time off from our jobs where we push a lot of sexual
and deviant material.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson was not
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore says he stands with the people against the powerful,''
Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But with whom does he stand tonight -- the parents whose young
kids are having their minds polluted and their souls corrupted by
Hollywood, or does he stand with the powerful Hollywood elite who
put money in his pocket here tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore began the week threatening federal penalties against the
entertainment industry if, within six months, it doesn't stop
marketing adult-rated material to youngsters -- as a Federal Trade
Commission report this week accused it of doing.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein released the NC-17 rated ''Kids'' about adolescents
using drugs and having sex. His Miramax studio was behind the
extremely violent ''Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Mark Fabiani said Gore representatives were in
contact with Weinstein and other entertainment executives this week
to outline the candidate's position.
</P>
<P>
   The night's songfest by Jon Bon Jovi, k.d. lang, Sheryl Crow,
Jimmy Buffett and others was the grand finale to a trio of concerts
that, along with lunches and dinners, earned the Democrats more
than $11 million for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Senate candidate and first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was
not given a role in the speaking program, joined the Liebermans and
Gores onstage during the final encore.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cruise, a newcomer to political endorsements, sent a
telegram of support from Spain, where he was shooting a movie.
Actress Julia Roberts said she, too, was going public in politics
for the first time after looking up ''Republican'' in the
dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   She found it, she said, ''just after reptile and right before
repugnant. Enough said.''
</P>
<P>
   Other stars were more brutally derisive of Bush and the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Matt Damon advised Americans to ''vote for the smart guy
because, believe me, there's only one in this race.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffet sang, in ''Margaritaville,'' a mocking of Bush's recent
mispronunciation of the word subliminal: ''Some people claim that
there's a woman to blame, but I know -- it's that subliminable
message thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching out to young voters, Gore met earlier with 11
twenty-somethings, gathered in the fashionable Westside Cafe Lalo
by daughter Karenna Gore Schiff, 27.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff called it the first in a discussion series dubbed ''youth
at the table.'' An MTV appearance by Gore on Sept. 26 will be the

<HEADLINE> Lupus In Black Bostonians Probed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The state will spend $600,000 to see if petroleum
pollution in largely black city neighborhoods contributes to lupus,
a potentially deadly immune disease, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The research, to be conducted over three years, will target
three areas of the city with unusually high levels of petroleum
contamination. Recent evidence has been uncovered linking petroleum
to a higher risk of developing lupus, according to the state
Department of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   More than 180 contaminated sites have been found in the areas to
be studied, said Suzanne Condon, the state's assistant commissioner
for environmental health.
</P>
<P>
   Lupus is a disorder that causes the body's own defenses to
mistakenly attack the DNA and proteins within healthy cells.
Complications include arthritis, blood vessel inflammations and
kidney failure.

<HEADLINE> Florence Prompts Watch in Bermuda  </HEADLINE>
By ADRIAN SAINZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Storm watches were posted Thursday in Bermuda as
Tropical Storm Florence showed signs of swinging away from the
southeast United States.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly stationary storm was 535 miles west-southwest of
Bermuda at 11 p.m. EDT Thursday and moving to the southeast at 3
mph with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph.
</P>
<P>
   It was expected to begin trekking eastward by Friday. Strong
winds and pounding surf were possible in Bermuda by Friday evening,
said forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it follows the forecast track, then they will be right on
the edge,'' said Richard Pasch, a hurricane specialist. ''They
could get wind gusts of up above 40 mph.''
</P>
<P>
   Rip currents associated with Florence and blamed for at least
three surf deaths Tuesday in North Carolina were expected to
continue. The body of the third victim, a 23-year-old man who had
been missing since he fell out of a kayak, was recovered Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they do not intend to reopen the two beaches
until Florence, which briefly was a hurricane this week, is no
longer a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a tropical depression formed in the western Caribbean
with a forecast track eventually taking it into the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The depression could remain near Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula
before entering the gulf Friday, said Eric Blake, a hurricane
center meteorologist.

<HEADLINE> Mets 10, Expos 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- The New York Mets know that every game counts,
no matter who the opponent is.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo, Robin Ventura and Jay Payton homered Thursday
night as the New York Mets beat the Montreal Expos 10-4 and
remained two games behind Atlanta, the NL East leader.
</P>
<P>
   Glendon Rusch (10-10) allowed eight hits in 7 1-3 innings,
helping increase the Mets' lead to five games over Arizona in the
wild card race.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to beat everybody down the stretch,'' Rusch said. ''We
need to play these guys just like we're playing Atlanta, or just
like we're playing Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo hit a solo homer in the first off Mike Thurman (4-6) to
reach 20 homers for the second straight season.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, in a 2-for-31 slump before his game-tying double in the
ninth Wednesday, hit a three-run drive on Sean Spencer's first
pitch in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's still a major contributor,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine
said. ''The numbers don't make a big statement, but his presence
always does. He's had a lot of key hits for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton, who hit a three-run, game-winning homer in the 10th on
Wednesday, added a two-run homer in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jay had another great night and Glendon pitched a great
game,'' Ventura said. ''Those are the things that you need.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurman allowed nine hits and seven runs -- five earned -- and
nine hits in 6 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thurman didn't have his best tonight, but he gave us
innings,'' Expos manager Felipe Alou said. ''We needed innings.''
</P>
<P>
   After Alfonzo's homer put the Mets ahead 1-0 in the first,
Fernando Seguignol's RBI double tied it in the bottom half and
Vladimir Guerrero followed with a run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch, 2-for-48 at the plate (.042) with no RBIs in his career
coming in, tied it with a run-scoring single and Derek Bell drew a
bases-loaded walk for a 3-2 lead. New York added a pair of runs in
the third on Payton's sacrifice fly and Mike Bordick's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Wilton Guerrero hit an RBI single in the fourth as Montreal
closed to 5-3, and the Mets blew open the game with five runs in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vidro hit an RBI single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Alfonzo had a career-best 27 homers last season. ... The
Mets have seven players with at least 10 homers. C Todd Pratt has
eight home runs in 145 at-bats. ... The Expos have signed a
two-year agreement with the Clinton Lumber Kings of the Midwest
League. The Lumber Kings will replace the Cape Fear Crocs of the
South Atlantic League next season as Montreal's Class A affiliate.
... Lee Stevens rejoined the Expos after returning home to
Grapevine, Texas, to rest his injured left big toe.

<HEADLINE> Clinton praises wife's debate performance  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - President Clinton raised campaign cash for his
wife's Senate bid Thursday night and said he was proud - and
nervous - watching her first debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I realize now what she went through all those years with me,''
Clinton said. ''Is he going to fall over? Is he going to smile?
Should he slug back? Should he just keep smiling?''
</P>
<P>
   The president, who aides say helped Hillary Rodham Clinton prep
for the debate Wednesday night in Buffalo, N.Y., gave her
performance a thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought she gave a good account of herself in a difficult
and challenging format,'' he said. ''I was very, very proud of
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the remarks as he hauled in some $350,000 for his
her New York Senate bid Thursday night at an intimate dinner party
held in the Washington, D.C., home of his old friend Vernon Jordan
and his Jordan's wife, Ann. Guests were asked to contribute $25,000
or raise $10,000 to feast on salmon, beef and homemade ice cream.
The money goes to New York Senate 2000, a committee set up by the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to raise soft money for
the first lady's race against Republican Rep. Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday night, Clinton helped raise $500,000 for IMPAC
2000 a Democratic group dedicated to the battle of redrawing
congressional lines set to ensue after results of the 2000 Census
are revealed. The group is headed by Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding nostalgic, Clinton marveled Thursday night at not
running for anything for the first tine in 26 years and instead
trying to boost the campaigns of his wife and Vice President Al
Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   He described voting for his wife in Chappaqua, N.Y., as ''the
most amazing experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was happy as a kid as on Christmas morning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''So now my family has a new candidate and my party has a new
leader and I have become cheerleader in chief, and I like it,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also hinted that he might want to turn his fund-raising
skills to a more personal kind of use.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had more millionaires and more billionaires in the last
eight years than any other time in history and I hope the next
administration keeps it going and maybe I can be one of them,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Census: No. of High School Grads Up  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 83 percent of Americans age 25 and
older graduated from high school, and over 25 percent have at least
a college degree -- both record highs according to new Census Bureau
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999, 83.4 percent of Americans 25 and older had high
school diplomas, up from 24.5 percent in 1940, the earliest records
available, and 77.6 percent in 1990, Census data being released
Friday shows. The percentage of people within the same age group
with a bachelor's degree increased to 25.2 percent, from 4.6
percent in 1940 and 21.3 percent 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the very large differences in education between younger
and older age groups, the attainment level of the total population
will continue to rise for some time as younger, more educated age
groups replace older, less educated ones,'' Census analyst Eric
Newburger said.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics are in line with other studies done on the
country's educational attainment, education advocates said. But
while applauding the improvement, they noted that more work needs
to be done to in improving education levels for minorities, and
especially Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   By race, 84.3 of whites had a high school degree in 1999,
compared with 77.0 percent of blacks and 56.1 percent of Hispanics;
25.9 percent of whites had at least a bachelor's degree in 1999,
compared with 15.4 percent of blacks and 10.9 percent of Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity is even more pronounced with foreign-born
Hispanics, said Linda Chavez, president of the Center for Equal
Opportunity, a Washington-based group that has been critical of
current bilingual education programs. Forty-four percent of
foreign-born Hispanics in the United States had graduated from high
school as of last year, compared with more than 70.0 percent of
native-born Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said greater emphasis needs to be placed on higher
education on young Hispanics born in the country, and ''more
emphasis on delaying entrance in the job market.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Hispanics have always had a very high labor force
participation,'' she said. ''There are some cultural changes that
in the long run need to take place if you are going to have
sustained economic progress.''
</P>
<P>
   By state, Alaska had the highest percentage of high school
graduates among those 25 and over, 92.8 percent, followed by
Washington (91.2 percent). West Virginia (75.1 percent) had the
lowest, followed by Mississippi (78.0 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia had the highest percentage of college
graduates (42.1 percent), while Arkansas (17.3 percent) had the
lowest.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very good news. It's evidence that schools have been
working to make changes to help make sure that more students are
successful in school,'' said Michael Pons, spokesman for the
National Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''It also shows that we clearly have some work to do and this
lets us know where some of those states are.''
</P>
<P>
   Other findings released Friday:
</P>
<P>
   --Adults age 18 and over with a bachelor's degree earned an
average of $43,782; those with only a high school diploma earned
$23,594.
</P>
<P>
   --Among those ages 25 to 29, almost 90 percent of women and 86
percent of men had high school diplomas in 1999. More young women
(30 percent) than men (27 percent) had attained bachelor's degrees.

<HEADLINE> Bush Party: Tape Appears Real  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. (AP) -- George W. Bush's campaign said Thursday
that a videotape mysteriously mailed to an Al Gore confidant
appeared to be an authentic copy of the Texas governor's debate
rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is investigating how the tape and other material may
have reached the Washington office of former Rep. Tom Downey, who
had been helping Gore prepare for debates. The Gore campaign
immediately turned the mystery package over to the FBI after
getting it Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears that whoever obtained that tape did so in some sort
of unethical way,'' Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes told reporters.
''The only people who would have had authorized access to that tape
were the most senior members of our campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes refused to speculate on whether the tape may have been
stolen or how it may have been obtained. Bush officials said there
was no evidence of a break-in, although the FBI will investigate
the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The tape showed Bush rehearsing with Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H.,
who played Gore in rehearsals at Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas,
about a month ago, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   The package, which was postmarked Austin, Texas, where the Bush
campaign is headquartered, also included a stack of documents that
appeared to be debate preparation materials.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said she didn't know whether the documents were
authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's less clear about that,'' she said. ''They appear to be
Xerox copies of legitimate documents from the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said that those who had legitimate access to the tapes
included herself, campaign manager Joe Allbaugh and top advisers
Karl Rove and Mark McKinnon, Bush's ad man. None of these people
would have sent the material to the Gore campaign, she said.
Whoever obtained the tapes, she said, is ''someone outside of our
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Bush, Ben Ginsberg, reviewed the tape Thursday
and concluded it was authentic, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the campaign was compromised, Hughes said: ''I
certainly hope not. Mr. Downey appears to have handled it in an
appropriate fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Downey, who said he didn't view much of the tape, said he will
no longer work with Gore on his debate preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, appearing Thursday on the ''Late Show with David
Letterman,'' made his first public comments on the mystery, but did
not bite at the talk show host's suggestion it was ''a dirty
trick'' setup by the Bush camp.
</P>
<P>
   Downey ''did exactly the right thing, and I'm proud of him,''
Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Protesters rail against death penalty at vigils  </HEADLINE>
By MARIA SANMINIATELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   JARRATT, Va. (AP) - It was a somber gathering for some 25
death-penalty opponents, who lit candles, meditated and prayed
while Derek R. Barnabei was put to death in a building just out of
their view.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very difficult, knowing what was going on inside the
prison,'' said Sharon Jadrnak, minutes after Barnabei's body was
driven past the group of protesters standing outside the
Greenvsille Correctional Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people don't know when they're going to die. To know when
you're going to die is terrible,'' said Jadrnak, who lives in
Prince George County.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters carried signs that said, ''Derek, we are with
you,'' ''The death penalty is murder'' and ''Abolish the death
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of capital punishment say executions of criminals are
themselves crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a human sacrifice, not for the sake of justice, but
for the sake of political gain,'' said Oliviero Toscani, an Italian
citizen who compiled a photographic essay of 29 death row inmates -
but not Barnabei - for New York-based Talk magazine. ''Whoever has
more condemned inmates has more votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie France McBirney, who lives in Norfolk, said she was
ashamed to live in a state that puts people to death.
</P>
<P>
   McBirney said she met Barnabei, a native of Somers Point, N.J.,
several years ago while doing translation work for a French writer
who interviewed the condemned man and began corresponding with him.
''He is very nice, an interesting and articulate person. I am still
convinced he's innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Vigils were held around the state Thursday as the execution hour
approached.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day in Charlottesville, protesters railed against
the cruelty of capital punishment and promised Gov. Jim Gilmore
they would not go away.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is America. We're supposed to be civilized. That's not
what I see,'' Ida Reid of Charlottesville told about 30 protesters
outside the local circuit court building.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said her brother, James Reid, has been brain-damaged since
a car accident 30 years ago, but he was still sent to death row for
the 1996 slaying of Annie Lester, a female acquaintance in
Montgomery County.
</P>
<P>
   Holding signs that bore slogans such as ''Life is sacred. Do not
kill,'' and ''An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind,'' some
protesters said the justice system is too unreliable and capital
punishment too brutal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone can get capital punishment one day and on a different
day, judge, and jury, he's acquitted,'' said Deborah Wyatt, a trial
attorney in Charlottesville. ''There's too much fallibility in the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt thinks public opinion is moving away from the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why are the European countries so ahead of us?'' she said.
''What's wrong with us?''

Gore Pushes Celebrity Politicking
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Al Gore pushed celebrity politicking to dizzying heights
Thursday as he traded laughs with TV's David Letterman over rival George W.
Bush's recent goofs, and raised millions with Bette Midler, Paul Simon and
company. Gore, who strode onto Letterman's unpredictable soundstage to the tune
of Prince's ''Kiss,'' booed the talk show host's suggestion that he had an
anti-Clinton motive in mind when he laid a passionate kiss on wife Tipper at the
Democratic National Convention. Reaching out to young voters, Gore met earlier
with 11 twenty-somethings, gathered in the fashionable Westside Cafe Lalo by
daughter Karenna Gore Schiff, 27.

   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- U.S. Navy ships and Marine troops arrived in East
Timor waters Thursday to counter any threat by militia gangs against an aid
mission on the devastated island, a military spokesman said. Last week, militias
killed three U.N. aid workers in neighboring West Timor and other gangs have
killed two U.N. peacekeepers in East Timor in recent clashes. Marine spokesman
Lt. Jeff Landis said about 4,000 troops arrived aboard four U.S. ships. The
vessels were carrying tons of building materials and food for the island
territory. The ships will leave East Timor on Saturday.

   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday
the Justice Department will take ''appropriate steps'' to deal with an effort by
residents of Puerto Rico to gain the right to vote in the upcoming presidential
election. A group of residents filed lawsuit in U.S. District Court for Puerto
Rico pushing for the right to vote. The judge hearing the case in August ordered
that Puerto Rico's government ''act with all possible expediency'' to enable
islanders to vote for president as a constitutional right. The Justice
Department filed its appeal Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Australians Cheer As Torch Moves  </HEADLINE>
By TED ANTHONY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- At the opera house, they packed the
water's edge and cheered. They watched from buildings, from a
docked ocean liner, even from atop the steel skeleton of the fabled
Harbor Bridge. They oohed and ahhed as the Olympic flame went by.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to greet the world, Sydneysiders paused at the edge of the
Olympics on Thursday night to see their downtown awash in
fireworks, an Olympic-rings light show and even a big round moon,
delivered against a cloudless sky. The collective exhortation: Let
the games begin.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shows people what we're about -- whatever that may be,''
said a smiling Gloria Garton, pressed up against a barricade with
her husband Thursday night to see blind Italian opera singer Andrea
Bocelli pass the Olympic torch to Australian pop star Olivia
Newton-John.
</P>
<P>
   Australian sprinter Melinda Gainsford-Taylor, women's captain of
her nation's Olympic team, brought the torch into the Sydney Opera
House grounds at dusk, passing it to Bocelli.
</P>
<P>
   He held it aloft before thousands of cheering people crowded
into Bennelong Point, then handed it to a grinning Newton-John. She
carried it off into the night on the last leg of its journey toward
Olympic Park and Friday's opening ceremony. Then Bocelli sang
Verdi's ''Di quella pira.''
</P>
<P>
   With the crowd roaring, the Olympic rings that hang from the
landmark bridge illuminated as the last sunlight faded, and
fireworks shot from the bridge's anchorage. Five helicopters and
the Goodyear Blimp -- rechristened the ''G'Day Blimp'' for the games
-- hovered overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all happening,'' enthused Lawrence Nethery of Sydney.
''The rings look fantastic, but the moon looks even better. One of
the best things I've ever been to.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A lovely day on the harbor,'' said spectator Lorraine Askew.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the seats outside the opera house went to the general
public; the other half went to those attending the Thursday opera
program. It created an odd juxtaposition: On one side, rowdy youths
held Australian flags aloft and chanted ''Aussie! Aussie!'' while
opera-goers in formal garb applauded sedately on the other.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd on the quay, chants and shouts erupted after a
clarinet player in the crowd performed a slow, haunting rendition
of ''Waltzing Matilda,'' the unofficial national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, downtown erupted into an exuberant festival of happy
anticipation. Exuberant fans popped champagne, guzzled beer and
sipped wine in the streets in a manner both jubilant and -- as
befits the Aussie attitude, it seems -- mellow.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's arrival ratcheted the excitement level up several
notches.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of early risers thronged the Harbor Bridge, many
chanting golfer Greg Norman's name as he carried the torch across.
Norman said he was overwhelmed by the crowd's size and fervor.
</P>
<P>
   By 3 p.m., four hours before the opening ceremony, Olympic Park
was jammed with spectators streaming in from downtown. The sunny
skies of recent days had been replaced by thick clouds, though
there was no sign of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers kept a tight lid on the opening ceremony's details,
as has become customary. But artistic director David Atkins said it
would be appropriate to both Australia and the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we've tried to do is reflect our culture,'' Atkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be a great showcase ... a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to show the world about Australia,'' said Michael
Knight, Australia's Olympics minister.
</P>
<P>
   Bocelli was a surprise guest in the torch ceremony Thursday
night. The tenor was driven in a golf cart to the podium, where
Gainsford-Taylor, who will be competing in the Sydney Games,
brought him the torch. Newton-John, known best in America for her
role in ''Grease'' and her hit song ''Physical,'' then ran in. The
three stood triumphantly, with the torch blazing.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic torch has been making its way across the world's
only island continent since June, carried by a variety of
Australians from Aborigines to athletes to a 109-year-old man.
Along the way, it has survived a theft attempt and a teen-ager's
novel if ill-conceived attempt to douse it with a fire
extinguisher.
</P>
<P>
   Australians who turned out to see the harbor spectacle Thursday
night said such events can bring people together and help present
their country's best face to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything important always happens right here at the opera
house,'' Garton said. ''Nighttime, it's like fairyland down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Added her husband, Allan: ''It helps people to forget all the
world's troubles.''

<HEADLINE> Jail Pushed Downey To Change Life  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Though he describes his first days in prison as
awful, Robert Downey Jr. says the experience has motivated him to
change his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have been the first to say it's unconstitutional, to
put drug abusers in jail or prison. Well, it's unconstitutional to
be a human being and screw your life up that way,'' the 35-year-old
actor says in the October issue of Details magazine. ''I wouldn't
wish my experience on an enemy. But there was value in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Downey was jailed in June 1999 after he admitted during a
probation hearing that he missed scheduled drug tests. He was
sentenced to three years in prison for violating his probation but
gained early release last month.
</P>
<P>
   Downey then moved into Walden House, a facility he had
previously lived in while trying to end his drug problem.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, he will have a recurring role on the Fox series
''Ally McBeal,'' playing a mysterious stranger who seems able to
connect with the complicated Ally, played by Calista Flockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm proud of the way I've conducted myself since my
incarceration and proud of the choices I've made since I've been
released,'' Downey said.

<HEADLINE> Vt. Gov. Deals With Civil Unions  </HEADLINE>
By ROSS SNEYD
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST FAIRFIELD, Vt. (AP) -- A small, hand-lettered sign hangs
from a utility pole on Vermont's Route 36 with the message ''Dump
Dean.'' Farther east, the words ''Gone Homo'' are scrawled on duct
tape beneath the governor's name on a campaign sign.
</P>
<P>
   These are difficult days for Howard Dean, Vermont's once popular
governor here in farm country, which in most years forms the
foundation of a Democratic candidate's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Civil unions, providing marriage benefits for same-sex couples,
changed all that. Democrats whose support could always be taken for
granted have abandoned the governor, and many are taking a look at
Republican nominee Ruth Dwyer. State polls show Dean's favorability
rating has slipped from 63 percent in February to 41 percent, a
tumble that followed passage of the civil unions law.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he showed up at a dairy farm Thursday just after
sunrise to begin his fall campaign for re-election. He's not taking
Franklin County, a Democratic stronghold between Burlington and the
Canadian border, for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be very clear that I'm not giving up Franklin County
for anything,'' Dean said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's kickoff came two days after a record number of
Vermonters voted in state primary elections and ousted Republican
legislators who supported the homosexual rights law.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two dozen people showed up outside Tom and Sue Howrigan's
new cow barn Thursday to greet the governor and listen to his
message about agriculture, education, health care, prescription
drug prices and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the folks had reservations about civil unions. But
there was still support for Dean.
</P>
<P>
   Dean's ''the better of all the evils,'' Tom Howrigan said.
''There's a lot of issues I don't really agree on, but I think for
the overall picture for agriculture, he's the better candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Farming still dominates Franklin County, where a few families
form the backbone of civic life. The Howrigans are among them.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Phil Hoff, a Democrat, said Dean needed to work hard
not only because of civil unions but also because after more than
nine years in office, some voters are beginning to tire of him.
Dean, 51, is running for his fifth two-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hoff said he thought it was unlikely Vermont would choose
someone as conservative as Dwyer, who wants to repeal the civil
unions law.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not terribly concerned,'' Hoff said, but warned: ''I don't
think it's going to be an easy ride or that he can take it for
granted.''
</P>
<P>
   So Dean is working to strengthen his base, drawing people like
the Howrigan family back into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've developed over the summer support among the leadership of
Franklin County that I didn't have for a while,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than civil unions, agriculture is what concerns the
great majority of people in this region. And, because it's what
they talk about, it's what the politicians are emphasizing.
</P>
<P>
   That's reminded some people who have been disappointed with
Dean's support for civil unions that they have much more in common
with the Democrats than that high-profile issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think when the dust settles, he'll do very well,'' said
Harold Howrigan. ''He's a good, strong businessperson, agriculture
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Howrigan has been talking to friends and neighbors about
what he believes are the good things that Dean has achieved,
including the governor's support for the Northeast Interstate Dairy
Compact, which pays New England farmers a premium for their milk.
</P>
<P>
   Among the losses if Dean were to be voted out of office would be
state Agriculture Commissioner Leon Graves, whom Howrigan described
as ''extremely knowledgeable with endless energy.''
</P>
<P>
   That message is being carried farm by farm across rural Franklin
County.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to stay away from politics,'' Sue Howrigan said after
bending the governor's ear about higher education. ''But I think as
it gets close to the election, they're going to realize the good
that he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean hopes so. But he sees signs like those along Route 36 and
knows he can't glide to re-election this time. So he spent Thursday
crisscrossing the state to continue the conversations he says he
wants to have with Vermont's voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm fighting in every county in the state,'' Dean said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Fires Scorch 11,000 Acres  </HEADLINE>
By GISELE DURHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A wildfire at Vandenberg Air Force Base that
forced evacuations in a nearby town grew to more than 11,000 acres
Thursday, the largest of several blazes in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Another fire that destroyed two homes in the Agua Dulce area of
the Angeles National Forest was extinguished Thursday after
scorching 750 acres of brush.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fire's pretty much out. Crews will be out there overnight
mopping up,'' said Diana Aronson of the Los Angeles County Fire
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Vandenberg fire, on the air base between Santa Barbara and
San Luis Obispo, was about 50 percent contained. The wind-whipped
blaze started Wednesday and spread to 8,000 acres within three
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters were helped Thursday by a morning blanket of fog.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fog layer is helping a whole lot,'' Santa Barbara County
Fire Department spokesman Charley Johnson said. ''We initially
thought it would take three to five days to get control, but now it
might be sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   A voluntary evacuation for the 200 residents of Casmalia was
lifted at noon Thursday, the same time Highway 1 was reopened with
traffic controls, said Bill Peters, spokesman for the California
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Protests Challenge New Economy  </HEADLINE>
By BRYAN BRUMLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- It was not the dreaded millennium bug or a
chemical weapons attack that crippled Britain's 21st century
economy this week, but a loosely organized protest by farmers and
truckers that hit a raw nerve: the supply of gasoline to the
transport system.
</P>
<P>
   ''The starvation of fuel to our key supply chains meant that the
nation was facing a major crisis in the short-term future,'' said
Geoff Dossetter, spokesman for the Freight Transport Association
</P>
<P>
   For the protesters, it was a triumph. But for Prime Minister
Tony Blair, and the leaders of industrialized nations around the
world, it was a reminder that their economies could become more
vulnerable as they become more advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Similar protests also hit Belgium, France, Germany and the
Netherlands, but nowhere was the impact as great as in Britain, in
part because the French government had already caved quickly to
demands of truckers, farmers and others who claimed that the double
whammy of soaring oil prices and fuel taxes was driving them out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   British truckers used different tactics from their European
brethren, who clogged major arteries in city centers and along
borders.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, protesters blocked fuel shipments out of the 10
refineries that serve the country. And that had an enormous impact
at steel plants, automobile factories, construction sites,
supermarkets and other retail outlets that in recent years have
vastly reduced the supplies they warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The digital revolution, which allows businesses to track more
closely the goods they use and sell, will allow them to cut back
even further, but it could make them more vulnerable to an oil
shock.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the just-in-time method of supply and distribution,
this is having a major impact. Companies simply do not have the
supplies on hand that they used to,'' said Vincent Burke, a
spokesman for the London Chamber of Commerce. Burke estimated that
the protest cost $1.5 billion, about 10 percent of gross domestic
product over four days.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarket shelves were bare of bread and other staples,
factories warned of layoffs, service stations throughout the
country ran dry, trucks and buses clogged inner city streets, and
tabloid headlines rained abuse on the government.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the supermarket chain Sainsbury's cautioned Blair
that food was likely to run out in ''days rather than weeks.'' Sir
Peter Davis said that ''suppliers, growers and producers delivering
milk, bread and everything else to us are having great
difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   The crunch came much more quickly than in a similar truckers'
protest 20 years ago, said Alan McKinnon, professor of logistics at
Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ''Supply systems are a lot more vulnerable now than they were in
the past,'' McKinnon said. ''This shows how our whole economy is
dependent on oil. And it shows how fragile the system is.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, companies are centralizing production and
warehousing.
</P>
<P>
   For protesters, he said, the message is: ''If you are intent in
paralyzing the system, you have fewer points to blockade.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain has 10 oil refineries now, compared to 23 in the early
1970s, during the first ''oil shock.'' Britain uses about the same
amount of oil, 79 million tons of oil in 1999, down from 87 million
tons 30 years ago. But the use has shifted from industry to
transport, with the number of vehicles doubling to 27 million.
</P>
<P>
   The new economy also offered means to ease the pain. The number
of conference calls booked through British Telecommunications
doubled, from 1,100 to 2,200 per day, said a spokesman, Simon
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   For courier services, ''demand rose,'' said Justina Hurley, a
spokeswoman for the DHL courier service. ''In some cases, we could
meet it. In others, we couldn't.'' To keep the pace, she said,
couriers arranged to meet customers ''halfway'' at drop off points,
or used bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   Two-wheeled activity jumped. ''It's been phenomenal,'' said
Sally Greenwood, who works at Chamberlaine's bicycle store in
Kentish Town. Repairs and sales are up 50 percent this week, she
said, drawing her away from her accounting. ''It's been so busy,
I've been running around the shop as well!''

<HEADLINE> Bush's Appeal With Men Still High  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ask men why they like George W. Bush and
they're likely to say he speaks his mind, has the courage to take
an unpopular stand and seems like a pretty regular guy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He seems like the kind of guy who, if things got tough,
wouldn't be afraid to roll up his sleeves and pick up a shovel to
help out,'' said Bush supporter Jerry Klaverweiden, a 55-year-old
independent from Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush has been able to depend on one group of voters
throughout the year, it has been men. Even as he waged his
''compassionate conservative'' campaign to split the women's vote
that normally leans Democratic, he's held a 10 to 20 point lead in
polls with men.
</P>
<P>
   But that advantage has been blunted, with Democrat Al Gore
surging in recent weeks and the vice president moving comfortably
ahead among women while cutting into Bush's lead among men.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore were statistically even among men, 45 percent for
Bush and 43 percent for Gore, in a new Pew Research Center poll
released Thursday, while other polls find Bush with up to a
10-point lead among men.
</P>
<P>
   Bush does very well among younger men while older men tend to be
more divided, polls suggest. White men still favor Bush by more
than 10 points in some polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason Bush has done well with men is character,'' said
Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People
and the Press. ''He has a strong lead among men for being a good
leader and for being politically honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Parker, a 45-year-old technician from Roanoke, Va., said
Bush just gives him a good comfortable feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just seems genuine,'' Parker said. ''There's nothing false
about him. I just like him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not always the reaction men have to Gore, although he has
been doing better recently on public perception of his personal
traits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Bush is a person of character and substance, as
opposed to Gore,'' said Nicholas Jalonack, a 25-year-old systems
analyst from St. Paul, Minnesota and an independent. ''I'll know
what I'm getting with Bush. I think he'll have sound logic to what
he does. I don't think he'll be bullied by the press to change on
the hot topic of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Bush's advantage among men is related mostly to party
identification, said Republican pollster Ed Goeas, who says gender
differences between the parties were sharpened by Ronald Reagan's
leadership of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ''Men are more Republican than women are,'' Goeas said. ''It
goes back to the single women looking for government help and the
safety net.
</P>
<P>
   ''Men tend to say government is part of the problem,'' he said,
''while women see it as part of the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's emphasis on tax cuts and military defense and his
selection of Dick Cheney, defense secretary during the Persian Gulf
War, as his running mate all enhanced his appeal to men, analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Kohut said Bush tends to emphasize values that men find
appealing such as support of business, opposition to government and
antagonism toward taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the things that push women towards Gore, push men toward
Bush,'' said Kohut.
</P>
<P>
   Friends in Texas often back up the perception that Bush is
decisive, fun to be around and gregarious.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got a very accessible personality,'' said Tony Garza,
Texas railroad commissioner and a friend. ''It's a function of an
individual who has a strong sense of self and exudes a confidence
that people are attracted to. Because he is at ease with who he is,
he puts other people at ease.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush demonstrated his personal touch when he would sit down in
the stands as owner of the Texas Rangers and banter with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   In a lighthearted poll question asked earlier this year, men
said they would prefer to spend an evening on the town with Bush
rather than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''He seems like he's more of an ordinary guy, rather than all
government,'' said Darin Callan, a 30-year-old electrician from
Axtell, Neb. ''It's like he's more of a normal kind of person
instead of all politics, all the time.''

<HEADLINE> Israeli Arabs May Not Back Barak  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- At odds with Israel's government over the
demolition of Arab homes and alleged police racism, Arab lawmakers
are threatening to deprive Prime Minister Ehud Barak's already
shaky coalition of key votes it might need for political survival.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Arab community leaders complained that Barak has turned
his back on them, even though an overwhelming number of Israel's 1
million Arab citizens voted for him in the May 1999 elections. In
his campaign, Barak had promised to make up for decades of
government discrimination in housing, education and budget
allocations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have every right to topple the government,'' Arab
legislator Abdel Malik Dahamshe said Thursday. ''We have been the
leading community for 50 years in poverty, in discrimination, in
unemployment, in house demolition and we hear just promises. And
Barak is taking us for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   A strong undercurrent of discontent runs through Israel's
neglected Arab towns and villages, and erupts from time to time.
The latest trigger was the razing of two homes in the Arab village
of Kufr Nahaf two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli authorities said the homes were built without a license.
Arab leaders maintain that Israeli zoning favor Jewish communities
and make it virtually impossible for Arabs to obtain building
permits. Arab legislator Mohammed Barakeh told community leaders
they should have protested the Kufr Nahaf demolitions.
</P>
<P>
   Dahamshe was blunter Thursday. ''A policeman who comes to
demolish my home -- the one who comes to break our arms and legs,
it's our right to protect ourselves and break his arms and legs,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they would investigate Barakeh and Dahamshe for
incitement.
</P>
<P>
   Arab leaders, in turn, accused the police commander of northern
Israel, a region with a large Arab population, of racism and
demanded his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the northern police chief, Alik Ron,
announced in a news conference that 41 Israeli Arabs had been
arrested on suspicion of hoarding arms and conspiring to attack
police officers and soldiers. Ron also referred to the incitement
investigation, prompting complaints that he was lumping together
civil disobedience and conspiracy to commit murder, and tainting
the entire community.
</P>
<P>
   Barak on Thursday defended the police, saying they were just
doing their job. However, he also said that the Arab community is
''loyal to the state, hardworking, under conditions of ongoing
deprivation.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing discontent comes at a time when Barak is trying to
rebuild his coalition and regain a parliamentary majority before
the parliament -- called the Knesset -- reconvenes in late October.
Three hawkish factions had quit the government in protest over
concessions they said Barak was likely to make at July's Mideast
summit at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his latest strategy, Barak hopes to build a coalition
of 50 legislators in the 120-member parliament, in addition to the
10 Arab lawmakers -- who would not formally be part of his
coalition. A peace treaty with the Palestinians would have to be
approved by at least 61 legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Arab lawmakers will back a treaty unconditionally, even if they
remain upset with Barak over domestic issues, Barakeh said.
However, as long as there is no peace deal, Barak's coalition
cannot count on the automatic support of the Arab legislators, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation is a sign of the growing alienation of Israeli
Arabs who make up 20 percent of Israel's population. Israel's
deputy foreign minister, Nawaf Masalha, an Arab member of Barak's
Labor party, said the prime minister should have paid more
attention to the community's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government hasn't related to them or spoken to them and
has taken them for granted even so they are frustrated,'' Masalha
told Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
   Arab leaders gathered this week to plan a strategy. They said
they would rebuild destroyed homes and have thousands of people
escort Barakeh in a show of force once he is called for police
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want our rights,'' Barakeh said. ''We are not trying to
wage war against the state.''

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Bomber Kills Self, Others  </HEADLINE>
By DILSHIKA JAYAMAHA
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A suicide bomber triggered an
explosion outside an eye hospital in central Colombo Friday,
killing himself and four others, police said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 26 people were injured in the explosion, 10 of them
critically, said Dr. Hector Weerasekera, director of the National
Hospital where the injured were being treated. The dead included a
policeman and three civilians who were passing by when the
explosion occurred.
</P>
<P>
   No one claimed for responsibility for the blast. However, Tamil
Tiger rebels fighting for an independent homeland have a suicide
squad and often carry out such bombings. They have been battling
for a separate area for the minority Tamils in the north and east
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't immediately clear if more people had died in the
blast, police said. Body parts lay strewn near the explosion site
and several vehicles were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   R. K. Nissanka, a fire department official, said a civilian
passing the eye hospital saw a man acting suspiciously and informed
a policeman on duty. The police officer went to question the man
who then set off the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a big noise and covered my face with my hands and fell
down. All I saw was people running everywhere,'' said J.W.
Ariyawansa, a patient who was coming to the hospital. His right
hand was badly injured in the explosion and a piece of shrapnel was
lodged in his head.
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lanka's health ministry is located next to the eye hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Police cordoned off an area two miles across around the hospital
and approximately 50 soldiers moved in investigate. Two army
helicopters hovered overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, President Chandrika Kumaratunga was blinded in her
right eye when a suicide bomber, believed to be a member of
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, tried to assassinate her during
an election rally. Twenty-five people were killed and more than 90
were injured in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have carried out three attacks in the capital this
year. In March, 31 people were killed in a bombing and shootout
near parliament. In June, a government minister was assassinated by
a suicide bomber. Earlier in January, a female suicide bomber blew
herself up close to the prime minister's residence.
</P>
<P>
   More than 62,400 people have been killed in the Tamil separatist
insurgency.

<HEADLINE> Boy Scout funding in Delaware threatened by ruling on gays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DOVER, Del. (AP) - The Boy Scouts of America's policy to bar
gays from becoming scout leaders could jeopardize the Delaware
council's funding from the United Way.
</P>
<P>
   United Way of Delaware has considered changing its funding
approach in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to uphold
the Boy Scout's policy, The (Wilmington) News Journal reported in
Friday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, ruling in June on a New Jersey case, refused
to overturn the ban by a 5-4 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The charitable organization's policy for client funding
prohibits giving money to groups that discriminate based on race,
religion, sex, age and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   The change being considered would add sexual orientation to that
policy, a move that could cost the region's Boy Scouts nearly
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''There hasn't been any reason to look at this policy until this
issue came up,'' said Larry Miller, United Way's director of
workplace campaigns and resource development.
</P>
<P>
   The policy has not been updated since 1992, Miller said, but
United Way's executive committee was expected to discuss the issue
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Del-Mar-Va Council of the Boy Scouts of America got about
$490,000 through the United Way this year, said Council Executive
Jim Gentry. That is about a quarter of its annual budget, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the short run, we probably couldn't make it up,'' he said.
''In the worst case, it would hurt our inner-city kids because they
generally have less of their own money to spend on programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The council covers the Delmarva Peninsula and is made up of
eight geographical districts and one overlapping district of
Explorer Scouts. It includes about 25,000 Scouts, ages 7 to 20, and
between 7,000 and 9,000 adult leaders.

<HEADLINE> Albright Warns of Milosevic Win  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
warned Thursday that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic may
''steal'' the upcoming presidential election and called on the
Serbian people to monitor the vote count.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, a traditional ally of Serbia, joined the United States
and four other key countries dealing with the former Yugoslavia to
stress they will evaluate the results of the Sept. 24 election ''on
the basis of internationally recognized standards.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day when Milosevic's supporters broke up the Kosovo
campaign rally of his strongest challenger, the election featured
prominently in Albright's meeting with foreign ministers from the
15-nation European Union and discussions by the six-nation Contact
Group on the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's supporters pelted presidential candidate Vojislav
Kostunica with tomatoes and stones during a rally in the industrial
city of Kosovska Mitrovica on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken law professor, who is leading in the polls, was
bloodied beneath an eye during the melee.
</P>
<P>
   After a lunch with EU foreign ministers, Albright told a news
conference ''we are united in our call for free and fair elections
in Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what is important here is that the opposition in
Serbia continue to work very hard for these elections, which
unfortunately we are concerned that Milosevic will steal,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is important therefore for the international
community and for the Serbian people to be vigilant throughout the
whole process, especially the counting process, so they can expose
what happened and reject the results if the election is stolen,''
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's information minister claimed Wednesday that Western
powers and pro-democracy forces were plotting to overthrow
Milosevic's government by declaring an opposition triumph in the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said there was a discussion Thursday of ways to
increase support for people across Serbia who are demanding a free
and fair election. She did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said afterward that
Yugoslavia has barred independent monitors from the Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe from observing the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia is radically polarized between Milosevic's supporters and
opponents of the autocratic ruler of Yugoslavia, which also
encompasses the much smaller republic of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has promised to release a substantial amount
of aid for Yugoslavia if the democratic opposition wins the
election. The Norwegian government on Wednesday said it would give
Yugoslavia $15 million if Milosevic is ousted. The United States
would also be expected to aid a democratic Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The six-nation Contact Group is made up of the United States,
Russia, France, Britain, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement after their meeting Thursday afternoon, the
ministers said they ''look forward to a democratic Yugoslavia, so
that it can be reintegrated in the international community and play
its rightful part in contributing to the stability of the entire
region.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic sources said putting the word ''democratic'' into
that sentence was difficult, because of concerns by Russia, which
has close cultural and religious ties to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo which has been under U.N. administration since the Serb
withdrawal after last year's 78-day NATO bombing campaign.

<HEADLINE> Habitat For Humanity Hits Milestone  </HEADLINE>
By ELLIOTT MINOR
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLAINS, Ga. (AP) -- It took 20 years for Habitat for Humanity to
build its first 50,000 homes. Four years later, the organization --
which uses volunteers to construct houses for low-income families --
is hammering the final nails into its 100,000th home.
</P>
<P>
   The construction push has stretched from a former president's
peanut farm to a restored building in New York's Harlem
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Millard Fuller, a former millionaire who founded the
organization 24 years ago, said the group hopes to raise $5 billion
to build 100,000 more homes in five years. With more than 2,000
affiliates in 68 countries, Habitat completes a home every 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what we're seeing is the emergence of a new social and
religious movement, which is ending poverty housing and
homelessness,'' he said. ''The growth of this work is escalating
tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   With growth has come criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Despite screening of prospective homeowners, financial
counseling and no-interest loans, Habitat has been forced to evict
a few homeowners who fell behind on payments. And since some
Habitat homes are located in poor, high-crime neighborhoods where
land is cheap, a few families have been forced to move.
</P>
<P>
   But those moving into the homes being finished this week have no
complaints. All the families must work on the construction crews to
build up ''sweat equity.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're putting in the finishing touches. This is really
exciting for my family,'' said Colin Baynes, who along with his
wife and 5-year-old son will move next month into the 100,000th
Habitat home in Harlem. ''Every weekend I was here working, putting
in time. It was a shelled-out building.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Habitat is holding its Jimmy Carter Work Project in
which the former president works for one of his favorite charities.
Some 14,000 volunteers are working to provide 22 new homes in New
York, 100 in Jacksonville, Fla., and 35 in and near Plains,
Carter's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   With saws buzzing and hammers tapping, 200 volunteers, including
former pro football player Rosie Grier and Bernice King, daughter
of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., swarmed over a
building site Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Swatting gnats and sweating in the south Georgia heat, the
workers nailed studs in place, hung sheet rock and painted walls.
</P>
<P>
   The group's 100,001st home, on land where Carter's father grew
peanuts and cotton, will be turned over to Eugene and Michele
Hughley, who are both prison guards.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the best blessing there is to see my daughter grow up in
her own home with her parents,'' Mrs. Hughley said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who turns 76 next month, said the site has special
significance to him because it's where he ''used to pick cotton and
shake peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, have volunteered for the group
since 1984, building homes on Indian reservations and in blighted
urban areas. The former president said human rights means more than
freedom from oppression.
</P>
<P>
   ''Human rights also involves the basic needs of humans for food
and shelter,'' he said.

U.S.Deploys Warship in East Timor
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- U.S. Navy ships and Marine troops arrived in East
Timor waters Thursday to counter any threat by militia gangs against an aid
mission on the devastated island, a military spokesman said. Last week, militias
killed three U.N. aid workers in neighboring West Timor and other gangs have
killed two U.N. peacekeepers in East Timor in recent clashes. Marine spokesman
Lt. Jeff Landis said about 4,000 troops arrived aboard four U.S. ships. The
vessels were carrying tons of building materials and food for the island
territory. The ships will leave East Timor on Saturday.

Gore Pushes Celebrity Politicking
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Al Gore pushed celebrity politicking to dizzying heights
Thursday as he traded laughs with TV's David Letterman over rival George W.
Bush's recent goofs, and raised millions with Bette Midler, Paul Simon and
company. Gore, who strode onto Letterman's unpredictable soundstage to the tune
of Prince's ''Kiss,'' booed the talk show host's suggestion that he had an
anti-Clinton motive in mind when he laid a passionate kiss on wife Tipper at the
Democratic National Convention. Reaching out to young voters, Gore met earlier
with 11 twenty-somethings, gathered in the fashionable Westside Cafe Lalo by
daughter Karenna Gore Schiff, 27.

Census: No. of High School Grads Up
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 83 percent of Americans age 25 and older
graduated from high school, and over 25 percent have at least a college degree
-- both record highs according to new Census Bureau statistics. In March 1999,
83.4 percent of Americans 25 and older had high school diplomas, up from 24.5
percent in 1940, the earliest records available, and 77.6 percent in 1990,
Census data being released Friday shows. The percentage of people within the
same age group with a bachelor's degree increased to 25.2 percent, from 4.6
percent in 1940 and 21.3 percent 10 years ago. The statistics are in line with
other studies done on the country's educational attainment, education advocates
said.

Palestinian Peace Talks Resume
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Clinton administration renewed its efforts Thursday to
end a deadlock between Israel and the Palestinians over the future of Jerusalem.
Hanging in the balance was a long-sought settlement of their half-century
dispute. The goal, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said, was to find a
formula that the two sides can accept -- a task that has eluded President
Clinton and all other American mediators who tried to find a compromise between
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's demand for sovereignty over East Jerusalem
and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's offer of some local Palestinian control.
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah backed the Palestinians in
demanding control of East Jerusalem.

just-retired Persian Gulf commander Gen. Anthony Zinni; Adm. Jay Johnson, who
retired as head of the Navy this summer; Gen. Ronald R. Fogleman, who resigned
as Air Force Chief in 1997; former Air Force chief Gen. Merrill McPeak; and
former Marine Commandant Gen. Carl Mundy, said Mindy Tucker, speaking for Bush.
She said the endorsements were expected next week.

<HEADLINE> Gore Raises More Than $6M in NYC  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Cruise and Paul Newman sent their regrets
while Harrison Ford was a surprise addition when a dazzling lineup
of entertainers showed up at Radio City Music Hall to raise
millions for a Democratic presidential candidate who's been
attacking their industry.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, raking in $6.5 million for his campaign in the Thursday
night event, touched on his criticisms of Hollywood from earlier in
the week, when he warned it must stop peddling excessive violence
to children or, as president, he would seek sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore won lame applause at Radio City when he admonished: ''I'll
be straightforward and honest about this. It is wrong to market
inappropriate material to children. I believe this very deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was quick at the fund-raiser to praise assurances from
some entertainment executives that they will act voluntarily to
protect children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's running mate, Sen. Joe Lieberman, took to the massive
lift-equipped stage to joke about his role as the ''opening act for
Bette Midler.''
</P>
<P>
   The frequently bawdy Midler cracked that she would likely be one
of Lieberman's first targets if he becomes vice president.
Lieberman has been a longtime critic of Hollywood vulgarity.
</P>
<P>
   Midler was joined by music heavyweights such as Jimmy Buffet and
Paul Simon, introduced by actors Michael Douglas, Julia Roberts and
more.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a Democrat,'' gushed Roberts. ''I've never done anything
political before.''
</P>
<P>
   Although not the biggest names on the bill, Sheryl Crow, Lenny
Kravitz and Jon Bon Jovi brought down the house when they pranced
on the stage and belted out the old Beatles hit ''Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The event capped a show business day for Gore and Lieberman. The
vice president traded quips with David Letterman in a taping for
his late-night CBS talk show while Lieberman went on Conan
O'Brien's NBC program and crooned a less than tuneful version of
Frank Sinatra's ''My Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson held a news
conference outside Radio City to accuse Gore and Lieberman of
hypocrisy for taking Hollywood's cash while criticizing its values.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pattern is always the same -- cozy up to Hollywood for the
big bucks and then tell the public we're as concerned as the next
guy'' about sexually explicit and violent fare exposed to kids,
Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting Lieberman testified to Congress this week about turning
up the pressure on Hollywood, Nicholson asked, ''What does it say
about a man's credibility when he criticizes them on Wednesday, and
then hobnobs with them and takes their money with a smile on
Thursday?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said Gore has criticized some of his
biggest financial backers while Bush, supported by the oil
industry, for example, has not.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, has had ties to a company that has produced
violent films. Nicholson said that's different because, ''My guy is
not having a fund-raiser here with the powerful elite of
Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Letterman chided Gore for the long kiss he planted on his wife
at the Democratic National Convention. Gore deadpanned, ''To me
that was just a little peck.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''You've been on the road too long,'' Letterman offered.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman even came close to making a prediction as he
introduced Gore.
</P>
<P>
   When Letterman launched a dialogue about environmental problems,
Gore used the occasion to poke fun at his own tendencies to get
overly wrapped up in policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are such a wonk,'' Gore said. ''Are you obsessed with
global warming?''
</P>
<P>
   Playing off a standing feature of the program, Gore also
delivered a Top 10 list of slogans supposedly rejected by his
campaign.

<HEADLINE> Gore concert and MTV Video Music Awards: More in common than you might think </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - It boggles the mind, but the concert honoring
Vice President Al Gore and Sen. Joseph Lieberman had more in common
with the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards than you might have thought
possible.
</P>
<P>
   There was location - the events were held, a week apart, at
Radio City Music Hall. And there was Lenny Kravitz - the musician
who presented an award for MTV and performed for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter where I go and no matter what it is that I'm doing
my whole thing is about preserving life and that's what I sing
about and that's what I'm here to represent,'' Kravitz said before
Thursday night's concert for Gore and Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   OK, but could this be as fun as the Sept. 7 MTV awards, where he
presented an award with model Gisele Bundchen?
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very interesting, very interesting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's concert was a fund-raiser for the Democratic
National Committee that featured performers including Jon Bon Jovi,
Sheryl Crow, and Crosby, Stills and Nash. Hosts included Julia
Roberts, John Leguizamo, and Salma Hayek.
</P>
<P>
   Both events also had controversy. Gore came under Republican
fire on Thursday for consorting with entertainment industry types
(the concert was put together for the Democrats under the
supervision of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein) in the same week that
he criticized that industry for marketing violence and adult
material to children.
</P>
<P>
   At MTV, controversy surrounded rapper Eminem over the content of
his song lyrics. Before the show, members of the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance Against Defamation protested MTV's support of Eminem,
saying his lyrics promote violence against homosexuals and women.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there were differences between the two events, most
noticeably, the fashion. Clothing at the MTV awards was about the
revealing and the risque. Lil' Kim wore orange plastic, Christina
Aguilera's dress had a huge cutout in the center that showed off a
thong strap, and Jennifer Lopez wore hip-hugger pants.
</P>
<P>
   There were no major displays of skin at the Democrat concert.
Roberts was covered up in a black jacket and tan pants, and k.d.
lang was in what looked like a jogging suit. Laura Dern wore black
leather, but the dress went to her feet and she wore a black
knitted shawl over it.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference might have been the media coverage. When
MTV took over Radio City, hordes of journalists from around the
world converged on the Big Apple, jostling for space in three-deep
lines.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's concert, there was plenty of standing room in the
media pen.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Transit Talks Near Deadline  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT JABLON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- County officials negotiated with bus and rail
drivers late Thursday as a strike deadline loomed, raising the
prospect of 450,000 people left without a means to get around.
</P>
<P>
   Three unions are involved in the labor dispute with the Los
Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Talks were ongoing as the 12:01 a.m. Friday deadline neared.
However, Goldy Norton, a spokesman for the United Transportation
Union, said there was little progress being made and predicted
there would be a strike.
</P>
<P>
   A top issue had been the MTA's call for a four-day workweek for
some drivers. But the transit agency announced late Thursday that
it had dropped that cost-saving demand.
</P>
<P>
   A strike by drivers, mechanics and clerks would shut down about
200 bus routes and three Metro Rail commuter train and subway
lines.
</P>
<P>
   All sides agreed that a strike would be devastating for nearly a
half-million daily riders. Nearly 68 percent have household incomes
under $15,000 per year and nearly three-quarters are black or
Hispanic, according to the MTA.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there was a bus strike, I don't have money for a cab --
that's $30, $40,'' said Jimmy Jackson, 36, who rides a bus and the
Metro Red Line from south-central Los Angeles to his $300-a-week
job as an auto detailer at a Sherman Oaks Mercedes-Benz dealership.
</P>
<P>
   During a nine-day strike in 1994, county employment dropped by
5,000 jobs, said Jack Kyser of the county Economic Development
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   A long strike could affect businesses whose low-paid workers
rely on mass transit, Kyser said, and an upsurge in welfare
applicants could also be possible if the working poor were unable
to get to jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 7 percent of county commuters use buses and trains.
However, the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, which
represents 800,000 workers, said it would support transit workers.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles unions have had renewed clout in recent years by
organizing low-income workers, said Jaime Regalado, a political
science professor at California State University at Los Angeles,
and director of the Edmund G. ''Pat'' Brown Institute of Public
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Recent victories have included unionizing janitors, home health
care workers and hotel employees.

<HEADLINE> Bush Wraps Up Calif. Tour  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Wrapping up a trip to California, George W.
Bush is marking a day of remembrance for soldiers lost to war in a
city rich with military ties.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will address a rally at a Vietnam veterans memorial on
Friday, National POW/MIA Recognition Day. The setting, in a
predominantly Republican town that's home to a Navy base and many
active and retired military personnel, was among the last stops in
California for Bush, who is struggling to capture the state's 54
electoral votes in November.
</P>
<P>
   Bush plans to return in two weeks and is sending his vice
presidential running mate Dick Cheney to campaign in California
next week.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP presidential nominee blazed through the state's central
region, skirting Los Angeles to visit Orange County, where he burst
into a small-town coffee shop to shake hands with startled patrons,
fielded questions from Hispanic teen-agers at a public high school
and held a rally in an Asian-American neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way he's sought to sell himself as a Republican who
cares about the concerns of minorities, wants to improve schools
and will help working families -- subjects not always associated
with the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Bush running behind Vice President Al Gore among
California voters. At a fund-raiser in San Diego to raise money for
the state GOP, Bush brushed off polls and said he's optimistic
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never been one to worry too much about the conventional
wisdom of the political process,'' Bush said. ''I feel great about
our chances. We are going to carry the state of California.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he ''can't wait'' to debate Gore at three presidential
debates that his campaign finally agreed to. The three prime-time
debates are scheduled for Oct. 3, Oct. 11 and Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the man is a great debater, but what Americans want is
a leader,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   While in California Bush focused on education reform and
military readiness. He planned to visit an elementary school on
Friday before heading to San Diego's Balboa Park to recognize POW
day.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign said several retired military commanders,
including some nominated to top posts by President Clinton, plan to
endorse Bush.
</P>
<P>
   They include just-retired Persian Gulf commander Gen. Anthony
Zinni; Adm. Jay Johnson, who retired as head of the Navy this
summer; Gen. Ronald R. Fogleman, who resigned as Air Force Chief in
1997; former Air Force chief Gen. Merrill McPeak; and former Marine
Commandant Gen. Carl Mundy, said Mindy Tucker, speaking for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has criticized the Clinton administration for running down
the military and says, if elected, he'll increase soldiers' pay and
spend more on technology and training to improve U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving California Friday, Bush was stopping in New Mexico
before heading home to Texas for the weekend. He was to visit
battleground states in the Midwest and Florida next week, including
a stop in Chicago Tuesday for the Oprah Winfrey Show and one in New
York for the ''Live with Regis'' show on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Campaigns Agree on Four Debates  </HEADLINE>
By DOUGLAS KIKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The debates are on, almost.
</P>
<P>
   Under a deal reached Thursday, Americans are to see three
prime-time presidential debates between Republican George W. Bush
and Democrat Al Gore, and one between the running mates. Feeling
pressure to get the matter settled, Bush gave up on the idea of
meeting his opponent in less formal TV talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   But the two campaigns still have to work out how the debates
will be conducted; they expect to iron out those details in a few
days.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like they want to get back at it and keep going and
resolve the remaining issues,'' said Laura Quinn, speaking for the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in San Diego, Bush, the one-time holdout, said he
was eager to get on with the debates, even while recognizing Gore
has a lot of experience in these confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the man is a great debater,'' Bush said, ''but what
Americans want is a great leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush yielded to Gore's insistence that they stick to the
schedule of the Commission on Presidential Debates, a private
bipartisan group that has sponsored presidential debates since
1988.
</P>
<P>
   The debates are to be held Oct. 3 in Boston, Oct. 11 in
Winston-Salem, N.C., and Oct. 17 in St. Louis, with each debate
lasting 90 minutes and starting at 9 p.m. EDT. A 90-minute debate
between the vice presidential candidates, Democrat Joe Lieberman
and Republican Dick Cheney, will go forward Oct. 5 in Danville,
Ky., also at 9 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said Bush wants a ''free-flowing,
spontaneous format instead of the rehearsed, wooden formats where
candidates are rewarded for memorizing 30-second sound bites.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was announced by Bush campaign chairman Don Evans
and his Democratic counterpart, Gore campaign chairman William
Daley, after their first joint meeting with the debate commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made great progress,'' Daley said. ''The American people
want to hear from these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party nominee Pat Buchanan and Green Party nominee Ralph
Nader, both registering single digits in national polls, most
likely will not meet the commission's threshold of 15 percent in
six media polls for inclusion. Candidates must meet those
conditions by late September to be invited
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations ended a standoff lasting several weeks in which
Bush held out for doing only one debate sponsored by the commission
and several less formal matchups in other venues, such as one on a
special edition of NBC's ''Meet the Press'' and another on CNN's
''Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials praised the campaigns for resolving the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''The major thing is that the debate debate is over,'' said Paul
Kirk, co-chairman of the commission and former Democratic National
Committee chairman. ''The credit goes to the campaigns ... that
they saw the wisdom of agreeing to it and getting this noise level
about it behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf, co-chairman of the commission and former
chairman of the Republican National Committee, said, ''The American
people ... are going to have a full airing of all the issues in
this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission leaders made it clear at the outset of the
meeting that they could not agree to moving debate sites announced
in January.
</P>
<P>
   Only two presidential debates were held in 1996 and one between
running mates. The record for presidential debates -- four between
Richard Nixon and John Kennedy in 1960 -- still has not been
matched.
</P>
<P>
   Daley was joined at the negotiations by Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman and adviser Jim Johnson, while Bush was represented by
Evans, campaign manager Joe Allbaugh and adviser Andrew Card.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign said Thursday that a videotape mysteriously
mailed to a Gore confidant appeared to be an authentic copy of the
Texas governor's debate rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is investigating how the tape and other material may
have reached the Washington office of former Rep. Tom Downey, who
had been helping Gore prepare for debates. The Gore campaign
immediately turned the mystery package over to the FBI after
getting it Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Soft Money Being Raised For PACs  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two dozen members of Congress are using
political committees to raise large contributions from
corporations, unions and wealthy individuals that they would
otherwise be barred from accepting as candidates, new Internal
Revenue Service records show.
</P>
<P>
   Those raising so-called soft money donations include several who
support a ban on such unlimited contributions, such as Senate
Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Rep. Patrick
Kennedy, D-R.I., the first-ever tax filings show.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Kennedy, the chief fund-raiser for House
Democrats, defended the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to unilaterally disarm while Republicans spend
millions of dollars attempting to disguise their right-wing records
and their special interest agenda,'' said John Del Cecato,
spokesman for Kennedy's Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Among the two dozen are the top four Republicans in both the
Senate and the House.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, lawmakers increasingly have formed
leadership political action committees to raise money they can
spend on travel, donations to state and local candidates and other
activities that sow goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   These PACs report to the Federal Election Commission any
donations they raise or give that are regulated by federal law --
donations that are strictly limited in size and usually go to House
and Senate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   However, many of the lawmakers have been taking corporate
donations through the PACs and spending it on items not regulated
by federal law, such as state elections, without having to disclose
them.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in the summer when Congress passed a law requiring
tax-exempt groups that engage in political activities to disclose
their donors -- including leadership PACs that take soft money.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, lawmakers whose political committees took
unlimited donations had to identify themselves to the IRS by
August. They'll formally disclose the names of their donors and the
amounts later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reviewed the IRS filings and found 25
lawmakers reporting they had PACs taking unregulated soft money
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes some top Republicans, led by House Speaker
Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi. Daschle and Kennedy were among the most prominent
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   While they can't spend their soft money donations to aid
candidates for the House or Senate, these lawmakers can use the
money to help state political parties or elect state legislative
candidates, who will redraw congressional district lines after the
2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Nebraska, with state candidates, they can take corporate
money,'' explained Deb Fiddelke, speaking for Sen. Chuck Hagel,
R-Neb., who raises soft money for his Sandhills PAC. ''This allows
us to use soft money to help state candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., spent the soft money he raised for his
Rely on Our Beliefs PAC to finance events at the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, we did some things there that were helpful in terms
of party-building activities,'' Blunt said, citing receptions he
underwrote for convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The list of lawmakers raising soft money for their PACs includes
nine senators or House members who support banning such donations.
In addition to Kennedy and Daschle, they include Democratic Sen.
Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, the
third-ranking Democrat in the House.
</P>
<P>
   These political committees give special interests another avenue
for donating to leaders of Congress -- and in amounts they could
otherwise not give the lawmakers' re-election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate candidates can accept no more than $1,000 per
person per election, no more than $5,000 from political action
committees per election and no donations from corporations or
unions.
</P>
<P>
   Their leadership PACs, however, can accept five- and six-figure
donations straight from corporate or union treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the abuse of soft money,'' said Donald Simon, general
counsel for Common Cause, the advocacy group that supports a ban on
large corporate and union donations. ''There are no limits. There
are no rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''For that reason, there is virtually unlimited potential for
corruption and buying influence,'' Simon said. ''That's why it's so
dangerous to have powerful members of Congress in the business of
accepting unlimited financial gifts from special interests.''

<HEADLINE> Scientists ready to remove mastodon bones from earth  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) - Paleontologists excavating the remains
of a mastodon from a backyard pond will this weekend begin removing
the largest bones.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday the scientists will begin removal of an 8-foot-long,
400-pound tusk from the peat-rich muck where the bones have rested
for the last 12,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   The remains were found last summer when Sheryl and Larry Lozier
dredged and deepened the pond in the backyard of their home.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists have since mapped the location of each of the
bones, which is intended to help the scientists investigate the
mastodon - a heavily built elephant-like mammal that became extinct
about 10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mapping should also provide the scientists with a picture of the
environment at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The excavation is being worked on jointly by the Ithaca-based
Paleontological Research Institution and Cornell University. Since
the discovery volunteers from local colleges have removed many of
the mastodon's smaller bones.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the mastodon's remains will be sent to PRI, where
they will be cleaned, studied and mounted for display. The Loziers,
who own the mastodon, are donating it to PRI.

<HEADLINE> Easing of Gay Blood Ban Rejected  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) -- The government is considering easing
the ban on gay male blood donors -- but its scientific advisers say
don't do it yet, citing lack of evidence about how it might affect
the AIDS risk in the nation's blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   All men who seek to donate blood are asked if they have had sex,
even once, with another man since 1977. Those who say they have are
permanently banned from donating blood.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that policy, in effect since 1985, is outdated
because better testing can now detect virtually all blood infected
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS -- and there's an increasingly
urgent need for more blood donors. Also, the gay community contends
the policy is discriminatory, forbidding donations by thousands of
men whose HIV tests show they're healthy.
</P>
<P>
   So the Food and Drug Administration asked its scientific
advisers Thursday whether it should change the rule to ban only men
who had sex with another man within the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   But the advisers voted 7-6 that there was not enough evidence
that it's safe to make that change. The FDA is not bound by its
advisers' decisions but typically follows them.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has split the blood industry, with half of the
nation's blood banks supporting easing the policy while the
American Red Cross, representing the other half, opposes any
change.
</P>
<P>
   Easing the ban would result in an estimated 62,300 gay men -- or
men who had experimented with homosexual activity only once --
seeking to donate blood, FDA medical officer Dr. Andrew Dayton
said. Out of that group, less than two units of HIV-infected units
of blood might get into the blood supply undetected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The current ban on gay male donors ''seems very
discriminatory,'' said Dr. Mark Mitchell, a Connecticut physician
on the FDA advisory panel. ''I feel very strongly that it needs to
be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was outvoted by fellow panelists who complained that the
FDA's estimates were based on mathematical models -- nobody knows
exactly how many homosexual men want to donate and how many of that
subset have HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ''I encourage the FDA to continue to look at possible options
for how this can be changed in a safe fashion,'' said Dr. Jeanne
Linden of the New York State Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   All donated blood undergoes strict testing for the AIDS virus
and other blood-borne diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nation's 12 million units of donated blood, about 10
HIV-infected units slip through each year, causing about two to
three HIV infections a year, said Dr. Michael Busch of the
University of California, San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But new genetic tests adopted by blood banks last year have many
scientists expecting to virtually eliminate even those rare cases.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as an extra precaution, the FDA also requires blood banks
to question potential donors about their risks for HIV and other
diseases and refuse the blood of high-risk people. The hope is
people will not lie, although studies show many do.
</P>
<P>
   Barred for life from donating are gay men, intravenous drug
users and prostitutes. Other people are forbidden to donate blood
for a year after certain risky behaviors, such as having sex once
with a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 8 percent of gay men have HIV. But many blood banks
are asking why they must turn away thousands of potentially healthy
men.
</P>
<P>
   Easing the ban ''should have no detrimental effect on ... the
safety of the blood supply,'' said Dr. Louis Katz of the American
Association of Blood Banks.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a matter of fairness, said Dr. A. Smith of the Gay and
Lesbian Medical Association. ''Like risks should be treated
alike,'' she said, asking why women who have unprotected sex with
multiple men -- another big HIV risk -- aren't barred from donating.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Cross argued that changing the policy could require
HIV tests to catch an additional 1,200 infected units of blood, a
big strain on the system.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot change our procedures in a way that would result in
increased numbers of infectious donation in our blood supply,''
said Dr. Rebecca Haley, the Red Cross's chief medical officer.
</P>
<P>
   The debate comes amid concern about blood shortages. Only 8
million Americans donate blood, just 5 percent of currently
eligible donors. Blood donations are decreasing about 1 percent a
year, while demand for blood is increasing by 1 percent a year.
Already, some cities routinely experience blood shortages during
holidays and the summer.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 5, Dodgers 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Brian Rose won his third straight decision
and rookie Ben Petrick doubled home two runs Thursday night,
leading the Colorado Rockies over the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Todd Helton was 0-for-4 with a walk, lowering his
major league-leading average to .375. He is 2-for-15 on the
Rockies' road trip and has only seven hits in 35 at-bats against
Los Angeles this season.
</P>
<P>
   Rose (4-2), who didn't get a decision against the Dodgers last
Saturday after being staked to a 6-0 lead, allowed three runs and
six hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Jimenez pitched the ninth for his 21st save in 27 chances.
After allowing runners to reach second and third with one out, he
allowed an RBI groundout to Eric Karros and retiring Mark
Grudzilanek on a grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies left fielder Todd Hollandsworth returned to Dodger
Stadium for the first time since the July 31 trade that sent Tom
Goodwin to Los Angeles and went 2-for-4, singling his first two
times up and scoring on Petrick's fourth-inning double.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Cirillo, who entered with an NL-leading .387 average with
runners in scoring position, capped the Rockies' three-run fourth
with an RBI single for a 3-1 lead against Chan Ho Park (15-10), who
allowed five runs -- four earned -- and nine hits in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Cora, in an 0-for-20 drought, did not move as a breaking
ball from Rose brushed his right kneecap with the bases loaded in
the fourth and forced in the Dodgers' second run.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockies got the run back in the fifth, when Park tried
to pick Jeffrey Hammonds off second and his errant throw deflected
off the glove of Cora and into right-center as Hammonds scored.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers closed to 4-3 in the bottom half on a two-out single
by Shawn Green, who needs four RBIs to reach 100 for the third
straight season
</P>
<P>
   Colorado made it 5-3 in the sixth when Rose singled for his
first major league hit and scored on Neifi Perez's single.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Donnels homered in the second, putting the Dodgers ahead
1-0.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Goodwin went 0-for-4, ending his career-best hitting streak
at 14 games. ... Donnels batted .328 with 27 homers and 84 RBIs in
105 games with Triple-A Albuquerque, and was promoted on Sept. 1
after spending a month on the disabled list because of a sore right
shoulder. ... Dodgers LHP Carlos Perez had arthroscopic surgery
Thursday to have a spur fragment removed from his rotator cuff. He
is expected to be ready for the start of spring training, according
to Dr. Frank Jobe. ... Dodgers C Jim Leyritz had an MRI that showed
a small tear in his right rotator cuff. It prohibits him from
throwing, so he will be limited to pinch hitting. ... Dodgers C
Angel Pena has ligament damage on the outside of the thumb on his
catching hand. He will play through the injury the rest of the
season, but faces possible offseason surgery. ... The Dodgers
committed three errors and have a major league-leading 131.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Vote For GOP Debt Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats are deriding a Republican
election-season plan for using 90 percent of next year's expected
surplus for debt reduction. But Thursday, many Democrats voted for
a blueprint of it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The House Ways and Means Committee voted 33-0 to create a
process for using 90 percent of next year's projected $268 billion
projected budget surplus for reducing the national debt. Only the
remaining $27 billion would be available for the tax cuts and extra
spending the two parties agree to over the next few weeks, as
Congress struggles to adjourn for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill reflects the GOP's newest stated goal: reserving 90
percent of next year's expected federal surplus to trim the debt.
Unable to force their biggest tax cuts into law over Clinton
vetoes, Republicans hope their new drive will help them grab credit
for debt reduction and limit President Clinton's efforts to use the
money to boost spending.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting the wide popularity of debt reduction, Democratic
leaders predicted the measure would sail through the House next
week, with many from their party supporting it. But they mocked the
bill as a GOP abandonment of their longtime tax-cutting priority
that would never make it through the Senate and would prove too
restrictive for even Republicans to live with.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the GOP plan would not leave enough to pay for
both parties' desires to cut taxes for telephone users, students,
inner cities and some small businesses and to boost spending for
schools, hospitals and nursing homes, fighting forest fires,
defense and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., defended the Republicans'
plan for debt reduction, saying it was their response to Clinton's
veto of major GOP bills cutting taxes for many married couples and
on large, inherited estates.
</P>
<P>
   Though stopping short of saying that Clinton opposes it, White
House budget office spokeswoman Linda Ricci said the GOP measure
''feels a bit like a bait and switch'' because it would last for
only one year. Administration officials and Democrats say the
Republican plan would leave room for tax cuts that would grow over
the years, crowding out debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also said the Republican proposal marked an
abandonment of GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush and his
proposed $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP debt-reduction plan means ''Republicans effectively
declared their nominee's budget dead on arrival even before it's
clear whether he'll be given an opportunity to submit a budget,''
said Ron Klain, adviser to Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the congressional GOP's plan
is ''very understandable'' because given Clinton's tax-bill vetoes,
it was needed to keep Clinton from a ''spending spree.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure, all of the Social Security and Medicare
surpluses -- plus most of the rest of next year's budget surplus --
would be directed to debt reduction. It would take 60 votes in the
100-member Senate to do otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republicans ignored a White House veto threat and
muscled two spending bills through the House on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With the Oct. 1 start of fiscal 2001 drawing ever closer, the
House approved a $414 million measure financing the District of
Columbia's government. The vote was 217-207.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, they voted 212-209 for a second bill
providing $30.3 billion for Congress' own operations, the Treasury
Department and smaller agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Both votes were nearly party-line, with Republicans saying they
had failed to work out compromises with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But with 11 of the 13 annual spending bills for the coming
fiscal year still incomplete -- including eight that face Clinton
administration veto threats -- Congress has a long way to go before
lawmakers can go home for the presidential and congressional
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained about both measures the House approved
Thursday, though only the Treasury-legislative measure faced a veto
threat by Clinton. They complained about shortfalls for student aid
and an environmental cleanup in the District of Columbia, and cuts
in Clinton requests for the Internal Revenue Service and
counterterrorism programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''In essence, this dog has three tails and no legs,'' Rep. David
Obey, D-Wis., said of the measure for the Treasury, Congress and
the telephone tax. ''It isn't going anywhere.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Make Proposals on Digital TV  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Broadcasters may have to deliver more
educational programming and other services to benefit the nation's
children under rules proposed by the Federal Communications
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also took action Thursday requiring that
manufacturers better inform consumers what they can expect from
their new digital TV sets and to resolve thorny copyright
protection issues.
</P>
<P>
   Digital television allows broadcasters to squeeze more video and
data into existing channel space. Broadcasters could use it to
provide sharper pictures or offer additional channels for sports or
movies, or stock quotes and other data transmitted to home
computers.
</P>
<P>
   By 2006, all TV stations must switch to the technology. During
the transition to digital, broadcast stations will air programs on
two channels-- one in digital and the other in the analog format --
so people can still watch broadcast shows on their existing analog
TVs.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC on Thursday laid out how digital TV sets should be
labeled so consumers will know if the sets can connect to cable TV
systems and if they have two-way interactive capabilities. The
Consumer Electronics Association, which represents television
manufacturers, expects the labeled sets on store shelves by the
holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also reaffirmed that it will allow cable
operators to require that television makers install special
encryption technology in digital set-top boxes. That is to ensure
that programs in the digital format delivered over cable to
televisions cannot easily be pirated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Program creators expect their digital content over cable
systems to be protected, or they won't make it available,'' said
Robert Sachs, head of the National Cable Television Association.
''Consumers will be the beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Joseph, a spokesman for the Consumer Electronics
Association, said the copyright protection being required by cable
companies could end up limiting the home recording and viewing
rights of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The move to digital television also is prompting the FCC to
re-examine the requirements of broadcasters to serve the needs of
children. The networks now must provide three hours of educational
programming each week, and they are limited in how much advertising
they can show during programs targeted at viewers younger than 13.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is looking at whether the number of hours should
be increased, in light of the fact that broadcasters could offer
additional channels with a digital signal. Because broadcasters
could use their digital frequencies to provide data over the
airwaves, some groups have proposed that schools be given some free
data services.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here's an opportunity for the media industry to really do
something to benefit kids,'' said Kathryn Montgomery, president of
the Center for Media Education.
</P>
<P>
   Following on the heels of a government report that said the
entertainment industry was marketing adult material to youths, the
FCC also said it would consider ways to ensure that promotions
aired during children's shows are appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is considering whether promotions could carry an
electronically coded rating -- as some broadcast television shows do
now -- so that parents could block out objectionable ads with a
V-chip.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters now can only air 10 minutes to 12 minutes of
commercials during shows targeted at children, and must follow
other rules to ensure that the separation between ads and programs
is clear to young viewers. But digital television opens the door
for interactive advertising, such as adding Web sites to shows.

<HEADLINE> Senate Sets Up China Trade Vote  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate votes next Tuesday on making normal
trade with China permanent, concluding two weeks of debate and
ending more than a decade of annual battles over trade's role in
stormy U.S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of that vote is not in doubt -- at least 70 senators
are expected to vote for the legislation that would give American
businesses access to far more open Chinese markets and require
China to abide by international trade standards.
</P>
<P>
   What wasn't clear until Thursday was whether supporters could
stave off a barrage of attempts to amend the bill. Trade backers
insisted it was crucial to keep it amendment-free so it wouldn't
have to go back to the House, which passed it last May, with time
running out in this Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Thursday easily defeated six amendments, bringing to
19 the number of amendments voted down over the past two weeks.
Many dealt with China's poor human rights record or the threat of
its exports to American workers, and were offered by senators
contending that this country should not give up trade as a tool in
forcing more responsible behavior from the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   Currently normal trade relations with China must be renewed
annually to comply with a 1974 law on trade with communist states.
But China's upcoming entry into the World Trade Organization
requires the United States to put normal trade on a permanent
basis.
</P>
<P>
   If it does not, U.S. businesses would not benefit from the open
market measures China will effect as part of its joining the WTO
and the billions of dollars in new exports that could result.
Business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the
Business Roundtable have made passage of the trade bill their top
legislative priority of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge to an amendment-free bill came Wednesday
when the Senate voted 65-32 to defeat a measure offered by Sens.
Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and Robert Torricelli, R-N.J., on
sanctioning Chinese and other countries trafficking in weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said Thursday that, just one day after that vote,
Chinese officials were again warning the United States of the
''grave consequences'' of building a national missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it ironic that, on the eve of our new relationship with
China, Beijing is threatening us,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Another note of discord surfaced Thursday when Zeng Jianhui,
chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of China's National
Peoples Congress said in Washington that Taiwan could enter the
135-nation WTO after China as a ''separate customs territory of
China.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States says that designation for Taiwan is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a letter this week to Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said there was a common understanding
with China that both China and Taiwan will be invited to accede to
the WTO at the same WTO general council session and that Taiwan
will join as the ''Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu,
Kinmen and Matsu.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States will not accept any other outcome,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Security High on India PM's Agenda  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Indian Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, intent on improving U.S.-Indian relations,
are tackling a main point of disagreement: India's nuclear weapons
policies.
</P>
<P>
   After a ceremonial welcome on the White House South Lawn,
featuring a 19-gun salute, Vajpayee planned a 40-minute private
talk with Clinton on Friday followed by an additional 30 minutes
accompanied by top aides from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has called the South Asian region ''perhaps the most
dangerous place in the world,'' a reference to the hostile
relations India maintains with its nuclear-armed neighbors,
Pakistan and China. India has had three wars with Pakistan and one
with China.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Thursday that
regional security concerns would be discussed at the White House
meeting and that it was important that both Pakistan and India
maintain their moratorium on nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries caused alarm here when they carried out
nuclear tests in May 1998. The administration has been urging both
to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and to exercise restraint
in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore was flying to Washington from New York
for a luncheon meeting at the State Department with Vajpayee that
was to take place after Gore addressed a gathering at Howard
University.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee talked by telephone with Texas Gov. George W. Bush not
long after arriving on U.S. soil on Sept. 7. He departs Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress praised Vajpayee's remarks Thursday before a
joint session of senators and House members. He said that after
long years of strained ties with Washington, ''the dawn of a new
century has marked a new beginning in our relations.''
</P>
<P>
   But a number of human rights and religious rights groups used
the occasion of Vajpayee's visit to highlight alleged abuses in
India.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch expressed concern about ''widespread caste
violence and discrimination, violence against the country's
religious minorities and abuses by Indian security forces in
Kashmir,'' the Himalayan territory that is shared by India and
Pakistan and which is at the core of the Indo-Pakistani dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International said Indian troops are partly to blame for
occurrences of ''torture, deaths in custody, disappearances and
political killings in Kashmir.''
</P>
<P>
   William Shultz, executive director of the group, said,
''President Clinton must use this opportunity to seek meaningful
improvements in human rights in India.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton told reporters that the two nations ''need
to have a better and closer and more constructive relationship,''
and that he hoped the United States could help end the dispute
between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at how well the Indians, the Pakistanis and the
Bangladeshis who have come to America have done -- the extraordinary
percentage of them who are involved in high-tech economy
professions -- it is tragic to think what this conflict has done to
hold back the people.''

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Foes To Receive Aid  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Clinton administration soon will provide $4
million to political foes of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to help
them try to end his rule, a senior State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress was notified of the grant recently, and another $4
million will be sent in stages under a program being worked out
with the Iraqi National Congress, which is trying to oust the Iraqi
leader, the official said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is not providing any weapons to the
opposition, said the official who talked to reporters under rules
that kept his identity secret.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 Iraqi dissidents are being schooled with Pentagon funds
on legal and war-crime issues, the official said. And documents
detailing human rights abuses are being collected for potential use
by a war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with eight of the
political foes, some of whom came here from Iraq. Others live in
exile.
</P>
<P>
   ''They proposed ways to hold Iraq accountable'' to the United
Nations and ''to the people of Iraq,'' Albright said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who really cares about the Iraqi people and the
recovery of their once-great country must listen to free Iraqis
like these who bravely speak the truth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. contributions are to be used to fund a newspaper, radio
transmitters and other media operations. An additional $268,000 was
given to the Iraqi National Congress for administration.
</P>
<P>
   Only the United States is providing this kind of assistance to
opponents of Saddam Hussein, the official said. None of the Arab
countries were willing to participate in what they view as an
attempt by an external force -- the United States -- to bring down an
Arab government, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the United Nations on Tuesday and on other
occasions this week Albright has denounced Saddam and his
government. She called him a villain and said at a news conference
Thursday: ''I genuinely have trouble believing one word out of the
mouths of any Iraqi official.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in more than a decade, at least one Iraqi
fighter jet flew into Saudi Arabia airspace last week, a senior
U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Iraq's purpose may have been to confront the
United States during the U.N. Millennium summit.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to put pressure on Saddam Hussein, she met for 50 minutes
with eight Iraqi opponents of his rule and discussed trying to
build a legal case against him, possibly with the formation of a
war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States salutes the courage of Iraqis everywhere in
the opposition,'' Albright said in a statement. ''I wish them
success in presenting to the world the true hopes and needs of the
Iraqi people.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright warned Iraq, meanwhile, that if it rebuilt its arsenal
of weapons of mass destruction or otherwise crossed U.S. ''red
lines'' it risked a U.S. attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a credible force in the region and we are prepared to
use it at a time and place of our choosing,'' she said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Albright ridiculed any suggestion that U.N.
sanctions were denying food to the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   She said oil revenues were so high ''they import 12,000 cases of
scotch each year.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not sure if this is food or medicine,'' Albright added.

at the request of the prime minister's staff, the White House said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Friday, as blue chip investors
sought bargains and technology investors took some profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.59 to 11,090.06 in the
first hour of trading. The Nasdaq composite index was down 33.35 at
3,880.51, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 4.77 to
1,476.10.
</P>
<P>
   Both moves represented shifts in direction from Thursday's

<HEADLINE> Clinton Won't Intervene for Lee  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will not contact Attorney
General Janet Reno to discuss his concerns about the government's
handling of the case of scientist Wen Ho Lee, presidential
spokesman Joe Lockhart said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton's staff already has been in touch with
officials at the Justice Department and would continue the
discussions to clear up questions raised by the president.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I don't expect the president to reach out to the attorney
general personally,'' Lockhart said. ''There is a fine tradition
that the Justice Departments operates independently.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rare public disagreement, Clinton said Thursday that Lee's
long detention ''just can't be justified,'' but Reno refused to
apologize and said the confinement was the nuclear scientist's own
fault.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old Lee, a former Los Alamos laboratory scientist,
went free Wednesday after pleading guilty to one felony of
mishandling weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, at her weekly news conference, said Lee could have avoided
nine months of detention by agreeing earlier to plead guilty and
tell the government what he did with the secrets.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis J. Freeh said ''the safety of the nation
demands that we take this important step'' under which Lee was
sentenced to the 278 days he had served. The government dropped 58
other counts.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Reno spoke, Clinton expressed an opinion far closer
to that of U.S. District Judge James Parker, who said Lee's
detention ''embarrassed our entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who met with Justice officials at the White House
before Lee's indictment last Dec. 10, said he found it difficult in
retrospect to reconcile how the government could ''keep someone in
jail without bail, argue right up to the 11th hour that they're a
terrible risk, and then turn around and make that sort of plea
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It just can't be justified. ... I, too, am quite troubled by
it,'' Clinton said. Reno did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are heartened that the president of the United States
appears to share some of the concerns that Judge Parker expressed
in his eloquent order yesterday,'' Lee attorney Mark Holscher said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart told reporters
Clinton's comments should not be read ''as a blanket criticism of
anyone'' and added that Reno and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
retain Clinton's support.
</P>
<P>
   Also, on David Letterman's show, Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic presidential nominee, refused to say whether the Justice
Department should apologize, saying he did not want to comment on
an ongoing legal proceeding. But he did note ''the underlying
problem was very serious because nuclear secrets have to be
protected absolutely and completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who have spent months calling Reno too timid in
investigating leaks from Los Alamos slammed her for being too
aggressive with Lee.

   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.55 to 11,081.92 in the
first hour of trading. The Nasdaq composite index was down 44.56 at

<HEADLINE> Talks With India Focus On Nukes  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Indian Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, intent on improving U.S.-Indian relations,
are tackling a main point of disagreement: India's nuclear weapons
policies.
</P>
<P>
   After a ceremonial welcome on the White House South Lawn,
featuring a 19-gun salute, Vajpayee planned a 40-minute private
talk with Clinton on Friday followed by an additional 30 minutes
accompanied by top aides from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders canceled plans for an afternoon news conference
at the request of the prime minister's staff, the White House said.
''It has been very long trip, an exhausting trip for the prime
minister and they felt that the last event of the day, the press
conference, was a little bit too much,' presidential spokesman Joe
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has called the South Asian region ''perhaps the most
dangerous place in the world,'' a reference to the hostile
relations India maintains with its nuclear-armed neighbors,
Pakistan and China. India has had three wars with Pakistan and one
with China.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Thursday that
regional security concerns would be discussed at the White House
meeting and that it was important that both Pakistan and India
maintain their moratorium on nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries caused alarm here when they carried out
nuclear tests in May 1998. The administration has been urging both
to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and to exercise restraint
in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore was flying to Washington from New York
for a luncheon meeting at the State Department with Vajpayee that
was to take place after Gore addressed a gathering at Howard
University.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee talked by telephone with Texas Gov. George W. Bush not
long after arriving on U.S. soil on Sept. 7. He departs Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress praised Vajpayee's remarks Thursday before a
joint session of senators and House members. He said that after
long years of strained ties with Washington, ''the dawn of a new
century has marked a new beginning in our relations.''
</P>
<P>
   But a number of human rights and religious rights groups used
the occasion of Vajpayee's visit to highlight alleged abuses in
India.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch expressed concern about ''widespread caste
violence and discrimination, violence against the country's
religious minorities and abuses by Indian security forces in
Kashmir,'' the Himalayan territory that is shared by India and
Pakistan and which is at the core of the Indo-Pakistani dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International said Indian troops are partly to blame for
occurrences of ''torture, deaths in custody, disappearances and
political killings in Kashmir.''
</P>
<P>
   William Schulz, executive director of the group, said,
''President Clinton must use this opportunity to seek meaningful
improvements in human rights in India.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton told reporters that the two nations ''need
to have a better and closer and more constructive relationship,''
and that he hoped the United States could help end the dispute
between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at how well the Indians, the Pakistanis and the
Bangladeshis who have come to America have done -- the extraordinary
percentage of them who are involved in high-tech economy
professions -- it is tragic to think what this conflict has done to
hold back the people.''

<HEADLINE> Albright Seeks Meeting With Iranian  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is
seeking an icebreaking meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly ministerial
debate, U.S. officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Iran are both members of an eight-country
group trying to move the peace process forward in Afghanistan.
Ministers of the so-called ''Six-Plus-Two'' group meet late Friday
at U.N. headquarters, and Albright and Kharrazi both planned to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said Albright was interested in talking
with Kharrazi and had for some time been hoping to establish a
high-level contact. The United States broke diplomatic relations
with Iran after the 1979 hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   An Iranian spokesman, Hossein Nosrat, said Kharrazi planned to
attend the meeting, but declined to say whether the minister
planned to talk with Albright.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been seeking to improve relations with
Iran since the 1997 election of President Mohammad Khatami, a
moderate cleric. Earlier this year, the United States lifted a ban
on U.S. imports of Iranian luxury goods and called for a ''new
relationship'' with the country.
</P>
<P>
   During the U.N. Millennium Summit last week, President Clinton
attended Khatami's speech. Albright was also in the audience when
Khatami addressed a conference on the sidelines of the summit on
the importance of forging a ''dialogue among civilizations.''
</P>
<P>
   A week before the summit, four U.S. lawmakers, including Sen.
Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, met with the speaker of
Iran's parliament, or Majlis, Mehdi Karrubi, during a cocktail
reception in New York, the first such meeting of U.S. and Iranian
lawmakers since the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, hopes were raised that Albright and Kharrazi
would meet at a similar ministerial level meeting of the
''Six-Plus-Two'' group on Afghanistan on the sidelines of the U.N.
General Assembly ministerial debate.
</P>
<P>
   But at the last minute, Kharrazi didn't show up, sending a
deputy in his place.
</P>
<P>
   While Albright and the deputy, Mohammad Javad Zarif, didn't
shake hands or even sit next to each other, it was at the time the
highest-level diplomatic contact between the two governments since
radical followers of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini seized
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and took 52 Americans hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Six-Plus-Two'' group includes China, Iran, Pakistan,
Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Report: Pentagon Needs Extra $50B  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States would have to spend an extra
$50 billion a year over the next 15 years just to keep the military
the size it is today, the Congressional Budget Office says.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the Pentagon and Energy Department nuclear
weapon program should be spending about $340 billion annually to
keep the military in a ''steady state'' -- to hold constant the
number of personnel and military bases and to keep replacing
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   As a comparison, this year's appropriation was $289 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The report released Thursday does not recommend the additional
spending and neither Defense Department nor other officials believe
the military should necessarily stay the same in size and mission
as it is today. For example, the military often doesn't simply
replace weapons by the numbers but develops better ones -- and so
uses fewer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody is proposing that we purchase new versions of the
equipment that we are using today on a one-for-one basis,'' said
Adm. Craig Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The report was produced to give officials a yardstick on costs
as the new administration next year looks at what changes it might
want to make in U.S. military forces.

<HEADLINE> UN Still Wants Answer On Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The United Nations' top human rights official said
Friday she is still seeking a ''credible response'' from Russia to
allegations of widespread human rights abuses in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stand ready to hold senior level discussions'' with the
Russian government on the rights situation, U.N. High Commissioner
for Human Rights Mary Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I continue to be deeply concerned about reports of alleged
serious human rights violations in Chechnya and convinced of the
need for these to be addressed,'' Robinson told an informal session
of the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Russia became the first permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council to suffer a formal rebuke from the 53-nation
commission, which criticized Moscow for ''disproportionate and
indiscriminate use of Russian military force, including attacks
against civilians'' in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, put forward by the European Union, urged Moscow
to set up a commission of inquiry and allow in special U.N.
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities -- who snubbed Robinson during a visit to the
region last spring -- denounced the U.N. move and said they wouldn't
be bound by the U.N. resolution on allowing in investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ''My chief concern remains that there be a credible response
from the Russian authorities commensurate with the scale of the
allegations of serious human rights abuses in Chechnya,'' Robinson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government has said U.N. rights investigators can
visit the region only as part of their general mandate and not in
connection with the human rights resolution in Chechnya, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were pushed out of Chechnya in a 1994-96 war,
which ended with the breakaway region's de facto independence.
</P>
<P>
   The troops rolled back in a year ago, after rebels raided
Dagestan and after apartment bombings in Russia that killed about
300 people. The rebels, seeking independence for Chechnya, have
denied responsibility for the bombings.

minister and World Health Organization officials had driven by.
</P>
<P>
   No one claimed for responsibility for the blast, which injured
24 people, four critically.
</P>
<P>
   But police blamed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebel
group, which has a suicide squad and often carries out such
bombings. The rebels, who seldom comment on such attacks, have been
battling for a separate area for the minority Tamils in the north
and east since 1983. More than 62,400 people have been killed in
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Health Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva told The Associated
Press he thought he was the target of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''I passed that way just seven minutes before the blast. I
suspect I was the target,'' de Silva said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the explosion, World Health Organization
officials also drove past the area for a scheduled meeting with de
Silva at the Health Ministry. The ministry's offices are located
next to the Eye Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Department Chief R. K. Nissanka said the bomber triggered
the explosion when a policeman approached him for questioning. A
civilian had told police the man was acting suspiciously.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a big noise and covered my face with my hands and fell
down. All I saw was people running everywhere,'' said J.W.
Ariyawansa, who was heading into the Eye Hospital for treatment at
the time of the blast. His right hand was badly injured and a piece
of shrapnel lodged in his head.
</P>
<P>
   The suicide bomber and the policeman were killed instantly in
Friday's attack. Three people died en route to the National
Hospital, and two died after arriving in the emergency ward, said
Pushpa Soysa, head of the nurses training unit. Of the 24 injured,
10 underwent surgery and four were in critical condition, Soysa
said.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the blast, a special police team were searching
hotels in the city for suspected LTTE members, said Bodhi Liyanage,
deputy inspector general of police.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an emergency operation and will continue until late in
the night,'' he said. State television reported that four persons
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have been blamed for three bombings in the capital
this year. In January, a suicide bomber blew herself up near the
prime minister's residence. In March, 31 people were killed in a
bombing and shootout near Parliament. In June, a Cabinet minister
was assassinated by a suicide bomber.
</P>
<P>
   President Chandrika Kumaratunga was blinded in her right eye
last Dec. 18 when a suicide bomber tried to assassinate her at an
election rally, when 25 people were killed and more than 90 were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have also been blamed for the suicide bomb
assassinations of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on May
21, 1991 and Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa on May 1,
1993.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav War Crime Prosecution Slow  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The legal clock is ticking against
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and other war crimes
fugitives, but even if they were captured today it could take years
to bring them to trial, a senior tribunal official warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic, accused of masterminding the ''ethnic cleansing'' of
non-Serbs from areas of Bosnia during the 1991-95 war, tops the
tribunal's list of wanted war criminals, along with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic reportedly has been sighted near Sarajevo, but
authorities in the Serbian part of Bosnia refuse to arrest him, and
the area is out-of-bounds for international troops empowered to
seize him.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Jacques Heintz, deputy registrar of the U.N. International
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, said Karadzic's arrest
is inevitable because political and logistical obstacles to the
arrest of the fugitives are disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   NATO peacekeepers, who had been reluctant to undertake a risky
arrest operation, have shown greater willingness to carry out the
tribunal's arrest warrants. Heintz cited the arrest of Karadzic
aide Momcilo Krajisnik by French troops in April. He said
Karadzic's turn is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all convinced that he will be arrested,'' Heintz said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's in an open air prison already,'' Heintz told The
Associated Press. ''It's simply a question of patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the tribunal's deputy prosecutor, Graham
Blewitt, said Karadzic might be arrested before elections in Bosnia
in November, but Heintz said any arrest had no connection with the
election and it could happen either before or after.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is ''a completely different situation,'' Heintz said.
''He is a head of state. As long as he remains in Yugoslavia he can
believe that he is well protected.''
</P>
<P>
   But he suggested that Milosevic's waning popularity in Serbian
opinion polls shows that ''again this is a question of patience.
Things are changing and will change one day.''
</P>
<P>
   With some 40 suspects in custody and trials under way in all the
tribunal's three chambers, Heintz said the tribunal is working at
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever is arrested today, whoever it is -- small, medium or
big fish -- he would have to wait in custody for probably 18 to 24
months before the start of his trial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The basic problem we are facing here,'' he said, is that ''at
this moment we are not able to render justice in a reasonable
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Heintz has put together a report proposing that the United
Nations appoint reserve judges to be called to hear cases in
addition to the tribunal's permanent 14-member panel.

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels Find 51 Bodies  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Congolese rebels discovered the bodies of
51 civilians who appeared to have been shot at close range by
government troops retreating from the northwestern town of Dongo, a
rebel leader said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Pierre Bemba, leader of the Ugandan-backed Congolese
Liberation Movement that is fighting to oust President Laurent
Kabila, said the 47 men and four women had been killed Sept. 8 in a
house in Dongo, about 435 miles northeast of the capital, Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on a satellite telephone from his northern headquarters
in Gbadolite, Bemba said the bodies were found when the rebels took
Dongo on Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Bemba said two survivors who escaped through the window of the
house before the government soldiers opened fire told his men about
the killings.
</P>
<P>
   A group of foreign journalists who visited Dongo saw the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   A government official denied his forces were involved in the
killings. ''This is completely false. We couldn't in any such
manner sacrifice our people,'' said Commandant Masongze Asindi,
secretary to the chief of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Bemba said it was the second time that Kabila's troops had
intentionally killed civilians. He said at least 120 people were
found shot dead in Zongo, on the border with the Central African
Republic, earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   All sides in Congo's two-year civil war have been accused of
killing and harassing civilians, most of whom have shown little
enthusiasm for the current conflict. In an earlier seven-month
rebellion that was widely popular, forces led by Kabila and backed
by Rwanda and Uganda toppled longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in
May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda are now backing rebels who took up arms
against Kabila in August 1998, accusing him of failing to rid Congo
of at least 10,000 Rwandan Hutu militiamen who participated in the
1994 genocide of more than 500,000 people in Rwanda. The militiamen
later fled to the country -- then known as Zaire -- and have since
joined Kabila's army.
</P>
<P>
   Bemba said the Hutu militiamen were supporting the Congolese
army in battles against the rebels in Waka, in the northwestern
Equateur province.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kabila and his allies and the rebels and their backers
signed a peace agreement last year, fighting has recently
intensified. Kabila has yet to authorize the planned deployment of
5,537 U.N. monitors and troops in support of a fragile cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are divided among three factions in the eastern half
of Congo, which they control with the help of Rwandan and Ugandan
troops and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a pro-government militia fighting in eastern Congo
said it had killed nearly 100 Rwandan soldiers near Walikale, about
35 miles west of the rebel stronghold at Goma on the Rwandan
border.
</P>
<P>
   Most roads in eastern Congo have become too dangerous to travel
because of attacks by local tribal fighters known as Mai-Mai, who
often fight alongside bands of Rwandan and Burundian Hutu rebels
fighting to oust their respective governments.

<HEADLINE> Buffalo teachers return to work  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Striking Buffalo teachers returned to work
without a contract Friday and, to the relief of parents and other
caretakers, promised to stay there until a state mediator issues a
formal proposal early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Union President Philip Rumore said teachers would be in school
through at least Tuesday, when the Public Employment Relations
Board presents the mediator's report.
</P>
<P>
   After working all week, the Buffalo Teachers Federation's 3,700
teachers unexpectedly resumed their strike Thursday morning,
canceling classes for 47,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   The city opened emergency shelters for children, day-care
centers fielded desperate calls from parents, and grandparents were
called into action.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Rosario, 54, spent the afternoon at LaSalle Park
helping watch his 15 grandchildren, 11 of whom normally would be in
school.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh God, no school again,'' Rosario's wife, Bernarda, said when
hearing schools were closed.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden walkout was sharply criticized by Supreme Court
Justice Kevin Dillon who threw out contempt charges against union
leaders on a technicality Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the absolute life of me, I cannot comprehend any reason
whatsoever why someone would conclude that harm from the actions of
this morning would fall on anyone other than the children of the
city of Buffalo,'' Dillon said.
</P>
<P>
   While BTF President Philip Rumore said it was PERB's action that
persuaded teachers to return to class, Buffalo Board of Education
President Paul Buchanan said the judge's admonition was the more
likely incentive.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told them in no uncertain terms... they are not to have any
kind of job action and he called them into court so they could hear
him telling them that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen union executives attended the court hearing
at Dillon's instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said the district's latest offer Wednesday contained no
raise for the 1999-2000 school year, 3.5 percent for the current
year, 2.5 percent for 2001-02, and 2.5 percent for 2002-03. The
union, district officials said, is seeking no raise for 1999-2000,
3.5 percent this school year, 2.75 percent in 2001-02, and 2.75
percent in 2002-03.
</P>
<P>
   The raises would be in addition to 2 percent annual increments
the teachers get regardless of collective bargaining raises,
district officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, Dillon gave the teachers a pass for their
walkout last week, dismissing contempt charges filed against union
leaders. He agreed with BTF lawyers who argued that paperwork
related to a court order forbidding the strike had been improperly
filed.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, however, solidified a temporary restraining order
issued Tuesday ordering teachers back to work. BTF attorney Michael
Sawicki said he expected the city to file new contempt charges
stemming from the latest walkout.

<HEADLINE> Good food, good friends carry diner through 50 years  </HEADLINE>
By JUDY BERNSTEIN
Glens Falls Post-Star
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE GEORGE, N.Y. (AP) - On Wednesday evening, employees of the
Prospect Mountain Diner were at the hospital, visiting a customer
they'd learned was sick.
</P>
<P>
   A regular, he had failed to arrive at his usual time. That
started the worry, longtime waitress Dorothy ''Dottie'' Skellie
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The diner's like a family. Everybody cares about each other.
If somebody doesn't show up, we want to know why,'' Skellie said as
she wiped down a counter on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of family atmosphere that draws workers and
regular customers back to the Adirondack mountain diner.
</P>
<P>
   It its 50 years, as the number of diners nationwide dwindled,
the Prospect Mountain Diner in the small resort town of Lake George
has thrived. It has been featured in Harper's Bazaar and The New
Yorker and was used in an tobacco ad, owner Art Leonhard said.
Famous visitors drawn to the old-time diner include actress
Ann-Margret, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman and members of the rock
band Aerosmith.
</P>
<P>
   The diner 54 miles north of Albany on state Route 9 - once a
major New York thoroughfare - still sports the original red stools
and booths. On the long Formica counter is a platter of covered
doughnuts. Several small jukeboxes are spaced every couple of seats
and at each booth.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Pat Humphry started working there as a college student
at a vacation job 33 years ago and Skellie started a year later.
Chef Ed Allen started at the diner 25 years ago as a 12-year-old
dishwasher.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my second home,'' Skellie said, tears welling up in
her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   What attracts people initially can be the diner's look or simply
the promise of solid home-cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The shiny silver diner was built in 1950 in Paterson, N.J., by
the Silk City Dining Car Co. The original owner, Phil Patenaude,
brought the diner to Lake George on two flatbed trucks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, two years after Leonhard bought it, he built an
addition to the back of the diner, where he served Chinese food -
the first in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The full menu includes a dozen kinds of pancakes, as well as
eggs, waffles, hamburgers, sandwiches, soups and pasta. Wednesday's
special includes soups and sandwiches as well as a barbecue chicken
dinner and a sausage, peppers and onions platter.
</P>
<P>
   What draws many people initially is the look, its history and
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Newman, who was visiting from Delaware, said the diner
reminded him of some he'd seen in a museum.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he went in because it served breakfast
mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The food and the friendly atmosphere drew Bob Rostetter, a
frequent customer from nearby Bolton Landing, who's eaten there for
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just one special, it's several,'' he said. ''And no
matter how busy (the waitresses) are, you'll always find someone to
talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Sutton of Lake George has come often for more than 30 years
because it's open long hours, which is convenient.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like the atmosphere of it,'' he said. And since he's been a
patron since he was a teen-ager, he said it offers a bit of
nostalgia, too.
</P>
<P>
   Leonhard said the restaurant is ''good food, good service, a
friendly atmosphere and clean.'' He emphasized ''clean.'' It is
not, he said, a ''greasy spoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers include businessmen, construction workers, truckers
and lots of families with kids, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And what marks the diner as a landmark as much as anything else
is the change he's seen with those families.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've seen them coming in since they were babies in their
mothers' arms and now they bring in their children,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Corzine, Franks differ in wealth and style  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH PLAINFIELD, N.J. (AP) - Bob Franks is the New Jersey
Senate candidate with the political resume, but the election has
become a referendum on political neophyte Jon Corzine - his wealth,
his record-breaking campaign spending, his spotty voting history,
his preference for big-government approaches to health care and
education.
</P>
<P>
   From style to substance, traditional politicking has been turned
on its head in the race to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Frank
Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Franks, a four-term House member, is a consummate
political insider offering himself as the regular-guy candidate.
Multimillionaire Democrat Corzine has never sought office but is
running like an incumbent, largely ignoring Franks and limiting
face-to-face encounters.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, the candidates couldn't be more different
</P>
<P>
   Franks practices aerobic campaigning. During a Labor Day parade,
he jogged to one side of the street, hopped the curb and shook
hands, then jogged to the other side to do the same, all the while
talking without punctuation:
</P>
<P>
   ''Hi folks I'm Bob Franks I'm running for U.S. Senate have a
terrific day!''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, 53, is as understated as his proposals are broad.
Approaching people in public, he asks gently, ''Mind if I say
hello?''
</P>
<P>
   Once the chairman of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., Corzine is worth an
estimated $400 million and spent $36 million just to win the
Democratic primary, mostly his money. Franks has raised less than
$2 million.
</P>
<P>
   But recent polls show almost a dead heat, with 20 to 25 percent
of New Jersey's voters still undecided. While both political
parties want the seat, a Corzine victory is crucial if Democrats
are to overturn the GOP's 54-46 Senate majority.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, 48, is a true organization man, having served two stints
as chairman of New Jersey's Republican Party. His campaign pace is
busy but not frantic. During a break on a day of public events,
Franks nursed an iced tea and a small glass of a New Jersey-brewed
beer at an Irish pub while quietly singing along with Bruce
Springsteen's ''My Hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks fits within New Jersey's tradition of moderate
Republicanism. He focuses on fiscal issues - balancing the budget,
say - but often votes with Democrats on issues like gun control and
federal support for the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Franks seems to have accepted that the campaign is mostly about
his opponent. Halfway through the Labor Day parade, he laughed when
he saw his friend Linda Dashuta waving a bumper sticker popular
among the anti-Corzine crowd: ''Make him spend it all, Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine favors an activist federal government that provides
universal health insurance, nursing-home care, preschool and
college for those with ''B'' averages. Critics say he is too
liberal; Corzine prefers the label ''progressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking the Atlantic City boardwalk on Labor Day weekend,
Corzine told two prospective voters that he'd like to ''spend a
little money on our schools, a little money on our health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Only during a meeting with two dozen congregants at a Baptist
church does Corzine hint at the scale of his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   He says universal health care, which proved too ambitious for
President Clinton, is at ''the top of my agenda,'' and he chides
Vice President Al Gore for advocating too incremental an approach
to helping the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has hurt himself with a series of misstatements. The
most recent was Sept. 6, when he told reporters, emphatically but
incorrectly, that he had voted in a 1998 referendum. The episode
brought renewed press coverage of the fact Corzine did not vote in
17 primary elections and five general elections since 1975.

<HEADLINE> Firm settles discrimination suit with $1 million donation  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Morgan Stanley Dean Witter claimed victory
Friday over a former analyst who claimed the firm discriminated
against him because he is black, saying it settled his lawsuit by
promising a $1 million contribution to the National Urban League.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe this is a complete vindication of Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter,'' the company said in a release announcing the deal to
settle a $1.35 billion lawsuit with Christian Curry. Both sides
dropped their claims.
</P>
<P>
   In the same release, Curry said the episode had been
''emotionally draining ... and to continue would be detrimental to
all.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While I will receive no payment, I am pleased with the
result,'' he said, noting that the National Urban League, a
nonprofit social service and civil rights organization, benefits
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Curry had alleged in a lawsuit - filed in state Supreme Court in
Manhattan and later moved to U.S. District Court - that he was
fired in April 1998 because he is black and because the company
thought he was homosexual after nude photos of him appeared in a
gay men's magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The company said in response that Curry, a real estate analyst
who started working for the firm in July 1997, was fired for
expense account abuses.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors looked into the matter and concluded the firm
used poor judgment but broke no laws when it fired Curry. Company
executives had authorized a $10,000 payment to an informant who
told them Curry had paid a computer hacker $200 to plant a phony
e-mail in the firm's computer system.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no discrimination or misconduct against Mr. Curry,''
the company said. ''We were fully prepared for trial and confident
we would win.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm said it would avoid the expense and distraction of a
trial by using money it would have spent on legal costs to make the
donation and ''underscore our strong commitment to furthering
minority interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Benedict P. Morelli, Curry's lawyer, said in the release that
his client can now put the case behind him and move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''While I initially thought Mr. Curry had a good case, we now
understand that Morgan Stanley Dean Witter engaged in no
discrimination or misconduct against Mr. Curry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morelli did not immediately return a telephone message for
further comment Friday.

<HEADLINE> Betsey Johnson: Implant saved my life  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Funk fashion queen Betsey Johnson says a breast
implant may have saved her life.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 58, said Thursday that one of her implants collapsed,
and she went to have them removed just before Christmas. It was
then that doctors discovered a small, cancerous tumor. She had a
lumpectomy to remove it and underwent radiation as well.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson - who dazzled the fashion world in the 1960s with her
clear vinyl dresses, silver motorcycle suits and other inexpensive,
groovy fashions - spread the news at an event held by General
Motors Corp. and the fashion community to raise money to fight
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker did not know Johnson had the disease when it asked
her to participate in the event by decorating a Chevy Cavalier
being raffled off for charity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just hope all my customers and girls will get earlier
mammograms and checkups. I feel it's time to give back, if there's
anything I can give,'' she said.

   WINSTED, Conn. (AP) - The seeds of a mystery have been planted
in this Connecticut city.
</P>
<P>
   Giant sunflowers have been popping up all over the downtown.
</P>
<P>
   City hall officials are wondering whether they were the result
of seeds blown in on the winds of a storm, or if, perhaps, the
flowers are the work of a ''Johnny Sunflower Seed.''

   Or is someone trying to make a political statement? Winsted is
the home of Ralph Nader, Green Party presidential candidate. The
party's logo is none other than ... a sunflower. Hmmmm.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't us,'' said Tom Sevigny, the state Green Party
chairman. ''It wasn't me, let's put it that way. But I think it's
fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind city hall on Main Street about a half-dozen giant
sunflowers have sprouted from the gravel-covered dirt. One plant,
directly next to the rear entrance, is more than 8 feet tall and
yet to blossom.
</P>
<P>
   ''When that flower opens, it's going to be outrageous,'' said
Lee Anne LaClaire, Winsted's social services director. ''I think
there're really something to see. We can't figure out how they got
here but we like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other plants are growing on the U.S. Post Office
property and in front of another building on Main Steet.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers are also popping up on the lawns of nearby homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have about six plants growing in my yard,'' said Eileen
Miller. ''I never planted them, either.''
</P>
<P>
   John Creedon, owner of Connecticut Cut Flower of Bantam, said
the seeds may have originally come from residential bird feeders.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's possible that they could have spread from birds or that
something like a chipmunk buried the seeds to be eaten later on,''
Creedon said. ''But it sounds like someone broadcast the area with
some seeds and may be playing a prank.''

<HEADLINE> New Vodka Uses Russian Leader's Name  </HEADLINE>
By LIUDAS DAPKUS
<TEXT>
<P>
   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) -- Putin Vodka hit liquor stores Friday
in what some are calling a clever marketing ploy that capitalizes
on the name of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   The vodka, produced by the ex-Soviet republic's Alita
distillery, features a label in white, blue and red -- the colors of
Russia's flag. ''Putin'' is emblazoned in large white letters.
</P>
<P>
   A bottle of Putin costs $7 -- a little less than most top-end
vodkas in Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
   Alita spokesman Vilmantas Peciura maintained the brand wasn't
meant to refer to the Russian president. He said it derived from
''putinas,'' a tree with red berries found in Lithuania, although
the vodka reportedly is clear and not flavored.
</P>
<P>
   Many people scoffed at the denial.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a brilliant idea,'' said Tautvydas Musteikis of Gray
Advertising. ''They've received tremendous publicity and are
getting more attention with every denial of the Russian link.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Lithuania broke with the Soviet Union in 1991, relations
with Russia have sometimes been strained. Many Lithuanians have
expressed suspicion about Putin's past work for the Soviet secret
police, saying he can't be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   The new vodka now is sold only in Lithuania, though the
distillery said it may decide to export it later, perhaps to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Embassy spokesman Boris Kirilov said he knew about the
vodka and said he didn't think Russians would be offended by it.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a judo champion in his youth, is said to drink little.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Royal Aide Plans Diana Memoir  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- To the dismay of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince
Charles, a former royal aide plans to publish a memoir about his
years working with Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   The book by Patrick Jephson, Diana's private secretary, will
cover 1987 to 1996 -- a particularly troubled time in the princess's
life. She and Charles separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever its possible content, the book is likely to arouse
fresh speculation about the life of the princess which can only be
upsetting to the feelings of Prince William and Prince Harry, and
to the princess's family,'' the queen and Prince Charles said
Friday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Jephson promised a ''truthful and balanced account'' and said he
is sure the royal family will be reassured when they read the book.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since her death I have been dismayed by the indiscriminate
comment she has received, much of it inaccurate, some of it
apparently intended to diminish her memory,'' Jephson said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Diana died in 1997 in a Paris car accident.

<HEADLINE> Crews continue cleanup of oil spill into Sandy Hook Bay  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Wind and high waves from a
storm that blew through Sandy Hook Bay dissipated most of a
30,000-gallon fuel spill that occurred when a tugboat punched a
hole in a Navy ship Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The tugboat Mary L. McAllister collided with the USS Detroit
about 4:20 p.m., ripping a 4-inch-by-4-foot hole on the rear port
side of the 58,000-ton ship. The Detroit, which is staffed by about
500 naval personnel, is designed to accompany aircraft carriers in
battle, restocking them with fuel, ammunition and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened about 700 to 800 yards off the end of the
2.9-mile pier and left a slick 1-3/4 miles long and a half mile
wide.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping channels that were closed immediately after the
accident were reopened Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Protection banned
harvesting of shellfish in Raritan Bay, Sandy Hook Bay, and the
Navesink and Shrewsbury rivers until further notice because of the
spill.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has dissipated to the extent that they're not getting any
measurable quantities of fuel from the skimmers anymore,'' said
Cmdr. Chuck Caudill of the Earle Naval Weapons Station.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not good news for environmentalists, who fear the
toxic effects of the No. 2 diesel fuel on fragile marine life and
shore birds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's potentially is a very dangerous spill,'' said Andrew
Willner, the baykeeper for New York and New Jersey. ''We have
migratory birds coming here - herons and egrets using the mud flats
- and their fish can become contaminated. Ducks are also landing in
the area and coming in contact with this fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday afternoon, however, there were no reports of any
wildlife dying as a result of the spill.
</P>
<P>
   The spill is one of the largest ever to occur in the bay, said
Cynthia Zipf, executive director of the Clean Ocean Action
environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   She said if the fuel were placed in 1-gallon containers and laid
end to end, the line of containers would reach for nearly five
miles.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a lot of fuel to be in the water,'' Zipf said.
''There's no great time for a spill, but this is a particularly bad
time. Birds are fattening up, getting ready for their migration.
Terns, gulls and kingfishers are going to be exposed to this.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the fall, marine life is so abundant,'' she said. ''All the
juveniles have grown up, and they're feeding voraciously. The whole
food chain is going to get contaminated because plankton is
contaminated, and other marine life feeds off of that.''
</P>
<P>
   A cleanup operation is ongoing. The work is being done by a Navy
response team, a Coast Guard pollution response team and two boats
from private contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy is using a skimmer, a boat that separates the fuel from
the water. One of the contractors used 8,000 feet of boom, and the
other used 5,000 feet to contain the leak.
</P>
<P>
   But the storm that blew through the area at 2 a.m. wrecked much
of the containment booms, which washed up on the rocky bay shore of
Sandy Hook, said Dery W. Bennett, executive director of the
American Littoral Society, a Sandy Hook environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   There was a strong smell of fuel in the air at Sandy Hook Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chances are very little of it was contained,'' Bennett said.
''You can't see a sheen out here, but you can smell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Willner said such a cleanup typically recovers about 15 percent
of the fuel from the water.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of fuel washing up on any New Jersey
beaches, although some was reported to have reached Midland Beach
on Staten Island, Willner said.

<HEADLINE> State's top court hears arguments in Utica mayoral dispute  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Lawyers argued before the state's highest
court Friday whether an exception to a state law governing
succession for city mayors applied to Utica.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals agreed to hear the case after two lower
courts disagreed over whether a special mayoral election should be
held in Utica.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the debate is a state law requiring that the
head of the local legislative body succeed a mayor when the mayor
is unable to complete a full term. The law applies to cities in
which the mayor and the local legislative leader are elected at the
same time for the same term. Utica falls under that category.
</P>
<P>
   On July 3, former Republican Mayor Edward Hanna resigned with
more than three years left in his term. City lawyers, citing the
state law, determined two days later that Common Council President
Timothy Julian could complete the remainder of Hanna's term without
the need for an election. The state Board of Elections concurred
that Julian, a Republican, could keep the job.
</P>
<P>
   But a former county legislator, Edward Revere, said city
residents should choose Hanna's replacement in a special election
this fall. Revere plans to run on the Democratic and Right to Life
ballots if there is a special election.
</P>
<P>
   Revere's attorney, Richard Kaplan, told judges that an exception
allowing city charters to override the state law applies to Utica.
Under that exception, charters dating before Nov. 5, 1975, that
require an election in case of a mayoral vacancy happening before
Sept. 20 supersedes the state law. Revere said Utica's city charter
meets the conditions for the exception and so Julian should be
mayor only on an interim basis.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vacancy (for mayor) occurred prior to Sept. 20, so there
is the need for a vote,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Frye disagreed, saying that the exception originally intended to
affect only New York City and in any event, it may only apply to
cases where there is a vacancy. Since Utica followed the state law
and allowed Julian to succeed Hanna immediately following the
resignation, a vacancy did not exist, Frye reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're trying to say that the exception applies and that the
general rule doesn't,'' Frye said.
</P>
<P>
   In July, state Supreme Court Justice John Tenney ruled that
Julian would have to face Utica voters in November, but a
five-member appeals court panel in Rochester unanimously reversed
that decision. Revere then turned to the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The state's top court, which usually takes months to review a
case, took timing into consideration in this instance and sped up
the process. The court received the request for a hearing in late
August and agreed Thursday to hear arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Judges peppered both Frye and Kaplan with questions throughout
each lawyer's 15-minute presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to say'' what the outcome will be, Kaplan said
following the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Frye said his ''argument went well'' before the six-member
panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we'll be successful,'' Frye said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Will Pursue Lee Concerns  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Friday he will contact
Attorney General Janet Reno to discuss his concerns about the
government's handling of the case of scientist Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he has questions about the fact that Lee's guilty
plea came very shortly after the government argued that he needed
to remain in jail without bail. He said that flew in the face of
the nation's opposition to ''abusive executive authority.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That raises a question ... about whether we have been as
careful as we ought to be about pretrial detention,'' Clinton said.
''We sometimes make mistakes, but we normally make mistakes the
other way, where we are bending over backward.''
</P>
<P>
   He made the statement to reporters prior to meeting with Indian
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his staff has already contacted Reno, and ''I'm
sure I'll have a chance to talk to the attorney general about it.''
He said he did not discuss the matter with her before now because
''it would have been completely inappropriate for me to
intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a serious violation here. He has acknowledged
that,'' Clinton said of Lee. ''Whenever we hold anybody in prison
... we need to have a very high threshold. There ought to be an
analysis of whether that threshold was crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said he did
not expect the president to reach out to the attorney general
personally. ''There is a fine tradition that the Justice
Departments operates independently.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rare public disagreement, Clinton said Thursday that Lee's
long detention ''just can't be justified,'' but Reno refused to
apologize and said the confinement was the nuclear scientist's own
fault.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Lockhart said that while Clinton intends to
look into how the case was handled, there was no discussion of an
apology to Lee from the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the limited and the proper role and hands-off role that
was played here by the White House, there's no discussion of that
(an apology),'' Lockhart said. ''When people are troubled by
things, and he indeed is troubled himself by some of these
questions, we should look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old Lee, a former Los Alamos laboratory scientist,
went free Wednesday after pleading guilty to one felony of
mishandling weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, at her weekly news conference, said Lee could have avoided
nine months of detention by agreeing earlier to plead guilty and
tell the government what he did with the secrets.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis J. Freeh said ''the safety of the nation
demands that we take this important step'' under which Lee was
sentenced to the 278 days he had served. The government dropped 58
other counts.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Reno spoke, Clinton expressed an opinion far closer
to that of U.S. District Judge James Parker, who said Lee's
detention ''embarrassed our entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who met with Justice officials at the White House
before Lee's indictment last Dec. 10, said he found it difficult in
retrospect to reconcile how the government could ''keep someone in
jail without bail, argue right up to the 11th hour that they're a
terrible risk, and then turn around and make that sort of plea
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It just can't be justified. ... I, too, am quite troubled by
it,'' Clinton said. Reno did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are heartened that the president of the United States
appears to share some of the concerns that Judge Parker expressed
in his eloquent order yesterday,'' Lee attorney Mark Holscher said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lockhart told reporters Clinton's comments should not be
read ''as a blanket criticism of anyone'' and added that Reno and
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson retain Clinton's support.
</P>
<P>
   Also, on David Letterman's show, Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic presidential nominee, refused to say whether the Justice
Department should apologize, saying he did not want to comment on
an ongoing legal proceeding. But he did note ''the underlying
problem was very serious because nuclear secrets have to be
protected absolutely and completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who have spent months calling Reno too timid in
investigating leaks from Los Alamos accused her of being too
aggressive with Lee.

<HEADLINE> Che Guevara Photographer Wins Suit  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Social justice, si. Vodka advertisements, no.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban photographer who snapped a famous picture of Che
Guevara has won copyright protection for the image from a British
court as part of a financial settlement with companies that had
used it in an ad for Smirnoff vodka, his lawyers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Taken in 1960, the photo of Guevara -- with long curly hair, a
tilted beret and a dark, intense gaze -- became a revolutionary
icon. One of the world's most widely reproduced images, it appeared
on countless T-shirts and posters.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the years, photographer Alberto Diaz Gutierrez, who
goes by the professional name Alberto Korda, never made any money
from the use of his famous picture. His motives in bringing the
lawsuit were not financial, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a supporter of the ideals for which Che Guevara died, I am
not averse to its reproduction by those who wish to propagate his
memory and the cause of social justice throughout the world,'' he
said. ''But I am categorically against the exploitation of Che's
image for the promotion of products such as alcohol, or for any
purpose that denigrates the reputation of Che.''
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old Diaz Gutierrez spoke to reporters at a London
exhibition of Cuban photography. He and supporters stood in front
of a print of the famous picture to toast their legal victory --
with Cuban rum.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in August by the London-based Cuba
Solidarity Campaign on Diaz Gutierrez' behalf against the photo
agency Rex Features Ltd. and the advertising agency Lowe Lintas
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of the settlement, approved by the High Court on
Thursday, was not disclosed. Lawyer Simon Goldberg said the
ruling's real significance lay in the fact that the court had
asserted Diaz Gutierrez' copyright.
</P>
<P>
   ''The declaration of copyright which the court affirmed will
send a clear message to those who reproduce photographic images
which they wrongly consider to be in the public domain without the
copyright owner's consent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rex Features and Lowe Lintas had no comment other than a joint
statement, signed by all the parties, saying the claim had been
''sensibly and amicably resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   When the suit was filed, Lowe Lintas, then known as Lowe
Howard-Spink, said it had acquired use of the Guevara image through
Rex Features in good faith, and denied infringement of any
copyright.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz Gutierrez, who lives in Havana, had complained that the ad,
for a spicy vodka, trivialized the historic importance of his
photograph. The image was superimposed on a hammer and sickle
motif, with a chili pepper used to depict the sickle.
</P>
<P>
   The photo of a steely-eyed Che, whose real name was Ernesto
Guevara, was taken March 5, 1960, at a memorial service for more
than 100 crew members of a Belgian arms cargo ship killed in an
attack Cuba blamed on counterrevolutionary forces aided by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine-born Guevara was a key figure in Cuba's 1959
revolution, alongside Fidel Castro. When he was killed by the
Bolivian army in October 1967, he was hailed a martyr of the
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz Gutierrez said he would donate the settlement and any other
proceeds from the photograph to children's medical care in Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Russian Leader Meets Soldiers' Kin  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin on Friday met with
relatives of 84 paratroopers killed in a devastating rebel ambush
in Chechnya, praising their sons and husbands amid accusations that
the government doesn't care about the war's toll.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not your fault that the country has ended up in the
situation it's in,'' the Russian leader told the family members in
the unusual meeting at the Defense Ministry, part of which was
shown on government television.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fortunate that you raised people who stood in the way of
the further collapse of the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear why he chose to meet with the families Friday,
six months after the ambush --one of the worst defeats in the war.
The losses from the paratrooper unit from the northern city of
Pskov helped undermine the military's claims that Chechen
independence fighters were near defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's meeting came a month after Putin was harshly criticized
for waiting several days to react to a submarine disaster that
killed 118 sailors and gripped the nation. After the rescue effort
was abandoned, he fielded several hours of angry questions during a
meeting with the crew's families, only to be criticized for his
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Servicemen fighting in Chechnya -- and families of the war's
victims -- complained that the government, and the rest of Russia,
grieved over the Kursk but paid little attention to deaths in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The paratroopers' relatives received savings accounts Friday
holding $25,900 in promised compensation for each family, the
Interfax news agency reported. That is a significant sum in a
country where the military is broke and servicemen often take
second jobs to feed their families.
</P>
<P>
   Family members interviewed on commercial NTV television said
they were satisfied with the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel attacks continue to claim lives in the rebel republic. On
Friday, a government official said six Russian soldiers were killed
and 14 were wounded when rebels shot up two armored personnel
carriers Thursday in a military convoy in southwestern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Most Russians still support the war in Chechnya, viewing it as a
necessary response to the lawlessness and violence that spilled out
of the southern province after it gained de facto independence in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, the United Nations' top human rights official said
Friday she fears a ''humanitarian tragedy'' in Chechnya this winter
because the situation remains ''very grave.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been no significant return of displaced persons,''
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson said. ''The
onset of winter and the scarce resources available make a
humanitarian tragedy a real possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasily Sidorov, head of the Russian delegation, said similar
forecasts a year ago failed to materialize.

<HEADLINE> Al Fayed Appeals Crash Verdict  </HEADLINE>
By PIERRE-ANTOINE SOUCHARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A French court heard an appeal Friday to reopen the
investigation of the car crash that killed Princess Diana and her
boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, along with their driver.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal was launched by Dodi's father, Egyptian tycoon
Mohamed Al Fayed, and the family of driver Henri Paul. The Paris
appeals court said it would announce its ruling Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   A lower court dismissed charges against press photographers who
were chasing the car prior to the Aug. 31, 1997, crash in a Paris
traffic tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Annie Grenier urged the court to uphold the
dismissal, judicial officials said on condition they not be named.
The hearing was closed to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Al Fayed did not attend the hearing. His lawyers argued the
photographers were the principal cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''Take away the photographers, and there wouldn't have been an
accident,'' Georges Kiejman, one of Al Fayed's attorneys, said
outside the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Judge Herve Stephan threw out charges against
nine photographers and one motorcyclist implicated in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse one-page statement, Stephan ruled that alcohol, drugs
and excessive speed caused the crash that ended the life of the
''people's princess.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The drunken state of the driver prevented him from remaining
in control of the vehicle while traveling at high speed,'' the
judge wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tests showed Paul had an alcohol level in his blood of more than
three times the legal limit. He also had prescription drugs,
including the anti-depressant Prozac, in his system.
</P>
<P>
   The photographers had been charged with manslaughter and failing
to assist persons in danger. They acknowledged chasing Diana, the
former wife of Britain's Prince Charles, but rejected any
responsibility in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Stephan found that the photographers' behavior in their pursuit
of Diana, despite its ethical implications, did not ''constitute an
infraction of the criminal code.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones survived the crash but suffered
severe facial injuries.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 90; Nasdaq Nasdaq Dips 95  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chips and tech stocks fell sharply Friday
on a mix of profit-taking, bargain hunting and general anxiety
about corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 90.27 to 10,997.20 in
afternoon trading. The Nasdaq composite index was down 95.94 at
3,817.92, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 14.48 at
1,466.39.
</P>
<P>
   The government reported Friday that consumer prices fell in
August for the first time in 14 years. While the drop was
unexpected, it did little to inspire the market, which was already
beginning to factor in a slowing in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Software maker Oracle was down $4.78 at $80.16, a day after
investors pushed its price higher on upbeat speculation about its
corporate earnings. They weren't disappointed -- earnings beat Wall
Street estimates by 4 cents a share -- but the stock fell Friday on
profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also unloaded shares of Anadigics, after the wireless
communications company announced its earnings for the last half of
this year would be hurt by reduced orders. Anadigics traded down
$5.38 at $24.50.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board, home appliance maker Maytag lost $2, falling
to $33.81, after it warned that third and fourth-quarter earnings
will be below Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But shares of Xerox rose $1.88 to $17.88 on published reports it
is being eyed for acquisition by Hewlett-Packard, Canon and others.
</P>
<P>
   Another bright spot: Energy stocks, which rallied after
President Clinton expressed concern about oil prices, which have
soared to 10-year highs.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton rose $1.42 to $52.94; Schlumberger was up 98 cents
at $84.75 and Baker Hughes traded $1.25 higher at $38.75.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's downward trading was in line with what has become a
trend on Wall Street. The market has lacked clear direction, in
spite of the fact it appears unlikely that the Federal Reserve will
hike interest rates again. As a result, stocks have moved up and
down arbitrarily, driven by a specific piece of news or economic
data.
</P>
<P>
   ''The month of September is going to be pretty choppy,'' said
John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest. ''I see
things cooling off and calming down by the middle of next month
because I believe earnings reports overall will be solid, oil
prices should start to drift down and the Fed ... won't raise
interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of about
4-to-3 on the New York Stock exchange, where volume came to 833.85
million shares, well ahead of the 685.08 million shares Thursday.
Friday was a triple witching day, when the expiration of stock
options and futures contracts generally cause a spike upward in
volume.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 6.49 to 532.72.

<HEADLINE> Suit Settled With Che Photographer  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Social justice, si. Vodka advertisements, no.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban photographer who snapped a famous picture of Che
Guevara has won copyright protection for the image from a British
court as part of a financial settlement with companies that had
used it in an ad for Smirnoff vodka, his lawyers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Taken in 1960, the photo of Guevara -- with long curly hair, a
tilted beret and a dark, intense gaze -- became a revolutionary
icon. One of the world's most widely reproduced images, it appeared
on countless T-shirts and posters.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the years, photographer Alberto Diaz Gutierrez, who
goes by the professional name Alberto Korda, never made any money
from the use of his famous picture. His motives in bringing the
lawsuit were not financial, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a supporter of the ideals for which Che Guevara died, I am
not averse to its reproduction by those who wish to propagate his
memory and the cause of social justice throughout the world,'' he
said. ''But I am categorically against the exploitation of Che's
image for the promotion of products such as alcohol, or for any
purpose that denigrates the reputation of Che.''
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old Diaz Gutierrez spoke to reporters at a London
exhibition of Cuban photography. He and supporters stood in front
of a print of the famous picture to toast their legal victory --
with Cuban rum.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in August by the London-based Cuba
Solidarity Campaign on Diaz Gutierrez' behalf against the photo
agency Rex Features Ltd. and the advertising agency Lowe Lintas
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of the settlement, approved by the High Court on
Thursday, was not disclosed. Lawyer Simon Goldberg said the
ruling's real significance lay in the fact that the court had
asserted Diaz Gutierrez' copyright.
</P>
<P>
   ''The declaration of copyright which the court affirmed will
send a clear message to those who reproduce photographic images
which they wrongly consider to be in the public domain without the
copyright owner's consent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rex Features and Lowe Lintas had no comment other than a joint
statement, signed by all the parties, saying the claim had been
''sensibly and amicably resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   When the suit was filed, Lowe Lintas, then known as Lowe
Howard-Spink, said it had acquired use of the Guevara image through
Rex Features in good faith, and denied infringement of any
copyright.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz Gutierrez, who lives in Havana, had complained that the ad,
for a spicy vodka, trivialized the historic importance of his
photograph. The image was superimposed on a hammer and sickle
motif, with a chili pepper used to depict the sickle.
</P>
<P>
   The photo of a steely-eyed Che, whose real name was Ernesto
Guevara, was taken March 5, 1960, at a memorial service for more
than 100 crew members of a Belgian arms cargo ship killed in an
attack Cuba blamed on counterrevolutionary forces aided by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine-born Guevara was a key figure in Cuba's 1959
revolution, alongside Fidel Castro. When he was killed by the
Bolivian army in October 1967, he was hailed a martyr of the
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz Gutierrez said he would donate the settlement and any other
proceeds from the photograph to children's medical care in Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Report: Mad Cow Is Blood-Borne  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Sheep in the early, symptom-free stages of mad cow
disease can pass the brain-wasting ailment to other sheep through
blood transfusions, new research has found.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, published Friday in the Lancet medical journal,
raise the possibility the human form of the disease could be
transmitted through blood transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers cautioned the risk was still ''theoretical''. No
cases have been recorded of humans becoming infected from a blood
transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, blood banks in Britain have introduced precautions
to reduce the risk of contaminated blood supplies, including
filtering out all white blood cells which could potentially carry
the infection and importing plasma from countries where there is no
evidence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human form of the fatal
mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''No further measures would seem possible -- short of a draconian
decision to shut down the whole U.K. blood donor system,'' said
Paul Brown, a senior research scientist at the American National
Institute of Neurological Disease in Bethesda, Md., who was not
connected with the study.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The Lancet, Brown criticized the researchers for
publishing their study at such an early stage before further tests
were complete.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Department of Health said the research did not present
any significant new risk to the public, as scientists have long
suspected that Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease can be transmitted through
the blood of victims not showing any symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government introduced these precautionary measures ... to
minimize any theoretical risk to patients,'' the department said.
''This risk remains theoretical.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers from the Institute for Animal Health in
Edinburgh and Compton, England, fed cattle brain infected with
bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, to a number
of sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Blood was then taken from 19 infected British sheep before any
symptoms were apparent and transfused into healthy sheep from New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   After 610 days, one of the transfused sheep began to show signs
of mad cow disease. All the others are still healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although this result was in only one animal, it indicates that
BSE can be transmitted between individuals of the same species by
whole-blood transfusion,'' the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ''It suggests there is a risk from blood transfusion in the
human population,'' Chris Bostock, the institute, told the British
Broadcasting Corp. ''But the benefits of having a blood transfusion
will greatly outweigh any risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 82 cases of the new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have
been confirmed in Britain. The disease first surfaced in the
mid-1990s, a decade after a vet discovered Britain's first
BSE-infected cattle herd. Scientists believe people contract
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease by eating beef infected with bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, but the disease can be confirmed only by
examining the brain after death.
</P>
<P>
   Since the British outbreak, the disease has also been found in
cattle in Portugal and in smaller numbers in Ireland, Belgium,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, France, Denmark and Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Ends Conflict with Eritrea  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring an end to the war with neighboring
Eritrea, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said Friday that
negotiations on reaching an overall peace settlement will start
soon.
</P>
<P>
   He also said a cease-fire in the two-year border war between the
two Horn of Africa neighbors agreed on in June was holding even
though no U.N. observers have been deployed to monitor it.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Friday to authorize
a 4,200-strong peacekeeping force to oversee the agreement and the
removal of troops from the two nations' disputed border.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are now in the second phase of tying up loose ends''
leading to ''a final and comprehensive agreement,'' Meles said. ''I
expect negotiations to resume at the end of the month or early next
month.''
</P>
<P>
   After an agreement is reached, he said, it would take a long
time before normal relations with Eritrea, a former Italian colony
that was once a province of Ethiopia, could be restored.
</P>
<P>
   He praised the United States for being involved in trying to
reach a peace settlement as soon as hostilities broke out
''although we have had our differences particularly with regard to
self defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Former National Security Adviser Anthony Lake was the Clinton
administration's special envoy who helped bring about a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in New York, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met
separately with Meles and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki and
said she was encouraged that the two African nations wanted to
reach a settlement as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Meles spoke at the National Press Club, while outside
demonstrators from the capital's large Ethiopian community
protested his rule, calling him a dictator. He was here for a round
of meetings with administration officials and members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He said his landlocked nation would shop around for use of a Red
Sea port and had 10 possibilities including Eritrea's port of Aseb.
He hinted Ethiopia might seek closer ties with another neighbor,
Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
   ''Economic integration in the Horn is vital for sustainable
development,'' Meles said. ''It might entail political integration
of sorts, but how and when that is achieved we will have to wait
and see.''
</P>
<P>
   The border war with Eritrea left 70,000 persons dead and led to
the displacement of another 800,000.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is backing the U.N. peacekeeping mission but
has said the troops could not be a substitute for a comprehensive
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations plans to dispatch 23 military observers each
to the capitals of both countries in line with a Security Council
resolution authorizing the deployment of up to 100 military
observers. Meles said some of these observers have started arriving
in his capital, Addis Ababa.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Asks Israel To Share Jerusalem  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Amid a desperate drive by the Clinton
administration to forge a Mideast peace agreement, the U.S.
ambassador to Israel is calling on the Israelis and the
Palestinians to share the holy city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no other solution,'' Martin Indyk said in Jerusalem.
''It is not, and cannot be the exclusive preserve of one
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Indyk, in his second term in the Tel Aviv post after heading the
State Department's Near East bureau, appeared to be leaning on
Israel and the Palestinians to strike a compromise deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The solution cannot come from one side challenging or denying
another side's beliefs,'' Indyk said Thursday upon receiving an
honorary degree from Hebrew Union College. ''Here, too, mutual
respect is the foundation for any agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy in Israel said in a statement Friday that U.S.
policy on Jerusalem had not changed, ''namely that its final status
should be negotiated directly by the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Both President Clinton, as a mediator, and Israel have offered
to share control over holy sites with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But Prime Minister Ehud Barak has ruled out redividing the city,
which Israel united during the 1967 Mideast war. He has proposed
limited Palestinian control over some Arab neighborhoods within and
just outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also has offered the Palestinians a state on virtually all
of the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, meanwhile, Clinton said in an exchange with
reporters at the White House that he was not expecting a
breakthrough in the protracted push for an Israeli-Palestinian
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should all wait and see,'' Clinton said. ''They know they
are on a short time frame, and they are working it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright opened a new round of
talks with Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in New York, Crown
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia backed Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's demand for east Jerusalem and rejected U.S. calls for a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing to negotiate about and compromise on when it
comes to Jerusalem,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a group of Arab-American and Muslim leaders,
Abdullah said: ''Jerusalem is important to the hearts of all
Muslims and in fact it's in the heart of everybody with a sense of
humanity. This is something on which there can be no compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia is considered one of the United States' best
friends in the Arab world. Its leaders usually exert their
influence privately.
</P>
<P>
   The crown prince has been running the affairs of Saudi Arabia
since King Fahd suffered a stroke in 1995. Abdullah is in New York
for the U.N. Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami asked a group of
European foreign ministers headed by Hubert Vedrine of France to
urge Arafat to conclude an agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami told the European Union delegation Friday that ''this is
crunch time'' and that the peace process may last only another 20
days to two weeks, an Israeli official told The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians
depend heavily on resolving their dispute over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, at a news conference Thursday, called Jerusalem ''the
most delicate subject.''
</P>
<P>
   She held separate meetings with a Palestinian negotiating group
headed by Saeb Erekat and, over dinner, with Ben-Ami.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's senior aide, Dennis Ross, also met with the two sides
and planned to hold further talks with them Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Palestinian official, Nabil Shaath, was to meet later
Friday with Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will keep working, step by step,'' State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, Albright said, was to find a formula that the two
sides can accept.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how much longer the administration will persist
in its uphill struggle. Ben-Ami is scheduled to return to Jerusalem
on Monday night.

<HEADLINE> US, Cuba To Hold Migration Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Cuba will hold migration
talks next week in New York, the State Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The talks will be Thursday, three weeks after the State
Department protested that President Fidel Castro's government was
preventing Cubans who have U.S. passports from legally leaving the
island. As a result, would-be immigrants had to attempt high-risk
escapes by boat.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly and a
Castro confidant, will head the Cuban delegation. William
Brownfield, a deputy secretary of state, will lead the American
side.
</P>
<P>
   Migration talks had been held at roughly six-month intervals,
but none has been convened since December. The State Department has
blamed the Cubans for the long delay.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 28, department officials summoned the chief of the Cuban
diplomatic mission, Fernando Remirez, and handed him a diplomatic
note complaining of Cuban noncompliance with a 1994 agreement
governing migration.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright accused Cuba
of ''increasingly obstructing the safe, legal and orderly migration
of individuals from Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. note said 117 Cubans from 57 families had been denied
exit permits in a recent 75-day period. The United States had
granted all of them visas.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba says a 1966 U.S. law encourages Cubans to undertake
dangerous crossings to south Florida, because it ensures that those
who arrive will not be repatriated.

<HEADLINE> Cuba, U.S. To Discuss Migration  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Cuba will hold migration
talks next week in New York, the State Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The talks will be Thursday, three weeks after the State
Department protested that President Fidel Castro's government was
preventing Cubans who have U.S. passports from legally leaving the
island. As a result, would-be immigrants had to attempt high-risk
escapes by boat.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly and a
Castro confidant, will head the Cuban delegation. William
Brownfield, a deputy secretary of state, will lead the American
side.
</P>
<P>
   Migration talks had been held at roughly six-month intervals,
but none has been convened since December. The State Department has
blamed the Cubans for the long delay.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 28, department officials summoned the chief of the Cuban
diplomatic mission, Fernando Remirez, and handed him a diplomatic
note complaining of Cuban noncompliance with a 1994 agreement
governing migration.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright accused Cuba
of ''increasingly obstructing the safe, legal and orderly migration
of individuals from Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. note said 117 Cubans from 57 families had been denied
exit permits in a recent 75-day period. The United States had
granted all of them visas.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba says a 1966 U.S. law encourages Cubans to undertake
dangerous crossings to south Florida, because it ensures that those
who arrive will not be repatriated.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Arabs Oppose Barak's Stands  </HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM HAZBOUN
<TEXT>
<P>
   UMM EL-FAHM, Israel (AP) -- In a mass rally Friday, Israel's Arab
community protested what it says is government-sanctioned
discrimination in a show of force intended to remind Prime Minister
Ehud Barak that he cannot take crucial Arab support for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30,000 Arab Israelis gathered in this hilltop city in the
north of the country, to send a message of defiance tinged in both
political and religious terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''This gathering of our people, both Muslim and Christian, is
proof that we reject Israel's policy against the Arabs here,''
Sheik Raid Salah, mayor of Umm el-Fahm, told the cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Salah's fiery speech echoed threats by Arab lawmakers to deprive
Barak's already shaky coalition of key votes it might need for
political survival.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Arab community leaders complained that Barak has turned
his back on them, even though an overwhelming number of Israel's 1
million Arab citizens voted for him in the May 1999 elections. In
his campaign, Barak had promised to make up for decades of
government discrimination in housing, education and budget
allocations.
</P>
<P>
   A strong undercurrent of discontent runs through Israel's
neglected Arab towns and villages, and erupts from time to time.
The latest trigger was the razing of two homes in the Arab village
of Kufr Nahaf two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli authorities said the homes were built without a license.
Arab leaders maintain that Israeli zoning favors Jewish communities
and makes it virtually impossible for Arabs to obtain building
permits. Arab legislator Mohammed Barakeh told community leaders
they should have protested the Kufr Nahaf demolitions.
</P>
<P>
   Arab legislator Abdel Malik Dahamshe was blunter Thursday. ''A
policeman who comes to demolish my home -- the one who comes to
break our arms and legs, it's our right to protect ourselves and
break his arms and legs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they would investigate Barakeh and Dahamshe for
incitement.
</P>
<P>
   Arab leaders, in turn, accused the police commander of northern
Israel, a region with a large Arab population, of racism and
demanded his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   The northern police chief, Alik Ron, announced this week that 41
Israeli Arabs had been arrested on suspicion of hoarding arms and
conspiring to attack police officers and soldiers. Ron also
referred to the incitement investigation, prompting complaints that
he was lumping together civil disobedience and conspiracy to commit
murder, and tainting the entire community.
</P>
<P>
   The growing discontent comes at a time when Barak is trying to
rebuild his coalition and regain a parliamentary majority before
parliament reconvenes in late October. Three hawkish factions had
quit the government in protest over concessions they said Barak was
likely to make at July's Mideast summit at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Arab lawmakers will back a treaty unconditionally, even if they
remain upset with Barak over domestic issues, Barakeh said.
However, as long as there is no peace deal, Barak's coalition
cannot count on the automatic support of the Arab legislators, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Proposes Alternate Anthem  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- An alternative to Israel's national anthem, a
paean to Jewish longing for Zion, is needed to accommodate the
aspirations of the country's Arab minority, a retired Supreme Court
justice said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by Miriam Ben-Porat, who is also a former state
comptroller, drew immediate fire from nationalists -- and praise
from Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Porat said discriminatory attitudes among Israel's Jewish
majority toward the Arab minority pose a danger and that having a
national song devoid of Jewish imagery would make it easier for
Israeli Arabs to celebrate Independence Day with their Jewish
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they want to celebrate, together with all of us, the
Independence Day of Israel where they were born and grew up, they
should be encouraged to do so,'' Ben-Porat said Thursday at a
convocation ceremony for Reform rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   She described the alternative as a ''national song'' that would
complement the official anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are precedents for the addition of a national song
alongside the anthem,'' she said. She did not cite examples, but
there are well-known songs in the United States, Australia and
Britain that sometimes substitute for national anthems.
</P>
<P>
   Arabs have long said there is nothing to attract them in
''Hatkivah'' -- ''The Hope'' -- the Israeli national anthem that
begins, ''As long as a Jewish soul beats deep in the heart'' and
expresses the longing for a return to Zion.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli Arabs say that national symbols -- including the
blue Star of David emblazoned on the flag -- remind them of the
tragedy of the Palestinian people who lost their country and fled
or were driven into exile during the first Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   ''I welcome her courageous position,'' said Arab legislator
Ahmed Tibi. ''Anyone who wants us as full partners and citizens and
as part of Israeli society must also address our position, which is
that all the symbols and ceremonies of the state of Israel have to
be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   One ultranationalist legislator, Rehavam Zeevi, walked out as
soon as Ben-Porat completed her speech Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Zevulun Orlev, of the hawkish National Religious Party,
suggested Ben-Porat was losing her grip.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened to her?'' he told Channel Two TV. ''Is she
ashamed that the state of Israel is a Jewish state? It's illogical,
irresponsible, even!''
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Porat's proposal of an alternative to ''Hatikvah'' is the
latest establishment nod to complaints of marginalization by Arabs,
who comprise a sixth of Israel's population. Last year for the
first time, the school curriculum included references to the flight
of Palestinian refugees in Israel's 1948 war of independence.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Protests Clog Europe's Streets  </HEADLINE>
By ARTHUR MAX
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Truckers' protests over high fuel
prices spread Friday, backing up traffic for miles on highways from
Spain to Poland. Some governments caved in while others refused,
reflecting the political divisions in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In The Hague, truck and taxi drivers circled government
buildings blaring their horns to demand tax breaks -- an unusually
boisterous protest in a nation where politics usually work on
consensus and quiet negotiation. Other angry Dutch drivers
dismantled highway barriers to escape traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   Strikers ruled many highways as protests reached into Spain,
Germany, Ireland, Poland and the Czech Republic. Thoroughfares were
jammed in dozens of cities from end to end of Europe -- from the
Baltic port of Gdansk, Poland to the Spanish coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government struck a deal with truckers to avoid a
strike, and Belgium and Britain began returning to normal as their
own protests eased.
</P>
<P>
   The varying responses of the governments also showed a streak of
disunity within the 15-member European Union; France -- where the
protests began -- gave in to protesters' demands for a tax break but
Britain refused to yield.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, where trucks, taxis and tractors blockaded the
center of the northern city of Bremen for three hours, the
government refused to back off a planned fuel tax increase. But it
said it was looking for ways to ease the pressure on the needy.
Newspaper reports spoke of help on heating fuel for the poor or
discount vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch government promised to meet truckers on Saturday to
find a way to end highway blockades. ''We want to stay within the
limits of the European Union. We don't want to break from the
rest,'' the Dutch economic affairs minister, Annemarie Jorritsma,
told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Taxi drivers closed the tunnel from Amsterdam to Schiphol,
choking off traffic to one of Europe's busiest airports for an hour
before dawn Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On some Dutch highways, motorists stuck in an endless ribbon of
motionless traffic took apart metal sections of the median
guardrails to make U-turns. Others sat morosely, waiting for the
blockade to lift.
</P>
<P>
   A disruption of supplies of fuel or components brought some auto
factories to a standstill in Germany and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   But Britain, the worst-hit country, began returning to normal
after protesters lifted a blockade of fuel depots and refineries.
Motorists joined long lines outside gasoline stations to fill their
tanks. The Department of Trade and Industry estimated that by
Friday night, 26 percent of the nation's 13,000 stations would have
fuel again. Prime Minister Tony Blair promised to listen to
protesters but offered no tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium, whose borders reopened after being closed by strikes
Thursday, also resumed an air of normalcy, except for a walking
protest in the industrial city of Charleroi by farmers and metal
workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands, truckers drove their rigs from every corner
the country to the graceful old streets of The Hague to blast their
message of protest outside government offices.
</P>
<P>
   Police in flak jackets stood by on alert near the Parliament
building, and diverted traffic from the narrow inner city streets
clogged by horn-hooting trucks. Police issued a permit to the truck
drivers on condition that they bring only their cabs into the city.
</P>
<P>
   High taxes on gas is a policy adopted in Europe decades ago as
an environmental measure to discourage excessive fuel consumption
and encourage the development of cleaner alternative sources.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes range from 51 percent in Greece to 73 percent in Britain,
where diesel cost an average of $4.33 a gallon last month. With
public concern mounting over global warming partially caused by
so-called greenhouse gases, the high tax rate has largely been
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   But crude oil prices have tripled since last December, to more
than $30 per barrel from $10, reaching a level transport workers
call a threat to the livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   ''The explosive increase in the price of diesel fuel has put
many companies on the verge of bankruptcy,'' said the Dutch
Transport Operators Association, which brought 360 trucks from the
country's 12 provinces to The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   The association demanded a reduction in diesel taxes by 20
percent to the European minimum, said spokeswoman Clarisse Buma.

<HEADLINE> Dow Sheds 113; Nasdaq Falls 85  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip and tech stocks fell sharply Friday on
a mix of profit-taking, bargain hunting and general anxiety about
corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 113.21 to 10,974.26 in
afternoon trading. The Nasdaq composite index was down 85.33 at
3,828.53, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 14.47 at
1,466.40.
</P>
<P>
   The government reported Friday that consumer prices fell in
August for the first time in 14 years. While the drop was
unexpected, it did little to inspire the market, which was already
beginning to factor in a slowing in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Software maker Oracle was down $4.81 at $80.13, a day after
investors pushed its price higher on upbeat speculation about its
corporate earnings. They weren't disappointed -- earnings beat Wall
Street estimates by 4 cents a share -- but the stock fell Friday on
profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also unloaded shares of Anadigics, after the wireless
communications company announced its earnings for the last half of
this year would be hurt by reduced orders. Anadigics traded down
$5.38 at $24.50.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board, home appliance maker Maytag lost $2.06,
falling to $33.75, after it warned that third and fourth-quarter
earnings will be below Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But shares of Xerox rose $1.88 to $17.88 on published reports it
is being eyed for acquisition by Hewlett-Packard, Canon and others.
</P>
<P>
   Another bright spot: Energy stocks, which rallied after
President Clinton expressed concern about oil prices, which have
soared to 10-year highs.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton rose $1.25 to $52.75; Schlumberger was up 98 cents
at $84.75 and Baker Hughes traded $1.31 higher at $38.81.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's downward trading was in line with what has become a
trend on Wall Street. The market has lacked clear direction, in
spite of the fact it appears unlikely that the Federal Reserve will
hike interest rates again. As a result, stocks have moved up and
down arbitrarily, driven by a specific piece of news or economic
data.
</P>
<P>
   ''The month of September is going to be pretty choppy,'' said
John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest. ''I see
things cooling off and calming down by the middle of next month
because I believe earnings reports overall will be solid, oil
prices should start to drift down and the Fed ... won't raise
interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of nearly
5-to-3 on the New York Stock exchange, where volume came to 960.40
million shares, well ahead of the 809.59 million shares Thursday.
Friday was a triple witching day, when the expiration of stock
options and futures contracts generally cause a spike upward in
volume.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 6.64 to 532.57.

<HEADLINE> UN To Investigate East Timor Deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- The United Nations has opened an
investigation into the deaths of five foreign journalists killed
during Indonesia's invasion of East Timor in 1975, a U.N. official
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 16, 1975, reporter Malcolm Rennie, 28, and cameraman
Brian Peters, 29, both British; reporter Greg Shackleton, 27, and
soundman Tony Stewart, 21, both Australian; and New Zealand
cameraman Gary Cunningham, 27, died in the town of Balibo.
</P>
<P>
   Australian investigators and the Indonesian government said they
were caught in a firefight between Indonesian troops and East
Timorese defenders. But former resistance fighters testified the
journalists were put to death by Indonesian invaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian forces were commanded by Maj. Gen. Leonardus
Benny Moerdani, one of former Indonesian dictator Suharto's closest
henchmen, who later served as defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor's U.N. police spokesman Antero Lopes said officials
have uncovered new information about the deaths that has prompted a
fresh investigation.
</P>
<P>
   He said investigators, from Canada, Nepal, Portugal, Australia
and Nigeria, have been assigned to look into the case.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's military invaded the former Portuguese colony in
1975. Some 200,000 people, mostly civilians, died during the famine
and military repression that led up to an Aug. 30, 1999,
independence referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Four-fifths of East Timorese voted for independence in the
U.N.-sponsored referendum. Widespread violence followed, with
pro-Indonesia militias killing hundreds of people.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Raising Soft Money  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal lawmakers are using political
committees to collect large contributions from companies and unions
that are banned from giving to senators' and representatives' own
re-election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   New Internal Revenue Service records show that 25 members of
Congress have set up committees to raise the special-interest
contributions, which are being spent to help state and local
candidates, to support state political parties or to wine and dine
delegates to the national party conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the lawmakers raising so-called soft money for their
leadership political action committees are the Republican leaders
of the House and Senate, including Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, as well as several Democrats
who support a ban on such unlimited contributions, including Senate
Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Rep. Patrick
Kennedy of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Kennedy, the chief fund-raiser for House
Democrats, defended the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to unilaterally disarm while Republicans spend
millions of dollars attempting to disguise their right-wing records
and their special interest agenda,'' said John Del Cecato,
spokesman for Kennedy's Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers' PACs report to the Federal Election Commission
any donations they raise or give that are regulated by federal law
-- donations that are strictly limited in size and usually go to
House and Senate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   However, many of the lawmakers have been taking donations
through the PACs and spending them on items not regulated by
federal law, such as state elections, without having to disclose
them.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in the summer when Congress passed a law requiring
tax-exempt groups that engage in political activities to disclose
their donors -- including leadership PACs that take soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers whose political committees took unlimited donations
had to identify themselves to the IRS by August. They'll formally
disclose the names of their donors and the amounts later this year.
</P>
<P>
   While they can't spend their soft money donations to aid
candidates for the House or Senate, these lawmakers can use the
money to help state political parties or elect state legislative
candidates, who will redraw congressional district lines after the
2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Nebraska, with state candidates, they can take corporate
money,'' explained Deb Fiddelke, speaking for Sen. Chuck Hagel,
R-Neb., who raises soft money for his Sandhills PAC. ''This allows
us to use soft money to help state candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., spent the soft money he raised for his
Rely on Our Beliefs PAC to finance events at the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, we did some things there that were helpful in terms
of party-building activities,'' Blunt said, citing receptions he
underwrote for convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The list of lawmakers raising soft money for their PACs includes
nine senators or House members who support banning such donations.
In addition to Kennedy and Daschle, they include Democratic Sen.
Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, the
third-ranking Democrat in the House.
</P>
<P>
   These political committees give special interests another avenue
for donating to leaders of Congress -- and in amounts they could not
give the lawmakers' re-election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate candidates can accept no more than $1,000 per
person per election, no more than $5,000 from political action
committees per election and no donations from corporations or
unions.
</P>
<P>
   Their leadership PACs, however, can accept five- and six-figure
donations straight from corporate or union treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the abuse of soft money,'' said Donald Simon, general
counsel for Common Cause, an advocacy group that supports a ban on
large corporate and union donations. ''There are no limits. There
are no rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''For that reason, there is virtually unlimited potential for
corruption and buying influence,'' Simon said. ''That's why it's so
dangerous to have powerful members of Congress in the business of
accepting unlimited financial gifts from special interests.''

<HEADLINE> Auction pulls in big bucks for state historic site  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENPORT, N.Y. (AP) - Restoration of Olana, the state's
castle-like historic site, is nearer as a result of one of its
preservationists' most successful auctions.
</P>
<P>
   The auction a week ago raised $40,000 to $45,000 for work on the
1870-1889 Moorish Italianate villa of painter, Frederic E. Church,
an artist of the style known as the Hudson River School.
</P>
<P>
   The group auctioned 103 pieces of art donated to the
organization or sold on consignment for a share of the proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just tremendous,'' said Heidi Hill, manager of the
auction and head of the mountaintop historic site overlooking the
Hudson River 30 miles south of Albany. ''It was the second largest
net (profit) generated by the auction in its nine-year history.''
</P>
<P>
   The major piece sold Sept. 9 was ''Resurrection Bay Alaska'' by
Rockwell Kent. It was valued before the auction at $3,000, but sold
for $25,000. Friends of Olana and another Hudson group will split
the profit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's auction raised $32,000.
</P>
<P>
   About $9 million is needed to help renovate the 250-acre estate,
including the mansion's roof and masonry and installation of a new
heating system.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani upbeat after undergoing prostate seed implantation  </HEADLINE>
By JUDIE GLAVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had radioactive seeds
implanted in his cancerous prostate gland Friday, and appeared
healthy and relaxed afterward, telling reporters the procedure was
painless and easier than he expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time that I spent this morning between 8 and 9 was not
nearly as painful as most of my morning meetings,'' the mayor joked
about five hours after the procedure. ''This was actually a much
quieter and more peaceful morning than I usually have as the mayor
of New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Mount Sinai hospital said the treatment for
Giuliani's prostate cancer went ''perfectly'' and called the mayor'
prognosis ''excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect him to be cured,'' said Dr. Alexander Kirschenbaum,
Giuliani's urological oncologist. ''He's doing great.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Stock said there were ''absolutely no
complications'' during the hour-long procedure, in which he used
tiny needles to insert the 90 titanium metal pellets, each the size
of a grain of rice.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani arrived at Mount Sinai around 6:45 a.m. and was in the
operating room at 7:30 a.m. The mayor, an opera fan, was under
local anesthetic and listened to music by the Three Tenors during
the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   He left to return to Gracie Mansion around 2:15 p.m. accompanied
by City Hall aides and his friend, Judith Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a few little pains,'' he said after arriving home.
''Right now I feel pretty good. But I also know it may not be that
way tomorrow, so I'll take it easy today.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted to being nervous before the seeds went in.
</P>
<P>
   ''You go through any form of a surgical procedure, you get a
little tense,'' he said. ''Once it's over, you say to yourself,
'Gee, that was easier than I thought it was going to be.' ... I
went through it with remarkably little pain or discomfort.''
</P>
<P>
   The procedure was the second phase of a three-phase treatment
plan. Giuliani has been undergoing hormone therapy for much of the
summer and will later have external radiation treatment, five times
a week for five weeks. He will continue taking hormones for three
more months.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he would probably return to work early next week.
Stock said most patients can resume work immediately after seed
implantation and continue working during external radiation
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds stay radioactive for about two months and can cause
treatable urinary problems, the doctors said, but the side effects
are considerably less than those caused by prostate surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was more candid Friday about his treatment choice than
he has been since announcing in April that he had prostate cancer.
He said he changed his mind frequently about what therapy to have
and made a final decision ''in stages.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I made the decision to take hormones way back four months ago,
and probably made the decision 70 or 80 percent that (seed
treatment) would be the best thing,'' he said. ''I kept my mind
open to other ideas ... and really finally made the decision to do
it this way, 100 percent, about two or three weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Many men Giuliani's age choose surgery to remove the prostate,
but that can cause impotence and incontinence. Kirschenbaum said
seed treatment had an ''excellent'' success rate. The American
Cancer Society puts five-year survival rates following the therapy
above 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mayor took his time, he did his homework,'' Kirschenbaum
said. ''There are so many uncertainties about this disease that you
cannot come out and say this is the best treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, 56, said he felt fine while taking the hormones,
although he experienced some hot flashes and sometimes felt too
tired to work.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was comfortable about dropping out of the Senate race
against Hillary Rodham Clinton, but admitted feeling some regret
Tuesday while watching her debate the man who took his place,
Republican Rep. Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ''For that one hour during the debate, I was thinking, 'Well, if
I was doing the debate, I would do it this way, I would do it that
way,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, though, he said he couldn't have simultaneously
run a Senate race and undergone cancer treatment. ''My
concentration wasn't there,'' he said. ''My concentration was on
figuring out what's the best cure for cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Giuliani's estranged wife, Donna Hanover, spoke
to reporters after receiving an award for her fund-raising efforts
for breast cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm doing everything possible under the circumstances to help
him,'' she said. ''I'm also keeping life as normal as possible for
our children, which includes taking them to Atlanta this weekend
for the long-planned wedding of one of Rudy's cousins. We are
grateful for all the prayers that are being said for Rudy's
recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor often appears in public with Nathan, an Upper East
Side divorcee whom he has called a ''very good friend.'' The two
listened to Luciano Pavarotti sing at Madison Square Garden on
Thursday night.

<HEADLINE> Judge Considers Northwest Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A federal judge is deciding whether to
grant class action status to a consumer lawsuit alleging that
Northwest Airlines engaged in monopolistic pricing after its 1986
merger with Republic Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Donovan Frank heard arguments Friday and
took the matter under advisement.
</P>
<P>
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived the case in
February 1999 and sent it back to District Court, ruling that U.S.
District Judge David Doty had erred in dismissing the lawsuit a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Seven consumers filed the lawsuit in 1997, alleging that the
Northwest-Republic merger stifled competition and led to
artificially high fares at Minneapolis-St. Paul International
Airport, where Northwest accounts for about 80 percent of the
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The consumers who sued Northwest don't want to unravel the
merger, but they seek as much as $400 million in alleged fare
overcharges each year. If the case is certified as a class action,
goes to court and Northwest is found to have engaged in
monopolistic pricing, travelers could be in line for refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest denies it has monopolistic control and has long
disputed studies showing higher ticket prices in the Twin Cities.
The airline also argues that because the merger was approved by the
U.S. Department of Transportation, it can't be challenged under the
Clayton Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the evidence shows that it wasn't the
Northwest-Republic merger that caused the results they are
claiming,'' Northwest spokeswoman Kathy Peach said after Friday's
hearing. ''Some prices are lower. There are lots of competitive
issues involved.''
</P>
<P>
   States that have filed friend-of-the-court briefs in the case
include Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Michigan, New York, North Dakota,
Ohio, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman disavows censorship as means of curbing violent entertainment </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Campaigning for the first time with first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, vice presidential candidate Joseph
Lieberman said Friday that censoring music would not help to deter
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe in censorship,'' Lieberman told students at
the Mark Twain Intermediate School for the Gifted and Talented. ''I
don't want the government to ever be in a position to tell a music
producer what to put in their product, but I do think that we in
government have a responsibility to be advocates and to appeal to
the entertainment industry to draw some lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and running mate Al Gore this week embraced a recent
Federal Trade Commission report that criticizes the entertainment
industry for marketing inappropriate material to youngsters.
Lieberman has said that he and Gore ''don't want to get into
content'' because that would threaten the First Amendment right to
freedom of speech, but that industry executives should voluntarily
adhere to rules prohibiting the marketing of such products to
children.
</P>
<P>
   When the entertainment industry ''rates products as only good
for adults and then turns around and markets them to kids, I think
we have a right to say, 'Hey, that's not fair. That makes a mockery
of your rating system,''' Lieberman said. ''When you do that, you
make an end-run around parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning with Clinton in her Senate campaign, Lieberman told
teachers, administrators and students that her concern for
improving education was exactly what the country needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore and I really want Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Senate
to help us lead the charge to improve America's public schools,''
Lieberman told the seventh and eighth graders gathered in the
school library.
</P>
<P>
   He detailed the Democrats' 10-year, $16 billion education plan
to recruit 1 million new teachers, which includes raising salaries
and making teachers more accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed with the Gore-Lieberman plan, saying, ''We demand
more and invest more; that's the equation that's especially needed
in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, also tried to bolster Clinton's
support in the Jewish community telling those gathered at the
school that ''Hillary Clinton in the United State Senate will be a
strong, strong supporter of the state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Republican Leadership Council, which has spent
about $1 million producing anti-Clinton television ads, said it
would halt such spending if Clinton agreed to sign a pledge by her
Republican opponent, Rick Lazio, to bar soft money from the Senate
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican congressman challenged Clinton to sign the pledge
during the candidates' first debate in Buffalo. The Clinton
campaign has raised millions of dollars so far in unlimited, soft
money donations. The Lazio camp said it stopped accepting soft
money donations in June.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spent Friday touring schools in Suffolk County. He made
appearances in Huntington and Middle Island before ending his day
at the Pulaski Street Elementary School in Riverhead, where he was
greeted with screams and flashbulbs as if he were one of the
Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign has said they won't sign any pact until
Lazio gets signed pledges from at least 14 outside groups,
including the Republican Leadership Council, saying they will halt
the independent ads.

<HEADLINE> Uzbek Group Added To Terrorist List  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States is adding to its list of
international terrorist organizations the Islamic Movement of
Uzbekistan, which has links to multimillionaire Saudi-born fugitive
Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Friday in a
statement the movement ''has threatened the lives of civilians and
regional security and undermined the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the group was responsible for criminal acts of terrorism
against Uzbek citizens and has also kidnapped four American
mountain climbers who were held hostage last month before they
managed to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan has also publicly called
for the violent overthrow of the government of Uzbekistan and has
claimed responsibility for ongoing armed incursions into Uzbekistan
and (neighboring) Kyrgyzstan'' in central Asia, Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   In notifying Congress that the movement was being added to a
list of 28 organizations sponsoring terrorism, Boucher said this
now makes it illegal for American citizens or persons residing in
the United States to provide funding or material support to the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury also is authorized to block any assets the
organization may have in the United States, although State
Department officials doubt it raises or keeps money here.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. embassies also can deny members of the organization or
their representatives visas, and they can be deported.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the State Department was authorized to make new
designations at any time or to remove a group from the terrorist
list. U.S. law says the list must be reviewed every two years.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Congressional Research Service, the movement is
part of bin Laden's global terrorism network known as Al-Qaida,
Arabic for military base.
</P>
<P>
   Other members are the Islamic Group and Al-Jihad of Egypt, the
armed Islamic Group of Algeria, Harakat ul-Mujahidin of Pakistan
and opposition groups in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   In a report last month, the research service said bin-Laden,
whom the United States has accused of blowing up two American
embassies in Africa in August 1988, is steadily eclipsing Iran and
other Middle East countries in sponsoring terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Uzbekistan's ambassador to the United States, Sodiq Safaef, said
the decision to add the movement to the terrorist last was
''extremely positive.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows that these are not freedom fighters as they claim but
skillful, well-financed and well-trained and well-armed killers,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Uzbek government holds the Islamic movement responsible for
five car bombings in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, in
February 1999. Uzbekistan claims the group was trying to kill
President Islam Karimov, who has banned religious political
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The movement's objective is to overthrow the secular government
in Uzbekistan state there and in other former Soviet republics in
central Asia.

<HEADLINE> UN OKs Eritrea-Ethiopia Peace Force  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council voted unanimously
Friday to authorize a 4,200-strong U.N. peacekeeping force to
monitor a cease-fire agreement between Eritrea and Ethiopia and
oversee the redeployment of troops from their disputed border.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came as Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said
negotiations on reaching an overall peace settlement with Eritrea
will start at the end of September or in early October.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are now in the second phase of tying up loose ends''
leading to ''a final and comprehensive agreement,'' Meles told
reporters at the National Press Club in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The United States drafted the resolution, which would authorize
the force to be deployed in a 15-mile buffer zone on the Eritrean
side of the 620-mile contested border while independent experts
conduct the demarcation of the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The beefed-up force would bolster a U.N. mission of 100 military
observers approved by the council July 31. The first troops of that
smaller force arrived in the region Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year border war flared after Ethiopia launched a
sweeping offensive into Eritrean territory on May 12, forcing some
1 million Eritreans to flee at a time when a regional drought
threatened hundreds of thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement to end the hostilities was signed June 18.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. force is to monitor the agreement and verify the
redeployment of Ethiopian troops that were not under Ethiopian
administration before the war began. The observers are also to
monitor the positions of Eritrean forces which must remain 16 miles
from the redeployed Ethiopian troops.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was ready to be approved weeks ago, but the vote
was held up while the United Nations contacted potential troop
contributors to determine who would be willing to provide units.
Diplomats said some industrialized countries, possibly including
Canada, might contribute to the mission.
</P>
<P>
   The mission is to be a ''classic'' peacekeeping operation, in
which U.N. troops occupy a demilitarized zone between two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In other recent conflicts, such as Sierra Leone and Congo, the
United Nations has been called on to monitor peace deals between
government and rebel groups within a single country. Such missions
are more complicated and dangerous than the one envisaged for
Eritrea and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   Under the resolution, an arms embargo imposed on both countries
would not apply to U.N. peacekeepers or U.N.-organized
mine-clearing operations.

<HEADLINE> French Detain Alleged Basque Leader  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYONNE, France (AP) -- Police on Friday detained an alleged
leader of the Basque separatist group ETA in the southwestern
French town of Bidart, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's Interior Ministry, which also reported the detention,
said Ignacio Gracia Arregui is considered the leader of ETA's
military wing, and allegedly ordered the failed 1995 assassination
attempt of King Juan Carlos of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Gracia Arregui, 45, was taken into custody while he was in
France with his girlfriend, Spain's Interior Ministry said. It said
it carried out the operation in conjunction with Spain's Civil
Guard and the French police.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 800 people have been killed since ETA started its
campaign for Basque independence.
</P>
<P>
   It ended a 14-month truce last December and has since been
blamed for 12 killings, eight of them since June.
</P>
<P>
   ETA, whose name stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has
mostly targeted security force members but in recent years has
begun killing members of both the Popular Party and the Socialist
opposition, both of whom oppose Basque independence.
</P>
<P>
   Gracia Arregui has been considered the leader of the military
wing of the ETA since 1992, when the leading members of the armed
group were arrested in Bidart, where he is being held, officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Servicemen's Remains Identified  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The remains of two U.S. Navy aviators
recovered from waters off the coast of Vietnam have been identified
and will be returned to their families for burial, the Pentagon
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One was identified as Lt. Cmdr. Roger B. Innes of Chicago. The
other officer's name is being withheld at the request of his
family.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made on National POW-MIA Recognition Day,
an annual observance by the Pentagon in memory of the thousands of
American veterans who are former prisoners of war and the thousands
who remain missing in action from World War II, the Korean War and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, remains believed to be those of nine U.S.
soldiers missing from the Korean War were flown to Hawaii for
identification. The remains were recovered in North Korea north of
Pyongyang, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The two Navy aviators went missing on Dec. 27, 1967 while flying
an F-4B Phantom jet along the coast of North Vietnam. Communication
with the plane was lost near an enemy target, and a search failed
to locate it.
</P>
<P>
   Based on information received from Vietnamese villagers in 1992
and subsequent interviews with local fishermen, U.S. and Vietnamese
divers in February and March 1998 surveyed an underwater site about
300 yards off the coast. Last year U.S. Navy divers recovered
remains, personal effects of the crew and aircraft debris in waters
approximately 30-45 feet deep. It was the first underwater recovery
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The remains were identified at the U.S. Army Central
Identification Laboratory in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   There are 2,005 U.S. servicemen unaccounted for from the Vietnam
War.

<HEADLINE> Inmates charged with helping murder suspect escape  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - Four inmates were charged with helping
a murder suspect escape, police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier L. Valentine, charged with the July shotgun slaying of a
22-year-old Norwich man, slipped out of the Otsego County Jail on
Sept. 1. He stole a minivan from a woman but was spotted by police
and captured a short time later hiding in a barn.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates are charged with cutting the bottom of a fence
around the recreation yard and holding it up to allow the
38-year-old Valentine to slip through.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin A. Garcia, 27, of New York City and James E. Northrop,
24, of Oneonta, were charged with first-degree escape and
first-degree promoting prison contraband, both felonies. Police
said they smuggled a hacksaw blade embedded in a sneaker brought
for one of the inmates by a visitor and cut through the fence over
a two-day span.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph J. McGuire, 21, of Corolla, N.C. and Melvin J. Bliss, 19,
of Oneonta, are accused of lifting the fence. They are charged with
first-degree escape.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine is charged with murder, robbery and burglary in the
death of Edward Pastore Jr. Police said he and five others robbed
Pastore of drugs and money before Valentine killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was moved to the Otsego jail from Chenango County
because he had threatened and intimidated other inmates. He was
returned to Chenango County after the escape try.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - In aggressively going after Hillary Rodham
Clinton during the first debate of their Senate campaign,
Republican Rick Lazio risked a possible backlash the first lady's
campaign has been encouraging ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The visually defining moment came at the very end of the
one-hour debate Wednesday night when Lazio walked to Clinton's
podium, waving his pledge to ban soft money from the campaign under
her nose and demanding her signature. She demurred.
</P>
<P>
   When he crossed the stage, he crossed the line, according to the
Clinton camp.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said the congressman
from Long Island appeared ''menacing'' at that moment.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not a nice guy,'' Wolfson told cable television's New
York 1. ''He looked senatorial in the tradition of Bobby Knight,''
the fired Indiana University basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   Since the debate there has been much talk about the danger men
face attacking women in politics and the fine line to be walked
when doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio camp insists any backlash on that front is
''mythical'' and exists largely in the minds of members of the
media.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can go too far, but he didn't,'' said Mike Murphy, Lazio's
chief campaign strategist. ''He didn't make any real personal
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They lost the debate. Their campaign is in trouble and they
know it,'' Murphy added. ''Their candidate did not perform and so
they're inventing this canard to try to distract everybody from the
defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll of 274 registered voters who watched the debate,
conducted for the New York Daily News and WCBS-TV by Blum &AMP; Weprin
Associates, gave the edge to Clinton, 49 percent to 36 percent,
when it came to who had done a ''better job'' in the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the debate, independent polls had shown that while
Clinton was making some gains among white women voters - a key bloc
for her and one where she had been trailing - Lazio was still doing
well among them.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after the debate, Lazio and his aides were defending
the congressman's aggressive style. They were also being asked
about the wisdom of attacking Clinton for blaming the ''vast
right-wing conspiracy'' during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Polling
then had shown the first lady's standing highest when she was
viewed as a victim.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll leave that for strategists,'' Lazio said Thursday when
asked about such concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't high tea. It's the Senate race in New York,'' Lazio
spokesman Dan McLagan said.
</P>
<P>
   That was a theme pushed by Lazio as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a race for the Senate, people expect plain talk,'' the
congressman said Thursday before leaving Buffalo, appearing pleased
with himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you go to the Senate, you've to be prepared to fight for
New York,'' he added during his next campaign stop at a charter
school in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in Oswego County, Lazio told supporters that viewers of
the debate ''found out something else about New Yorkers - we don't
back down from a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he was at a farm near Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the Senate, nobody's going to care if you're a man or a
woman,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the debate from pundits and voters has varied.
</P>
<P>
   New York Times columnist Gail Collins wrote that while Lazio
''was supposed to be the 'likable' candidate'' he ''morphed into a
political predator. Darth Vader with dimples ... (''Survivor'' show
winner) Richard Hatch with clothes on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post's David Broder came away from the debate
believing ''the 'stature gap' between Hillary Rodham Clinton and
her challenger, Rep. Rick Lazio, is smaller than many Democrats
would wish.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan McCormack, an undecided Democrat from Rochester told the
Buffalo News that she came away from the debate still undecided,
but feeling Lazio was ''too rough.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody who would like to slap her, raise your hand,'' said
Arthur Deruve of Yonkers as he watched the debate at the Sons of
Italy Lodge in White Plains.

<HEADLINE> State's top court rules no mayoral election needed in Utica  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - No special election is necessary in Utica to
replace a mayor who resigned with more than three years left in his
term, the state's highest court ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals' decision means that former Common Council
President Timothy Julian can complete the three years left on
ex-Mayor Edward Hanna's term.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, the head of the local legislative body succeeds
a mayor when the mayor is unable to complete a full term. The law
applies to cities like Utica in which the mayor and the local
legislative leader are elected at the same time for the same term,
the court determined.
</P>
<P>
   On July 3, the 78-year-old Hanna resigned because of a heart
condition and his age. City lawyers, citing the state law,
determined two days later that Julian could finish serving the
remainder of Hanna's term without the need for an election. The
state Board of Elections concurred that Julian, like Hanna a
Republican, could keep the job.
</P>
<P>
   But a former county legislator, Edward Revere, said city
residents should choose Hanna's replacement in a special election
this fall. Revere had planned to run on the Democratic and Right to
Life ballots if there was a special election.
</P>
<P>
   Revere's attorney, Richard Kaplan, argued that an exception
allowing city charters to override the state law applies to Utica.
Under that exception, charters dating before Nov. 5, 1975, that
require an election in case of a mayoral vacancy happening before
Sept. 20 supersedes the state law. Revere said Utica's city charter
met the conditions for the exception and so Julian should be mayor
only on an interim basis.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vacancy (for mayor) occurred prior to Sept. 20, so there
is the need for a vote,'' Kaplan told judges at a hearing Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Frye, a private lawyer representing the city, disagreed.
He said the exception originally intended to affect only New York
City and in any event, it may only apply to cases where there is a
vacancy. Since Utica followed the state law and allowed Julian to
succeed Hanna immediately following the resignation, a vacancy did
not exist, Frye reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're trying to say that the exception applies and that the
general rule doesn't,'' Frye said.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals Friday essentially agreed with Frye,
stating that the ''legislative history'' of the state law ''leaves
no doubt as to the limited purpose of the exception.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Legislature did not enact the exception to invite local
departures from the statewide design for mayoral succession,'' the
court said.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals' decision upheld a lower appellate court
ruling. That five-member panel in Rochester had unanimously
overturned an earlier decision by state Supreme Court Justice John
Tenney calling for a special election in November.
</P>
<P>
   Utica Corporate Counsel John Dillon said final decision ''comes
as no great surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very pleased to receive another unanimous decision,''
Dillon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least it we got a clarification of the law in this case,''
Kaplan said. ''Unfortunately, it seems like no other cities but New
York City can be a part of the (exception).''
</P>
<P>
   The state's top court, which usually takes months to review a
case, took timing into consideration in this instance and sped up
the process. The court received the request for a hearing in late
August and agreed Thursday to hear arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Judges peppered both Frye and Kaplan with questions throughout
each lawyer's 15-minute presentation Friday morning and handed down
the ruling less than five hours later.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuits: Ritalin maker encouraged overdiagnosis of child disorders </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Two lawsuits filed this week accuse the
makers of the drug Ritalin and the American Psychiatric Association
of encouraging overdiagnosis of behavioral disorders in children to
boost sales of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis Pharmaceutical Corp. and the American Psychiatric
Association promoted the belief that a large number of children
need to take Ritalin for attention deficit disorder or attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, the lawsuits filed in New Jersey
and California allege.
</P>
<P>
   A similar suit against the East Hanover, N.J.-based maker of the
drug and the American Psychiatric Association was filed earlier
this year in Texas. The latest suits were filed Wednesday in state
Superior Court in Hackensack and in San Diego federal court by some
of the same attorneys who filed huge lawsuits against gun makers
and the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis and Ciba-Geigy Corp., which produced Ritalin before it
merged to form Novartis in 1996, also donated hundreds of thousands
of dollars to an organization of members with attention deficit or
hyperactivity disorder, the lawsuits say.
</P>
<P>
   And the companies and the American Psychiatric Association
worked together to include the diagnosis of the two disorders and
list it in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders in 1980, creating a huge market for the drug, the
lawsuits say.
</P>
<P>
   The companies released misleading sales literature about
Ritalin's effectiveness, ''without ever advising ... that Ritalin
usage would not stimulate or improve academic performance and/or
have any long-term effect on the symptoms associated with ADD or
and/or ADHD,'' the California lawsuit says.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis released a statement Friday calling the charges
''unfounded and preposterous'' and noted that attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder has been recognized by medical
experts worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The American Psychiatric Association also denied the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The APA will defend itself vigorously by presenting a mountain
of scientific evidence to refute these meritless allegations and we
are confident that we will prevail,'' the association said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Between 4 percent and 12 percent of school-age children - about
3 million, mostly boys - are believed to have attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The symptoms of short attention
span, impulsive behavior and difficulty sitting still are also
associated with youthful rambunctiousness, which has raised
questions of whether youngsters are being overmedicated.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional hearings recently examined whether Ritalin, a
brand name for the stimulant methylphenidate, is overprescribed for
the disorders. The American Academy of Pediatrics issued its first
guidelines earlier this year for diagnosing the disorders, stating
that a child must show symptoms in two settings for at least six
months.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits, filed on behalf of boys who took the drug in both
New Jersey and California, say that Ciba-Geigy Corp. began a
conspiracy to boost the Ritalin market in the mid-1950s, leading to
the creation of the ADD diagnosis in the Diagnostic Statistical
Manual. In 1987, the diagnosis was expanded to attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits say that the drug's makers gave $748,000 to the
California advocacy group Children and Adults with
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder between 1991 and 1994 to
help promote Ritalin sales.

<HEADLINE> Pressure continues on Hillary Clinton over money raising  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton is involved in a
''blatant abuse of power'' by having Senate campaign contributors
stay over at the White House or the Camp David presidential
retreat, Republican rival Rick Lazio's campaign manager said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''History is again repeating itself and has reached a new low,''
said Bill Dal Col.
</P>
<P>
   ''The use of the Lincoln Bedroom and Camp David as
accommodations for campaign 'supporters' is nothing less than a
taxpayer-funded abuse of power, and is yet another example of why
New Yorkers can't trust Hillary Clinton,'' Dal Col said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Republican Leadership Council, which has spent
heavily on anti-Clinton television advertising in New York, said
Friday it would halt such efforts if the first lady agreed to sign
Lazio's pledge to bar soft money from the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman had waved the pledge in front of Clinton's face
during their first debate of the campaign Wednesday night in
Buffalo. She refused to sign it and continues to insist that Lazio
get signed pledges from at least 14 outside groups, such as the
RLC, that they will not run such independent ads before she will
sign the pledge.
</P>
<P>
   The actions served to continue pressure on the first lady's
campaign over its fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a report in The New York Times on Friday that
President Clinton and his wife met late last week with her
fund-raising team to tell them to step up their efforts. The report
said Mrs. Clinton was ''alarmed'' by the success Lazio has had
raising money.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent filings with the Federal Election Commission
show Lazio had $10.2 million on hand as of the end of August while
the first lady had $7.1 million. That does include the millions of
dollars in soft money she has also raised through other committees.
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col said that in addition to releasing the names of recent
overnight guests at the White House and Camp David - something the
White House has agreed to do - the Clinton campaign should ''list
the amount of dollars Mrs. Clinton's guests have contributed to
campaign committees, and to stop this blatant abuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the first lady said campaign contributors have been
invited to such sleepovers, but denied any quid-pro-quo involving
invitations in return for money.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have friends and supporters come and spend time with us and
spend the night with us that we are getting to know and who like
spending time with us,'' she said. ''I don't see what's news about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was criticized after the 1996
re-election campaign for inviting big donors to spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Lincoln Bedroom was never sold,'' Clinton said in 1997,
when aides released a list of 938 guests who had spent the night at
the White House to that point in the Clinton presidency. The list
included political supporters, as well as entertainment luminaries
and old Clinton friends.
</P>
<P>
   In offering to bow out of New York's Senate race, the RLC's
executive director, Mark Miller, said, ''Mrs. Clinton has a
personal credibility problem because she often says one thing and
does another. With our offer today, Mrs. Clinton has the
opportunity to prove she's not a hypocrite.''
</P>
<P>
   The RLC, which includes such Lazio boosters as New York Gov.
George Pataki among its leadership, has already spent about $1
million on anti-Clinton ads.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means one down, 13 to go,'' Clinton campaign spokesman
Howard Wolfson said. ''Now it's time for Mr. Lazio to show real
leadership and get the rest of his allies to sign on the dotted
line and agree to stop their negative campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio camp is convinced Clinton has no intention of giving
up soft money and that the demand for signed non-aggression
statements from so many outside groups is proof of that.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Clinton campaign is addicted to soft money,'' Lazio said
Thursday during a campaign stop in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the RLC move, Lazio campaign spokesman Michael
Marr said, ''The heat just got turned up on Mrs. Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Marr said Clinton should also call on the ''various left-wing
outside groups that have already worked on behalf of her campaign
to honor the pact.'' Marr cited the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League and the AFL-CIO as such groups.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL, responding to a letter sent out by Lazio to pro-Clinton
groups, announced Friday that if the congressman could get the
groups supporting him to keep out of the campaign, it would as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has not been raising soft money for his Senate bid, but
has not ruled out doing so if Clinton continues to use it.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Russia Bank in Illegal Deals  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. government has accused a leading
Russian bank of playing a central role in the movement of $7
billion over three years through accounts at the Bank of New York
to fund suspicious or illegal activities worldwide, recently
unsealed court documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Sobinbank said Friday, however, that is has no knowledge of any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, which surfaced in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan in the past week, say ''at the center of this illegal
operation'' were two bank accounts at the Bank of New York for two
Russian banks with common ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts belonged to Sobinbank and Depozitarno Kliringovy
Bank, otherwise known as DKB, and were ''in short, the pipeline for
this illegal scheme,'' according to arguments by federal
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York scandal touched off a two-year federal
probe that led to guilty pleas to money-laundering charges by a
former Bank of New York executive and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Edwards, the bank's former Eastern European Division vice
president, and her husband, Peter Berlin, said they helped Russian
bankers launder billions to avoid Russian taxes and cover up the
money's connection to crimes -- including money used as ransom for a
kidnapping in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government implicated Sobinbank as a key player in the
money laundering scheme as it sought to support its Aug. 20, 1999
seizure of $15.27 million from the Sobinbank account and about
$11,000 from a DKB account.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Richard Conway Casey concluded in an Aug. 25
ruling that prosecutors in the office of U.S. Attorney Mary Jo
White had, at least for now, sufficiently alleged Sobinbank's
knowing involvement in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court cannot fathom how billions of Sobinbank's dollars
could have been transferred out of its constantly replenished (Bank
of New York) account to accounts in the United States without
Sobinbank's knowledge or willful blindness to the scheme,'' the
judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He added that it was early enough in the case that Sobinbank may
still prove at trial that it was an unknowing participant ''either
because the money was not used illegally or because the bank had no
knowledge of its illegal use.''
</P>
<P>
   In footnotes, the judge said he chose to allow the allegations
to be made public because allegations against the bank were already
public and because, despite the bank's claims that it was an
innocent third party to the money laundering, ''there are
allegations in the complaint that suggest Sobinbank may not be
entirely innocent in this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lesch, a lawyer for Sobinbank, said the bank's position
was that it had ''absolutely no knowledge of any wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Serebrennikov, deputy chairman of Sobinbank's board, said
in a statement released Friday that the bank ''is not involved with
the participants'' of the money laundering scandal.
</P>
<P>
   He said the bank is trying to get back money seized,
''principally based on the unproven theory that the seized funds
... were associated with illegal money laundering activities by
persons other than Sobinbank.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Sobinbank has no knowledge of such activities and believes
that the seizure of the funds is illegal and unconstitutional,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted also that the U.S. government has not filed any
complaint or initiated any criminal investigation against
Sobinbank, even though the funds were seized more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Haddad, a spokesman for U.S. prosecutors, declined to
comment Friday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Criticizes Lee Detention  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee's nine-month
pretrial detention conflicts with America's disdain for ''abusive
executive authority,'' President Clinton said Friday as his
administration came under growing criticism over the handling of
the nuclear security case.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans in Congress called the Justice Department's
pursuit of the Taiwan-born scientist a ''fiasco'' and at least one
Senate hearing on the government's actions has been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old Taiwan-born scientist, fired from his job at the
Los Alamos weapons lab in March 1999 and vilified as a suspected
spy, pleaded guilty to one count of mishandling classified material
and was set free Wednesday. The government dropped 58 other felony
counts that once charged him with endangering some of America's
most sensitive nuclear secrets. He was never charged with espionage
and has maintained he never provided secrets to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers said Friday that Lee had given the go-ahead to
pursue a civil lawsuit accusing the government of violating federal
privacy laws by leaking information suggesting he was a spy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. Lee does intend to proceed with his privacy act lawsuit,''
said Heather Hersh, one of his attorneys. The lawsuit, which had
been on hold since May pending outcome of the criminal case, may
also address whether Lee was singled out by investigators because
he is ethnic Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The civil suit, filed shortly after Lee was indicted in
December, is being heard in U.S. District Court in Washington D.C.
Lee's lawyers had argued in the now-concluded criminal case heard
in Albuquerque, N.M., that the scientist had become a suspect
because of his Chinese heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he has seen no evidence of racial profiling in
connection with the Lee case. ''I don't believe that,'' he told
reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But the president, who on Thursday had said he was concerned
about how the Lee matter was handled, was sharply critical Friday
of Lee's pretrial detention -- nine months in solitary confinement,
often shackled and under conditions normally reserved for
terrorists. allowed little contact with even his family.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutor George Stamboulidis said, however, that Lee
spent almost six hours a day, four days a week in the federal
courthouse working with his lawyers on his defense and even
traveled to Los Alamos as part of that effort during his detention.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that the Justice Department, in opposing bail, had
argued strongly that Lee's release on bail would pose a grave
security risk ''and then all of a sudden there was a plea agreement
that was inconsistent with the claims that were made.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That raises a question ... about whether we have been as
careful as we ought to be,'' said Clinton, adding such detention
runs counter to America's traditional opposition to ''abusive
executive authority.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever we hold anybody in prison ... we need to have a very
high threshold,'' said Clinton. ''There ought to be an analysis
over whether that threshold was crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he planned to discuss the matter with Attorney
General Janet Reno, who has defended her department's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Later, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart, when asked the
government owed Lee an apology, said, ''There's no discussion of
that.'' Clinton noted that while most of the felony counts were
dropped, Lee still admitted to having committed ''a serious
national security violation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lee investigation, which caused nearly two years of
controversy and heated exchanges in Congress over the alleged loss
of nuclear secrets to China and lax security at the Energy
Department's nuclear weapons laboratories, will get another airing
on Capitol Hill this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee has tentatively scheduled a
hearing for the week of Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing will address why Lee was kept in solitary
confinement, whether he was a victim of racial profiling, and why
the government abruptly switched from adamantly opposing bail to
letting Lee be set free, said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   There was ''absolute incompetence'' in the handling of the case,
Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, accused the FBI, and Energy and
Justice departments of ''bungling'' the investigations into nuclear
security problems. ''They need to be held accountable for this
miscarriage of justice,'' Grassley said Friday.

<HEADLINE> Model refugee camp opens amid joggers and roller-bladers in Central Park </HEADLINE>
By MIRANDA LEITSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Aid workers and former refugees have built a
model refugee camp amid the joggers, roller-bladers and other
leisure seekers in Central Park to illustrate the experience of the
world's 39 million people who now seek shelter and safety in such
camps.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this exhibit, we hope to spark concern, interest and
knowledge'' about refugees, said Joelle Tanguy, executive director
of Doctors Without Borders, which organized the exhibit. ''We seek
to bring across the scale (of the refugees' plight) and make it
tangible to people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What would you and your family do if you were uprooted in a
war?'' Tanguy asked at a news conference Friday, the first day of a
two-day exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers from the group, known as MSF from its French name
Medecins Sans Frontieres, led schoolchildren through the camp, from
the three different types of shelters - for tropical, desert and
winter climates - to a water pumping station and food center.
</P>
<P>
   Some children were afraid of the cone-shaped, canvas winter
tents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sleeping in there,'' said Vaughn Paige, 9, from the
Central Park East 1 School, as an aid worker asked some 10 kids to
lie down head-to-head in a tent.
</P>
<P>
   Other children groaned as they tried to carry buckets of water
about 10 feet. Only one girl was able to carry it a short distance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now imagine if you had to carry that a mile,'' said MSF
volunteer Rondy Anderson, 42, who just returned from a mission in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Davies, a public educator with MSF, said safe water
was one of the most important needs in a camp. ''Cholera is the No.
1 risk in a population displacement. It just spreads like wildfire.
That's why the water source and the waste disposal are so
important.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time MSF, winner of the 1999 Nobel Peace prize,
set up its model refugee camp in the United States. It was created
in 1996 to celebrate the organization's 25th anniversary and has
traveled to several European cities and the United Arab Emirates.
The exhibit will stop at other areas around the city and then
travel to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers gathered at the food center, where they learned that
refugees are usually given two cups of rice, beans, sugar and
vegetable oil for their families. But they were warned that in some
dire cases, only compressed nutrient-enriched biscuits would be
available.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen from Harlem's Thurgood Marshall Academy tasted the
biscuits. Some spat them out, while others said they tasted like a
Ritz cracker.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't like it at all,'' said Angelina Carter, 14.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorker Christina Moore, a psychologist who worked with MSF
in Albania during the Kosovo conflict, showed the teen-agers the
makeshift, thatched latrines covered with a blue tarp.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't give you a lot of privacy, does it?'' Moore asked
the teens.
</P>
<P>
   ''What are you going to do to clean yourself?'' asked one teen,
as the others cried out the same question with shock and dismay.
</P>
<P>
   Later, two teens from the group, described to their classmates
the bracelet of life, a paper bracelet with four color-coded zones,
that MSF workers use to see if a child is malnourished.
</P>
<P>
   ''The red zone is the most deadly,'' said Akeem Rasool, 14, as
he held up the arm of a plastic doll at a medical tent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's scary because you have a little child, they are not
healthy and they are going to die,'' said Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the youngsters and educators agreed that the experience
was worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly is something that our kids can benefit from. They
need to learn about situations around the world,'' said Shelley
Inniss, 50, who teaches a social change course at Thurgood
Marshall. ''It's important that they compare their lives with
others.''

<HEADLINE> Agency charges GM with harassment, discrimination at Linden plant  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Employees at General Motors Corp.'s Linden
plant passed around pornographic pictures and used racial epithets
while managers did nothing to stop them, the federal government
charged in a discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued GM
Thursday on behalf of a black, female employee who said she was
sexually harassed and subjected to a racially hostile work
environment since 1997 at the 2,400-employee plant, which makes
sports utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A male worker in the plant's paint department exposed himself to
employee Mary Scott, and was not punished once Scott complained to
managers, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   At a retirement party in September 1997, employees passed around
photographs of a male manager's buttocks and genitalia, the lawsuit
said. Scott complained in writing and no one was disciplined, the
suit said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott complained on Sept. 18, 1997, that two male employees
frequently used sexually-oriented profanity and made gestures to
simulate sex acts in her presence, the suit said. And the employees
frequently used racial epithets to describe blacks at work, the
suit said.
</P>
<P>
   GM spokeswoman Kelly Cusinato said the Pontiac, Mich., company
had been in discussions with the EEOC and was disappointed by the
lawsuit. The company has completed an investigation of the matter,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to comment on whether employees had been
disciplined, but said the company is ''currently evaluating
appropriate responses to the EEOC complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These are allegations that any employer would be disturbed by,
especially one like General Motors that is committed to creating a
workplace environment that is free from discrimination, hostility
or harassment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, one of two black and female employees among the 16 people
on her shift in the paint department, has been on medical leave to
cope with the stress of her work environment, EEOC officials said.
She filed a complaint with the EEOC in 1998.

<HEADLINE> FDA OK's Generic Therapy Taxol  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration approved on
Friday the first generic version of the popular cancer therapy
Taxol, a move that promises many breast and ovarian cancer patients
cheaper therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Ivax Corp. of Miami said its generic paclitaxel will be
available later this fall. While Ivax would not reveal the price,
company president Neil Flanzraich noted generic drugs typically
debut 30 percent cheaper than their brand-name competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be sold at a significantly reduced price,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taxol therapy can cost $5,000 to $7,000, depending on the extent
of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Taxol is one of the most widely used treatments for breast and
ovarian cancer, expected to earn manufacturer Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. $1.2 billion in U.S. sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   Generic paclitaxel is safe and effective, and in the body is
equivalent to Taxol, said Gary Buehler, FDA's generic drug chief.
</P>
<P>
   There is a slight difference in how the two products are made.
Generic paclitaxel is made from the needles of yew trees,
Flanzraich said. Bristol-Myers makes Taxol synthetically.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA was ready to approve paclitaxel on Aug. 28, but a
last-minute patent fight delayed the action. This week, a federal
appeals court in California lifted the last legal hurdle, a patent
request that could have delayed generic competition by another 30
months.
</P>
<P>
   Taxol was discovered by the taxpayer-funded National Cancer
Institute, which licensed the drug to Bristol-Myers. First approved
in 1992 as second-line therapy for advanced ovarian or breast
cancer, Taxol today also is used against AIDS-related Kaposi's
sarcoma and lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Only the first breast and ovarian patents have expired, and thus
the FDA formally approved generic paclitaxel just for those
patients. But it is legal for physicians to use generic paclitaxel
for other patients, too.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Ivax, which soared 25 percent last week after a
federal judge reversed an order that would have extended
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s current lock on sales, closed up 6
percent, or $2.50 per share, at $43.75 Friday on the American Stock
Exchange. Bristol-Myers stock was up 12.5 cents at $53.44 a share
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Skydiver making night jump killed, found away from his parachute  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WANTAGE, N.J. (AP) - Aviation officials are investigating the
death of an Italian skydiver whose body was found about a
quarter-mile from his parachute after a night jump, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Police recovered the body of Gianni Lattarico, 24, in a
wooded area at 12:45 p.m. Friday, while his parachute was found in
some trees, State Police Sgt. Al Della Fave said.
</P>
<P>
   Lattarico, who is from Italy, was part of a team of four
skydivers who left from Sussex Airport Thursday night to make a
jump that would qualify them to regularly parachute at night, Della
Fave said.
</P>
<P>
   Lattarico was the last of the four to jump at 9:15 p.m.
Thursday, and should have landed four minutes later, Della Fave
said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident is under investigation. Federal
Aviation Administration officials will send an inspector to
determine whether Lattarico's parachute was packed correctly,
spokeswoman Arlene Salac said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 160; Nasdaq Sheds 79  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors' continuing nervousness about
corporate profits pushed blue chips and technology stocks to their
lowest levels in more than a month Friday despite a government
report indicating inflationary pressures are easing.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 160.47 to
10,927.00, its biggest drop since July 26. The decline left the Dow
with a loss of 293.65 or 2.6 percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was down 78.63 at 3,835.23, down
143.18, or 3.6 percent, for the week. The close was the lowest for
the Nasdaq since Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 15.06 at 1,465.81, down
28.69 for the week or 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors maintained their focus on corporate earnings rather
than the economy, a trend that was established early in the week.
</P>
<P>
   While the government reported Friday that consumer prices fell
unexpectedly in August, the first decline in 14 years, the news did
little to inspire the market, which has already factored in a
slowing in inflation. Many investors sought to take profits in
stocks that they perceived as being vulnerable to weak earnings as
the economy cools.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economy is seemingly slowing pretty decisively. There's a
lot of concern about whether the earnings are going to be there. So
far we've had decent numbers, but the street is running a bit
scared,'' said Charles White, president of Avatar Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was also a quarterly triple witching day, when the
expiration of stock options and futures contracts generally cause a
spike upward in volume and can lead to big price swings.
</P>
<P>
   The exception to Friday's downward move was the energy sector.
It rallied as crude oil prices, which have soared to 10-year highs,
flirted with $36 a gallon Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton rose $1.18 to $52.69; Schlumberger was up 92 cents
at $84.69 and Baker Hughes traded $1.50 higher at $39.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that rising oil prices might prove inflationary
in the future also appeared to be a factor in the market's overall
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Software maker Oracle was down $6.63 at $78.31, a day after
investors pushed its price higher on upbeat speculation about its
corporate earnings. They weren't disappointed -- earnings beat Wall
Street estimates by 4 cents a share -- but the stock fell Friday on
profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also unloaded shares of Anadigics, after the wireless
communications company announced its earnings for the last half of
this year would be hurt by reduced orders. Anadigics traded down
$5.20 at $24.67.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board, home appliance maker Maytag lost $2.19,
falling to $33.63 after it warned that third and fourth-quarter
earnings will be below Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But Xerox rose $1.94 to $17.94 -- more than 12 percent -- on
published reports it is being eyed for acquisition by
Hewlett-Packard, Canon and others.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems rose $1.50 to $62.75.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has lacked clear direction for several weeks despite
the fact it appears unlikely that the Federal Reserve will hike
interest rates again. As a result, stocks have moved up and down
arbitrarily, driven by a specific piece of news or economic data.
</P>
<P>
   ''The month of September is going to be pretty choppy,'' said
John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest. ''I see
things cooling off and calming down by the middle of next month
because I believe earnings reports overall will be solid, oil
prices should start to drift down and the Fed ... won't raise
interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of more than
5-to-3 on the New York Stock exchange, where volume came to 1.22
billion shares, well ahead of 1 billion shares Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 8.33 to 530.88.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average was up 0.14 percent.
Germany's DAX index fell 0.69 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 slipped
2.11 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.35 percent.

<HEADLINE> Labor Department says official did nothing improper in conversation with Miss America </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Labor Department on Friday rejected
allegations that one of its officials tried to improperly persuade
Miss America, Heather French, to change her congressional testimony
in favor of a veterans employment and training bill.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to two House members who bitterly complained about
the alleged conduct of Espiridion (Al) Borrego, Labor Secretary
Alexis M. Herman said ''there were no laws or regulations
violated'' by the official, who is assistant secretary for
Veterans' Employment and Training.
</P>
<P>
   French told The Associated Press in July that on the eve of her
House testimony, Borrego was ''trying to intimidate'' her by saying
that provisions in the bill ''would cause more than 3,000 veterans
to lose their jobs and become homeless. I took that as if he was
definitely trying to shake my testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   While French did not waver in her July 12 testimony, Rep. Jack
Quinn, R-N.Y., demanded an explanation from Herman about Borrego's
telephone conversation with French, and Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill.,
demanded the official's resignation. Quinn is chairman of a House
Veterans Affairs subcommittee and Evans is the full committee's top
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Herman ordered a review by department Solicitor Henry Solano,
and her letters to the lawmakers Friday reported on his
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Quinn, Evans or French could immediately be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Terry Everett, R-Ala., chairman of the House Veterans
Affairs investigations subcommittee, said, ''I am very concerned
about these allegations of intimidation and coercion by an
administration official which appear aimed at influencing the
outcome of VA committee legislation. I, therefore, intend to
request that the Department of Labor's inspector general's office
investigate these allegations. Furthermore, I call upon Labor
Secretary Alexis Herman to look into these charges, and if proven
true, to order his dismissal.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general has considerable independence from
department officials, even though the office is part of the
department.
</P>
<P>
   Herman wrote that the solicitor and the department's career
ethics officer ''concluded that there was no effort to persuade Ms.
French to advocate a particular position in her testimony; modify
her testimony in any way or refrain from testifying.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having reached these conclusions, the solicitor and the ethics
officer determined that there were no laws or regulations violated
by Mr. Borrego or any other member of the staff... .''
</P>
<P>
   French, the daughter of a Marine veteran who was wounded in
Vietnam, has made homeless veterans her cause and testified several
times before Congress about their plight.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego had objected to an early version of the legislation,
which included language that could have cost government-paid
employment counselors their jobs if they didn't meet performance
standards. While the Department of Veterans Affairs runs most
veterans programs, the Labor Department is in charge of federal
employment and training assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Borrego thought that as a matter of courtesy, he should
alert Ms. French that she would be appearing on the same panel as
someone he perceived as a potential critic of the department,''
Herman wrote. ''In retrospect, it appears that not enough planning
went into this call and Mr. Borrego became overly detailed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Borrego has advised me that he regrets that Ms. French
initially interpreted the call in a different way, and that it was
not his intent to affect her testimony in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrego issued his own statement, saying he ''regrets any
confusion stemming from my telephone conversation with Ms. French''
and said he looked forward to working with her on behalf of
veterans.

<HEADLINE> BIC responds to national lighter recall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILFORD, Conn. (AP) - A New Jersey company is recalling about
294,000 disposable cigarette lighters made by Milford-based BIC
Corporation because they lack federally required child-resistant
mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   Vaid Enterprises of Jersey City, N.J., is recalling the lighters
because young children could ignite them, the Consumer Product
Safety Commission said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the company nor the agency is aware of any injuries
involving the lighters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The recalled lighters are gray goods, meaning they were never
intended for sale in the U.S., and were illegally brought into this
country by Vaid Enterprises,'' said Thomas M. Kelleher, senior vice
president-administration and general counsel for BIC. ''The
recalled lighters were produced in a BIC factory in France for sale
in markets outside the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The disposable lighters being recalled are oval-shaped ''BIC''
and mini-''BIC'' brand lighters. They have a green, red, blue,
black or yellow body and a metal top.
</P>
<P>
   The standard size lighters have the UPC number 3 086120 600020.
The mini-lighters have the UPC number 3 086120 600051.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience, gas, grocery and thrift stores in the East sold the
lighters from January through April for about $1 each.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should stop using these lighters immediately and
return them to the place of purchase for a refund.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, consumers should call the CPSC at
1-800-638-2772.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party takes its fight to state Supreme Court  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW DALY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD - The fractious Connecticut Reform Party has taken its
fight over the presidential ballot to the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Francis McDonald Jr. will preside Monday, as
lawyers for the party's two competing factions argue whether Pat
Buchanan or John Hagelin deserves the Reform line on the state
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The high-court hearing was scheduled after Buchanan's supporters
filed a lawsuit in Hartford Superior Court to get Buchanan's name
on the ballot. They claim the conservative commentator deserves the
Reform line because he was chosen at their raucous nominating
convention in Long Beach, Calif. last month.
</P>
<P>
   But Hagelin's backers, who walked out of that convention and
held their own across the street, call the pro-Buchanan vote
invalid. They say Hagelin, an Iowa physicist, is the party's real
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The squabble has led state elections officials to declare the
party ''over-nominated.'' Until the internal differences are sorted
out, neither man will be listed on the Reform Party line of the
ballot, Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is already on the ballot in Connecticut as the
candidate of the Freedom Party. But his supporters, unhappy with
Bysiewicz's decision, filed suit this week to place Buchanan's name
on the Reform line as well.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before a scheduled hearing on the case Friday, Buchanan
supporters agreed to move the claim from the Superior Court to the
Supreme Court, after Hagelin's supporters had threatened to seek an
injunction on jurisdictional grounds.
</P>
<P>
   John Conway, a lawyer representing the pro-Buchanan faction,
said he was pleased McDonald had agreed to hear the case so
quickly. He expects a ruling by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confident we'll prevail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conway and other Buchanan supporters cited a ruling this week by
the Federal Election Commission awarding Buchanan $12.6 million in
federal campaign funds belonging to the Reform Party. In a related
development, a California judge ruled Wednesday that Buchanan, not
Hagelin, is the Reform nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Donovan, state chairwoman of the Reform Party and a
Hagelin backer, said she also is pleased the case will be decided
by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Reform party members in the state do not share
Buchanan's ideology, Donovan said, and should not be saddled with
him as the party's presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have a strong case,'' Donovan said. ''This is
precedent-setting in terms of the rights of a state party
organization to be in charge of their own destiny.''

<HEADLINE> Poet Angelou Falls Ill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Poet Maya Angelou went to a hospital
emergency room Friday morning, hours after she left an appearance
at the University of Nebraska in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old Angelou was not admitted to BryanLGH Medical
Center West, an employee said. She did cancel an appearance Friday
in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   Angelou left the university's Lied Center for Performing Arts in
a wheelchair Thursday night after speaking to 2,400 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was extremely exhausted and needed the wheelchair to get
around,'' said Karen Wills, an organizer of Angelou's appearance.
She said Angelou had left Friday afternoon by airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Angelou suffered a case of pneumonia last year.
</P>

   During her speech Thursday, Angelou told students that they are
not in college to get a degree, marry and buy a three-bedroom house
with a two-car garage. Instead, she said, they are learning to
compose ''this world you find yourself in.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelou, author of the 1970 autobiographical ''I Know Why the
Cage Bird Sings,'' advised people to look to poetry for
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is imperative that you have it to tenderize your life,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of Angelou's speech touched on racial issues. She told
the mostly white audience that blacks arrived on the American
continent in 1619, one year before the Mayflower arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ''And still the last hired and the first fired. ... The question
is how have they composed lives which were friendly to them,''
Angelou said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all was serious, though. After reciting a poem, she let out
a big ''Woo!'' and laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never trust people who don't laugh,'' she said. ''There's an
African saying: Be careful when a naked person offers you a
shirt.''

<HEADLINE> Judge rules evidence was improper in detective's drug case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) - Police improperly seized pharmacy
records in the case of a Hartford police detective accused of using
fake prescriptions, a judge ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Russo should have had a reasonable expectation of
privacy about his prescription records, Superior Court Judge Stuart
Schimelman found.
</P>
<P>
   Russo's defense argued the pharmacy records were obtained
improperly, without search warrants or subpoenas. Russo was charged
with fraudulently obtaining controlled substances and forgery.
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling, State's Attorney Kevin Kane moved to dismiss
the charges but got permission from the judge to bring the case
before the state Appellate Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on that decision, the state had insufficient evidence to
go forward,'' Kane said in an interview after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Kane has 20 days to decide whether to appeal. If the Appellate
Court sides with Schimelman, the charges against Russo will be
dismissed. If the court decides Schimelman erred, the criminal case
against Russo may continue.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors wanted to use the records to show that Russo used
fake prescriptions to obtain between 15,000 and 18,000 tablets of
Tylenol 3 with codeine from four pharmacies between January 1996
and October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Russo has been suspended from the police force. He has filed a
federal civil lawsuit against the city and Hartford police leaders,
accusing them of violating his civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims their actions were part of a pattern of
harassment by the Hartford department. Russo said he was singled
out because he had worked with federal agents who identified the
correct suspect in a shooting after Hartford police arrested the
wrong man.

<HEADLINE> Suffolk Executive releases his 2001 budget plan  </HEADLINE>
By PAT MILTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. (AP) - Suffolk County Executive Robert Gaffney
on Friday released his $1.98 billion budget proposal for 2001,
which calls for a tax increase of about $82 a year for residents of
Suffolk's five western towns.
</P>
<P>
   Households in Suffolk's eastern towns which do not come under
the county police department would have a tax hike of about three
dollars a year under the new budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is ever pleased at the prospect of raising taxes, even
slightly,'' Gaffney said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the tax hike was due largely to a $35 million increase
in the police district taxes as a result of a binding arbitration
decision. Rising medicaid and health insurance costs were also
factors in the tax increase, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tax bill for residents in the five western towns,
Huntington, Babylon, Smithtown, Islip and Brookhaven, would
increase by an average of $6.89 a month, or just over $82 a year.
Residents in the eastern towns of East Hampton, Southampton,
Shelter Island, Southold and Riverhead would pay around three
dollars a year more.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.98 billion budget is 6.6 percent increase over last year.
It will be sent to the Suffolk County Legislature, which will hold
public hearings on the budget plan and make its recommendations. A
budget must be approved by Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Gaffney said Suffolk County is in excellent economic health. He
projected a $77 million surplus this year, and noted that Standard
and Poors upgraded the county's bond rating from BBB+ to A as of
last May.
</P>
<P>
   ''Suffolk County continues to benefit from both a strong economy
and a dynamic and diversified economic base,'' said Gaffney. ''It
has been a period of unparalleled economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Nassau County, county officials are trying to ward
off the takeover by a state financial control board. County
Executive Thomas Gulotta and his staff were putting the last
touches on a proposed budget for 2001 and a financial plan for each
of the next four years to reduce the county's deficit. The budget
plans had to be presented to the county legislature and the Nassau
Interim Finance Authority by Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gulotta has released portions of his plan to close the county's
$143 million budget gap, which include layoffs of 350 workers,
early retirement and attrition of another 300 jobs, a property tax
increase, and a tax on entertainment tickets sold at the Nassau
County Veterans Memorial Coliseum and Westbury Music Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Gulotta's plan has been met with pessimism by some members of
the county legislature who question whether his steps for reducing
the deficit will be sufficient to convince state NIFA officials
that the county can get back on a strong financial footing without
a fiscal takeover.

<HEADLINE> Lazio misspeaks on voting age during visit to elementary school  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) - U.S. Senate candidate Rick Lazio was so
overwhelmed by the enthusiastic greeting he received Friday at the
Pulaski Street Elementary School that he told the students he
wished they were old enough to vote - only he got the voting age
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''Boy, I wish all of you were 21 years old right now,'' the
Republican congressman said after being welcomed into a school
auditorium by shrieks of approval and applause usually reserved for
the likes of The Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   The error was quickly seized upon by the state's Democratic
organization, which fired off a press release suggesting Lazio was
proposing to repeal the 26th amendment, which gave the right to
vote to 18-year-olds in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ''According to the latest census data, there are 731,898 New
Yorkers aged 18-20. Apparently Rick Lazio is not interested in
getting their vote,'' said Peter Kauffmann, spokesman for the New
York State Democratic Party. ''I'd like to invite all New Yorkers
aged 18-20 to register and vote - there is room for you in the
Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spokesman Michael Marr declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> More Federal Land To Be Cleared  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration wants to clear
brush and trees on another 455,000 acres of federal lands next
year, a 33 percent increase over what agencies planned before this
summer's brutal wildfires, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 1.8 million acres -- an area larger than the state of
Delaware -- would be thinned through logging and prescribed burns to
reduce the threat of fires.
</P>
<P>
   The thinning effort, mostly targeted near fast-growing
communities such as Billings, Mont., and Flagstaff, Ariz., doubles
what the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management logged and
burned five years ago to prevent fires.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies ''are committed to minimizing the losses from future,
unnaturally intense fires,'' said Jim Lyons, an Agriculture
Department undersecretary.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials said most of the clearing will involve
small-diameter trees, not commercially valuable large timber.
</P>
<P>
   The acreage figures, provided in testimony before a Senate
subcommittee Friday, were some of the first details of how
President Clinton plans to carry out a plan that would spend an
additional $1.6 billion for firefighting and fire prevention next
year. Clinton announced the proposal last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials said Friday they also want to help thin 315,000
acres on private, state and tribal lands, and clean watersheds,
stabilize soils and replant vegetation on about 750,000 acres
charred by fires this year.
</P>
<P>
   The officials likened the effort to a 1930s-style public works
project that would create about 8,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Frank
Murkowski, R-Alaska, called the budget request for thinning forests
''totally inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said another Clinton initiative -- a
proposed rule to ban road building on 43 million acres of roadless
forests -- would increase the fire risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're turning your back and walking away from living things
that Mother Nature will burn down,'' he said after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 6.7 million acres have burned this year, one of the worst
fire seasons in 50 years. Craig cited Forest Service figures
showing two-thirds of agency lands that burned in the West were
wilderness and roadless areas.
</P>
<P>
   But Lyons said the remote areas burned because agency officials
focused firefighting on more populated areas with roads.
</P>
<P>
   ''The roadless policy is not interfering with our capacity to
fight fires,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Thoughts from 2 miles up: A reporter's first dive  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOVE WILLIAMSTOWN, N.J. (AP) - I wasn't scared until we were at
the open plane door - looking 13,000 feet down. But then it was too
late to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   I had seen what happened to the other people who had just left
the plane. They got snapped away and started falling - fast.
</P>
<P>
   But when my skydiving instructor stepped out, I didn't have any
choice but to go with him, we were harnessed together.
</P>
<P>
   We shot down and were ripped away from the plane. Too scared to
speak, or do anything else, I just watched the clouds zoom by.
</P>
<P>
   For 60 long seconds, instructor Mark Kruse and I fell together,
the wind snapping in our ears. The air, surprisingly cold for a hot
September day, rushed past.
</P>
<P>
   A skydiver with a video camera attached to his head dove with us
to capture my first dive. At one point, he grabbed my hand in a
handshake and spun me around in a gut-wrenching circle. Things seem
to happen faster up here.
</P>
<P>
   I repeated to myself what Kruse had told me before we got on the
plane, ''Just arch your back, breathe and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Skeffington, manager of Freefall Adventures, had given me
about 20 minutes of instruction on the ground on how to position my
arms and how to land, but he and Kruse acknowledged that most
people forget all that when they get up in the air. ''Arch, breathe
and relax,'' I could handle.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing I had to remember - this one rather crucial -
was when to pull the ripcord. Kruse, of course, had his own cord,
but students are supposed to get the feel of pulling their own.
</P>
<P>
   When we reached 5,000 feet, I was to pull the orange handle at
my hip and release the parachute. I checked the altimeter strapped
to my wrist several times, surprised that we weren't there yet.
While I was enjoying the amazing ride, I knew I'd relax a little
once the chute opened.
</P>
<P>
   At just before 5,000 feet, Kruse gave me the OK and I pulled the
cord. The red, white and blue parachute opened with a snap, yanked
us up with surprising force, then settled us into a smooth float.
</P>
<P>
   Kruse gave me a thumbs up, I took a deep breath and enjoyed the
ride - calm, peaceful and beautiful. For five minutes, homes,
trees, baseball fields and golf courses drifted by. Philadelphia,
about 20 miles away, looked like a small town in the distance, and
clouds hugged the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting it to be over and at the same time not wanting it to
end, I reminded myself that this is probably the only time I'll
ever do this. So I tried to soak it all up - the graceful, floating
feeling, the beauty, the serenity.
</P>
<P>
   When we reached 1,000 feet, Kruse let me help steer the rig
toward the landing zone - a gravel 'X' in the middle of a field. We
angled in toward the ground and landed smoothly, but still a
surprising jolt ran up my legs.
</P>
<P>
   Relieved and excited, I felt like I'd accomplished something,
even though all I did was hang on for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after landing my stomach is still queasy and my legs are
shaking. I'm afraid to eat anything because I can't be sure it'll
stay where it's supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, nothing is the same. The sky seems bluer, the
clouds brighter white, the day happier. It's not just relief that
nothing went wrong. It's an intangible - the joy of having taken
that first step out and the peace of being in one piece 13,000 feet
later.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New AIDS Drug Kaletra  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Patients with the AIDS virus are about to get
a new option that may help those who have failed standard therapy:
a drug called Kaletra.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration approved Kaletra late Friday,
for use by both adults as well as HIV-infected infants and children
who are older than 6 months of age.
</P>
<P>
   Kaletra is one of a class of AIDS drugs called protease
inhibitors. But early evidence suggests it may work a little
differently than its competitors -- allowing higher HIV-fighting
levels of drug to circulate in the blood system than other
medicines do.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is all still a little theoretical,'' cautioned Dr. Heidi
Jolson, the FDA's AIDS chief.
</P>
<P>
   But in studies of patients who had failed other protease
inhibitor treatment, enough saw their HIV levels dramatically drop
-- presumably because of this effect -- to persuade the FDA to
speedily approve Kaletra's sale.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists with manufacturer Abbott Laboratories said in one
study about 70 percent of such protease-failed patients improved on
Kaletra, although Jolson cautioned that those patients also took
another relatively new pill, so it's unclear if Kaletra should get
all the credit.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott said the prescription-only medicine -- available in
capsules or liquid taken twice a day as part of a cocktail of
standard AIDS drugs -- should be on pharmacy shelves around the end
of next week. The company did not reveal the price.
</P>
<P>
   Kaletra is a combination of a new chemical called lopinavir plus
a small dose of Abbott's older AIDS drug Norvir. The company mixed
the two because together they produce what co-inventor Dale Kempf
calls a great drug reaction: The Norvir increases blood levels of
lopinavir. Abbott calls that Kaletra's key, contending the drug can
get to higher levels in the body than other protease inhibitors
without causing more side effects than a standard dose would.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaletra does cause side effects, Jolson stressed. It comes
with a long list of drugs that physicians cannot prescribe together
with Kaletra because the interactions are dangerous, she said. She
urged doctors to carefully check that list, which includes certain
heart drugs and sedatives.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 percent of Kaletra users had significant rises in
cholesterol and triglyceride levels, she said. About 1 percent
suffered pancreatitis. Other side effects were typical for AIDS
drugs, including diarrhea, fatigue and nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Parents got a special warning: Keep the bottle out of reach of
children, because liquid Kaletra contains enough alcohol to be
dangerous if a child overdoses.

<HEADLINE> Senate Votes To Honor Slaves  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate completed congressional action
Friday on an effort to honor slaves whose forced labor helped build
the U.S. Capitol, the seat of American democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved by voice vote a measure to authorize the
speaker of the House and the president pro tem of the Senate to set
up a special task force to study the history and contributions of
slave laborers toward building the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The task force then is to recommend a memorial to be displayed
on the Capitol grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed its version Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''These men, these slaves, laid the very foundation of our
democracy,'' said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill was sponsored by Sens. Spence Abraham, R-Mich.,
and Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional historians say slaves did much of the 18th- and
19th-century work constructing the building.
</P>
<P>
   Slaves were the largest locally available labor pool in 1790
when Congress ordered a new capital to be carved out of two
slave-owning states, Virginia and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   When the three commissioners in charge of construction began
building in 1792, they hired field hands from local small farmers
and planters. Local slaves were available to be rented from their
owners cheaply, an average of $55 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Many white laborers worked under similar conditions as the
slaves, but their employment was voluntary, and they could keep the
money they earned.
</P>
<P>
   Local historian Bob Arnebeck, in his 1991 book, ''Through a
Fiery Trial, Building Washington, 1790-1800,'' wrote that as work
began, slaves served as axmen, cutting trees on Jenkins Hill on
which the new Capitol would stand.
</P>
<P>
   Some helped square logs needed for construction. Others cleared
trees and stumps from the new streets laid out by city planner
Pierre L'Enfant.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dep't Sues Over Tomatoes  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department filed a civil antitrust
suit Friday that it said was designed to offer consumers a better
choice of vine-ripened tomatoes in winter.
</P>
<P>
   The department's antitrust division sued in U.S. District Court
in Tucson, Ariz., to overturn a private agreement that it said
reduced competition in the development of seeds for long-shelf-life
tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Long-shelf-life tomatoes, now generally grown in Mexico, can
ripen on the vine and be shipped year-round to distant locales for
sale before spoiling. Now, a majority of the fresh tomatoes sold in
stores in the United States during winter are picked in southern
climates while still green and then gassed until they redden.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. consumers spend $4 billion a year on fresh tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed against LSL Biotechnologies Inc., Seminis
Vegetable Seeds Inc., and their joint venture, LSL Plant Science.
It seeks to void an agreement that prohibits a competitor, Hazera
Quality Seeds Inc. from developing and selling seeds for
long-shelf-life tomatoes in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The department said LSL and Hazera entered a contract to develop
seeds for such tomatoes. The contract has expired except for a
provision that bars Hazera from developing the seeds that allow
farmers to get vine-ripened tomatoes long distances to market in
winter before they spoil.
</P>
<P>
   ''Competition to innovate spurs companies to offer consumers
more choices and higher quality products at better prices,'' said
Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein. ''This agreement deprives
American farmers and consumers of the full benefits of that
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   LSL Biotechnologies' attorney was not immediately available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   LSL and Seminis are the dominant sellers of seeds used to grow
fresh tomatoes in North America during winter. The government said
Hazera, one of the largest producers of seeds in Europe and the
Middle East, is one of only a few companies with the interest and
expertise to develop and market new long-shelf-life tomato seeds to
American farmers in competition with the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   LSL Biotechnologies and LSL Plant Science are headquartered in
Tucson, Ariz. Seminis is the largest developer, producer, and
marketer of vegetable seeds in the world. It is headquartered in
Saticoy, Calif., and is a majority-owned subsidiary of Savia, a
Mexico-based conglomerate.

<HEADLINE> Ford to reopen truck plants shutdown for tire recall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) - Ford Motor Co. said Friday it would reopen three
truck factories that had been closed three weeks so tires meant for
new vehicles could be used as replacements in the recall of 6.5
million Firestones.
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown of plants in St. Paul, Minn., Edison, N.J. and
Hazelwood, Mo., diverted about 100,000 tires to the recall, Ford
spokeswoman Della DiPietro said. She said Ford decided to reopen
the plants because the tire industry was producing 50,000 more
P235/75R15-size tires each week than when the shutdown began.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said Thursday about 2 million of the 6.5 million recalled
tires had been replaced. The Firestone tires under recall have been
linked to at least 88 deaths and 250 injuries by federal
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   During the shutdown, Ford lost production of 15,000 Ford
Explorers/Mercury Mountaineers and 23,500 Ford Ranger pickups, not
all of which would have used the 15-inch tires under recall. Some
tires also came from Ford switching some production from 15-inch to
16-inch tires.
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro said Ford would make up the lost Ranger production, but
would not make up the Explorer/Mountaineer production. The shutdown
will not delay the launch of the 2002 Explorer/Mountaineers early
next year, but will push back some retooling.
</P>
<P>
   The plants employ about 6,000 workers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Reveal Nursing Home Plan  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's weekly radio address will
be broadcast live Saturday from a 200-bed nursing home in northwest
Washington where he will announce a new initiative to improve care
at the tens of thousands of nursing homes nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The White House on Friday did not release details of the
president's proposal Friday, but it comes just weeks after a
federal report revealed that some nursing homes are so understaffed
that they may be endangering the welfare of their patients.
</P>
<P>
   The report issued in late July by the Health Care Financing
Administration said that at more than half -- 54 percent -- of the
nursing homes surveyed nursing aides spent less than two hours a
day with patients. The study examined 1,786 nursing homes in three
states.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Special
Committee on Aging, said Friday that Clinton is expected to discuss
nursing home staffing shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm interested in the substance of the president's remarks,''
Grassley said. ''If he presents a staffing proposal and later
approaches me with it, I'll take a careful look at it. We might
share goals and priorities for improving the number of trained
staff who care for nursing home residents.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, Grassley convened a hearing to release the long-awaited
study, mandated by Congress back in 1990, that linked staff
shortages to severe bedsores, malnutrition and dehydration. The
study, mandated back in 1990, was originally due in January 1992.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.6 million elderly and disabled Americans receive care in
approximately 16,500 nursing homes across the United States.
Medicaid pays for the majority of nursing home patients.
Sixty-eight percent of the patients at the Washington Home where
Clinton will visit receive Medicaid benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said Congress is considering a proposal that would give
nursing homes some extra money, but has said that based on the
report, he's not willing to ''give the nursing home industry a
blank check.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Abrams, chief operating officer at the American Health Care
Association, which represents 12,000 long-term care providers, said
he hopes Clinton proposes training and staffing grants to help
attract new workers to the industry. His organization has set a
goal of bringing 250,000 new certified nursing assistants and
another 60,000 licensed practical nurses and registered nurses to
the industry by January 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''These jobs (for assistants) are taxing physically and given
the choice, the typical person will chose the retail establishment
-- the food service job or Wal-Mart -- over the long-care facility,''
Abrams said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Attends Afghanistan Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi attended a closed-door
meeting Friday on Afghanistan, an encounter which U.S. officials
hope will be an ''ice breaker'' in U.S.-Iranian relations.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Iran are members of an eight-country group
that has been working to end the long civil war in the central
Asian nation and advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Kharrazi arrived first, and Albright followed. Neither spoke to
reporters. In the conference room, they sat down on opposite sides
of a horseshoe-shaped table. The doors then shut.
</P>
<P>
   The ministerial session of the group on Afghanistan was held on
the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly debate and was
attended by Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said Albright was interested in talking
with Kharrazi and had for some time been hoping to establish a
high-level contact. The United States broke diplomatic relations
with Iran after the 1979 hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   An Iranian spokesman, Hossein Nosrat, declined to say whether
Kharrazi planned to talk with Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, hopes were raised that Albright and Kharrazi
would meet at a similar meeting of the ''Six-Plus-Two'' group on
Afghanistan. But at the last minute, Kharrazi didn't show up,
sending a deputy in his place.
</P>
<P>
   While Albright and the deputy, Mohammad Javad Zarif, didn't
shake hands or even sit next to each other, it was at that time the
highest-level diplomatic contact between the two governments since
radical followers of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini seized
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 Americans hostage.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the General Assembly on Friday, Kharrazi called
for international efforts to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a globalized world, nothing can justify harboring or
providing safe havens to terrorists or condoning their
activities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States accuses Iran of sponsoring terrorism but has
been seeking to improve relations with Iran since the 1997 election
of President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric who has pushed
democratic reforms in the face of hard-line opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the United States lifted a ban on U.S.
imports of Iranian luxury goods and called for a ''new
relationship'' with the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Khatami said in New York last week that ''serious issues''
must be resolved between the two countries before there can be
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   During the U.N. Millennium Summit last week, President Clinton
attended Khatami's speech. Albright was also in the audience when
Khatami addressed a conference on the importance of forging a
''dialogue among civilizations.''
</P>
<P>
   A week before the summit, four U.S. lawmakers, including Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., met with the speaker of Iran's parliament,
Mehdi Karrubi, at a cocktail reception in New York, the first such
meeting of U.S. and Iranian lawmakers since the Islamic revolution
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Friday, Kharrazi said Iran backed a broad-based
and representative government for Afghanistan, which is largely
controlled by the Taliban Islamic militia.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, who are mostly Sunni Muslims, accuse Iran, an
overwhelmingly Shiite Muslim nation, as well as Russia and other
central Asian states of aiding their northern-based enemies.

<HEADLINE> Panel Addresses Welfare Reform  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The highly praised reductions in the nation's
welfare rolls might have occurred as much because of the nation's
booming economy as the 1996 welfare law, panelists at a
Congressional Black Caucus hearing said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is premature to call welfare reform a success,'' said
William Julius Wilson, a social policy professor at Harvard
University. ''We have no idea what will happen to these families
when the economy returns to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton celebrated the success of the 1996 welfare
reform law last month on its fourth anniversary. Welfare rolls are
half what they were four years ago, he said, and the percentage of
Americans on welfare is at its lowest level in 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's panel on the success of welfare reform law, chaired by
Rep. Danny Davis, R-Ill., as part of the caucus' annual legislative
conference, said the real test of the law will come when the
economy stabilizes or drops. ''Many of the conclusions that have
been reached are premature,'' said Ron Walters, a professor of the
University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's Wilson said poor single mothers fare the worst under
the new law. And, he said, ''If they're struggling now, what will
happen to these women when the economy slows down or returns to
normal?''
</P>
<P>
   Congress probably will return to the law next year. When it
does, one expected suggestion is that Congress give more help to
workers in transportation and child care.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 welfare law encouraged recipients to enter the work
force by limiting the time they can collect benefits and requiring
them to work while drawing welfare. It also offered incentives to
employers to hire welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Too many people leaving welfare who want to work have no way to
get from their homes to where the jobs are, said Gary Jefferson,
vice president of United Airlines. ''Unless you solve the problem
of transportation, there's no point in wondering where the
welfare-to-work program goes from here,'' Jefferson said.
</P>
<P>
   There's also discrimination against minorities who have been
unable to get off welfare, panelists said, and a perception remains
among businesspeople that people on welfare don't want to work.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they perceive those people are ... people who aren't going
to help their businesses, they won't hire them,'' said Rodney
Carroll, chief operating officer of the Welfare To Work Project.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will speak to the caucus Saturday night. ''I think the
president will use this opportunity to talk about all that we've
accomplished over the last 7&AMP;frac12; years with his allies within the
(caucus),'' spokesman Joe Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> Poet Maya Angelou Falls Ill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Poet Maya Angelou went to a hospital
emergency room Friday morning, hours after she left an appearance
at the University of Nebraska in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old Angelou was not admitted to BryanLGH Medical
Center West, an employee said. She did cancel an appearance Friday
in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   Angelou left the university's Lied Center for Performing Arts in
a wheelchair Thursday night after speaking to 2,400 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was extremely exhausted and needed the wheelchair to get
around,'' said Karen Wills, an organizer of Angelou's appearance.
She said Angelou had left Friday afternoon by airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Angelou suffered a case of pneumonia last year.
</P>
<P>
   During her speech Thursday, Angelou told students that they are
not in college to get a degree, marry and buy a three-bedroom house
with a two-car garage. Instead, she said, they are learning to
compose ''this world you find yourself in.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelou, author of the 1970 autobiographical ''I Know Why the
Caged Bird Sings,'' advised people to look to poetry for
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is imperative that you have it to tenderize your life,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of Angelou's speech touched on racial issues. She told
the mostly white audience that blacks arrived on the American
continent in 1619, one year before the Mayflower arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ''And still the last hired and the first fired. ... The question
is how have they composed lives which were friendly to them,''
Angelou said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all was serious, though. After reciting a poem, she let out
a big ''Woo!'' and laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never trust people who don't laugh,'' she said. ''There's an
African saying: Be careful when a naked person offers you a
shirt.''

<HEADLINE> Army To Release Kosovo Report  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army is preparing to publicly release an
investigative report saying several members of the 82nd Airborne
Division on peacekeeping duty in Kosovo beat, threatened and
assaulted civilians, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The formerly classified report also raises questions about the
kinds of training these men received in preparation for
peacekeeping duty, the officials said. They discussed the matter on
condition they not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The central conclusions of the investigative report were
publicly disclosed during the trial in Germany of Staff Sgt. Frank
Ronghi, who was sentenced in August to life in prison with no
chance for parole for the murder, sodomy and rape of an 11-year-old
Kosovo Albanian girl.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News reported Friday that it obtained a copy of the
investigative report.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensational conclusion of the report -- that several
members of Ronghi's platoon in the 504th Parachute Infantry
Regiment beat, threatened and illegally detained civilians in
Kosovo -- was publicly disclosed by government attorneys in the
Ronghi trial. These acts were accepted as fact by both the
prosecution and the defense, but the report itself was not made
public because it contained classified information.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has removed the classified material and will release a
redacted copy of the report Monday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The men accused of the misbehavior were punished -- though not
jailed -- earlier this year. They are based at Fort Bragg, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Among the actions they were accused of: an American lieutenant
and a noncommissioned officer, along with Ronghi, took two Albanian
brothers to an abandoned warehouse and punched them in the stomach.
The lieutenant held a gun to the back of one of the brother's head
and asked him if he wanted to die.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Could Save Caribbean Murders  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW J. ROSENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- A ruling by Britain's Privy Council
that could save hundreds of convicted murderers from execution on
Caribbean islands has prompted some politicians to reconsider ties
to British law.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether or not the death penalty should continue is not for
others to determine,'' said Jamaica's Prime Minister P. J.
Patterson, who is among several Caribbean leaders eager to resume
hangings amid rising crime, much related to drug-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said the ruling was ''another compelling reason'' to
create a Caribbean court to replace the Privy Council, which is
drawn from members of Britain's House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke Wednesday night, the day after the council commuted the
death sentences of six Jamaicans to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-1 ruling does not stop Caribbean governments from
executing convicted murderers, but experts say it places new, and
possibly insurmountable, obstacles in their way. And at least one
human rights activist cautiously claimed victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''This affects every death row prisoner in every country under
the jurisdiction of the Privy Council,'' said Jamaican human rights
attorney Hilaire Sobers. ''The cases of those who already had been
condemned will now have to be revisited.''
</P>
<P>
   The council -- the final court of appeal for nine independent
former colonies in the Caribbean and five British territories --
ruled that inmates should be allowed lawyers when appealing before
Jamaica's Privy Council, which advises on mercy pleas, and said
that should apply throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Privy Council also objected to a Jamaican law allowing
death-row prisoners only six months to have appeals heard by
international human rights commissions. And it reaffirmed an
earlier decision mandating that no more than five years can elapse
between sentencing and execution, judging any further delay cruel
and inhumane punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Those favoring hanging said the ruling will provide the needed
impetus for the region to establish its own appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ruling marks the beginning of the end of executions in
Trinidad and Tobago and indeed the Caribbean,'' said Israel Kahn, a
pro-death penalty attorney in Trinidad, which last year resumed
executions after a five-year hiatus, hanging 10 people including an
alleged drug lord and eight gang members.
</P>
<P>
   In Jamaica, a country of 2.6 million people, no executions have
taken place since 1988. But public pressure to resume hangings is
increasing.
</P>
<P>
   The urgency that pro-death penalty politicians and activists
have placed on establishing the regional court has led human rights
activists to dub the new body ''the hanging court.''
</P>
<P>
   But Patterson claimed the issue was about national sovereignty,
not just executions.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International said Trinidad is using sovereignty to
defend human rights violations, including executions.
</P>
<P>
   English-speaking Caribbean nations, with a population of 5
million, have about 250 people on death row -- more than 100 in
Trinidad alone -- one of the highest death sentence rates in the
world, Amnesty International has said.

<HEADLINE> Peru Spy Chief In Another Scandal  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- A storm of protests grew Friday demanding the
resignation of President Alberto Fujimori's feared intelligence
chief, hours after the release of a video purportedly showing him
bribing an opposition congressman.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition leader who released the video called for the
arrest of spymaster Vladimiro Montesinos and for Fujimori's
resignation. Montesinos runs a spy network as the de facto head of
the national intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're waiting for Vladimiro Montesinos to be captured and for
a transition government that will call new general elections,''
Congressman Fernando Olivera said a day after releasing the video.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-minute video, which had poor sound quality, showed
congressman Alberto Kouri signing a document that apparently
formalized his resignation from the opposition. Montesinos then
handed Kouri what seemed to be a thick wad of bills.
</P>
<P>
   The video plunged Peru into a fresh political scandal at a time
that Fujimori has been working intensely to undo damage to his
image abroad set off by charges of widespread fraud in his election
to an unprecedented third term in May.
</P>
<P>
   Its release cast a long shadow over promises by Fujimori to
strengthen Peru's damaged democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Other opposition leaders added their voices to Olivera's call
for an investigation into what has been dubbed in the press as the
''video of shame.'' Lima Mayor Alberto Andrade, who saw his
presidential hopes destroyed by a government-financed smear
campaign, demanded that Montesinos ''resign immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a national embarrassment,'' said retired army general
Daniel Mora. ''As a retired member of the armed forces, I would
like to see them withdraw their support for this government.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador John Hamilton also pressed for a ''rapid,
complete and transparent investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In light of yesterday's events we urge the Peruvian government
to take clear and energetic measures to re-establish public trust
in the intelligence services while the investigation is
conducted,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, regarded by many Peruvians as having even greater
power than Fujimori, has survived denunciations in the past,
including charges that he took bribes from a drug lord and was
behind the smear campaigns against Fujimori's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Blanca Colan said Montesinos had asked her
office to investigate the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the past he has requested investigations when he was
accused of wrongdoing and the attorney general's office has
determined each time that there was insufficient evidence to bring
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Olivera and other members of his Independent Moralizing Front,
including Fujimori's former wife, Susana Higuchi, showed the video
late Thursday at a news conference. Olivera's party is the
second-largest opposition group in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Olivera has not said how he got hold of the video, specifying
only that he obtained it from ''patriots who put their lives at
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Fujimori's political alliance won only 52 seats in the
120-member Congress in May, a dozen opposition congressmen quickly
joined the government's ranks, giving Fujimori majority control.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Toledo, who pulled out of the May presidential runoff
after charging Fujimori planned to rig the results, later accused
the government of offering congressmen elected on his ticket
$50,000 and upwards to join Fujimori's alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo accused Kouri specifically of having received $160,000
and Kouri sued Toledo for slander.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said Friday in Miami that Fujimori's alliance did not win
control of Congress ''but through some incredible magic that was
exposed last night, the official party now has the majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the broadcast, Kouri said the meeting with
Montesinos had been to discuss matters of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, he admitted having received $22,500 from
Montesinos -- but said it was a loan to buy a truck to distribute
food to the poor.

<HEADLINE> County drops prison contractor with link to corrupt officials  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KINGSTON, N.Y. (AP) - A construction firm that paid $10,000 to a
water commissioner later linked to government corruption has been
dropped as the contract for a new, $53 million jail.
</P>
<P>
   Ulster County decided Thursday not to sign a $2.5 million
contract with Barry, Bette and Led Duke, an Albany-based
construction company, because of the company's ties to Fred Andros.
</P>
<P>
   During the investigation of a Dutchess County extortion case, it
was discovered that BBL paid $10,000 to Andros, then-Poughkeepsie
water commissioner, in return for necessary permits.
</P>
<P>
   Andros was an associate of William Paroli Sr., the former
Dutchess County Republican chairman who admitted in February that
he conspired to extort payments from companies doing business in
the Town of Poughkeepsie.
</P>
<P>
   Paroli got 21 months in jail; Andros was sentenced to 33 months
for conspiracy and awaits trial on charges he murdered the town's
personnel director.
</P>
<P>
   BBL says it was a victim of extortion. It never faced any
charges.
</P>
<P>
   But the connection to Paroli and Andros was enough, county
officials said, insisting their decision was not a reflection on
BBL's ability.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our decision reflects only the desire of the county to have
this extremely important project proceed without the distractions
and questions that have arisen because of the firm's past
activities,'' said Ward Todd, majority leader of the county
legislature.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuits Claim Ritalin 'Conspiracy'  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The makers of Ritalin and the American
Psychiatric Association encouraged overdiagnosis of behavioral
disorders in children and used misleading sales literature to boost
sales of the drug, according to a pair of lawsuits filed this week.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis Phamaceutical Corp. and the association promoted the
belief that a large number of children need to take Ritalin for
attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder, the lawsuits filed in New Jersey and California allege.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis released a statement Friday calling the charges
''unfounded and preposterous'' and said attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder has been recognized by medical
experts worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The psychiatric association also denied the allegations, saying
they would be rebutted with ''a mountain of scientific evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 4 percent and 12 percent of school-age children -- about
3 million, mostly boys -- are believed to have attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The symptoms of short attention
span, impulsive behavior and difficulty sitting still are also
associated with youthful rambunctiousness, which has raised
questions of whether youngsters are being overmedicated.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional hearings recently examined whether Ritalin, a
brand name for the stimulant methylphenidate, is overprescribed for
the disorders. The American Academy of Pediatrics issued its first
guidelines this year for diagnosing the disorders, saying a child
must show symptoms in two settings for at least six months.
</P>
<P>
   A similar lawsuit against the East Hanover, N.J., company and
the association was filed earlier this year in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The latest suits were filed Wednesday in state Superior Court in
Hackensack and in San Diego federal court by some of the same
attorneys who filed huge lawsuits against gun makers and the
tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits, filed on behalf of children who took the drug in
New Jersey and California, say that Ciba-Geigy Corp. began a
conspiracy to boost the Ritalin market in the mid-1950s. Ciba-Geigy
produced Ritalin before merging with Novartis in 1996
</P>
<P>
   Novartis and Ciba-Geigy worked with the psychiatric association
to include the diagnosis of the two disorders and list it in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1980,
creating a huge market for the drug, the lawsuits say.
</P>
<P>
   The companies released misleading sales literature about
Ritalin's effectiveness, ''without ever advising ... that Ritalin
usage would not stimulate or improve academic performance and/or
have any long-term effect on the symptoms associated with ADD or
and/or ADHD,'' the California lawsuit says.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits also say the drug's makers gave $748,000 to the
California advocacy group Children and Adults with
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder between 1991 and 1994 to
help promote Ritalin sales.

<HEADLINE> Corrections chief challenges criticism to sex offender system  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A day after a Senate investigator said no
working system alerts prosecutors when sex offenders are released
from prison, the top corrections officer claimed his department
does just that in nearly every case.
</P>
<P>
   New computer systems are being tested and revamped review
procedures are in place, all to insure prosecutors have enough time
to begin Megan's Law notifications, Corrections Commissioner Jack
Terhune said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Since a convicted rapist was mistakenly released in March, no
sex offender ordered confined to a state hospital after serving a
sentence has been freed, Terhune said.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections officials meet state laws requiring notice in the
majority of other cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe we are close to 100 percent compliant,'' Terhune
said.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Alves was freed in March after serving less than half of
a 47-year sentence for the rape of a teen in Fair Lawn and the
assault of a Clifton teen. Prosecutors in Bergen and Passaic
counties said they would have tried to block the release had they
been alerted, as state law requires.
</P>
<P>
   Once freed, Alves took off on a 12-day cross-country bus trip
before being arrested and charged with violating sections of
Megan's Law. Sex offender notification rules require convicts to
provide a valid address and to register with local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March, Terhune admitted
his department made mistakes before releasing Alves. At the time,
he promised changes.
</P>
<P>
   The committee then hired former U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff
to investigate the department's procedures.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing Thursday, Chertoff told the panel county
prosecutors often reported they were not notified as required by
law. In many cases, sex offenders were on the street before
prosecutors were told and police had time to verify addresses.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires notification 90 days before a scheduled
release.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are well on the way to fixing it,'' Terhune said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the Corrections Department and the state
Parole Board are sharing detailed information on when inmates are
scheduled for possible release, Terhune said.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections administrators now begin reviewing an inmate's
records six months before a possible release. Since April, inmates
who will qualify for Megan's Law when released are tracked once
they begin serving a sentence, Terhune said.
</P>
<P>
   All prisons are now using the same forms and procedure, Terhune
said.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the process are inmates who are ordered released by
the courts before scheduled parole eligibility dates, Terhune said.
The notification process is also hampered by an inability to
accurately fix a release date, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates are granted various credits, all of which are flexible
and change the ultimate release date. That release date is the time
when corrections officials plan to begin a review of a sex
offender, Terhune said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that review begins and the release date is moved up
several months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Terhune could not offer any specific number of inmates that fall
into such categories.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also would not comment specifically on the
numbers offered by Chertoff of inmates who were released before the
90-day notice.
</P>
<P>
   ''The numbers don't mean much until you look at the names,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His department has responded to questions from Chertoff and that
internal review is now being examined by the attorney general's
office, Terhune said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Desperate For Mideast Deal  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Clinton administration, in a desperate
stretch run for a Mideast peace accord, is looking to Arab leaders
to ease Yasser Arafat into a compromise over the Holy City of
Jerusalem. The strategy appears not to be succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah has publicly ruled out
compromise. ''There is nothing to negotiate about and compromise on
when it comes to Jerusalem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was having dinner Friday
night with Abdullah as U.S. diplomatic efforts to mediate peace
terms with Israel and the Palestinians appeared at a crossroad.
</P>
<P>
   In his standoff with Israel on the future of Jerusalem, Arafat
carries the flag not only for the Palestinians but for the Arabs at
large. Their objections to Israel's 33-year control of all of
Jerusalem have not been appeased by the freedom all faiths have had
to worship.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat casts his demand for Palestinian sovereignty over East
Jerusalem in terms of a Muslim liberation movement. In this vein,
he has rejected proposals by President Clinton and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak that would give the Arabs control of sacred
mosques but deny sovereignty over East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, preparing for the stretch run, Albright sent Edward
Walker, a U.S. diplomat with wide experience in the Middle East, on
a long trip to Arab capitals.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to convince Arab leaders that the Jerusalem problem can
be resolved only by compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Several governments made statements indicating they have no
intention of coaxing Arafat into compromise, but U.S. officials
said their private message was that settlement had to take into
account the needs of both Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Now Saudi Arabia, which along with Egypt are the pivotal Arab
countries, has gone public in support of a tough Arafat position.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Thursday in New York to Arab-American and Muslim
leaders, Abdullah said: ''Jerusalem is important to the hearts of
all Muslims, and in fact it's in the heart of everybody with a
sense of humanity. This is something on which there can be no
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia usually counsels other Arabs privately. That
Abdullah spoke out so strongly in public gave special import to his
message.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, its negotiations with Israel stalled since January, also
publicly backed full Palestinian sovereignty over East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Only Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak apparently is reluctant to
offer wholehearted endorsement to Arafat's position.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has tried to enlist Egypt in a drive
for compromise. Otherwise, what opportunity is left for an accord
between Israel and the Palestinians could be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Muslim Iran's opposition to the peace process, Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi told British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook on Friday that Tehran wouldn't block a settlement,
according to British officials briefed on their meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In another effort to promote compromise on Friday, Martin Indyk,
the U.S. ambassador to Israel, urged Israel and the Palestinians to
share the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no other solution,'' Indyk said at Hebrew Union
College in Jerusalem, where he received an honorary degree. ''It is
not, and cannot, be the exclusive preserve of one religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Indyk, in his second term in the Tel Aviv post after heading the
State Department's Near East bureau, said, ''The solution cannot
come from one side challenging or denying another side's beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador's spokesman, Larry Schwartz, said Indyk was
simply restating U.S. policy that Jerusalem's final status needs to
negotiated by the parties.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton gave a cautious account of the state of play
in an exchange with reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should all wait and see,'' he said. ''Everybody is working
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said there was no reason for despair despite the absence
of breakthroughs in the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   While Albright and U.S. mediator Dennis Ross pressed the
negotiating effort with Israeli and Palestinian officials in New
York, a top Palestinian official, Nabil Shaath, called on Sandy
Berger, Clinton's assistant for security affairs, at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's doable, it's hard, it's difficult,'' he told reporters
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Shaath said, ''once we make some progress'' Clinton may
call another summit meeting, like the one held in July at Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   But in Ramallah, on the West Bank, Arafat was quoted as telling
the Palestinian Cabinet: ''Israel is not willing to be seriously
engaged in the negotiations and intends to waste more time.''

<HEADLINE> Albright: Kharrazi Meeting 'Useful'  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
Iran's foreign minister took a small step Friday toward long-sought
U.S. diplomatic contact with Tehran, attending an eight-nation
meeting to promote peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute meeting was believed to be the first time American
and Iranian officials on such a high level worked together on a
specific issue since the 1979 hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was a useful meeting,'' Albright said when asked
about the session's significance on U.S.-Iran relations. ''I think
when there are problems to be solved like this together, this is
encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she and Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi
were on opposite sides of the horseshoe-shaped table and didn't
have a one-on-one conversation during the 90 minute session.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she said she was pleased that Iran and the United
States took the same stand deploring Afghanistan's drug trafficking
and human rights record and its harboring of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very encouraged by the similarity of views that we all
had,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   In her speech to the seven other members of the Afghan group,
Albright said the United States was particularly concerned about
the impact on Iran of drug trafficking in Central Asia and called
for ''closer contact among ourselves'' to bring peace to
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Albright had lingered at the doorway at the end of the meeting,
looking inside the small conference room where Kharrazi remained,
but eventually walked out to a gaggle of reporters outside.
Kharrazi walked out behind Albright while she was at the
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   The United States accuses Iran of sponsoring terrorism but
nevertheless has been seeking to improve relations with Tehran
since the 1997 election of President Mohammad Khatami, a
reform-minded cleric. Earlier this year, the United States lifted a
ban on U.S. imports of Iranian luxury goods and called for a ''new
relationship'' with the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Khatami said in New York last week that ''serious issues''
must be resolved between the two countries before there can be
dialogue. Iran has called for U.S. sanctions to be lifted entirely
and for an end to support by some U.S. lawmakers for opposition
groups Tehran accuses of being terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the General Assembly on Friday, Kharrazi called
for international efforts to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's meeting was yet another attempt by the United States to
reach out to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   During the U.N. Millennium Summit last week, President Clinton
attended Khatami's speech. Albright was also in the audience when
Khatami addressed a conference on the sidelines of the summit on
the importance of forging a ''dialogue among civilizations.''
</P>
<P>
   A week before the summit, four U.S. lawmakers, including Sen.
Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, met with the speaker of
Iran's parliament, or Majlis, Mehdi Karrubi, during a cocktail
reception in New York, the first such meeting of U.S. and Iranian
lawmakers since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, hopes were raised that Albright and Kharrazi
would meet at a similar ministerial level meeting of an
eight-nation group on Afghanistan on the sidelines of the U.N.
General Assembly ministerial debate.
</P>
<P>
   But at the last minute, Kharrazi didn't show up, sending a
deputy in his place. At that time, it was highest-level diplomatic
contact between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Albright referred to that 1998 meeting when asked about the
significance of Friday's contact.
</P>
<P>
   In a final statement issued after the meeting, the ministers
expresed grave concern over the intensification of fighting in
Afghanistan and the serious humanitarian impact on the civilian
population. They called on the warring sides to work towards a
political solution.

<HEADLINE> Striking Teachers Back in Class  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Under orders by a judge, striking Buffalo
teachers returned to work without a contract Friday and promised to
stay there until a state mediator's proposal is released next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Teachers Federation's 3,700 teachers walked out for
two days last week and unexpectedly resumed the strike Thursday
morning, canceling classes for 47,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   The city opened emergency shelters for children and day-care
centers fielded desperate calls from parents. Francisco Rosario,
54, spent the afternoon at LaSalle Park helping watch his 15
grandchildren, 11 of whom normally would be in school.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh God, no school again,'' Rosario's wife, Bernarda, said when
hearing schools were closed.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court Justice Kevin Dillon sharply criticized Thursday's
sudden walkout and solidified a temporary order against the
walkout.
</P>
<P>
   School board President Paul Buchanan said the district's latest
offer Wednesday contained annual hikes of 2.5 to 3.5 percent for
the next three years. The teachers want slightly higher raises, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The increases would be on top of automatic 2 percent annual
raises, district officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The mediator's report is to be released Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Jumpers compete in parachuting contest for over-40s  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSTOWN, N.J. (AP) - Pat Moorehead logs skydives like other
people pile up frequent flier miles. At last count Friday, he'd
jumped out of planes 5,072 times.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old has been feeding his jumping addiction for 33
years. He and hundreds of other skydivers from around the country
are competing here this week in the national Parachutists over
Phorty Society (POPS) championships. The competition ends Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't quit skydiving because you get old, you get old
because you quit skydiving,'' Moorehead, of Long Beach, Calif.,
said, quoting a phrase seen on parachutists' T-shirts and bumper
stickers.
</P>
<P>
   The divers compete in several categories, including who can land
closest to a spot on the ground about as big as a golf ball, and
which teams of four, eight or ten can make the most formations
before landing.
</P>
<P>
   All day Friday, teams of divers practiced their freefall
maneuvers on the ground at the Freefall Adventures Skydiving
School, forming circles, stars and 'X' shapes by holding each other
by the arm or leg.
</P>
<P>
   Then they piled into small planes, flew to about 14,000 feet and
jumped out. Divers grabbed onto each other's legs and arms in the
predetermined manner, then switched to the next maneuver, trying to
form as many shapes as they could in 45 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   When they reached 4,500 feet, they separated and each opened
their parachute.
</P>
<P>
   Looking like little kites with GI Joes dangling from them, they
drifted past the clouds and came to their landings.
</P>
<P>
   Moorehead is president of a subgroup of POPS: Skydivers Over
Sixty, or SOS. The group has about 600 members in 17 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Moorehead, a great-grandfather, calls it ''exhilarating.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a T-shirt that says ''Remember when sex was safe and
skydiving was dangerous?'' Moorehead chats amiably with the other
divers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of camaraderie in this sport,'' he said. ''You
wind up diving with people you don't even know, and sometimes don't
even speak the same language, but it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if it makes him feel young, he answered, ''Well, I
never felt old yet, so I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   He met his wife, Alicia, on a skydiving trip 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd both sworn off marriage,'' he said, ''we didn't do well
at it. But we sat down on the plane next to each other and we've
been together ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Moorehead is past president of the World Parachutists
Over Phorty Society, which has 10,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason so many older skydivers stay with the sport is
technology, Alicia Moorehead said.
</P>
<P>
   No longer do divers use the old, round parachutes. Today they
use rectangular ones that offer much more control.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes it much more safe,'' she said. ''The round parachutes
pound you into the ground, they're not as maneuverable.''
</P>
<P>
   They also use altimeters that are strapped to their chests to
remind them when to pull the ripcord. And, just in case they
forget, or for some reason are unable to, a sensor in their
backpack will automatically open the parachute when the jumper
reaches a certain altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Technology also has allowed for ultra-lightweight fabrics to be
used in the parachutes. Even the divers' jumpsuits are computer
generated for different weights and sizes.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest skydiver at this competition is 76. Tom Morrison, of
Ambler, Pa., first dove in World War II. But this, he said, is much
more fun.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's enjoyable. We have an exquisite bunch of people in this
sport,'' said Morrison, who has made 8,950 jumps, including one
last year with George Bush to celebrate the former president's 75th
birthday. ''We all share the same unusual activity out here.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea when I'm going to stop.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lauds India for Restraint  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and India's prime minister,
celebrating a new era in U.S.-Indian relations, agreed on a broad
expansion of cooperative programs Friday but apparently fell short
of overcoming thorny differences on nuclear issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's inconceivable to me that we can build the kind of world
we want over the next 10 to 20 years unless there is a very strong
partnership between the United States and India,'' Clinton said
during a photo session in the Oval Office with Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Vajpayee joined Clinton at a welcoming ceremony on the
White House South Lawn and said: ''This is a time of new hope and
new opportunities in Indo-American ties.''
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements over nuclear issues remained, but as the day
unfolded a strong sense emerged of a new comfort level between the
former Cold War rivals and a perception that problems can be dealt
with in a trusting atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements were announced on enhancing cooperation on such
issues as trade, investment, counterterrorism, counterdrug issues,
energy and the environment, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The chief bilateral problem is India's refusal so far to sign
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which has yet to take effect.
The United States has signed the treaty, but the Senate has refused
to ratify it. The Clinton administration has tried to persuade
India to sign and ratify regardless of what the United States does,
arguing that it would be in India's national interest.
</P>
<P>
   India has said it would not stand in the way of the test ban
treaty's implementation, indicating that once major powers such as
the United States and China ratify it, India will be prepared to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, India has vowed to maintain a moratorium on
nuclear testing, which drew praise from Clinton at the South Lawn
ceremony. The 30-minute event, held on an idyllic late-summer
morning, attracted a throng of invited guests, including many
Indian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister met with U.S. and Indian business leaders
Friday night and discussed recent and planned changes in Indian
regulations to privatize state utilities and other industries. He
was there to woo foreign investment to help India gain the
high-tech infrastructure it needs to expand its economy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he expressed awe at U.S. economic power. ''The
continued U.S. prosperity is almost a miracle,'' he said, adding
that it as ''inspired India.''
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, 75, has been hobbled by a bad knee throughout his U.S.
visit. Departing from custom, he remained seated as Clinton spoke
to the gathering. A planned midafternoon news conference was
canceled because Vajpayee complained of exhaustion, White House
press secretary Joe Lockhart said. The prime minister's U.S. visit
began a week ago with his attendance at the U.N Millennium Summit
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, was
host at a luncheon for Vajpayee and told him at a private meeting
that he will resubmit the test ban treaty to the Senate as one of
his first acts as president if he is elected, according to Bruce
Reidel, a National Security Council official.
</P>
<P>
   In a toast to Vajpayee before the lunch, Gore said, ''It is rare
to find a leader who embraces the qualities of idealism and
pragmatism and confidence and humility. And in you, Mr. Prime
Minister, we have such a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   A joint statement issued late Friday said India will ''continue
efforts to develop a broad political consensus'' on the test ban
issue with the purpose of ''bringing these discussions to a
successful conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   India also reconfirmed its commitment ''not to block the entry
into force of the treaty,'' the statement said. That will require
ratification of all countries with nuclear weapons or other types
of nuclear programs and a number of countries without nuclear
programs.
</P>
<P>
   India's sense of vulnerability as a result of having
nuclear-capable neighbors, China and Pakistan, prompted Vajpayee to
order nuclear tests in May 1998. Pakistan followed with tests of
its own. This year, Clinton described the subcontinent as perhaps
the ''most dangerous place'' in the world, but he refrained from
such comments during Vajpayee's visit.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the weapons tests by the South Asian rivals, the
administration imposed sanctions against both. Most have been
lifted since then. Reidel indicated sanctions against India will
remain until it ratifies the test ban treaty.

Suicide Epidemic Ravages Native Youth on Northern Ontario Reserves
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A youth suicide epidemic is once again ravaging
northern Ontario's native communities, with one of the worst hit
reporting almost nightly attempts by teen-agers as young as 13 and
14.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty young people have died on reserves across the province's
north this year, Jim Morris, a health adviser to Nishnawbe-Aski
Nation, the region's top native political organization, said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is most serious on the Pikangikum First Nation, a
community about 186 miles northeast of Winnipeg, which made
national headlines when it was rocked by a wave of suicides and
attempts in the summer of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The six suicides among teen-agers since January in Pikangikum
are only ''the tip of the iceberg'' Chief Peter Quill, said in an
interview Friday during a break from an emergency meeting of chiefs
and crisis workers in his troubled community.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said the latest spate of deaths shows an alarming new
trend.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're getting younger,'' he said, and more young girls are
now committing suicide, including a group of Pikangikum youths who
recently hanged themselves after sniffing gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ontario has the highest suicide rate in Canada, at
three times the national average, Morris said, and Pikangikum,
Webequie and Kingfisher First Nation have experienced a string of
epidemics since the early 1990s.

BCE Has $4 Bil. Alliance with Thomson for Globe and Web Content
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Telecom giant BCE Inc. made another major move to
become Canada's multimedia leader Friday, striking a deal with
Thomson Corp. that combines Canada's biggest private broadcaster,
CTV Inc. and the Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The $4 billion alliance, driven by the need to provide more
content for consumers on the Internet, creates a new as-yet-unnamed
company that will be a dominant player in the multimedia world of
broadcasting, newspapers and the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Besides CTV and the Globe, the BCE-Thomson partnership will
control Internet portal Sympatico along with a stable of the
most-visited Canadian Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the latest in a string of blockbuster ventures that
has shaken up Canada's newspaper, broadcasting and telecom
industries in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, BCE will control the company with a 70.1 per
cent stake. BCE will contribute newly acquired CTV, pending CRTC
approval, and its 71 per cent interest in Internet site
Sympatico-Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson Corp., majority owned by Ken Thomson, will own 20 per
cent and will contribute the Globe and its nine Web sites, along
with a 50 per cent of specialty business news channel ROBTv.
</P>
<P>
   In total, companies controlled by Ken Thomson will own nearly 30
per cent of the new entity.

Hundreds Gather in Montreal To Support Crime Reporter Who Was Shot
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Several hundred people gathered Friday to show
their solidarity for crime reporter Michel Auger, who was shot five
times in the back earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists were joined by other concerned citizens in the
demonstration, which ended in the parking lot of Le Journal de
Montreal, where Auger was shot Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller marches and vigils were held across Quebec and in
Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Auger, who often covered biker gangs, released a photo of
himself Friday as a sign of thanks for the support he has received.
It showed the 56-year-old smiling from his hospital bed despite
being hooked up to various tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Paule Beaugrand-Champagne, editor-in-chief of the tabloid, said
Auger was improving and was awake and able to talk with his wife
and a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Helene Pichette, president of the Federation of Quebec
Journalists, said the demonstrations convey the message that
journalists will not be intimidated by the vicious attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''Together . . . we're saying No to intimidation and No to
manipulation,'' she told the crowd of supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said they have no information about a motive for the
crime. But Auger's co-workers, who said he has received several
threats over the years, pointed the finger at the criminal groups
he has written about.

Crown Corporation Says B.C. Ferry Followed Regulations
</P>
<P>
   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- A 19,000-tonne British
Columbia government passenger ferry was following navigational
regulations when it rolled over a 10-meter power boat, killing one
man and critically injuring a woman, a spokesman for the Crown
corporation said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At least four separate agencies -- Transport Canada, British
Columbia Ferry Corp., the RCMP and the coroner's office -- are
probing Thursday's accident in waters near the Swartz Bay Ferry
Terminal, about 22 miles north of Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Allen Larson, 72, of Port Angeles, Wash., died Thursday
when the massive Spirit of Vancouver Island -- capable of carrying
470 vehicles and more than 2,000 people -- collided with his vessel,
Star Ruby.
</P>
<P>
   His former wife, Lois Larson, 71, of Anchorage, Alaska was
listed in critical condition in the intensive care unit at Victoria
general hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as we know at this point, the ship (ferry) was
complying completely with all regulations that were applicable,''
said Capt. Mike Carter, a British Columbia Ferries vice president.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia Ferries has no immediate plans to change the
way its vessels leave and enter the waters of Swartz Bay, Carter
said.

attack. He was 55.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was the drummer on several O'Jays albums, including
''Live in London,'' released in 1974. He left the group in the
1970s and continued to work in Cleveland area nightclubs.

He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Giedroyc helped found Kultura, a literary magazine that has been
based outside of Paris since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Idolized by millions of Poles, Giedroyc, as Kultura's
editor-in-chief, worked tirelessly to make the banned writings of

</P>
<P>
   Kultura printed otherwise unavailable books, such as
Solzhenitsyn's ''Gulag Archipelago'' and Arthur Koestler's
''Darkness at Noon.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Steps Up Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic stepped
up his re-election campaign with a rally at a factory Friday,
accusing political rivals of being ''Yugoslav traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The event was Milosevic's second appearance in four days --
unprecedented for the autocratic ruler who rarely shows his face in
public. Opposition analysts say his increased pre-election activity
indicates his concern that he may lose the Sept. 24 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the Serbian Orthodox Church appealed to Milosevic's
government to end its campaign of ''intimidation'' ahead of the
elections, amid reports of police arresting 22 pro-democracy
activists Friday throughout Serbia. Some were released, but many
remain in detention.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement carried by Beta news agency, the influential Serb
Church's Holy Synod expressed concern about rising political
tensions only days before the vote for Yugoslavia's president,
parliament and municipal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying himself as the patron of reconstruction, Milosevic
traveled to the central Serbian town of Kragujevac to tour the
state-owned Zastava car and military factory, destroyed during NATO
airstrikes last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shall accomplish everything if we are united. ... Life for
all is possible if we preserve the country from enslavement and
Yugoslav traitors,'' Milosevic said, in his customary reference to
the democratic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to preserve our freedom and peace from the
missionaries of slavery and war,'' Milosevic told a cheering crowd
of thousands of factory workers, brandishing his picture and waving
Yugoslav flags.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to resist all ''pressures and sanctions by Western
governments seeking to colonize the Balkans and the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zastava factory, which had also produced small arms and
artillery, was heavily bombed during the 78-day NATO air campaign
against Yugoslavia in an attempt to end Milosevic's crackdown on
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The government has vowed to rebuild the
plant, which was forced to stop producing weapons and reduce car
production.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and his entourage sped into the plant in limousines
with darkened windows while surrounding streets were sealed off by
policemen. No independent media were allowed to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Independent polls show Milosevic trailing behind opposition
candidate Vojislav Kostunica, his chief rival for the crucial
ballot. They suggest Milosevic may be pushed into a runoff for the
country's top post.
</P>
<P>
   The president's visit to Kragujevac came a day after his
supporters pelted Kostunica with tomatoes and stones during a rally
Thursday in a Serb-run enclave in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The incident ... shows that Milosevic and the circle around
him are losing power,'' Kostunica said in Belgrade. ''They have no
courage to face me or the people but use a handful of desperate
individuals for a pocketful of coins to bring shame on us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica's ally in Kosovo, Marko Jaksic, named five people, two
of whom are Serbian police officers, as instigators of the incident

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Camps To Discuss Debates  </HEADLINE>
By DOUGLAS KIKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush
tentatively agreed Friday on three debate formats -- one traditional
two-lectern event, one town hall, and one ''talk show'' forum --
said officials close to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp had gone into the talks willing to accept the
three-format plan, which the bipartisan Commission on Presidential
Debates proposed in January. Bush, who bowed to the plan after
coming under criticism for announcing his own debate schedule,
wanted at least one to be a ''talk show'' format, which he finds
more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The two campaigns, after meeting 7&AMP;frac12; hours on Friday, broke to
review the proposal and planned to meet again Saturday to complete
details and sign off on the formats, said one official close to
debate negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Details still under discussion include the amount of time for
questions, responses, counter responses and whether times should
vary based on format, said the source, speaking on condition of
anonymity
</P>
<P>
   A Bush campaign official confirmed the two sides had tentatively
agreed on the three-format plan and were waiting to see the details
in writing on Saturday. The official spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Neither campaign would publicly comment on negotiation details.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides sounded optimistic the deal would be done soon.
</P>
<P>
   There was ''substantial progress made toward an agreement,''
Bush campaign chairman Don Evans said through a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign chairman William Daley also was in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Quinn, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National
Committee, said the Gore campaign went into the talks ''ready to
take the commission mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had pushed for more informal debate formats and nearly two
weeks ago said he would accept only one commission debate and two
network debates -- one on NBC and another on CNN's ''Larry King
Live.'' Gore rejected Bush's idea, which the bipartisan commission
criticized.
</P>
<P>
   Bush gave in on Thursday and agree to the three commission
debates.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf, the Republican co-chairman of the debate
commission, said after Friday's session, ''Different formats have
different dynamics to go along with it, and that is what we are
trying to iron out.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kirk, his Democratic counterpart, said, ''Ninety-five
percent of the issues are agreed upon. ... Great strides were
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers from both sides were meeting Friday night in an effort
to speed the final negotiations to an agreement on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential debates are to be held Oct. 3 in Boston, Oct.
11 in Winston-Salem, N.C., and Oct. 17 in St. Louis, with each
lasting 90 minutes starting at 9 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   A 90-minute debate between the vice presidential candidates,
Democrat Joseph Lieberman and Republican Dick Cheney, will go take
place Oct. 5 in Danville, Ky. All the debates are on college
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party nominee Pat Buchanan and Green Party nominee Ralph
Nader, both registering single digits in national polls, most
likely will not meet the commission's threshold of 15 percent in
media polls for inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan lost a legal battle to enter the debates in a ruling
released Friday. U.S. District Court Judge Richard Roberts rejected
Buchanan's claim against the Federal Election Commission for
dismissing his complaint against the debate commission concerning
the 15 percent threshold.

<HEADLINE> Officials express concerns about notification of public  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - As new reports of potentially contaminated
bottled water surfaced Friday, political leaders expressed concerns
about the city's weeklong delay in informing the public about the
possible tamperings.
</P>
<P>
   The city's health department has acknowledged that it was aware
on Sept. 6 of three instances in which bottled water had been
contaminated, although it was not until Sept. 13 that Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani held a press conference to alert the public.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the FBI, not the health department, eventually notified
the police department about the possible tampering. The police in
turn informed the mayor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is troubling to me that the mayor was not informed about
this health issue until almost a week after (health) officials
knew,'' said City Council Speaker Peter Vallone. ''The council's
first concern, of course, is the residents of the city, and their
health was placed in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, as the number of potential contamination cases in the
New York City area reached nine, it remained unclear why the health
department failed to notify top city officials about the suspected
tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Health department spokeswoman Sandra Mullin did not return calls
Friday, but earlier this week, Mullin said she was not sure why the
department did not disclose information about the contaminations
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't really answer those questions,'' she said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Public Advocate Mark Green called for the health
department to disclose why it failed to act once the agency
suspected that bottled water had been tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   ''The health department must reassure the public by immediately
answering these questions,'' said Green. ''Why did it take a week
for the police and the mayor to know about a potential public
health crisis, and why was it the FBI rather than the health
department that finally told them?''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Robles, chair of the City Council's health committee,
also expressed concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''The council will continue to monitor the health department and
all the allegations,'' he said. ''It is definitely cause for
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the three cases the health department knew about, two
other potential cases were reported earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, two new possible cases of tampering in the city were
reported to the police department, although details were not
immediately available. A third case was reported in Hicksville in
Nassau County.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, a 42-year-old woman who bought an 8 oz. bottle of
Poland Spring complained of a burning sensation in her mouth and
nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, police in New Rochelle said that on July 2 a
civilian employee of its department complained of feeling ''a
burning type of sensation'' and becoming ill after he drank from a
half-liter bottle of Poland Spring water he bought at a pizzeria.
</P>
<P>
   Francesco Rizzuti was treated and released from Sound Shore
Hospital in New Rochelle, but due to dizziness has not been back to
work since the incident occurred, said Detective John Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Westchester County police lab refused to test the bottled
water at the time because there was no suspect or imminent arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The bottle has still not been tested.
</P>
<P>
   In the four instances in which tests have been performed on
contaminated water, authorities identified an ammonia-like
substance in two, lye in one and household bleach in another. Tests
on the other cases have not yet been completed.
</P>
<P>
   The victims have all recovered after short hospitalizations.

<HEADLINE> Lazio botches voting age, campaign says Clinton abusing power  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio, the Republican Senate
candidate running against Hillary Rodham Clinton, told an
enthusiastic crowd of elementary students Friday that he wished
they were old enough to vote - but he got the voting age wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''Boy, I wish all of you were 21 years old right now,'' Lazio
said after being welcomed into the Pulaski Street Elementary School
auditorium amid shrieks of approval and applause.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spokesman Michael Marr declined to comment, though the
state Democratic Committee wasted little time in firing off a news
release suggesting Lazio was proposing to repeal the 26th
amendment, which gave the right to vote to 18-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, meanwhile, Lazio's campaign manager said the first
lady is abusing her power by having Senate campaign contributors
stay over at the White House or the Camp David presidential
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ''History is again repeating itself and has reached a new low,''
said Bill Dal Col, referring to criticism of the Clinton
administration after the 1996 re-election campaign for inviting big
donors to spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col said that in addition to releasing the names of recent
overnight guests at the White House and Camp David - something the
White House has agreed to do - the Clinton campaign should ''list
the amount of dollars Mrs. Clinton's guests have contributed to
campaign committees, and to stop this blatant abuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the first lady said campaign contributors have been
invited to such sleepovers, but denied the invitations were made in
return for money.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have friends and supporters come and spend time with us and
spend the night with us that we are getting to know and who like
spending time with us,'' she said. ''I don't see what's news about
that.''

<HEADLINE> MRI 'Disarms' Police Officer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Technology fought the law -- and won.
</P>
<P>
   An armed, off-duty police officer went this week to get a
magnetic resonance imaging test. Clinic workers told it was all
right to keep his handgun with him.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he entered the room, the device's heavy-duty magnet
yanked the .45-caliber gun right out of his hand and the gun
discharged. The bullet lodged in an exterior wall and no one was
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   It took three hours to power down the magnet and free the
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   An MRI is four times as powerful as magnets used to lift cars in
junkyards, said Sgt. William Benwitz, who runs a firearms training
unit.
</P>
<P>
   The weapon is out of service. Benwitz said firing the weapon was
too risky because its molecular structure might have been altered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until we send this gun back to the factory, we're not even
going to test-fire it,'' he said. ''The metal is more brittle than
it should be.''

<HEADLINE> Three Connecticut horses infected with West Nile virus  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Horses in Danbury, Hebron and Milford
have been diagnosed with the West Nile virus, the first cases of
infection in mammals in the state this year.
</P>
<P>
   The horses in Hebron and Danbury were euthanized on Aug. 30 and
Sept. 7, officials with the state Department of Environmental
Protection said Friday. The horse in Milford became sick on Sept 5,
but is recovering, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No human cases of the mosquito-borne disease have been reported
in Connecticut this summer, but infections have been reported in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The type of mosquito that bit the horses also bites humans,
state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This does mean that the risk is higher now,'' said Dr. Matthew
Cartter, the chief epidemiologist with the state Department of
Public Health. ''It's still low...but it's higher now than it was
throughout the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The DEP on Friday recommended insecticide spraying in a two-mile
radius around the sites where the horses were located. The state
was discussing the spraying with town officials in Danbury,
Milford, Bethel, Hebron Columbia and Lebanon. It would not begin
until Wednesday at the earliest, DEP officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having three horses sick with WNV in three different parts of
the state, all within a week of each other is a cause for
concern,'' said DEP Commissioner Arthur J. Rocque Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Theodore Andreadis, who heads the mosquito testing
program at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, said
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may begin testing
Connecticut residents to determine the prevalence of the disease in
humans.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the risk of infection from West Nile virus is
low. Since most people exposed to the virus show no symptoms, it is
hard to track where and how often the virus is transmitted.
</P>
<P>
   Children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems
are most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile virus can cause a range of flu-like symptoms. In the
most serious cases, infection can result in encephalitis, or
swelling of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   A study of antibodies would help determine the risk to humans
from the virus, Andreadis said.
</P>
<P>
   CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said the state would have to initiate
any such study.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they need our assistance, we would help them,'' Skinner
said.
</P>
<P>
   After last year's outbreak in New York City, the CDC went
door-to-door in Queens neighborhoods to collect blood samples.
</P>
<P>
   The survey concluded that between 533 and 1,903 people had been
infected - or 1.2 percent to 4.1 percent of the 46,000 residents in
the neighborhoods tested.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the major questions we're dealing with here is what is
the human risk,'' Andreadis said. ''That's what this survey will
help try to explain to us.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, tests found the virus in human-biting mosquitoes in
Greenwich. The state decided not to spray insecticides, but the
town and the operators of the golf club near where the mosquitos
were trapped sprayed the area Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, about 130,000 mosquitoes have been trapped around
the state and tested at the Agricultural Experiment Station.
Infected bird-biting mosquitoes were found earlier this summer in
Stamford and Norwalk. The state has also found the virus in 279
dead birds in 47 different municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   ''West Nile virus is back with a vengeance this year. It is much
more widespread than any of us expected it would be,'' Andreadis
said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico To Celebrate, Toast Openly  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexicans aren't just free to celebrate their
independence from Spain on Friday -- they are free to publicly toast
the event with a glass of tequila for the first time in 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since President Pascual Ortiz Rubio was wounded in an
assassination attempt the day he took office in 1930, the sale and
public display of alcoholic beverages have been banned during
patriotic Mexican events.
</P>
<P>
   While it was unclear whether Ortiz Rubio's would-be assassin had
been drinking, the measure was apparently aimed at quelling a twin
evil: the celebratory gunplay that had become customary at public
festivities in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, Mexico was coming off nearly two decades of almost
constant armed conflict, and drinking -- accompanied by shooting off
pistols -- was one of the favored ways of whooping it up.
</P>
<P>
   The battle against the latter custom is still being fought in
small towns like Tepotzotlan, just north of Mexico City, where town
authorities hang out signs every year on Independence Day banning
pistols and collect weapons from would-be revelers.
</P>
<P>
   It's still against the law to buy a drink on election day -- or
during the hours the president gives his state of the nation
address.
</P>
<P>
   And until this year, it had been illegal to even bring a bottle
of Mexico's famous drink, tequila, to the huge Independence Day
celebration in Mexico City's main plaza, where thousands of
masquerading partygoers gather to mark the country's break from
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Days before Friday's celebrations, officials in several Mexican
cities -- including the capital -- announced they would remove the
ban on alcoholic beverages as a test to see if Mexico can do
without its so-called ''Ley Seca,'' or Dry Law.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Ramirez, manager of a bar near Mexico City's Independence
monument, applauded the decision. ''We are free, so we should be
free to drink,'' Ramirez said. ''We are just enjoying the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other bar managers in Mexico City, Ramirez has stocked up
on extra tequila and other liquor for popular drinks, anticipating
a big crowd Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Puebla, 65 miles southeast of Mexico City,
officials lifted the alcohol ban, but also beefed up security in
anticipation of festivities.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Ley Seca'' has generally been taken seriously in Mexico.
For those who didn't plan ahead, it was virtually impossible to buy
alcohol from stores unwilling to risk a large fine.
</P>
<P>
   Most Mexicans who wanted to enjoy a drink during the holiday
stocked up on liquor before Sept. 15-16, the traditional dry days
of the country's Independence Day celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The festivities recall events leading up to the day on Sept. 16,
1810, when a priest named Miguel Hildalgo made his famous
revolutionary call, marking the beginning of the armed struggle for
Mexico's independence from Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing an oversized sombrero decorated with a Mexican flag,
Juan Silva, 37, celebrated Friday with one of many tequila drinks
being sold at stands set up around Mexico's Independence monument.
</P>
<P>
   Silva, who was watching crowds gather around the monument, said
he supported lifting ''La Ley Seca,'' as long as people didn't get
out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he asked, what's a Mexican holiday without the
country's favorite drink? ''Tequila is 100 percent Mexican,'' he
said smiling and raising his glass in a toast.
</P>
<P>
   Yet tamales seemed to be more popular than tequila at many
stands. Virginia Gonzalez, overseeing one table selling beer and
tequila, said sales were slow. ''They are tasting, nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Marina Resendiz, 28, decided to be safe and spend the day
in her Mexico City home, away from the crowds that fill the city's
center and far from any possible rowdiness. ''There will be more
parties, and more people who don't know their limit,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Officials Back Off Diesel Rules  </HEADLINE>
By LEON DROUIN KEITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   DIAMOND BAR, Calif. (AP) -- With scores of truckers in the
audience, Southern California air regulators voted unanimously
Friday to delay rules that would have required cleaner-burning
diesel fuel two years before the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   It was the truckers -- some wearing buttons reading ''Trucks Feed
My Family'' -- who helped persuade the South Coast Air Quality
Management District to push back the start date for the rules from
2004 to 2006, district governing board chairman William Burke said
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ''It put a real human face on the side of the rule,'' Burke
said.
</P>
<P>
   The district, which covers Los Angeles, historically has had the
nation's worst air pollution, although Houston took that dubious
title last year and is poised to do the same this year.
</P>
<P>
   Trucking industry spokeswoman Stephanie Williams said the
challenge now is to hold the Environmental Protection Agency to its
proposed rule, which like the district's measure would require
diesel fuel to have a sulfur content of no more than 15 parts per
million by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Diesel fuel in California currently averages about 120 ppm
sulfur, which is too dirty to be used with the latest
emissions-reducing technology. That technology is not yet
commercially available, but its advocates say it can cut emissions
of some pollutants by 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists said they were disappointed that the air
district board failed to add to its history of creating pollution
rules tougher than both the state and nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are ... the nation's top contender for worst air quality,''
said Todd Campbell of the Coalition for Clean Air. ''We need to set
the standard, and the board failed to set it today.''
</P>
<P>
   Although board member Leonard Paulitz joined the 9-0 vote to
push back the rules, he said particularly chronic pollution
problems in the district call for rules that are tougher than the
norm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's not, in our enthusiasm to get all the players on the
dance floor at the same time, fail to realize the reason we have
special rules is we have special conditions,'' Paulitz said.

<HEADLINE> Florence to pass by Bermuda; depressions in Gulf, Atlantic  </HEADLINE>
AP Photo FLAC101
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) - Warnings went up Friday on Bermuda as Tropical
Storm Florence moved toward the Atlantic island and away from the
southeastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, tropical depressions in the Gulf of Mexico and the
Atlantic Ocean east of the Leeward Islands were on the verge of
becoming the sixth and seventh named storms of the Atlantic
hurricane season.
</P>
<P>
   The first depression slid into warm, storm-generating waters in
the southern Gulf of Mexico. Forecasters said it could become
Tropical Storm Gordon as early as Friday evening, menacing the Gulf
coast anywhere along U.S. shores in three days' time.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 500 miles east of the Caribbean's Leeward Islands, a
depression was close to tropical storm strength, heading on a
largely westerly track, poised to become Helene.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda was preparing for heavy rains and surf-churning winds of
45 mph or more by late Friday as Florence was expected to cross
just west of the island before dawn Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 p.m. EDT, Florence's maximum sustained winds were up to
near 70 mph and centered near latitude 30.8 north, longitude 67.5
west, or about 200 miles west- southwest of Bermuda. Some
strengthening was expected overnight, with the possibility Florence
again might become a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Florence was moving east-northeast at about 20 mph, and was
expected to make a gradual turn to the northeast with an increase
in forward speed during the next few days and shoot toward the open
Atlantic, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Florence is ... no threat to the United States. It should pass
within 60 miles of Bermuda overnight,'' according to Eric Blake, a
meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
''Bermuda should feel heavy rain, high winds and dangerous surf.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hamilton, Bermuda, residents were taking a relaxed attitude,
despite an earlier warning from Public Safety Minister Paula Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should be vigilant now. We should keep on the alert for
other advisories, particularly warnings during high surf
conditions,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Bank worker Killian Morrisey, though, summed up the mood on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had Hurricane Gert last year and not much happened. I am
not stocking up on provisions. And if anything happens, I am not
going to die in a couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   And along Front Street, Hamilton's main drag, none of the shops
were boarded up Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The depression which formed Thursday in the extreme western
Caribbean Sea, crossed Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula during the night
and moved into warm waters in the southern Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. EDT, the depression was centered near 21.7 north
latitude, 88.0 west longitude, over the north coast of the Yucatan
peninsula. The depression was meandering for hours Friday, but was
expected to shift slowly toward the north-northwest through the
night.
</P>
<P>
   It had top sustained winds of 35 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''We actually predict that one will become a tropical storm
first - that would be Gordon,'' Blake said. ''We expect it in the
Gulf of Mexico to move to the north-northwest and still be in the
Gulf in 72 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Depressions become named tropical storms once their top
sustained winds reach 39 mph; tropical storms become hurricanes
once their top sustained winds hit 74 mph.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. EDT, the third system was centered near 15.6 north
latitude, 53.5 west longitude, or about 470 miles east of the
Leeward Islands. It was expected to move west-northwest at about 16
mph well into Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic system also had top winds of 35 mph and was
expected to become a tropical storm before reaching the Leeward
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect that one to move westward and to affect the Leeward
Islands within the next 36 hours,'' said Blake. ''We do anticipate
that it will become Tropical Storm Helene before the system reaches
that point.
</P>
<P>
   ''In three days, we still have it south of the Dominican
Republic, so its way too far away now to speculate on any possible
threat to the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rip currents associated with Florence and blamed for
at least three surf deaths Tuesday in North Carolina were expected
to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina authorities said they do not intend to reopen the two
beaches until Florence, which briefly was a hurricane earlier this
week, is no longer a threat.

<HEADLINE> Aryan Nations May Meet in Pa.  </HEADLINE>
By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Facing eviction from its compound in
northern Idaho, the Aryan Nations may move its annual white
supremacist gathering to Pennsylvania next year.
</P>
<P>
   The news was posted on the neo-Nazi group's Web site Friday, a
week after the group was slapped with a $6.3 million judgment in a
civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The compound is scheduled to be seized on Sept. 29 and the
assets sold to satisfy a portion of the judgment due to two people
who sued the group after they were assaulted by Aryan Nations'
guards.
</P>
<P>
   The notice was the first indication that the lawsuit, brought by
the Southern Poverty Law Center, may drive the group out of Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been asked if I would continue to host the yearly
National Congress and my answer was, of course, an astounding
YES!'' wrote August B. Kreis III, Web master for the Aryan Nations
and a Posse Comitatus leader in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Kreis wrote that if the compound is lost, the Aryan Nations
''National Congress 2001'' would be planned for a site near
Ulysses, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Aryan Nations leader Richard Butler declined to talk with
reporters Friday. He is appealing the judgment to the Idaho Supreme
Court, but that appeal is not expected to halt the seizure of the
group's 20-acre compound north of Hayden Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Dees, the civil rights lawyer who led the plaintiffs'
legal team, has said he expected the judgment to bring a quick end
to the Aryan Nations and its racist, anti-Semitic message.
</P>
<P>
   Butler moved to northern Idaho from California in 1973, and
began holding an annual event called the Aryan Nations Congress in
1981. The gatherings drew white supremacists from across the nation
to hear speeches and participate in cross burnings and other
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Kootenai County Sheriff Rocky Watson has said his officers will
seize the Aryan Nations compound on Sept. 29. The sheriff's office
will store the contents and eventually hold a sale, with the money
going to Victoria and Jason Keenan, who filed the lawsuit, and
their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a jury ruled that Butler, his organization and its
corporate entity, Saphire Inc., were negligent in selecting and
overseeing security guards who attacked the Keenans in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Speaks at Two Fund-raisers  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was a fund-raiser for his wife, but
President Clinton used it as a chance to express his desire for
Democrats to grab it all in the fall: the House, the Senate and the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can tell you after eight years here, it obviously matters
who the president and vice president are -- hugely,'' Clinton said,
slicing the air with his hands. ''And it really matters who's in
the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for a Senate seat from
New York, stood behind him, nodding at some of the estimated 200
people who contributed $500 to attend the private reception at a
Washington hotel Friday night. The event raised more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised her public service and joked that they both had
developed thick skins from jabs from their political foes. Mrs.
Clinton thanked the donors who stood snacking on crab cakes and
spinach quiche, saying it would help her in the last two months of
her campaign ''when it will get very hot and heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused and then recalled her contentious debate earlier this
week against her opponent, Republican Rep. Rick Lazio. ''It got a
little hot and heavy Wednesday night,'' she said, and likened the
experience to her days as a trial lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remember the old maxim? If you don't have the facts, you argue
the law. If you don't have the law, you argue the facts. And if you
don't have the law or the facts, you pound on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her opponent as well as the Republican presidential
candidate will keep pounding on tables hoping voters won't notice
that they're better off under the Democrats. The Democrats need to
gain five seats to win back the Senate and seven seats to win back
a majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The first couple then sped in a limousine across town to the row
home of Victor Kamber, a Democratic strategist who hosted another
fund-raiser for about 60 people, many of them union leaders. The
president hadn't planned to attend the second fund-raiser, but he
went anyway and spoke to the guests who dined on orange chicken,
asparagus and beef tenderloin. It was not announced how much that
event raised.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said that she knew there were a lot of people who
didn't want to see her in the Senate but that she felt positive
about her campaign. And she again referred to the testy debate with
Lazio. ''The only experience that prepared me was having two
younger brothers,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea: Goodwill Begets Goodwill  </HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- North Korea said Friday that it will
welcome any U.S. goodwill gestures, now that the two nations have
resolved a diplomatic flap over the recent body searches of North
Korean delegates.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sent a message of
regret to North Korea, explaining that the search in a German
airport by American Airlines security personnel did not reflect
U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's No. 2 leader Kim Yong Nam and his delegation
returned to Pyongyang after the incident, skipping last week's
Millennium Summit. North Korean officials denounced the U.S. action
but later said they took note of the American apology.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in a speech to the annual ministerial meeting of the
General Assembly, North Korea went further.
</P>
<P>
   While calling the recent incident ''the manifestation of the
continued hostile policy'' by the United States, North Korea's U.N.
Ambassador Li Hyong Chol said his nation paid attention ''to the
recently stated U.S. position that it has no reason to perpetuate
its hostile relations with our country.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If this position is put into practice, we will be ready to
respond in a positive way any time,'' Li said.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador also touched on another point of dispute with the
United States, North Korea's missile program, and said it could be
discussed if conditions improve between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the hostile relations are removed and confidence is built
... there will be ways to address the concerns of both sides,'' the
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
   Li said the issue of reunification of the divided peninsula is
for the North and South Koreans to achieve, independent of any
outside interference.
</P>
<P>
   With growing rapprochement between North and South Korea, he
said the United Nations should dismantle the U.N. Command set up
during the Korean War in 1953, describing it as ''a legacy of the
Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   In veiled criticism of the United States, North Korea said
international peace and security should be achieved by
strengthening the role of the United Nations, ''not by
arbitrariness, high-handedness and intervention of any individual
power.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Won't Meddle With Site  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- The head of the California
Republican Party said he won't censor the racy offerings available
through a new GOP Web site that sends a piece of online purchases
to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Republicanshopping.com directs visitors to hundreds of different
sites hawking goods and services. But with a few clicks of the
mouse, shoppers can find all manner of books and videos that would
not embody the GOP theme of ''family values.''
</P>
<P>
   At one site, a purveyor of videos, browsers seeking adult movies
can find ''Sexual Chemistry,'' in which ''an overworked chemist
experimenting with new sex-enhancing drug uses himself as a human
guinea pig in order to make an impending deadline. His new drug
works wonders on his libido, but has an unexpected side-effect: it
turns Robert into a Roberta!''
</P>
<P>
   The Penthouse film library is also available, including such
titles as ''Women In and Out of Uniform,'' ''Internet Babes'' and
''Party With the Pets.'' Up to 10 percent of videos' purchase price
goes to the state GOP.
</P>
<P>
   At affiliated site barnesandnoble.com, the full gamut of
grown-up material is available. ''The Anarchists Cookbook,'' an
infamous book on how to build bombs and guns, is there, too. Five
percent of purchases goes to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the offerings were appropriate, California GOP
Chairman John McGraw said the party was keeping an eye on the site.
</P>
<P>
   But, the software entrepreneur said, he was not going to meddle
with business.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have over 400 national merchants in the program,'' McGraw
said at a news conference. ''We vetted every one of those, and if
it comes to our attention that there is some non-acceptable or
pornographic stuff, we will need to review that, and discuss the
course of action.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not change the site after reviewing it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not going to tell people what they can sell, but we are
also not going to promote something that is in-your-face
pornography or anything like that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Italians Kidnapped in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDELLIN, Colombia (AP) -- Gunmen kidnapped three Italians on
Friday as they drove on a main Colombian highway, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities blamed rebels of the National Liberation Army for
kidnaping the men, who Italian news report said are electricians
working for the National Chocolate Factory in Rio Negro, near
Medellin.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the Italians were intercepted by a pickup truck
carrying five men on the Medellin-Bogota highway.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels are believed responsible for 60 percent of the
kidnappings that occur in Colombia, which has one of the world's
highest kidnapping rates.
</P>
<P>
   Through July of 2000, 1,754 people were kidnapped in Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Makes HMOs Have AIDS Doctors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Under a new state law, California HMOs
will soon be required to let HIV-positive patients get standing
referrals to doctors with expertise in treating AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   While HMOs are required to have specialists for many conditions,
from allergies to urology, the treatment of HIV and AIDS isn't a
certified specialty. AIDS activists say finding a doctor who has
expertise in treating HIV is necessary because of the complex
health problems and treatment regimes needed for those infected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who has a relationship with an HMO knows how difficult
it is to navigate the system to get a referral to a specialist,''
said Cesar Portillo of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. ''For people
with HIV, any delay in getting proper care from a specialist can be
fatal.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis signed the measure Tuesday. The requirement
takes effect Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Portillo said he believes the law is the first to direct HMOs to
use HIV/AIDS specialists. Other states have used ''special needs''
provisions in the law to require health plans to use HIV/AIDS
specialists, he said.

<HEADLINE> College Rewrites its Loyalty Oath  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL ESKOVITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- A Communist community college student's refusal
to pledge allegiance to the United States has prompted the college
system to rewrite its loyalty oath requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Fabricio Rodriguez, student body vice president at Mesa
Community College, was denied his minimum-wage salary after he
refused to sign the oath and relinquish his Communist beliefs. The
oath is required of school employees and officers.
</P>
<P>
   After friends and colleagues rallied to Rodriguez's defense,
calling the oath an arcane leftover of the 1950s, the American
Civil Liberties Union took the case.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Maricopa Community College system said it had
eliminated the reference to Communism.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're actually very pleased that the student brought it
forward,'' said college official Rick DeGraw. ''That's what
students are supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The college law has been a state statute since 1961, even though
the U.S. Supreme Court deemed it unconstitutional five years later.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a Cold War relic just like the B-52 bombers,'' said
Hamilton College Prof. Philip Klinkler, who specializes in U.S.
politics and constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
   Klinkler, who said many states had similar provisions designed
to prevent Communist infiltration, said loyalty oaths ''seem pretty
silly'' today.
</P>
<P>
   The rewritten pledge still asks employees to swear allegiance to
the constitution of Arizona and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez has not said whether he will sign it.

<HEADLINE> London Stock Exchange Chief Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The chief executive of the London Stock Exchange
resigned Friday, a casualty of the revolt by shareholders angered
at his efforts to push through a doomed merger with Germany's
Deutsche Boerse.
</P>
<P>
   Gavin Casey stepped down after narrowly surviving a vote by
dissident shareholders on Thursday. He lost at first in a show of
hands but won a follow-up ballot with 53 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Some shareholders had predicted that Casey would resign after
such a rare and potent display of disapproval, but his resignation
was nonetheless an embarrassment for the London exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The LSE is struggling to bounce back from its failure to unite
with the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse and form a powerful
pan-European exchange. At the same time, it is trying to ward off a
hostile takeover bid from Sweden's OM Gruppen, owner of the
Stockholm Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation has mounted that the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse
might launch an unfriendly bid of its own. Other potential bidders
for the LSE include the Nasdaq Stock Market, the technology-rich
U.S. market, and Euronext, which comprises bourses in Paris,
Brussels and Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Upset at what they see as blundering by Europe's largest
exchange, retail brokers and other small investors stalled the
reappointment of Casey and two other LSE directors at Thursday's
annual shareholders' meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Like Casey, the other board members -- chairman Don Cruickshank
and executive chairman Michael Marks -- survived a shareholder vote,
albeit by somewhat wider margins.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is absolutely right that I should resign as chief
executive,'' Casey said in a letter.
</P>
<P>
   Casey has been the LSE's chief executive since 1996. His
resignation is effective immediately, the exchange said.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Marsden, a partner in S.P. Angel and Co., a brokerage and
LSE shareholder, suggested that Casey might have been made a
scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he did too bad a job. I'm sorry it's come to
this,'' Marsden said.
</P>
<P>
   The London exchange has begun looking for a replacement, and
until then, Cruickshank will shoulder executive responsibility.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Tutor Charged in Minn. Scandal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A former tutor who did more than 400 pieces
of coursework for Minnesota basketball players was charged Friday
with a single federal felony count of financial aid fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The charge was signed by Joshua Hochberg, the acting chief of
the fraud section at the Justice Department, and Mark McConnell, an
attorney with the fraud section who has been supervising the case.
</P>
<P>
   Several newspapers and TV stations, citing unidentified sources
close to the investigation, have reported the charge is part of a
plea bargain in which Jan Gangelhoff agreed to testify against
former basketball coach Clem Haskins and the program's former
academic adviser, Alonzo Newby. In exchange for her testimony,
Gangelhoff would receive no jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Gangelhoff and her attorney, Jim Lord, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gangelhoff is the first person charged with a criminal offense
in the wake of the scandal. In the charge, she's accused of
''knowingly and willfully'' committing fraud by ''fraudulently
preparing and submitting academic coursework'' for a basketball
player, making him eligible to enroll at the university and
enabling him to obtain a federally financed Pell Grant during the
1995-96 school year.
</P>
<P>
   While the charge did not name the player, media reports on the
investigation say he is Bobby Jackson, who now plays for the
Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of grant money in question is $2,900, WCCO-TV
reported Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gangelhoff, a former office manager of the university's academic
counseling unit, said she did the coursework for as many as 20
players from 1993 until early 1998. She resigned in 1998 after
university officials accused her of improperly helping a player
with a paper.
</P>
<P>
   She went public with her allegations in March 1999, sparking a
university investigation that led to the ouster of Haskins and
other athletics officials, as well as self-imposed sanctions by the
university and an investigation by the NCAA. The NCAA's decision on
any additional sanctions is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Gangelhoff's case has been assigned to chief U.S. District Judge
Paul Magnuson in St. Paul. Her first court appearance was expected
sometime next week.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators are considering more than a dozen felony
counts against both Haskins and Newby, WCCO reported Thursday
night, quoting unidentified sources.
</P>
<P>
   The Star Tribune, citing an unidentified source close to the
investigation, reported Friday that federal investigators do not
intend to bring any charges against any student-athletes involved
in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the university sued Haskins to recover the $1.5
million it paid to buy out his contract, saying the coach lied when
he denied giving $3,000 to Gangelhoff and that he told players to
mislead investigators after the scandal broke. Haskins' attorney,
Ron Meshbesher, has said the university's allegations are false.
</P>
<P>
   WCCO reported that Gangelhoff and other key witnesses will
testify before a federal grand jury in Minneapolis next week,
including her sister, Jeanne Payer, who also was a tutor at the
university, and Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The station said Jackson has already been interviewed by the
FBI, as was former player Russ Archambault. It quoted Archambault's
attorney as saying the agents' questions focused on alleged
wrongdoing by Haskins.

<HEADLINE> Angels 16, Twins 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Tim Salmon matched a career high with his
34th home run and the Anaheim Angels rapped out a season-high 21
hits on their way to a 16-5 win over the Minnesota Twins on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Every starter for Anaheim had at least one hit, as the Angels
scored 16 runs for the second time this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took advantage of wildness by Twins starter Matt
Kinney (1-2) and some shoddy fielding in a five-run first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Kinney walked three batters in the inning and threw a wild pitch
that let a run in. In between the wildness, Salmon hit a two-run
shot over the right field wall. Garret Anderson added a two-run
double to put Anaheim up 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels batted around again in the sixth inning, scoring
seven runs. Anderson, who was 3-for-6, collected his 100th RBI of
the season with an RBI single as Anaheim sent 13 men to the plate
to take a 15-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim starter Al Levine allowed only two runs on three hits
but was lifted after four innings, which kept him from winning his
fourth game.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Karl (1-2) came into the game to start the fifth inning,
and pitched two shutout innings to pick up the win.
</P>
<P>
   It was the worst outing for Kinney since being called up by the
Twins on Aug. 14. In his first four starts, the right-hander gave
up nine runs in 24 1-2 innings. Friday night Kinney allowed eight
runs on seven hits in one and 1-3 innings, striking out one to go
with his three walks.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins scored twice in the second on a two-run double by
Corey Koskie to make it 8-2. Jacque Jones drove in two more with a
triple and also scored in the sixth.
Notes@: It took Kinney 24 pitches to record the game's first out.
By then, Anaheim had already scored four runs. ... Darin Erstad
singled twice in the sixth to push his major league-leading hit
total to 218. ... Koskie drove in two runs to give him 59 RBI, one
more than in his rookie season last year. ... Salmon, who hit 34th
homers in 1995, scored three runs to reach 100 for the season,
joining Erstad (106) and Troy Glaus (106). ... Twins pitcher Danny
Mota made his major league debut when he relieved Romero with one
out in the sixth inning. He was acquired by the Twins in the Chuck
Knoblauch trade with the Yankees in 1998. The other three players
picked up by the Twins, Guzman, Brian Buchanan and Eric Milton, are
all on the current roster.

<HEADLINE> Lagretto Wins World Cup Event  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEVON, Pa. (AP) -- Lagretto, ridden by Kate Levy of Katonah,
N.Y., cleared all seven barriers without a fault in the tiebreaking
round to win the opening event of the American Gold Cup Equestrian
Festival on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The win for the 13-year-old Belgian-bred gelding and his
20-year-old owner/rider came on the heels of a victory Saturday in
the Autumn Classic Horse Show in Port Jervis, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Levy and Lagretto topped the 48 starters by winning a two-horse
jumpoff over Olympic champion Leslie Burr-Howard of Westport,
Conn., astride the Irish-bred Clover Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Levy and Burr-Howard were the only two riders to ride their
mounts to fault-free scores over 17 jumps within the 83-second time
allowed in the first round of the qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   Lagretto and Levy posted a score of zero faults in 38.23
seconds, well within the 43-second time allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Clover Leaf dropped the top rail from the third barrier on the
course for four faults. He finished with eight jumping faults and
two time faults.
</P>
<P>
   Levy and Lagretto earned the right to start in the coveted and
last place in the 40-horse jumping order, one ahead of Clover Leaf
and Burr-Howard, in Sunday's $60,000 American Gold Cup Grand Prix.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman's Mom-in-Law Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The mother-in-law of vice presidential candidate
Joseph Lieberman was hospitalized Friday for treatment of abdominal
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Ella Freilich, the mother of Hadassah Lieberman, was admitted to
New York Presbyterian Hospital late Wednesday, said Mrs.
Lieberman's spokeswoman, Sally Aman. She would not provide details
of the illness.
</P>
<P>
   ''She is in the hospital under observation and she is expected
to leave the hospital soon,'' Aman said Friday. ''It is not
life-threatening and she is simply in the hospital under
observation. The doctors expect to release her in the next few
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lieberman visited her mother Thursday and early Friday
before returning to Washington with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Freilich, who is in her early 80s, and her late husband,
Samuel, came to the United States with Hadassah from Czechoslovakia
in the early 1950s after having survived Nazi concentration camps.

<HEADLINE> Mayor Backs Decree on Police Reform  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Talks over reforming the Police Department
took a dramatic turn Friday when Mayor Richard Riordan and Police
Chief Bernard Parks said they would agree to federal oversight of
the department.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan sent a letter to the City Council saying he would
support a consent decree with a few conditions. He had long been
opposed to a decree, under which a federal judge would monitor the
department to make sure it institutes reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's conditions include limiting the monitor's role, said
Kelly Martin, Riordan's chief of staff. Martin also said the mayor
also wants the Justice Department to specify how long a federal
monitor would be in place.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's about-face could be the final step in approval of a
sweeping package of reforms that federal officials have been
hammering out with city negotiators since May with the aim of
making the police department more open and accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's real reform,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have spent more than four years investigating
allegations that the Police Department routinely employs excessive
force and infringes on the rights of minorities. The inquiry
accelerated last fall as a scandal unfolded at the department's
Rampart station.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal involves allegations that police officers beat and
framed innocent people. So far, more than 100 convictions have been
overturned and five officers have been charged with crimes ranging
from planting weapons to attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Justice Department formally told city officials of
its intention to sue over what Washington alleges is a ''pattern of
practice'' of civil rights abuses, prompting the council to open
negotiations with federal attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan and Parks insisted for months that the police force
could reform itself. The mayor adopted his new stance, which has
Parks' support, after negotiations led to a more palatable package
of proposed reforms from the Department of Justice, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also wanted to avoid a federal lawsuit, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement, if accepted by the Justice Department and
approved by the City Council and by Riordan, would eliminate the
threat of a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pleased with these developments and we look forward to
continuing to work expeditiously toward a final agreement,'' said
Bill Lann Lee, assistant attorney general for civil rights. Lee has
spearheaded negotiations with the city.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Riordan said that besides agreeing to a consent
decree, he will agree to the Police Department keeping data on
traffic stops aimed at determining whether officers engage in
racial profiling. That was a key federal demand that Riordan and
Parks had opposed.

<HEADLINE> Canada Launches Sovereignty Study  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Confronting one of the most divisive
issues on the world agenda, Canada has announced the creation of an
independent commission to try to reconcile a country's right to its
sovereignty with the world's duty to intervene to stop atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy used his General Assembly
address Thursday to outline the commission's work and to urge the
188 other countries in the audience -- many of them vehemently
opposed to the concept of ''humanitarian intervention'' -- to join
the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing so threatens the U.N.'s very future as this apparent
contradiction between principle and power, between people's
security and governments' interests, between -- in short --
humanitarian intervention and state sovereignty,'' Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
   The sovereignty vs. intervention debate has grown increasingly
rancorous since Secretary-General Kofi Annan raised it in his
General Assembly address last year.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Cuba's foreign minister took issue with supporters of
the proposal, saying that such outside intervention in a country's
affairs poses ''the greatest threat to international peace and
security.''
</P>
<P>
   In an address to the General Assembly's ministerial meeting,
Felipe Perez Roque claimed the plan is aimed at poor countries like
Cuba. And he denounced ''humanitarian intervention'' as an attempt
by powerful forces led by the United States and a small group of
its rich allies to fragment and recolonize defenseless developing
nations.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said at last week's U.N. Millennium Summit
that ''when good and evil collide'' the international community
must take a side and protect people -- whether by diplomacy,
sanctions or collective force.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the international community met this test last year
when NATO's 78-day bombing campaign ended Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments have been shamed for having refused to
respond to the Rwandan genocide but also criticized for having
launched airstrikes on Yugoslavia -- violating its sovereignty -- to
protect ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has paralyzed Security Council action in some
conflicts because Russia and China maintain firm positions that a
country's right to deal with its own internal crises, without the
meddling of the international community, is paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Their argument, which is backed by India and many in the
developing world, is based on fear of outside intervention in
hometown conflicts like Chechnya, Tibet and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The International Commission on Intervention and State
Sovereignty will try to address all these issues and more, and come
up with recommendations for how world governments and the United
Nations can confront the next Rwandas and the next Kosovos,
Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which will present its findings and
recommendations to the United Nations in a year, has enlisted
current and former foreign ministers to serve on its political
advisory board. Academics, lawyers and humanitarian experts from
both the developing world and the industrialized world have been
recruited to serve as commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   Former Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, co-chairman of
the commission, said that despite the Chinese absence, commission
members would nevertheless solicit input from China.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can't do it in a more publicly involved way, we'll
certainly do it privately,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian government is contributing dlrs 1 million for the
yearlong $2.5 million project, with the Carnegie Corp. of New York,
the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the
Rockefeller Foundation also contributing.

<HEADLINE> Teen Violated Law in Suicide Case  </HEADLINE>
By TOM STUCKEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- A teen-ager who helped his girlfriend kill
herself last fall violated Maryland's law banning assisted suicide
but was not criminally responsible for his actions, a judge ruled
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Pamela North said it was clear the boy suffered
from serious depression and he could not conform his actions to the
law.
</P>
<P>
   She referred him to a state psychiatric hospital where he will
be evaluated and treated.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, whose name is not being used because he is a juvenile,
was the first person charged under the law passed in 1999 that made
it a crime to help someone commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, then 16, and Jennifer Garvey, 15, took a gun from the
boy's house last September and went to a storm drain known to
neighborhood teen-agers as ''the underworld.'' The two had written
numerous letters to each other in which they talked of how
depressed they were and how they would like to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The boy told police the night of the shooting that he intended
to kill himself, but could not find the gun after his girlfriend
shot herself.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bergeson, an assistant state's attorney, argued that the
evidence did not prove that the boy was unable to control his
actions.
</P>
<P>
   State's Attorney Frank Weathersbee drew criticism from some
legislators for charging the boy under the assisted suicide law,
which they said was never intended to cover a suicide pact.
</P>
<P>
   But North said the law was broadly written and was not limited
to medical personnel or family members who help someone commit
suicide. She said the General Assembly had a chance to change the
law at the 2000 session after the boy was charged but failed to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   North said evidence showed the boy ''did knowingly cause another
person to commit suicide,'' but she said he was not responsible for
his actions because of his history of severe depression.

<HEADLINE> Astros 16, Pirates 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Chris Truby homered, tripled, doubled and drove
in five runs as the Houston Astros beat Pittsburgh 16-7 Friday
night, the Pirates' season-high seventh straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou homered, doubled twice and drove in four runs for
the Astros. Houston tied its season high for runs, having scored 16
against the Pirates on Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Truby and Alou both doubled during a six-run eighth inning that
broke open the game.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh, which held an early 5-0 lead, fell to 0-5 at Enron
Field. Brian Giles hit his 33rd home run and John Vander Wal also
connected for the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Brian Powell (2-1) threw two hitless innings for the
victory. He pitched for the first time since Aug. 28, having been
sidelined by a sore shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Skrmetta (1-2) pitched two innings and allowed two runs on
three hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates scored five times in the second off Tony McKnight,
starting with Vander Wal's 22nd homer. Pat Meares hit a two-run
double and Adrian Brown added a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Truby hit a two-run triple in the bottom half and scored on Tim
Bogar's groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Alou and Lance Berkman doubled to tie it at 4 in the third, and
Truby's homer put the Astros ahead. The Pirates regained the lead
at 7-6 in the fourth on Giles' home run.
</P>
<P>
   Alou's two-run homer in the fifth, his 29th, put Houston ahead
8-7. Mitch Meluskey added an RBI single in the sixth and Bogar
singled home a run for a 10-7 lead in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Alou hit a two-run double and Truby had an RBI
double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Meluskey played in his 105th game, the most by an Astros
rookie since Jeff Bagwell (156) and Luis Gonzalez (137), both in
1991. ... Scott Linebrink's single in the second inning was his
first major league hit. ... Vander Wal stretched his career high
hitting streak to 16 games, tying the Pirates' season best set by
Wil Cordero's 16-gamer set April 20-May 23.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 6, White Sox 5  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Alex Gonzalez and Darrin Fletcher homered off
struggling Chicago rookie Jon Garland and the Toronto Blue Jays
continued their strong play at Comiskey Park, beating the White Sox
6-5 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays, three games behind Cleveland in the AL wild card
chase, have won seven of their last nine games at Comiskey, dating
back to 1998. Cleveland beat New York 11-1.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's loss left the White Sox's magic number at 11 for
clinching the AL Central.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting of MVP candidates, Toronto's Carlos Delgado walked
twice and was hit by a pitch in an 0-for-1 night while Chicago's
Frank Thomas was 0-for-4 with a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto drove Garland (3-7) out in the fifth on run-scoring
doubles by Brad Fullmer and Fletcher that made it 6-2. Fletcher hit
a solo homer in the fourth, his 18th.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old Garland, the youngest pitcher in the majors,
hasn't made it past the fifth inning in three starts since coming
off the disabled list 11 days ago. He gave up six hits, including
two homers, and six runs -- four earned -- with five walks.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Valentin's two-run homer in the fifth, his 23rd, cut the
lead to 6-4 and was Chicago's club-record 199th homer this season.
Charles Johnson hit a solo shot, his 28th, off John Frascatore to
make it 6-5 in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvim Escobar (10-14) retired Thomas and Magglio Ordonez with a
runner on to end the seventh and pitched a scoreless eighth. Billy
Koch got three outs for his 33rd save, including Thomas on a
strikeout with the tying run on third base.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays scored three in the third as Shannon Stewart
reached on an error when Sox first baseman Paul Konerko couldn't
handle his hard grounder and Gonzalez followed with his 13th homer.
Dave Martinez walked, moved up on a grounder and scored on
Fullmer's single.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago loaded the bases with no outs in the third on two walks
and Magglio Ordonez's single but managed just one run on Carlos
Lee's RBI single as Quantrill got Paul Konerko on a 5-2-3 double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had an RBI single for Chicago's first run in the third
off starter Steve Trachsel, who lasted just three plus innings.
Notes: Fall was in the air with a 62-degree game-time temperature.
... Cal Eldred, still trying to see if can pitch again this season
with a screw in his elbow, made 40 tosses from 40-to-50 feet Friday
with no pain. He'll throw again Sunday. Eldred has a stress
fracture of his elbow and has been on the DL since July. He had
surgery to implant the screw last week. ... The 1998 White Sox hit
198 homers. ... Delgado is homerless in his last 16 games, his
longest drought this season. ... Mark Buehrle pitched 3 1-3 hitless
innings of relief for the White Sox.

<HEADLINE> Olympics Open With a U.S. Gold  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- She shoots. She scores!
</P>
<P>
   American Nancy Johnson captured the first gold medal of the
Sydney Olympics, firing her way to victory Saturday (Friday night
EDT) in the women's 10-meter air rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Winning the first medal -- that's pretty cool,'' said Johnson,
whose father first took her to a shooting range at age 15. ''It's
extra special, no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a two-time Olympian from Downers Grove, Ill., hugged
her coach and pumped her fists after winning; her dad, Ben
Napolski, was in the audience. The silver medal went to Kang
Cho-hyun of South Korea, and Gao Jing of China took the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's gold medal triumph came just hours after the
extravagant four-hour opening ceremony. While the 26-year-old
Johnson was winning, the women's triathlon was making its debut as
an Olympic sport -- and Australia's Michellie Jones was capturing
the host nation's first medal.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's was the first of 13 gold medals up for grabs on Day 1
of the Olympic competition.
</P>
<P>
   When the triathletes hit the water in Sydney Harbor, athletes in
women's basketball, fencing, archery, judo and field hockey were
already under way.
</P>
<P>
   -- TRIATHLON: In its debut as an Olympic event, the women's
triathlon produced a terrific one-on-one finish as Brigitte McMahon
of Switzerland outlasted Australia's Jones in the grueling
competition. McMahon was the winner by two seconds when the pair
reached the finish line at Sydney Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   An exhausted Jones, after taking the first medal for the host
Australians, fell just beyond the finish line. She and McMahon then
stood, holding hands, to welcome bronze medalist Magali Messmer of
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   American Joanna Zeiger, of Baltimore, was waving a small
American flag as she arrived in downtown Sydney in fourth place.
The triathlon course started and finished on the plaza outside the
acclaimed opera house, with an excursion through downtown Sydney
and the Royal Botanic Gardens in between.
</P>

   -- SWIMMING: Australian swimming sensation Ian Thorpe made a big
splash in his first event, setting an Olympic record amid the type
of adulation usually reserved for rock stars.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old Australian was top qualifier in the 400-meter
freestyle preliminaries Saturday morning (Friday night EDT), with
his 3 minute, 44.65 second time breaking an 8-year-old Olympic
mark.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was pretty happy with the result there,'' said the teen
dubbed the ''Thorpedo.'' Americans Chad Carvin of Laguna Hills,
Calif., and Klete Keller of Phoenix, also advanced to the eight-man
evening final.
</P>
<P>
   The duel between American Jenny Thompson and Dutch swimmer Inge
De Bruijn started with a bang, as Thompson set an Olympic record in
the 100 butterfly preliminaries only to see De Brujin eclipse it
minutes later in another heat.
</P>
<P>
   The record had stood for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was really pleased with my time,'' Thompson said. ''I was
controlling myself emotionally. I'm feeling good and strong and
relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier at the Aquatic Center, two Americans qualified Saturday
(Friday night EDT) for the women's 400-meter individual medley --
Kaitlin Sandeno and Maddy Crippen.
</P>
<P>
   Sandeno, the 17-year-old known as the ''Energizer,'' posted the
third-fastest qualifying time in the preliminaries. She's hoping to
give the United States its first gold medal in the event since
Janet Evans in 1988. Crippen was the eighth and final qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   American medal hopes on the first day of swimming belonged to
its two relay teams, with veteran Thompson seeking to capture a
record sixth gold medal. Thompson shares the high total for an
American woman Olympian with speedskater Bonnie Blair.

   -- BOXING: The American boxing team, hoping for its best showing
since Seoul in 1988, took its first step in that direction when
119-pounder Clarence Vinson scored a one-sided decision over Rachid
Bouaita of France. Vinson, of Washington, D.C., landed the last
eight scoring blows in a 9-2 decision.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable U.S. boxer in Sydney only made it to ringside:
Muhammad Ali, who showed up at the boxing venue during another
bout. The ex-heavyweight champion hugged an old foe, Joe Bugner,
who was working as a boxing commentator. Bugner, who now lives in
Australia, lost to Ali in 1975.

   -- SAMARANCH DEPARTS: International Olympic Committee president
Juan Antonio Samaranch, presiding over his last games, left the
Sydney Olympics to visit his ailing wife in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch's wife, Maria Theresa, was suffered an undisclosed
ailment. IOC director Francois Carrard, who announced Samaranch's
departure, provided no other details.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a private matter for him and his family,'' he said.
''It's not possible for me to say today when he could come back.
But he made clear he does intend to come back to the games as
quickly as he can.''

   -- BEACH VOLLEYBALL: The U.S. women enjoyed a day on the beach in
Day One of the competition as Holly McPeak and Misty May easily
dispatched the Czech duo of Martina Hudcova and Tereza Tobiasova in
a 15-5 rout. The fourth-seeded Americans used seamless teamwork in
cruising to the win.

<P>
   -- WOMEN'S BASKETBALL: Margo Dydek, the 7-foot-2 center for the
WNBA's Utah Starzz, scored 20 points and grabbed 12 rebounds as
Poland beat New Zealand 75-52 to kick off the basketball
competition. It was the first Olympic game for the women's team
from both countries.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil later beat Slovakia, 76-60.

<P>
   -- OPENING CEREMONY: The best-kept secret in Australia was
revealed Friday when Australian Olympic runner Cathy Freeman
kindled the Olympic flame to cap an extravagant -- and seemingly
endless -- opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, an Aborigine, did her duty near the end of a
four-plus-hour show that lagged behind schedule. Freeman, a
favorite to win a gold medal in Sydney, has been notoriously
outspoken in her defense of Australia's indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
   The party kicked off with a lone rider and his horse galloping
into Olympic Stadium to the cheers of 110,000 pumped-up fans.
</P>
<P>
   The flashlight-waving, hand-clapping crowd went wild throughout
the lengthy event, giving a standing ovation when North and South
Korea marched together behind a single flag for the first time
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Among those taking in the festivities were Muhammad Ali and Bill
Gates.

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Adolofo Valencia scored with 10
seconds left in overtime to give the New York-New Jersey MetroStars
a 2-1 victory over the Dallas Burn on Friday night in the first
game of their quarterfinal playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia took a pass from Clint Mathis deep in the box, got past
two defenders and placed an 8-yard shot just inside the post.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the ball came to me I looked at the clock and saw there
was less than a minute left,'' Valencia said. ''I knew I couldn't
wait, I had to score.''
</P>
<P>
   MetroStars coach Octavio Zambrano said that it was a perfect
spot for Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he's at his best when he's in the box,'' Zambrano said.
''In a scramble inside is where Adolfo really shines.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory gives the MetroStars three points in the series,
which resumes Wednesday night in Dallas. Game 3, if necessary, will
be next Saturday at Giants Stadium. The first team to five points
wins the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always disappointing to lose a game like that,'' Dallas
coach David Dir said. ''But I think we can take a lot of positives
out of this. We clearly had the better chances especially in the
second half and gave them plenty to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis opened the scoring 34th minute, slipping the ball past
goalkeeper Matt Jordan from close range.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, which rarely threatened in the first half, looked as if
it would tie the match in the 55th minute when Lothar Matthaus
pulled Antonio Martinez down in the penalty box. However,
goalkeeper Paul Grafer was able to dive to his right and save the
spot kick by Oscar Pareja.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn tied it two minutes later when Ariel Graziani crossed
the ball from the right to an unmarked Bobby Rhine in the middle of
the box. Rhine turned quickly and put the shot past Grafer.
</P>
<P>
   Each team had a chance to win in late in regulation. For the
MetroStars, Tab Ramos' free kick from just outside the box in the
85th minute sailed wide right. In the 89th minute, Dallas' Sergi
Daniv intercepted a clearing pass and shot wide right.

<HEADLINE> O'Neill Latest Yank Forced to Bench  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Paul O'Neill is the latest Yankees starter
forced to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The right fielder, bothered by a sore right hip for several
weeks, will be rested for 5-7 games until his hip heals, New York
manager Joe Torre said after Friday night's 11-1 loss to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill didn't play Thursday and was clearly limping Friday,
when he went 0-for-2. He missed six games last month because of the
hip.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees seven games ahead of Boston in the AL East and
just over two weeks remaining, they're looking to get healthy for
the playoffs instead of trying to put their best lineup out every
day.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Bernie Williams hasn't played since Sunday,
allowing his strained right rib cage and sore calf time to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, who missed more than a month
with a sore right elbow before returning Sept. 6, sat out Friday
night after feeling pain making a throw to home plate in Thursday
night's 3-2 loss to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to get rid of it in a hurry and I couldn't get on top,''
Knoblauch said. ''It was the first time I had to throw sidearm. It
was a sharp pain, like the pain I had been feeling before.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said Knoblauch was likely to play against the Indians on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it should be all right,'' Knoblauch said. ''I could
probably have played tonight, but Joe said we're looking toward
October. I think it was good just to give it a day to calm down. I
didn't throw today, I just hit. It's not going to go away, but if
it will calm down, I can play with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez, who is feeling banged up, was given a night off
and also should be back Saturday. Catcher Jorge Posada was
scheduled to take a day off Friday and will be in Saturday's
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter, however, will be out Saturday. Torre said he
ordered Jeter to take off one of the games during the four-game
series against the Indians and the shortstop chose Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Entertainment Venue Closed  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Olympic authorities said Saturday they
were forced to close their busiest downtown entertainment venue
after it became littered with broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was injured as a result of smashed bottles and glasses
strewn over Martin Place, a city square close to Sydney's major
bank buildings.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, officials warned members of the public that
security personnel would confiscate any glass brought to the six
Olympics Live Sites dotted throughout central Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the safety and comfort of all guests at Olympics Live
Sites, any glass taken to ... sites will be confiscated,'' said
David Richmond, director general of Sydney 2000, the games'
organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is understandable that people want to enjoy themselves, but
we will not allow a small minority to spoil the occasion for
spectators and performers alike,'' Richmond warned.
</P>
<P>
   The live sites feature stages where bands and other performers
play and giant screens broadcast Olympic events. On Friday night,
the screens were showing the spectacular opening ceremony for the
2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said more than 50,000 people visited the various live
sites on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Martin Place site was closed down at midnight -- two hours
early -- because of safety fears.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported only two arrests among the crowds, both for
assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Place was busy again Saturday, with live bands
entertaining hundreds of people and a women's water polo match
being shown on the giant screen.
</P>
<P>
   The square had clearly been swept since Friday night, but there
was still a large amount of broken glass in cracks between paving
stones.
</P>
<P>
   There was not a single arrest by police at the main Olympic
site, Homebush Bay, on Friday night where more than 100,000 people
crowded into the main stadium to watch the opening ceremony.
