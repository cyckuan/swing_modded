<HEADLINE> SFOR Confirms Possible Clash Between Rival Serb Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 18 (Xinhua)--NATO-led Stabilization
Force(SFOR) confirmed on Monday that its troops had been
developed around the Banja Luka police station to prevent a
potential clash between rival Serb police.
</P>
<P>
Major John Blakeley, a spokesman for SFOR, said that after 50
Serb special policemen loyal to Republika Srpska President
Biljana Plavsic took over the Banja Luka public security center
in a predawn raid on Sunday, Momcilo Krajisnik, the Serb member
of the Bosnia presidency asked SFOR for permission to use other
special police units for "operational reason".
</P>
<P>
SFOR denied the request and deployed two platoons of military
police equipped with eight armored vehicles around the police
station to prevent a "potentially explosive situation from
developing", Blakeley said.
</P>
<P>
The special police, who claimed to have found evidence in the
station of espionage on Plavsic by her opponents, were later
escorted back to their barracks by SFOR troops.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Rallies Arab Backing in Fighting Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat today called for Arab action in face of
Israeli sanctions against the Palestinians in a message he sent to
the 22-member Arab League (AL).
</P>
<P>
"The message examined the latest negative developments in the
Palestinian territories due to the Israeli anti-peace coercive
measures and its imposing of a starvation policy and embargo
against the Palestinians," the Egyptian MENA news agency quoted
PNA permanent representative to the Arab League Mohammad Subeih as
saying.
</P>
<P>
It comes in the light of perpetual attempts by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to intimidate the PNA and
spark off a civil war among the Palestinians, said Subeih after
handing over the message to AL Secretary General Esmat Abdul
Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Meguid briefed the Palestinian representative on his recent
intensive contacts with Arab foreign ministers and permanent UN
Security Council member states in order to support the PNA and
foil Netanyahu's schemes, according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
Arafat accused Israel of waging "state terrorism" against his
people as punishment for July 30 double suicide bombing in Jewish
west Jerusalem and urged last week an emergency Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and United Arab Emirates
President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan al Nahyan were involved in
efforts to convene the summit to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian
peace-making crisis.
</P>
<P>
The bombing attack took place just as the Israelis and the
Palestinians decided to resume the peace talks, which had been
stopped by the construction of a Jewish settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the bombing attack, Israel sealed off
Palestinian areas, froze millions of dollars of financial
transfers it owes the PNA and suspended the resumption of talks
with the PNA on so-called confidence building measures such as
opening air and sea ports in self-ruled Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has threatened to match the sanctions with a partial
boycott of Israeli goods and go on with "national unity" talks
with various Palestinian groups on Wednesday despite Israeli
accusation that the talks amount to "appeasement of terrorism."

<HEADLINE> France Appeals for Ending of Fighting in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- France today again called for an
immediate ending of fighting in northwest of Cambodia between the
forces loyal to former First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh
allied with the Khmer Rouge and those of Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
"We remain particularly vigilant in respect of the situation
of human rights and appeal from our hearts the rapid and concrete
improvement in this field, notably under the form of an amnesty,"
said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed for a "rapid resumption of functioning of
institutions" of Cambodia, whose main task he said is to prepare
for the May 1998 general elections.
</P>
<P>
"The international community cannot accept that the elections
go on in the conditions which would not respect the spirit of the
Paris accords" which call for a national reconciliation and
denounce violence, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the general elections call for the
establishment within the shortest time of a constitutional
council, a council of magistration, an electoral code, a law on
parties, the liberty of expression, security of persons, and an
equal access to the media by all parties.
</P>
<P>
He again called on the Phnom Penh government to let all the
parliament deputies, who quit Cambodia in July after Ranariddh was
ousted from power by Hun Sen, to return home with all security
guaranteed, so that the elections can be held "in the conditions
of liberty and incontestable balance."
</P>
<P>
He finally praised the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) for the mediation efforts it made among all the parties of
Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Said at Work on New Designs of Nuclear Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A private group claims that the
United States is hard at work on new designs of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based Natural Resources Defense council says the
U.S. is working on some types of warheads including steps toward
redesigning the heart of the hydrogen bomb, its atomic trigger,
the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Council made the judgement based on an Energy Department
document declassified in June and plans to make it public
tomorrow, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The work focuses on the B-61 bomb for planes, the W-87 warhead
for MX missiles and the W-76 and W-88 warheads for Trident
missiles launched from submarines, the document was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Council says the work in some cases is meant to increase
the power and precision of the weapons and to strengthen them for
jobs like penetrating deep into the earth to knock out enemy
bunkers.
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department however insists that it is only
modernizing old designs with a goal of increasing the warheads's
life, safety and security while denying that it is making new
weapons or enhancing explosive power of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
The Department which maintains the nation's nuclear arsenal for
the military, says its work adheres to the intent of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but critics disagree with this,
the New york Times added.

<P>
HANGZHOU, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A strong typhoon codenamed
Number 11, or Typhoon Winnie as it was called before reaching east
China's Zhejiang province, landed at Wenling City at 21:30 hours
(Beijing Time) today, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
The local people are now making every effort to combat the
typhoon, along with thunderstorm and tidal waves.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China, and Chinese Premier Li Peng extended
their cordial regards to locals right after the landing and
required leading officials at all levels and people to combat the
typhoon and involve themselves in the relief work to reduce the
losses to the minimum.
</P>
<P>
Latest weather forecast indicated the typhoon would further
move northwesternward and affected such cities as Shaoxing, Jinhua
and Hangzhou. By the 19:30 hours, locals from the coastal regions
of these cities have all moved to safer places.

<P>
PARIS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- France today indirectly indicated
that it prefers Gabonese President Omar Bango to President
Laurent-Desire Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo in
mediating a settlement to the conflict in the Congo Republic.
</P>
<P>
While describing as "normal" that the neighbor countries of
the Congo Republic is interested in looking for a solution to the
conflict in the country, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves
Doutriaux said that France has always "firmly supported" the
mediation provided by Bongo and U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun.
</P>
<P>
Kabila and President Pascal Lissouba reached an agreement today
upon the dispatch of an international force to Brazzaville "in a
brief delay."
</P>
<P>
The force could consist of soldiers from Angola, Central
African Republic, Chad, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic
of Congo, and Uganda, according to Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has been going on since June between the forces
supporting President Lissouba and Cobra militiamen supporting
former President Denis Sassou-NGuesso in Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
The mediation provided by Bongo and Sahnoun has so far failed
to persuade the two conflicting sides to lay down their arms.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Islamic
militia today claimed that they have arrested a close aide to
Afghanistan's former military chief Ahmad Masood, Afghan sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces have arrested Abdul Baqi who is said to be
Masood's close aide in the northern Kunduz province controlled by
the militia, said the Afghan sources in Peshawar, a major city in
northwestern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Baqi was distributing money among local people to instigate
them to revolt against the Islamic militia until he was arrested
by the patrolling Taliban men, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
But the sources did not disclose the specific location where
Baqi was caught.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's such claim has not been independently confirmed
so far.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few weeks, the forces loyal to Masood and the
Taliban fighters have been engaged in fierce fighting north of
Kabul. But both sides have failed to make any significant
territorial gains.

PARIS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The French city Strasbourg today
registered a new high level of ozone pollution with 226
micro-grams of ozone per cubic meters in its central Kleber
Square, announced the official Agency for Supervision and Study of
Atmospheric Pollution in Alsace.
</P>
<P>
The worst polluted area is in the central area of Strasbourg,
followed by its suburbs, while other parts of the Alsace region in
which Strasbourg is located have lower levels of pollution.
</P>
<P>
Both Paris and Strasbourg last week attained the level-two of
ozone pollution, with more than 181 micro-grams of ozone per cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
Waste air from cars, high temperatures, sunshine and lack of
wind are the main factors for the rise of pollution level in both
Strasbourg and Paris.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Upper Rhine and Lower Rhine, which make up
the Alsace region, have called on the local residents to use
automobiles only for the purposes of strict necessity.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Warns Zimbabwe Against Deepening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- World Bank consultant Gloria
Mkombachoto today warned the Zimbabwean government against paying
lip service to the deepening economic crisis that threatens to
undermine the peace and tranquility prevailing in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said while the government had, through successive budget
statements, acknowledged the existence of some economic woes that
had afflicted the country since independence in 1980, it had
shown little commitment to finding a permanent solution to the
problems.
</P>
<P>
"These problems are known by everyone, especially the people
and companies that are affected compared to the policy makers,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"To this end, it is proposed that before these economic
problems translate into severe social and ultimately political
problems, let's not temper with the peace and tranquility that is
currently prevailing in this country," he told participants
attending a two-day post budget seminar that opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The comments came in the wake of the 1997/98 budget presented
to parliament last month, and described in some circles as
"standstill" or "non-event".
</P>
<P>
Among the main components of the budget were cuts in real
terms of allocations for some key social ministries as well as
the absence of clear strategies to promote investment and create
jobs.
</P>
<P>
Signs of economic stress among Zimbabwe's 12 million people
were beginning to show through strikes at unprecedented levels by
workers in both the public and private sectors, according to the
World Bank official.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today recommended the Security Council to establish a
peace-building support office to succeed the mandate of the United
Nations Observer mission in Liberia(UNOMIL).
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said with the
establishment of a democratically elected government in the
country, the principle objective of UNOMIL had now been achieved.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said that the mandate of UNOMIL would
expire on September 30 and the withdrawal of UNOMIL personnel was
already underway and should be substantially completed by that
date, leaving a small team to complete the usual liquidation and
closing process.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said the establishment of a peace-building
support office in Liberia could greatly assist the new government
on its efforts for reconciliation and reconstruction and
contribute to promoting peace and stability in the region.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Gold Mine Closed as Gold Prices Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The fall in gold prices in the
world market has claimed its first victim in zimbabwe with the
closure of Rio Tinto Zimbabwe's (RTZ) Brompton Mine near Kadoma,
140 km south-west of Harare.
</P>
<P>
RTZ announced today that the company has not been able to
sustain profitable operations due to losses incurred in the first
half of this year, in which gold traded at an average 347 U.S.
Dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
"The recent fall in the gold price to levels well below this
figure has compounded the problems of the operation and in the
circumstances further losses cannot be maintained," said Frank
Webster, group personnel and public relations manager of the
mining conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
Gold prices have been falling since the beginning of the year
partly due to the disposal or threat thereof by central banks
which are making efforts to meet the criteria for entry into the
European Monetary Union.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Political differences are the
main barriers to the promotion of economic relations among member
nations of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation
(SAARC), Pakistani Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said today.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made the remarks while addressing a two-day seminar on
"South Asia' 97 -- Towards a Progressive Economic Union" held in
Pakistan's southern port city of Karachi, the official Associated
Press of Pakistan reported.
</P>
<P>
Referring particularly to the Indo-Pak relations, the minister
said that "if political relations warm up, the economic relations
will automatically improve."
</P>
<P>
Since its birth, SAARC has not made the desired progress due to
political differences among member countries like Pakistan and
India, he added.
</P>
<P>
Countries in the South Asian region, where inhabits one-fifth
of the population of the world, have been offered tremendous
opportunities to work together for mutual benefit by meeting the
demand of consumers, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
He added that considerable progress has been made by the
economies of South Asian countries on their way towards a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
There was need for formation of a strong regional block in this
part of the world to avail maximum profits of inter-trade, Aziz
said.
</P>
<P>
"As a single country we would have limited exports, but as a
regional block we could enhance exports for our mutual benefit,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denies Holding Oslo III Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Osama el-Baz, political advisor to
the Egyptian president, today denied reports on holding Oslo 3
talks with the participation of Israel, the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA), Egypt and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Baz, who is leaving here for a few-day visit to Norway, said
that his visit to Oslo, the Norwegian capital, comes at the
invitation of the Norwegian Foreign Ministry to discuss bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
"Talks in Oslo will deal with the Mideast peace process
developments as well as the Egyptian and Norwegian role in the
peace drive," he added in his departure statement.
</P>
<P>
Baz said that he would not meet with any Palestinian or Israeli
official in Oslo, saying that press reports on Oslo III talks were
"bare of truth."
</P>
<P>
After 14 rounds of secret negotiations under the brokerage of
Norway, the Palestinians and Israelis reached a principled
agreement on Palestinian autonomy in Oslo in August 1993, a
historical breakthrough that gave the peace process new life.
</P>
<P>
The two sides formally signed the Interim Accord, known as the
Oslo II, in Washington in September.
</P>
<P>
Baz noted that four years passed since then but the peace
process is still stalled. "The U.S. and Egypt are exerting sincere
efforts but they are, however, hindered by the measures taken by
the Israeli government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Baz hoped that Israel would ease the closure of the
Palestinian self-rule territories and "fulfill its commitments
regarding the Palestinian Authority."
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the U.S. have been working to ease the economic
sanctions and overall closure Israel imposed on the Palestinians
following a double suicide bombing in a Jewish market in Jerusalem
on July 30 which killed 16 people.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended a
resumption of talks with the PNA on so-called confidence building
measures after the bombing, which deepened a peace-making crisis
that was caused by Israel's launching of a Jewish settlement in
East Jerusalem in March.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The first ever African workshop
on environmental litigation opened here today in a bid to work
out means of protecting the environment and natural resources
using legal means.
</P>
<P>
The one-week workshop organised by Ugadan National
Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) and sponsored by the
United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) drew participants
from judicial officers from Kenya, South Africa, Uganda,
Mozambique, Tanzania and Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Opening the workshop, the attorney general and minister for
justice Bart Katureebe regretted that the subject of
environmental law although not very new in the legal field has
had little emphasis and attention in most African countries.
</P>
<P>
He therefore urged lawyers to prepare ground for creating
legal precedant which has all along been the preserve of natural
scientists.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for sensitisation of law enforcement
agencies of the existance of issues such as environmental crimes.
</P>
<P>
He also regretted that it is still amazing that a policeman on
the street or lawyer who has not been exposed to environmental
law will not appreciate the usefulness of issues such as
protection of wetlands and therefore find it very difficult to
arrest a suspect who has polluted a river and therefore take such
a person to police station or charge him for a criminal offence.
</P>
<P>
The deputy executive director of NEMA Henry Aryamanya Mugisha
streesed the need in his speech for members of the legal
profession to acquaint themselves with the new thinking of
environmental law.
</P>
<P>
He said this will reduce the stress on the judicial system,
which is already overburdened with cases which would otherwise be
settled before the conflicts occur.

sub-regional cooperation for national labour policy formulations
and implementation.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 delegates from 20 English-speaking countries
attended the seminar.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Tayo Fashoyin, director of the ARLAC,
urged African governments to consider harmonising their labour
regulations, industrial relations and movement of workers across
national boundaries to create a common market for the continent.
</P>
<P>
He said the harmonisation of such regulations would provide
Africa with a common framework to achieve a measure of
flexibility in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Of the three main areas that deserve harmonisation, a policy
on the movement of workers has long been overdue despite the fact
that it has posed the greatest challenge to economic integration,
said Fashoyin.
</P>
<P>
He added that the process of articulating a sub-regional
approach to social regulations is a "commendable" one which may
serve as a useful framework for social and economic regulations.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Resume Re-establishing Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Angola's Deputy Minister of
Territorial Administration Higino Carneiro said here today that
the work of re-establishing local power organs in the
UNITA-controlled areas will be resumed in northern Malanje
Province on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The work as one of the major tasks of the Angolan peace
process was started on April 30, but suspended in May because
some UNITA members and their supporters had been engaged in some
counter-activities such as trampling on the national flag and
emblem.
</P>
<P>
Carneiro told reporters after a meeting on re-establishing
local governments held here today that the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) had pledged to cooperate
with the government to ensure the work go on smoothly.
</P>
<P>
According to the government official, the work of
re-establishing local governments will be completed by
mid-October with focus on Angolan border areas.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Help Evacuate Montserrat Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) --- The British government has
expressed its readiness to help evacuate the remaining residents
of the Carribbean island of Montserrat as experts warned that a
massive volcanic eruption was approaching.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the British Foreign Office and the Overseas
Development Office were reportedly holding urgent talks on the
worsening situation in the island, which has been repeatedly
attacked by a series of volcanic eruptions.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman said here today: "With all the smoke
and ash from the volcano, it's impossible to fly."
</P>
<P>
He noted that a ferry service to neighboring islands such as
Antigua was another option for those residents wishing to leave
Montserrat.
</P>
<P>
On the islanders' options of possible final destinations, he
said: "Not everyone wants to go to the UK. Some have gone to the
U.S. where there is a big Montserrat community and others may want
to go to neighboring islands on a temporary basis."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Britain's International Development Minister George
Foulkes said earlier today that the possibility of a "massive,
cataclysmic-intensive eruption" of the volcano could not be ruled
out.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past 24 hours the volcano has become much more
dangerous. As a result we have agreed to this voluntary partial
evacuation of anyone who wants to leave in the wake of this
information," Foulkes said.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the Montserrat Volcano Observatory had warned the
consequences of a possible massive eruption would be disastrous
and anywhere on the island could be significantly threatened.
</P>
<P>
The island's population is sharply down to less than half the
11,000 residents living there before the volcano became active
again in July 1995.

<HEADLINE> HSBC Values Highly Relationship with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) - HSBC's relationship with China is
one of the most important ones it has in the world, claimed John
Bond, the chief executive of HSBC Group.
</P>
<P>
Bond made the remarks during an exclusive interview with Xinhua
recently, saying that "it is a very long relationship which we
value highly".
</P>
<P>
HSBC Holding's Plc is one of the largest banking and financial
services organizations in the world. Its international network
comprised more than 5,000 offices in 78 countries.
</P>
<P>
The Group's total assets at 30 June 1997 were 275 billion pounds
(440 billion US dollars) and increased of 39 billion pounds (52.4
billion US dollars), or 16% since year-end 1996.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent trip to Hongkong, where he chaired a
press conference on Hongkong Bank 1997 Interim Results, Bond said:
"We are delighted with the way the unification has been gone so
smoothly.... the mood there was extremely good."
</P>
<P>
"People are very confident and it is just what Chinese leaders
have always said 'business as usual' and this is what exactly HSBC
expected," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the future relationship with China, Bond said: "We
have a very clear strategy in China; we want to develop our
business there in every way that we can, but clearly in a way that
matches China's economic aspirations."
</P>
<P>
Bond was very pleased that HSBC has been one of the first
foreign banks that have been granted licence to deal RMB in
Shanghai since last March.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on China's monetary and financial policy, Bond said
China is doing RMB business "extremely well"; it is taking a "step
by step" policy which is a "right way to go".
</P>
<P>
Bond stressed : "We understand the policies China adopted,"
saying that "You should walk before you can run."
</P>
<P>
Expressing HSBC's confidence in China's economy, Bond told
Xinhua that "HSBC is going to hold a board meeting in Beijing later
next month, so board members can see China's magnitude of the
achievements brought about by the economic reform policy since
1978."

<HEADLINE> Greece Blames Turkey for Failed Talks on Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Greece today accused Turkey of
being responsible for the failure of the second round of direct
talks between Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash which took place in Switzerland last
week.
</P>
<P>
In an interview in the Athens daily, The News, Greece's Foreign
Undersecretary Yannos Kranidiotis said that the breakdown of the
U.N.-sponsored direct talks in Switzerland between the two leaders
was due not only to Denktash's stance but to the Turkish
government.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Cypriot government had come to the
negotiating table in a "constructive mood," but on the contrary,
the Turkish side participated in the talks with the aim of
stalling the process of Cyprus' accession to the European Union
(EU) as well as the installation of the Russian-made S-300
missiles in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that both Cyprus and Greece, with their consistent
stance, have already made the right impression," he said, adding
that "it is up to the international community to attribute the
blame for the deadlock to the Turkish side and not to equate the
victimizer with the victim."
</P>
<P>
As for the text presented at the talks by U.N. mediator Diego
Cordovez, He said that although the text contained "several weak
points," it nevertheless confirmed the need for the unified and
indivisible sovereignty of the Cypriot Federation.
</P>
<P>
He described this as "a positive and significant developments"
in favor of Greece's positions and policy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kranidiotis also mentioned the role to be played by
U.S. presidential envoy on the Cyprus problem Richard Holbrooke,
saying that the envoy's role should be "supplementary" to that of
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"We expect Mr. Holbrooke to exercise his influence on the
Turkish side so that it cooperates in the international effort to
solve the Cyprus issue based on international principles," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts believe that the crucial period for the
Cyprus problem will be 1998 following the presidential elections
in Cyprus and the beginning of negotiations for Cyprus's accession
to the EU.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
said here today that China is an important country which is full
of promise and her development is a great contribution to the
world.
</P>
<P>
Weizman made the remarks during his meeting with Guo Chaoren,
president of Chinese Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Guo arrived here Sunday heading a Xinhua delegation for a
three-day visit at the invitation of the Israeli foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said that although Israel is located at the western end
of Asia and far from China, he has been watching closely the
development there, noting China is making all efforts to develop
its economy.
</P>
<P>
It is predictable that China will achieve a greater success in
the near future in various fields like industry, agriculture,
science and technology and enter into the 21st century with a new
outlook, Weizman pointed out.
</P>
<P>
This will surely make greater contributions to the peace and
development of the whole world, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Greece Intensifys Border Patrols to Combat Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Greek police and army units have
stepped up patrols along the border with Bulgaria in an effort to
fight against the rising illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The Greek move came following the recent arrest of two members
believed to be a gang that transports illegal immigrants into
Greece from Bulgaria on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
Greek police recently arrested two Turkish nationals near
Promahonas in the northern Serres prefecture with four of their
compatriots. They told Greek police that many Turks were waiting
in southern Bulgaria in an attempt to enter Greece in search of
work.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Greek police and army units have also intensified
patrols in the border areas with both Turkey and Albania in a bid
to stop the increasingly illegal immigrants from entering the
country.

<HEADLINE> Report Finds Link Between Violent Videos, Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A UK Home Office-commissioned
research is expected to establish the first official causal link
between crime and screen violence, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled The Effectiveness of Video Violence on
Young Offenders, to be published in October, is to suggest that
aggressive people are more likely to commit violent acts more
frequently after watching videos than non-aggressive youngsters.
</P>
<P>
The two-year study, which used a sample of 120 aged 15-21
youths, including young offenders, compared the reaction of normal
youths watching video nasties with that of violent and non-violent
offenders.
</P>
<P>
The Study is to show that violent offenders and non-offenders
react differently to violent videos and films, with the former
remembering more details of brutal acts in the movies and
identifying more closely with the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the study will put pressure on the British
government to tighten censorship rules for those believed to be
most easily swayed by depictions of violence in videos.
</P>
<P>
The Home Secretary Jack Straw is also expected to tighten
regulations covering the sale,distribution and screening of films
to make it harder for young people to watch violent movies.
</P>
<P>
Young offenders in institutions could be banned from watching
violent videos, reports said.

UNITED NATIONS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan urged both sides in southern Lebanon "to do their utmost to
prevent a further deterioration of the situation and, in
particular, to refrain from targeting civilians," a UN spokesman
said here today
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general was disturbed at reports of renewed
hostilities in southern Lebanon. He was particularly concerned at
the targeting of civilians, notably the killing of two youths by a
road-side bomb in Kfar Houne and the subsequent shelling of the
town of Sidon, with six reported killed and many more injured,
said Brandt Juan Carlos, associate spokesman for the secretary
general.
</P>
<P>
Israel-backed South Lebanon Army militia fired three rounds of
shells at southern port city Sidon on Monday, killing six
civilians and wounding 34. The shelling was to avenge the killing
of the two youths when an explosive device blew up a vehicle in
the Jezzine area of south Lebanon hours before the shelling in
Sidon, according to local press.

JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- European Union's Mideast envoy
Miguel Moratinos met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Gaza
today on the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on the restricting measures by the Israeli
government against the Palestinians following the July 30 suicide
bombings in west Jerusalem which killed 16 people.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government barred tens of thousands of Palestinians
from working in Israel and stopped transferring funds owed the

crack down on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said that he expected Israel to release the frozen
funds as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the current security cooperation between Israel
and the PNA, Moratinos said that the meeting Sunday night between
Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials in Ramallah went
well and "Israelis are now more satisfied with security matters."
</P>
<P>
At the Ramallah meeting, the Israelis secured Palestinians'
promise of security cooperation while the Palestinians asked
Israel to drop the punitive measures.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reserves Large Medicine Contracts for Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has set aside 40 million
U.S. dollars for the purchase of medicines and medical supplies
from Egypt after the renewal of oil-for-food deal, an Egyptian
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian delegation will visit Baghdad soon to find out
which types of medicines Iraq needs the most, Director of the
state-owned Pharmaceutical Holding Company Galal Ghorab was quoted
by the Egyptian MENA news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, which estimates its medicine needs at 240 million dollars
for this year, will announce an international bid by next week for
the purchase of medicines, he added.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council agreed in June to extend the
oil-for-food agreement allowing Iraq to sell 2 billion dollars in
oil for another six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
During the first stage of the agreement which took effect last
December, Egypt, which is the leading Arab country to call for an
early lift of the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after it's 1990
invasion of Kuwait, became the largest official supplier of aid to
Iraq among the Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Abacha Visits Cote d'Ivoire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's head of state General
Sani Abacha this morning paid a working visit to Cote d'Ivoire
and had closed-door talks with his Ivorian counterpart President
Henri Konan Bedie.
</P>
<P>
According to the British Broadcast Corporation, the visit was
shorter than originally said 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Abacha arrived in the capital Abidjan at around 9:30 a.m. and
left before lunch time, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The whole meeting was totally discreet as the two leaders
talked without the presence of any interpreter.
</P>
<P>
However, since both countries are working together closely in
the ECOWAS Committee of Four on Sierra Leone, observers here
believe how to restore that country's civilian government toppled
in the May 25 coup must have been the focus of their discussions.
</P>
<P>
The committee, made up of Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and
Guinea, is set up by the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) to seek ways to reverse the coup. It has
announced a combination of three measures to settle the issue,
namely, dialogue, sanctions and use of force.
</P>
<P>
To date, the talks between the committee and representatives
of the junta in Sierra Leone has collapsed after the military
regime said it would stay in power until the year 2001. Sanctions
against the junta has since been tightened.
</P>
<P>
The observers noted that Nigeria might be the only member of
the committee keen on military intervention while the other three
countries, particularly Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire, have been urging
caution.
</P>
<P>
They have said everything possible should be done to avoid the
use of force.
</P>
<P>
Cote d'Ivoire is the last country in the committee which
Abacha, the current ECOWAS chairman, has paid a brief visit since
the coup took place in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the Nigerian leader is under some pressure in
dealing with the Sierra Leonean crisis, especially when the
ECOWAS summit is to be held next week.
</P>
<P>
Most observers believe the issue of Sierra Leone will be high
on the agenda of the coming summit of heads of state and
government.

<HEADLINE> Detention of Rwandan Genocide Suspects Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in Arusha, Northern
Tanzaniaa, has extended the detention for another 30 days of four
Rwandan genocide suspects to allow more time for the prosecution
to finalize its investigation.
</P>
<P>
Judge Laity Kama, President of the tribunal, granted the
extension today following the prosecutor's request that the
detention of the four be extended because of the complexity of
the investigations, an ICTR press statement released today said.
</P>
<P>
Granting the request, Judge Kama reminded the prosecution to
ensure that it presents the indictments of the accused as soon as
possible because the rules provide that the period of detention
shall not exceed 90 days, at the end of which, in the event the
indictments are not confirmed, the suspects shall be released.
</P>
<P>
The four suspects are George Ruggiu, a Belgian journalist who
worked with Radio Television Libre des Mille Collines, Aloys
Ntabakuze, a former commander of the para commando battalion of
the Rwandan army, Sylvain Nsabimana, a former prefect of Butare,
and Gratien Kabiligi, a former colonel in the general staff of
the Rwandan army until July 1994.
</P>
<P>
They were arrested in Nairobi, Kenya, exactly a month ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
today issued orders to allow Iranian citizens to visit the holy
sites in Iraq as from September 4, the first time since the
beginning of the eight-year war between the two countries in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at a joint meeting today of the Iraqi
Revolutionary Command Council and the ruling Arab Ba'ath Socialist
Party under the chairmanship of the president.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi news agency today quoted an official spokesman as
saying that the decision conforms to humanitarian principles in
the president's speech on August 8, expressing the good will of
Iraq towards the Iranian people.
</P>
<P>
In the address, Saddam called upon Iran to pursue a policy of
cooperation, stabilization of relations and development of
bilateral ties, on the basis mutual respect and non-interference
in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman expressed the hope that the Iranian visitors will
abide by the related regulations and instructions, and to foil any
attempt of undermining this initiative.
</P>
<P>
He described the Iraqi initiative as constituting a linkage and
good omen for the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has the tombs of Imam Ali Bin Abu Talib, Imam Al Hussein,
and several other holy sites to the Shiite Muslims, who make up
the majority of the Iranian people.
</P>
<P>
One of the most serious residues of this war is the issue of
prisoners of war and those missing-in-action. It constitutes the
prime obstacle in the face of normalization of diplomatic and
political relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> CPDM Won Re-run of Legislative Elections in Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Camerounian supreme court
has in Yaounde today officially proclaimed the final results of
the re-run of the legislative elections in Cameroun on August 3
with the CPDM winning all the seven seats in three
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 12 political parties took part in the re-run of the
legislative elections in the Mayo Banyo division of Adamaoua
province, Mayo Rey division of the North province and the Nde
division of the West province.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Cameroun People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) has
obtained an absolute mojority in the three constituencies winning
all the seven seats as follows: two seats in the Mayo Banyo
division, two seats in the Nde division and three seats in the
Mayo Rey division.
</P>
<P>
The supreme court sitting as the constitutional council also
rejected the petitions sent in by the two major opposition
parties: the Social Democratic Front (SDF) and the National Union
for Democracy and Progess (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
The two parties called for the cancellation of the re-run of
the legislative elections in the Nde and Mayo banyo divisions
respectively due to irregularities during the elections.
</P>
<P>
The supreme court examined the petitions and rejected the
petitions for lacking of evidence.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun's legislative elections were held on May 17
throughout the territory with some 3.7 million voters casting
their votes. About 1000 representatives of 45 political parties
competed for the 180 seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
With the proclamation of the results, the 180 seats in
parliament have been shared by seven political parties.
</P>
<P>
It is certain that only two political parties - the CPDM and
the SDF are having parliamentarian groups in the current
legislature, the UNDP is not going to have a parliamentarian
group since it is two seats short of the minimum 15.

<HEADLINE> Interests Money Go to Both Parties in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A new report by a campaign
reform advocacy group says that in the first half of this year,
the insurance and tobacco industries were the top soft-money
donors to the Republican Party in the United States, while labor
unions and lawyers contributed the most to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
The non-partisan organization Common Cause in a study released
today reports that the Republicans raised a record-setting 23.1
million dollars during the first six months of this year. The
Democrats came in at half that amount with 11.1 million dollars in
contributions.
</P>
<P>
The report says the insurance industry gave about 1.7 million
dollars to the Republicans in the period, just ahead of
contributions from the tobacco interests totaling nearly 1.6
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the Democratic side, unions contributed 934,454 dollars,
while lawyers and lobbyists contributed 817,600 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The hard-to-trace soft money contributions were made to the
political parties by subsidiaries or top executives in the
respective industries. The soft-money donations, made directly to
the parties for party building efforts, often go one way or
another to the individual campaigns in a system that often avoids
detection.
</P>
<P>
There has been increased momentum urging to ban the practice,
though with no success so far.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the top individual soft-money donors
for the Republicans were Mr. and Mrs. Richard DeVos of the Amway
Corp. at 1 million dollars; Philip Morris Co. at 653,715 dollars;
and RJR Nabisco/RJ Reynold's Tobacco at 340,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report says the top individual soft-money donors for the
Democrats were Connell Rice &AMP; Sugar Co. at 200,000 dollars;
Slim-Fast Foods Co. /Thompson Medical Co. at 200,000 dollars; and
the Communication Workers of America at 195,500 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Bombardment Kills 6 Lebanese Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Six Lebanese civilians were
killed and 28 others seriously injured today in shelling by the
Israeli troops and its allied militiamen, the South Lebanon
Army (SLA), the official Lebanese News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead were a one-month-old girl, a six-year-old boy
and a woman, and most of the injured are in serious conditions.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Israeli troops and SLA army today fired six
bombs at southern Lebanese city of Saida, about 40 Kilometers
south of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The attack, which started at 2:25 pm (11:25 GMT) and lasted
until 3:20 pm, is the first time for this port city over the past
years.
</P>
<P>
Israeli radio quoted one Israeli security official as saying
that the attack was launched by SLA, not Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
He added that this is a retaliatory action for the death of two
children, whose father was reportedly one of the SLA's leaders.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, the car carrying the two children was exploded
by the mines on a road in the southern province of Jezzine, a
strip of land officially outside the Israeli-occupied zone but
under the SLA control.
</P>
<P>
But, the Hezbullah, or Party of God, said the two civilians
were killed by the Israeli troops and urged Lebanese government to
take responsibility to protect its citizens from the terrorism
inside the occupied zone as well as outside.

LUSAKA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior official here today
said that the Lusaka city council will soon move in to clear
vendors in an area within 200 metres around a newly opened market
to ensure normal business there.
</P>
<P>
Sonny Mulenga, deputy minister of Lusaka province, made this
declaration after Dez rez complained that the vendors are
violating the contract which stipulates that no vendor should
trade in the area.
</P>
<P>

remove the vendors because they are blocking customers from
entering the biggest market in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Kateka also said that some marketeers have abandoned their new
stands inside the market to come and trade outside, where there
is more business.
</P>
<P>
Mulenga said the problem of vendors surrounding the new market
with 3,000 stalls will be dealt with once and for all, adding
that if they are left to continue their trade, the purpose of
building the expensive market will be defeated.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Criticized for Signing New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's pro-Islamic Welfare
Party (RP) today criticized President Suleyman Demirel for signing
a controversy education reform bill.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in the Parliament, the Deputy
Chairman of RP's Parliamentary Group Salih Kapusuz, accused
Demirel of lacking careful consideration before signing it.
</P>
<P>
Demirel signed the eight-year compulsory education refrom bill
into law last Sunday after the Parliament passed the bill
following a heated debate.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Demirel took the quick action in
order to show his firm support for the Mesut Yilmaz government
and other secularists.
</P>
<P>
Kapusuz said that Cankaya (the presidential palace) made a
mistake by signing the Education Ministry-proposed bill, which
caused great anger among the RP and its supporters.
</P>
<P>
"The president should have shown the same sensitivity to this
bill that he showed to other bills," he added.
</P>
<P>
The eight-year compulsory education reform bill was passed in
the Parliament last Saturday by 277 to 242, marking an initial
victory of the secularist establishment.
</P>
<P>
On the role played by Yilamz over the education reform bill
issue, Kapusuz claimed that the prime minister is adopting a
hostile attitude toward the religious people.
</P>
<P>
He accused the ruling Motherland Party chairman of engaging
in "separatism" in pushing forward his education reform program.
</P>
<P>
The RP parliamentary group leader vowed that RP will apply to
the Constitutional Court, Turkey's supreme judicial organ, to
have the new law annulled.
</P>
<P>
A large number of religious schools have to be closed in
accordance with the new law, which is believed to be a fresh blow
to the conservative Islamists following the forced resigning of
the pro-Islamic Necmettin Erbakan administration in June.
</P>
<P>
Students, if they like, have to finish their eight years
of compulsory education before they enter religious schools where
the Koranic lessons are given.
</P>
<P>
The Yilamz government has repeatedly stated that this
education reform was extremely important for the continuation of
Turkey's democracy and secularist system, saying it would prevent
fundamentalists from expanding in the secular republic.
</P>
<P>
However, RP and its leader Erbakan were greately angered by the
adoption of the controversial education reform bill, threatening
that the party would try every means to block the implementation
of the new law.
</P>
<P>
The military, who calls itself a defender of Turkey's
secularism and democracy, has shown resolute support to Yilmaz
and his government's efforts for the passage of the key bill in
the Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Northern Iraq in Disorder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The northern Iraqi province of
Sulaymaniyah is in a state of disorder resulted from the
activities of various Kurdish parties in the region, local
newspapers and radio stations reported today.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) has arrested 700
citizens for the past week in the province on charges of
collaborating with Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), which is
allied with President Saddam Hussein's army.
</P>
<P>
The Sulaymaniyah province is the last stronghold of the PUK in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The PUK and KDP, the two main Kurdish parties in effective
control of northern Iraq, have clashed for about three years,
largely over duties leveled on oil trucked across the border with
Turkey in violation of U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its
1990 invasion of Kuwait. The duties are the main source of income
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the arrest campaign is still going
on today.
</P>
<P>
Also in the province, a number of boys aging between 7 and 10
years have recently been abducted by elements belonging to the
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has been fighting a
13-year-old separatist war in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The boys will allegedly be trained militarily and be used
in the fighting against Turkish troops.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf
Denktash today condemned the killing of a Turkish Cypriot on the
Greek Cypriot side of the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Cihan Necip Hakyemez, a 38-year-old Turkish Cypriot, was shot
and killed by a masked Greek Cypriot as he was riding a
motorcycle in Limassol, a mixed town of both Greek and Turkish
Cypriots, last Saturday, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Denktash, who has just returned from the failed peace talks
with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides in Switzerland last Week,
maintained that Hakyemez was assassinated by a secret armed Greek
Cypriot gang.
</P>
<P>
"It was also like this in the old times. They would shoot down
everyone they thought was a spy in the mixed towns," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, a small island state in the eastern Mediterranean, has
remained divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded and took over the
northern third of its in the wake of a pro-Athens coup by Greek
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side unilaterally declared the setting up
of the so-called "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983,
which was only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been making efforts for years in a bid
to bring a peace solution to the rival Turkish and Greek Cypriot
communities, but no tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Denktash and Clerides held their second round of
peace negotiations in the Swiss town of Montreux under the
U.N. mediation, but the talks ended in deadlock.

<HEADLINE> Palestine: Egyptian Role Important for Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Nabil Shaath, minister of planning
and international cooperation at the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) said today the Egyptian mediation role is vital
for moving the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
here, Shaath hailed Egypt as "the main pillar for a fair peaceful
solution and restoration of the Palestinian rights."
</P>
<P>
Implementing main terms of reference of the peace process and
the relevant accords signed by parties concerned mark the axis of
Egyptian endeavors, said Shaath.
</P>
<P>
The Moussa-Shaath meeting was held in light of efforts exerted
to stem the deterioration of the peace process and ease the
Israeli-clamped economic siege of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Moussa said by no
means should the terms of reference of the peace process,
including the land-for-peace principle, be given up.
</P>
<P>
"Once such terms are forsaken there is no way to ensure the
implementation of subsequent agreements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said Israel is demolishing peace. "Its policies that
involve siege on Palestinians, starving them out, razing their
homes, and persisting with settlement building -- all pose as the
real danger jeopardizing peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Freezing Palestinian funds and denying Palestinian workers
access to their workplaces stand as manifestations for a war of
starvation and economic siege," Shaath pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-Palestinian coordination is the most efficient way to
save the peace process, he said, asserting that the PNA honors its
security commitments stipulated in the accords signed with Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the PNA rejects the Israeli-imposed demands
to arrest 125 Palestinians on the pretext of fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is carrying out a mass punishment for something
Palestinians have nothing to do with," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has introduced tough security measures against
Palestinians and demanded the PNA to round up suspects since the
double bombings in a Jerusalem market that killed 14 Israeli
civilians on July 30.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said that he discussed with Moussa the future of the
peace process in light of the prospective visit by U.S. Secretary
of State Medeleine Albright which he regards as an important one
highly evaluated by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the U.S. have been working to ease the economic
sanctions and overall closure Israel imposed on the Palestinians
following the bombings.

<HEADLINE> Kabila Willing to Mediate in Congo's Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- President Laurent Kabila of the
Democratic Republic of Congo has offered to mediate in the crisis
in the Congo Republic, according to Radio Cameroun here today.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said that he has made a series of proposals to solve
the Congo crisis after Congolese President Pascal Lissouba met
him in Kinshasa recently.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the decision by Kabila, Gabonese President Omar
Bongo who has been mediating in the crisis said he will continue
with his mediating efforts, adding that what is important for
Congo today is peace no matter where it comes from.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese crisis started on June 5 when the government
forces loyal to President Lissouba tried to disarm the "Cobra"
militia of former president Sassou Nguesso. Continuous fighting
has killed some 3,000 people over the past two months.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Technical Committee on Kuwait POWs Meets, No Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A technical sub-committee
including members from Kuwait, Iraq and nations of the 1991 Gulf
War held their 25th monthly meeting on Kuwaiti POWs today on the
Kuwaiti-Iraqi borders, but no results were achieved.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by representatives from Kuwait,
Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the United States, Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
Previous meetings had also ended in failure due to differences
on the Prisoners of War issue from both Kuwait and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait claimed that more than 600 Kuwaitis and third country
nationals were brought to Iraq at the end of the Gulf War in 1991
and have been detained in Iraqi jails while Baghdad denied.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Kuwaiti National Committee for Missing
and POWs Affairs said that the committee members discussed the
"proposed agenda" and decided to hold the 26th meeting on the
Iraqi part of the Kuwait-Iraqi border on September 24, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the previous meetings, Iraq acknowledged taking along with
withdrawing troops some POWs to Iraq, but saying it possessed no
fresh knowledge of their whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad alleged that a number of the Kuwait POWs had gone
missing during a popular uprising that broke out in southern
Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The POWs' issue has been one of the key factors hindering
any improvement of relations between Kuwait and Iraq within
the context of an Arabic reconciliation drive in which Kuwait
started to restore normal ties this year with countries such
as Jordan, Sudan and Yemen who sided with Iraq during the
war.

<HEADLINE> Students Stage Demonstration in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- At least 30 students were
arrested by the military authorities and two were feared being
killed in a protest demonstration today in Freetown, the capital
of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, the State Radio,
which is controlled by the junta in power, has not released any
concrete figures, but a spokesman of the junta admitted that the
military had taken some measures to "contain" the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also accused the students of wounding soldiers
who were heavily armed on security mission.
</P>
<P>
"The students are armed with AK47s we have too", he said,
adding that the soldiers had to take the students away.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, the current highest
governing body of Sierra Leone, refused Sunday to grant
permission for the demonstration proposed for today, threatening
to clamp down.
</P>
<P>
But one of the leaders behind today's students' protest denied
the demonstration posed any threat to the situation of the
country charged by the army, saying that it was a peaceful
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
He said the students were only trying to stop blood shedding
in the country and did not prepare to take arms.
</P>
<P>
As the next step, the organizers of the demonstration will
call on all Sierra Leoneans to stay in house instead of going out
to work.
</P>
<P>
In Bo, the second largest city of Sierra Leone, students
echoed their colleagues in Freetown and also went out to the
streets for demonstration.
</P>
<P>
The students called on the military junta to go and demanded
the return of ousted president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
After marching for a while, they came face to face with the
heavily armed soldiers and police, and sat down in the street
peacefully, only to be dispersed quickly.
</P>
<P>
The students later re-grouped in another part of the town and
were once again chased away by the combined security forces.
</P>
<P>
No clashes were reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sierra Leoneans on exile in neighboring Guinea were
also meeting at a gathering today to call for the restoration of
Kabbha.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration in front of the Sierra Leonean embassy in
Conakry, capital of Guinea, went on peacefully.
</P>
<P>
While the demonstrators were marching around the embassy,
another demonstration organized by a group calling itself as the
Movement for the Restoration of Democracy was also happening
right in the embassy compound.
</P>
<P>
This group called for the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) to help reinstate Kabbah's government by any
means necessary.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Newspapers Denounce Israeli Massacre in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Syrian newspapers denounced
today the massacre committed by Israeli forces in the Lebanese
port city of Sidon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces, together with the pro-Israeli South Lebanon
Army (SLA), shelled Monday the Lebanese port city of Sidon
inhabited by 200,000 Lebanese, killing nine people and wounding 43
others.
</P>
<P>
"This massacre indicates that Israel has adopted a strategy to
push the region into further catastrophes," Syrian newspaper
Teshreen said today.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that Israel, under the Netanyahu government
would not hesitate to commit all sorts of crimes.
</P>
<P>
Al-Baath, mouthpiece of the Syrian ruling party Arab Baath
Socialist Party, pointed out today that the new Israeli massacre
is not remote from the Qana massacre on April 18, 1996 when
Israeli forces shelled a camp of the U.N. peace-keeping forces in
south Lebanon, killing about 110 Lebanese civilians and wounding
150 others in addition to 15 soldiers belonging to the
U.N. peace-keeping forces.
</P>
<P>
Newspaper Al-thawrah today called on the U.S. Administration to
exercise its political and moral responsibilities by reminding
Netanyahu and other Israeli extremists that it is impossible to
combine peace with occupation, and that the establishment of peace
does primarily require abiding by the principle of complete
withdrawal from occupied Arab territories and returning land and
rights to their legitimate owners.

MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Flash floods brought about by
monsoon rains have claimed at least four lives and rendered
thousands of others homeless in the northern and central

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Communities Urged to Settle Their Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Special Envoy for
Cyprus, Sir David Hannay has urged the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities to make a contribution toward a settlement to the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting in an interview with London Greek Radio
on the two rounds of U.N.-led direct talks between the Greek
and Turkish sides, aimed at reaching a comprehensive solution to
the protracted Cyprus problem, according to Cyprus News Agency
today.
</P>
<P>
The second round of talks, ended in failure last Friday
in Glion-sur-Montreux, Switzerland, followed the first round of
face-to-face talks, held in Troutbeck, near New York from July
9 to 12.
</P>
<P>
Hannay told the radio that the two rounds of direct talks
were not put to the best possible use, but said a work
program will go ahead this autumn as neither President Glafcos
Clerides nor Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash had a problem
with this.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process is now going to move into a new gear
with the working by the U.N., in consultation with the two
parties, on the actual legal texts that will be needed for a
settlement," the British envoy added, noting they will cover
issues such as a draft constitution, territorial adjustments,
arrangements for security matters, refugees and compensation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that negotiations on these texts will
begin in March 1998, after the presidential elections in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that both Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leader
Denktash have an important role to play in efforts for a solution,
but said "they have got to be satisfied through the process of
negotiations that their fundamental needs and requirements are
being taken account of as those of the other side."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkey sent troops and took over the
northern third in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been continuing
their efforts to reunite this island nation as a bi-communal,
bi-zonal federation despite repeated failure in peace talks for
past 23 years.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Favor Bed Net to Control Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- After nearly 100 years of
research and control efforts worldwide, malariologists have come
to the conclusion that the age-old bed net may be the only way to
control malaria, Press Trust of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
Bed net treated with insecticide is the key to controlling
malaria, which is spreading to all corners of the world, said
scientists attending a global meeting on parasitic diseases in
Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
There is no vaccine that is ready to use and drugs are becoming
useless at a fast rate, the scientists said, adding that
eradicating malaria is not easy and the malaria parasite has
become resistant even to some latest drugs.
</P>
<P>
They said bed nets impregnated with synthetic pyrethroids offer
personal protection and reduce mortality.
</P>
<P>
"In China, malaria incidence dropped by 92 percent after large
scale use of impregnated bed nets," PTI quoted an eminent
scientist as saying.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said that malaria, which is killing about 1.5
million people annually worldwide, has marched into highlands of
Africa and the newly independent states of the former soviet
union.
</P>
<P>
They said that trials carried out with impregnated bed nets in
Africa, Brazil and some parts of India have shown their utility.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Roman-Jewish Battle Site Excavated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Evidence of the harrowing
battle for Yodfat in 67 B.C. during the great revolt against
the Roman has been uncovered in a current archeological dig, The
Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
On the painted floor of a luxurious mansion in Galilee region
in northern Israel, the excavators found the remains of a human
surrounded by arrowheads, vivid testimony to the last moments
after the Roman army broke into the city it had besieged for 47
days.
</P>
<P>
The remains of some 30 other victims, evidently reburied by
returning Jews years after the city's destruction, were found at
the bottom of a cistern which had been converted into a mass
grave.
</P>
<P>
The mansion, according to archeologist Motti Aviam of the
Antiquities Authority, contains exceptionally well preserved wall
murals similar to - perhaps superior to - those found from the
period in Massada and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
An unusual feature of the building was that the floor of the
central room in which the murals were located was also painted
in geometric design, apparently indicating that the building's
occupants walked there barefoot. It was in this room that the
body and arrowheads were found.
</P>
<P>
Yodfat was the first sizable city captured by the Romans in
their march on Jerusalem. It was the headquarters of Josephus,
who had been dispatched to the Galilee by the leaders of the
revolt in Jerusalem to organize the defenses in the north.
</P>
<P>
He survived the battle to become the great historian of the
period. It is from his own works that the story of the
battle for Yodfat became known.
</P>
<P>
The excavations at Yodat, now in their sixth season, are
being conducted by Aviam and Professor William Scott Green of the
University of Rochester in New York.

<HEADLINE> Chinese-Bangladesh Defense Chiefs Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian has expressed hope that Sino-Bangladesh friendship and
cooperation in various fields will continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
Chi made the comments this morning during a meeting this
morning with Bangladesh Defense Secretary Quazi Munjur-I-Mowla.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who also serves as a state councillor and vice-chairman of
China's Central Military Commission, said that China and
Bangladesh are close neighbors and that the both developing
countries share an unshakeable friendship based on brotherly love.
</P>
<P>
Chi noted the constant high-level visits between high-ranking
political and military leaders from the two countries and the fact
that both share either identical or similar views on major
international issues.
</P>
<P>
The development of friendship and cooperation between China and
Bangladesh and their respective armed forces is not only in the
fundamental interests of the people of both countries, but also
conducive to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific Region and
the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Chi recounted his 1989 visit to Bangladesh and praised the
Bangladesh people for their bravery and spirit of hard work. He
noted that China and Bangladesh share a long history and brilliant
culture, and added that China can learn a lot from its friendly
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Chi said Mowla's visit will greatly enhance the development of
friendship and cooperation between the two sides. He also
expressed his appreciation for Bangladesh's just position on
issues such as human rights and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China adheres to the principle that state-to-state
relations should be guided by the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence, and that countries are equal, regardless of
whether they are big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor.
</P>
<P>
Mowia spoke highly of the Sino-Bangladesh friendship and
expressed his hope for a great success of the forthcoming 15th
National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Mowla said the goal of his visit to China is to further develop
bilateral ties and cooperation, and expressed his confidence that
the two sides will continue to increase exchanges and enhance

<HEADLINE> China Expects Breakthrough in State Sector Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- China is expecting a major
breakthrough in reform of state-owned enterprises as it opens its
arms wider to the shareholding system.
</P>
<P>
Although the shareholding practice currently is being piloted
in only a few large- and medium-sized firms, it will be spread and
will lead to fundamental changes in the nation's state sector,
according to sources at the State Commission for Restructuring the
Economy (SCRE).
</P>
<P>
Economists say that China can count on a boom period for
shareholding, since a few Chinese provinces, including
southeastern Jiangsu and Anhui, and the northern Hebei Province,
have charted their timetables for transforming the state sector.
</P>
<P>
Since China launched the shareholding plan in the early 1980s,
the practice has been successful. But it also met with opposition
and some critics labeled it privatization.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the number of shareholder firms which evolved from
former state ventures, large- and medium-sized ones in particular,
has hovered around 9,000 since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Tensions eased recently when the state leaders clearly defined
shareholding as a good way to achieve public ownership, and an
enterprise system which may be taken in either a capitalist or a
socialist country.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, in a speech at the Party School
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in
May, called for bolder moves to be taken in economic reform.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China is still in the primary stage of
socialism and the reform drive should be conducive to boosting
the economy, increasing overall national strength, and improving
people's living standard.

<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese economists have envisioned a rosy future for the once
inert state sector, saying the state enterprises will become more
vigorous and competitive since shareholding may wipe away some
deep-rooted stumbling blocks to high economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the shareholding system has displayed its worth in
past experiments. According to managers of the pilot enterprises,
the shareholding practice had an immediate positive effect on
economic efficiency and reducing the asset-to-liability ratio of
the transformed enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"It also liberated the pilot state ventures from the
administrative influence, encouraged them to be market-oriented
and facilitated the establishment of a modern enterprise system in
response to a market economy," a company official said.
</P>
<P>
Fundamental changes also took place in those transformed state
enterprises since their assets had clear and various ownerships,
instead of sole state ownership.
</P>
<P>
The firms are also characterized by democratic management: the
board of directors, board of supervisors, and the general managers
assume their own responsibilities, compared with the past practice
of having everything decided by the government.
</P>
<P>
The shareholding firms will also operate more easily, as they
may raise the much-needed funds on the capital market. This makes
them more publicly-owned than ever, since it will be common for
the individuals to have a stake in the enterprises, with the state
holding a dominant percent of shares.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a salient feature of the newly-defined public
ownership in the future," said an economist.
</P>
<P>
But the government is aiming higher. Transforming state
ventures into shareholding firms has to be standardized in line
with the Corporate Law, said officials of the SCRE.
</P>
<P>
The board of directors, supervisors, and the shareholders
shouldn't be just figureheads, they must play an active role in
managing the transformed businesses, they stressed.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Condemns Israeli Shelling in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel Meguid today denounced the "Israeli massacre" in
southern Lebanon Monday claiming lives of innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, Meguid said that the
"continued Israeli aggression on Lebanon's sovereignty, territorial
integrity and security" will not deter the Lebanese people from
resisting Israel's occupation of the south.
</P>
<P>
"Resisting occupation is a legitimate action acknowledged by
the international law and human rights declaration," according to
the league's chief.
</P>
<P>
Meguid urged the international community, including the U.N.
Security Council, the EU and the co-sponsors of the peace process,
to move immediately to denounce Israel's attack and force it to
implement U.N. Resolution 425 which demands the withdrawal of Israeli
troops from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, The Lebanese government today lodged
an urgent complaint with the International Committee Monitoring
the Ceasefire of the April Understanding, denouncing Israel's
violation of the understanding when it shelled civilian targets in
broad daylight Monday, away from military installations.
</P>
<P>
Six civilians were killed and 36 wounded in fierce shelling
Monday in the bloodiest attack on the southern port city of Sidon
since the end of a major Israeli offensive in south Lebanon in
April 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army said the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA)
in the occupation zone, not Israeli troops, were behind the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 Israeli troops have held a border occupation in a
self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon since 1985, in
defiance of U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chairman: Peace in Congo (B) Still Hopeful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe said
today hopes for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Congo
Brazzaville have not faltered despite the violation of a
cease-fire agreement reached by the warring parties on July 13.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean President who doubles as Chairman of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), and Congolese Foreign
Minister Destin Alsene Tsaty-Boungou both said peace is necessary
to ensure development.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who is leading the peace initiative for Congo (B),
said here, "we want to see the Republic of Congo develop in a
peaceful way."
</P>
<P>
Interviewed today after delivering a message to Mugabe from
President Pascal Lissouba, Tsaty-Boungou also said it was hoped
Congo (B) would have a government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese foreign minister said, "we would like to have a
government of national unity with members from the majority and
the Opposition."
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire agreement has been violated with troops
exchanging sporadic gunfire and mortar bombs.
</P>
<P>
Former Congolese strong man Denis Sassou-Nguesso last month
rejected a draft plan for peace between his militia and forces
loyal to Lissouba.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 5,000 people have been killed on weeks of fighting that
broke out in June when the government sought to disarm
Sassou-Nguesso's militia, ahead of the postponed presidential
elections.

<HEADLINE> Earliest Chinese Characters Found in Shandong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists have discovered
what they believe are the oldest Chinese characters ever written
in the country inscribed on oracle bones dating back some 4,000
years, according to the People's Daily today.
</P>
<P>
The two inscriptions were written nearly a millennium earlier
than the famous inscriptions on tortoise shells and ox bones that
were found in the Yin Ruins, the site of the capital city of the
late Shang Dynasty (16-11th Century BC), the experts said.
</P>
<P>
The newly-found inscriptions were found on two pieces of oracle
bones in the bottom of a large sacrificial pit, from which 356
pieces of pottery, stone, shell and bone ware were unearthed in
Huantai County, in east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Though they have not deciphered all the characters, the experts
are confident that the two inscriptions are from the same origin.
</P>
<P>
From a site nearby, bronzeware bearing inscriptions which date
to the Shang Dynasty have also been found. Experts cited these as
the oldest inscriptions ever found on bronzeware,
</P>
<P>
The experts dated the inscriptions on oracles bones back to the
Longshan culture, which was after local Dawenkou culture, which is
renowned for its matriarchal society, in which the male sex is
worshiped.
</P>
<P>
In the Dawenkou society, according to the newspaper, women
worshiped the male reproductive organ, as evidenced in a recent
find at which a tortoise head was laid on the breast of a woman in
a tomb from some 6,000 years ago. The tomb was located in the
Lizhai archaeological site, which is two kilometers from the site
where the ancient oracle bone inscriptions were discovered.

<HEADLINE> Crackdown on Illegal Commissions for Pharmaceuticals Strengthened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A national crackdown on both
soliciting and offering illegal kickbacks for pharmaceuticals has
yielded initial results.
</P>
<P>
The State Council decided to launch a major crackdown in May of
last year to bring an end to rampant nationwide unlawful
activities which disrupted market order, corrupted medical
professionals, sparked rising prices for pharmaceuticals and
supported the production of substandard or counterfeit
pharmaceutical products.
</P>
<P>
Since then, over 4,400 cases involving the illegal kickbacks
were reported to departments concerned, of which over 2,700 have
been dealt with, and 2,019 have been concluded, according to a
press conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
Of the cases, 664 are considered serious, since they either
involve individuals each giving or receiving illegal commissions
worth over 10,000 yuan (1,204.8 US dollars), or units each giving
or receiving kickbacks of over 100,000 yuan, according to
information from the press conference jointly held by several
central government departments.
</P>
<P>
It was also announced that reporters should give national media
exposure to 15 extremely serious cases.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence of their illegal acts, several pharmaceutical
companies, department stores, and hospitals were fined, five
persons were imprisoned for terms ranging six to 14 years, and
three others received administrative warnings.
</P>
<P>
In the most serious case, Du Yunyun, a chief pharmacist of a
railway hospital in Beijing, was sentenced to 14 years
imprisonment for receiving commissions of over 170,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Over 20,000 cases of producing fake or substandard medicine,
and over 9,000 unauthorized medicine dealers were punished,
according to the press conference.

said one contributory factor was the rising jet fuel price which
went up twice since last year.
</P>
<P>
"Landing and navigation fees have also gone up. Zimbabwean
aviation authorities recently introduced navigation fees and the
range of our domestic operations is fairly wide," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesmen said there had been increases in salaries, crew
expenses and catering costs.
</P>
<P>
ZEX, a private airline set up two years ago, was the first
indigenous venture to compete with the national airline, Air
Zimbabwe, which is soon to be privatized.
</P>
<P>
A third airline, Expedition Airlines, started operating in
July this year.

<HEADLINE> Australia To Support Fiji Return To Commonwealth: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer announced today in Fiji that Australia supports
the country's bid to rejoin the Commonwealth and said the
embarrassing leak of a secret Australian report would not harm the
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Downer arrived in the Fiji capital city of Suva today for two
days of meetings with the Fiji government, attempting to improve
their relationship following a recent secret paper scandal.
</P>
<P>
Some copies of secret Australian briefing papers, which
described Fiji Foreign Minister Berenado Vunibobo as disappointing
and temperamentally volatile, was left unattended outside a
meeting of South Pacific Forum Economic Ministers in July in
Australia. The papers were obtained by a Reuter correspondent and
published soon after.
</P>
<P>
Fiji had planned to lodge a formal complaint over the report,
which also criticized other Pacific island nations' ministers for
being drunk and corrupt, but today the mood was conciliatory.
</P>
<P>
Fiji Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka offered strong support for
Australian Prime Minister John Howard, saying he thought of him
like an older brother, and asked Downer to leave Fiji with
positive views of the region.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in a canoe that we can go away in this part of the
world," Rabuka was quoted today by the Australian Associated Press
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are forever tied to the affairs of our neighbors, we will
have to interact with each other," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Also today, in an address to a meeting of the Fiji Australia
Business Council, Downer said two way trade between the two
countries rose by 27 percent since 1995, to nearly 590 million
U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also opened today in Suva a three-day
meeting of leading Australian diplomats in the South Pacific
countries.
</P>
<P>
"I have reiterated the continuing importance Australia attaches
to long term constructive bilateral relations with the Pacific
island countries," the foreign minister said in a statement on the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Australia will continue to support Pacific island governments
in their development of improved economic and resource management
policies, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Australia's development assistance to the region in 1997/1998
(the fiscal year starting on July 1, 1997), has been maintained at
previous levels (92 million U.S. dollars) despite budget cuts in
other areas.
</P>
<P>
Fiji was possessed by Britain on October 10, 1874, and remained
a British colony until it gained independence on October 10, 1970,
as a state within the Commonwealth. Fiji's strongman Rabuka
declared Fiji a republic on October 1, 1987. At a meeting in
Canada that year, the Commonwealth Heads of Government formally
declared that Fiji's membership of Commonwealth had lapsed.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Government Forces Take Ranariddh's Last </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian government forces
claimed today they had captured the town of O'Smach, the last
major stronghold held by loyalists of Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
But the prince and his followers denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
Chief of General Staff of the Cambodian Royal Army Ke Kimyan
said in Phnom Penh that the town fell to government forces at
about 1:00 p.m. (0600 GMT) today.
</P>
<P>
Casualties of both sides were still unknown, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Ranariddh's military commander and former
Deputy Commander of the Royal Army Nheuk Bun Chhay fled to
Thailand long ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Ranariddh argued in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand,
that the town was still in his hands.
</P>
<P>
O'Smach, a town near the Thai border, was the last major
stronghold held by troops loyal to Prince Ranariddh, who had been
ousted from office by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen in the July 6
bloody fighting.
</P>
<P>
Since then, part of the prince's supporters began fighting the
government troops, but were pushed back from the capital to the
Thai border.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen ordered government forces to seize O'Smach by August
15. But the uphill town and the land mine-filled jungle around it
made the task extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, more than 20,000 Cambodians, mainly women and
children, fled the town into Thailand to escape the heavy fighting.
</P>
<P>
Thai authorities said on Monday that they opened gates at a
checkpoint on the border and allowed the refugees to enter.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Consumer Price Index Unchanged in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Canadian consumers saw an annual
price increase of 1.8 percent for the goods and services included
in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket in July, Statistics
Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
The annual consumer price rise was identical to the increase
noted in June, the federal statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, transportation charges have risen
considerably, with significant price increases noted for auto
insurance, air travel and new car purchases.
</P>
<P>
Prices for food, utilities, education, alcohol, tobacco, rental
accommodation and clothing also saw some increases.
</P>
<P>
In the same time, "lower mortgage interest charges continued to
benefit consumers," the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
Other items that cost less than last July included: computers,
audio and video equipment, household appliances, furniture and
tools.
</P>
<P>
Lower prices for new cars, gasoline, clothing, footwear and
beer were offset by higher prices for air travel, traveler
accommodation and food, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Lodges Complaint Against Israeli Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has filed a complaint
with the five-nation ceasefire monitoring committee to accuse
Israel of violating the ceasefire understanding and targeting
attack at civilians, the Lebanese Orient Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move came after Monday's bombardment on the southern
Lebanese city of Saida by Israeli troops and its militia ally, the
South Lebanese Army (SLA), in which six people were killed and 45
others wounded.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the radio said Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas
fired at 7:05 am (4:05 GMT) about 30 Katyusha rockets at the
Israeli troops and SLA positions in the north of the buffer zone
in south Lebanon, wounding a woman.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square kilometer "security zone"
in 1985 allegedly to ward off cross-border guerrilla infiltrations
into its northern settlements.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the Katyusha attack
and said in its statement today that this is the response to the
Israeli massacre of civilians.
</P>
<P>
The heavy fighting between Hezbollah guerrillas and Israeli
troops and the SLA took place after the bombing of a car in
southern Lebanon which killed the son and daughter of former SLA
security chief Assad Nasr.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the SLA accused Hezbollah of carrying out the
bombing, and in turn launched a sudden strike upon Saida, which is
outside the "security zone" and hasn't been under attack for more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Beirut said that the fighting is most likely to
continue until the delegates of the ceasefire monitoring
committee, comprising of representatives from the US, France,
Syria, Lebanon and Israel, meet to discuss the complaints lodged
by Lebanon and Israel.

YAOUNDE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- An inter-urban train from
Yaounde en-route to Douala derailed Sunday close to Binguele
station, some 30 kilometers from Yaounde, Cameroun Tribune
reported today.
</P>
<P>
All passengers survived the accident but three people, the
driver and his assistant, and one passenger were wounded.
</P>
<P>
They were sent to the national social insurance fund hospital
in Yaounde, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun's Transport Minister Jean Bokam went to the area
where the accident occurred to assess the damage.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at about 12:15 a.m. Sunday, when the
engine-bearing cabin suddenly skidded off the rail, bringing the
journey to Douala, the economic center of the country, to an
abrupt halt, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the railway corporation said it is difficult to
figure out the cause of the accident now and they claimed that
this would be resolved when a team of engineers return after
probe from the area.
</P>
<P>
Four hours after the accident, the railway line, the busiest
in the country especially for goods, was reopened.
</P>
<P>
Passengers on the derailed train continued their journey to
Douala on another train after engineers working throughout the
night cleared the coaches.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Output Increases in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Total crude oil output of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) increased by
some 60,000 barrels per day (bpd) in July, according to a market
survey reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's July output averaged 26.44 million bpd, compared with
26.38 million bpd a month ago, the Middle East Economic
Survey (MEES) showed.
</P>
<P>
The oil output in July was about 1.4 million bpd above OPEC's
self-imposed production ceiling of 25.033 million bpd, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Lower production in Nigeria, mainly as a result of temporary
problems in its production and export system, was counterbalanced
by increased output in Venezuela, Kuwait, Iran and Saudi Arabia,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that a substantial increment is expected
to be added to OPEC output this month following the restart of
Iraqi exports last week.

<HEADLINE> No Evidence of Corrupt Acts Inside EU: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- European Commission's (EC)
deputy spokesman Vale de Almeida said today that the EC has found
no evidence of flawed or corrupt actions occurring within its
security bureau.
</P>
<P>
De Almeida made the remark at a press briefing following
allegations by the local Flemish newspaper Morgen (The Morning
Post) on Monday that irregularities, if not corrupt acts, were
spotted from the European Commission's security bureau, where an
official has been removed from the commission's staff car section.
</P>
<P>
De Almeida said the commission, the executive body of the
15-nation European Union, is taking the allegations seriously.
</P>
<P>
The commission is making inquiries to establish that there is
nothing more than the reported irregularities that occurred during
earlier transactions between the security bureau and the security
contractor, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told the press that a certain amount of money was
refunded to the commission in early 1993 after a miscalculation,
which he described as a technical irregularity, was found in a
transaction between the security bureau and the contractor.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman declined to disclose how much money was involved.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on an allegation that 18 people were on
the permanent payroll of the security contractor, who could
reportedly be using the money overpaid by the commission, the
spokesman said that investigations so far have not found any
unjustified payments.
</P>
<P>
When asked why they were not renewing the contract with the
same contractor when the current contract expires at the end of
this year, the spokesman explained that commission security
affairs are now open for tender with new contracts expected to be
signed in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The security contractor of the commission has been providing
routine and special security measures on occasions like the visits
by United States President Bill Clinton and Palestine leader
Yasser Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Ministry Launches Campaign Against Tooth Decay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- China's Health Ministry will
start a campaign against tooth decay on September 20, which is
National Tooth Day, in 11 provinces and autonomous regions which
the Red Army crossed during the Long March (1934-1935).
</P>
<P>
The activity, known as "The New Long March for the Prevention
and Control of Tooth Decay," will be carried out in more than 40
counties in Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan,
Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi provinces and Ningxia Hui and Guangxi
Zhuang autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the year-long activity, which is jointly-organized
by the Health Ministry and the national Committee for Oral Health
(NCOH), is to improve oral hygiene in China's rural areas, said
Yin Dakui, vice-minister of health.
</P>
<P>
The major tasks of the activity include establishing
anti-tooth-decay networks in the local medical organizations,
spreading information about oral hygiene among the local people
and providing dental equipment and oral health care products to
these areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NCOH will provide hygiene materials and handbooks to poor
areas and send experts there to give instruction.
</P>
<P>
"The activity will promote the development of the national oral
health care, and will take us one step closer to the goal of basic
oral hygiene for all by the year 2000," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> EU Mourns Civilian Deaths in Lebanon, Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union today
mourned for 10 civilians who were killed during bombings in
Lebanon and Israel, a press release here said.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry spokesman from Luxembourg, which is serving
the six-month rotating presidency of the 15-nation union, appealed
to both sides to respect the ceasefire agreement reached in April
1996, which called for an end to attacks on civilians.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire ended 17 days of fighting between the Lebanese
and Israelis in that region.
</P>
<P>
"The bombardment against Saida and Jezzine in Lebanon and
against Kyriat Schmonah in Israel on Monday resulted in 10 deaths
and dozens of injured among the civilian population," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The attack was the bloodiest against Lebanese civilians in more
than a year. Artillery shells were reportedly fired by pro-Israel
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
The shells were fired from Jezzine, an enclave that lies north
of the security zone that the Israeli army and its Lebanese allies
occupy in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The attacks were launched in retaliation for a roadside bombing
that killed three Lebanese civilians also on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the last nine days no less than 25 people, more than half of
them civilians, were killed in the region.

FREETOWN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- One student died in a
shoot-out between security forces and a group of protesting
students at the campus of a nursing school in the capital
Freetown here Monday, the State Radio said Today.
</P>

Two university students and a local fisherman were arrested in
different parts of the city for carrying firearms and other

President of the college's student union Yosuf Bah told Xinhua
in an interview, "my colleagues could be cautious in resisting

"It can cost us our lives as I don't believe that students
should take to the streets to demonstrate their protest against a
well-armed military regime," Bah warned.

<P>
In another development, the military regime has appealed to
the Guinean government to reopen the Sierra Leone embassy in
Conakry, one day after it was closed following unauthorized
demonstrations by pro-democracy Sierra Leone refugees.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement broadcast over State Radio, the
regime said it "frowns on the behaviors of these Sierra Leoneans
who have taken undue advantage of the hospitality of the friendly
people of Guinea."

<HEADLINE> China's Leading Banker Lauds Financial Sector Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- China's financial sector has
experienced steady and sound development since the 14th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1992 and the central
bank will remain committed to a moderately tight monetary policy
for a period of time, according to a senior banking official.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, the
central bank, said in an interview with Xinhua that the steady and
healthy development of China's financial sector is reflected in
several aspects.
</P>
<P>
First of all, the financial macro-control capability has
markedly strengthened, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the implementation of the moderately tight monetary
policy and the use of a basket of financial tools to regulate the
money supply, the annual growth rate of the supply of broad money,
known as M2, which is the combination of cash in circulation plus
all types of deposits, dropped from 34.4 percent in 1994 to 25.2
percent last year. This year the rate is expected to be less than
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that, over the past five years, the framework of a
financial legal system has basically taken shape, which has in
turn effectively helped improve financial supervision.
</P>
<P>
The financial legal system consists of the Law on the People's
Bank of China, which is considered the centerpiece, and the
Commercial Bank Law, the Insurance Law and the Bill Law. It also
includes some more-detailed rules and regulations such as the
Provisional Rules on the Management of Bank Credits, the
Provisions on the Management of Financial Institutions, the
General Rules on Loans, the Provisional Rules on the Management of
Sponsoring Banks, and the Provincial Rules on the Management of
Credit Card Business.
</P>
<P>
The enactment and implementation of the laws and rules have
provided a guarantee for the divided operation and management of
business in banking, securities, insurance and trust, and thereby
helped improve the financial order, Dai said.

<P>
Over the years the central bank has considered curbing
inflation as its prime task, adhered to a moderately tight
monetary policy and properly conducted financial macro-control,
thereby allowing the monetary policy to play a due role in the
country's overall macro-control effort, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
The financial situation so far this year has been stable and
healthy, as reflected by a reasonable growth of the money supply
and an increase of lending that has basically met the requirements
of economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that right now and in the next period of time the
central bank will continue to follow the moderately tight monetary
policy and, at the same time, make appropriate fine-tunings of
macro control and improve the quality of financial services in
order to facilitate the sustained, rapid and healthy development
of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The state banks must strictly control their loan portfolio and
effectively improve cash management, Dai pointed out.
</P>
<P>
While focusing support on state-owned enterprises, the state
banks should also reasonably satisfy the requirements for credits
of enterprises with different types of ownership, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dai added that while concentrating its support on some large
and medium-sized enterprises, the state banks should also, in line
with industrial policies, support the development of competitive
small enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The state banks should also support inter-enterprise
cooperation, help to nurture industrial conglomerates, and
facilitate strategic restructuring of enterprises in different
economic zones, the governor urged.
</P>
<P>
Provisions for bad loans in the state banks should be well
managed in accordance with relevant rules and regulations in order
to support enterprises' merger, bankruptcy and re-employment of
the laid-offs, he said.

<P>
The central bank governor listed the increasingly deepening of
financial reforms as another major achievement in the financial
sector in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Reform in the state-owned commercial banks has accelerated over
the years. At the same time, three policy-oriented banks -- the
State Development Bank, the Export and Import Bank of China, and
the Agricultural Development Bank of China -- have been founded to
take over the policy-directed business from the state banks.
</P>
<P>
In addition, urban cooperative banks are being set up in 100
selected cities whereas rural credit cooperatives are being
reformed, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
The measures already taken have combined to contribute to the
formation and perfection of a setup of financial organizations led
by the People's Bank of China, with the state-owned commercial
banks as the major players.
</P>
<P>
Over the recent years China has also established a foreign
exchange market and an interbank money market, started the open
market operation on a trial basis, and made the yuan, the national
currency, convertible for current-account transactions.
</P>
<P>
The recent years have also withnessed a successful and
continuous opening of the financial sector to the rest of the
world, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
To date 23 cities and the island province of Hainan, which is
also a special economic zone, have been approved as pioneer places
where overseas financial institutions are allowed to set up
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, overseas financial institutions had opened
a total of 540 representative offices and 161 operational agencies
in China, with their total assets reaching 33 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has allowed a number of overseas financial
institutions in Shanghai to deal with yuan-based business on a
limited basis in the city's Pudong New Area, a burgeoning
financial and trade district separated from downtown Shanghai by
the Huangpu River.
</P>
<P>
The governor also noted that the asset value of the financial
sector has grown rapidly over the recent years. Statistics
indicate that the total assets of all Chinese financial
institutions were valued at 13.28 trillion yuan (about 1.6
trillion US dollars), nearly ten trillion yuan more than in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Tibetan Artists Perform in Palais des Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The brilliant performance by a
group of Chinese Tibetan artists here in the Palais des Nations
Monday evening deeply impressed an audience of 1,200 from United
Nations agencies and missions of more than 150 countries.
</P>
<P>
Before the beginning of the performance, Pierre Pelou, chairman
of the art committee of the United Nations Office at Geneva
(UNOG), welcomed the artists of the Chinese Tibetan Song and Dance
Ensemble (CTSDE) and said their performance was a precious gift to
the U.N. by the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The performance will contribute to world peace and promote
mutual understanding between the Chinese people and people from
other parts of the world, Pelou added.
</P>
<P>
CTSDE Director Tenzin thanked the UNOG for their efforts in
helping provide the Tibetan artists with the opportunity to
perform in the Palais des Nations.
</P>
<P>
He said the CTSDE's tour abroad showed that the Chinese
government has always attached great importance to protecting and
developing Tibet's traditional culture, which represents not only
part of the Chinese culture, but also a rare part of the cultural
heritage of all mankind.
</P>
<P>
The CTSDE artists arrived in Bern, Switzerland, on August 16
after a visit to Italy. The performance in the UNOG assembly hall
of the Palais des Nations was the first of their series of
scheduled performances in the country.
</P>
<P>
The CTSDE delegation, consisting of around 30 artists, left
here today for the western city of Fribourg to attend a week-long
International Re-Encounter of Folklore.

<HEADLINE> Another UN Team of Missile Experts Arrives in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. team of experts in
self-propelled missiles arrived in Baghdad Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second team of its kind to visit Iraq in a week,
with a mission different from that of the previous one that has been
in Iraq since August 11.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Special Commission has been sending teams of experts to
Iraq to search for banned missiles and weapons of mass destruction
under U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi authorities have claimed that they have implemented the
U.N. resolutions and destroyed all those banned weapons, thus
demanding a quick lift of U.N. sanctions imposed on it after it
invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
There had been confrontations between the U.N. teams and the
Iraqi authorities on the sites of inspections before. But no
problem has arisen between Iraqi authorities and the U.N. arms
inspectors since Richard Butler became chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission on Iraq last July.
</P>
<P>
Iraq affirms it will continue to cooperate with the
U.N. Special Commission, provided that the latter will do its
duties objectively, finish its mission as soon as possible and
recommend lifting the U.N. embargo on Iraq.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 19 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary General's Special
Representative on Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi today held extensive
talks with the leaders of Afghan northern alliance in
Mazar-e-Sharif, about 300 km north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, who is on a two-week mission to assess the Afghan
situation and the UN peace efforts in Afghanistan, listened to the
views of the anti-Taliban alliance on the restoration of durable
peace in the war-hit country, official sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian diplomat, who last week held a detailed meeting
with the Taliban leaders in Kandahar, a major city in southern
Afghanistan, was accompanied by Head of the UN Special Mission on
Afghanistan, Norbert Holl, in the talks, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, the details of these talks were not available at the

</P>
<P>
As part of his mission to consult the relevant countries in the
region on Afghanistan, the 63-year-old Brahimi will proceed late
in the day from Mazar-e-Sharif to Central Asian Republics, the
sources said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. space shuttle Discovery
with six astronauts returned to Earth today after one day delay
with a satellite containing valuable information about the Earth's
ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
The space plane glided through a pale, mostly clear sky and
landed at Kennedy Space Center just after sunrise, ending a
12-day, 7.5 million kilometer journey for science.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the morning, flight controllers had kept close watch
on the hazy sky over Kennedy, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, NASA decided to delay the landing because of fears
that pre-dawn haze might turn into fog though no actual fog
developed later.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from NASA said that the crew achieved all its
objectives despite problems with some of the 24 payloads aboard
the spaceship.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts spent their last full day in orbit swinging
around the ozone-monitoring satellite that they retrieved on
Saturday. The satellite has been set free from the spaceship for
nine days.
</P>
<P>
The Germany-made satellite contains nine days' worth of
atmospheric data, enough to fill about 500 kilograms of computer
disks.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts also successfully raised with a Japan-made robot
arm the 3500 kilogram satellite high above the open cargo bay to
see what it would be like to move parts of the future
international space stations.

<HEADLINE> East China Battles Strong Typhoon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Local people in east China's
Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces and Shanghai Municipality are
recovering from a powerful typhoon which swept through the areas
last night.
</P>
<P>
Known as "Number 11," or "Typhoon Winnie," the typhoon first
struck the coastal city of Wenling in Zhejiang Province. The
province's coastal belts, in particular, suffered the most damage.
</P>
<P>
In Wenling, strong tidal waves damaged 26 sections of 13
coastal dikes and flooded 34 towns and townships. Some 30,000
local residents were temporarily trapped in their homes due to the
water gushing from the broken dikes and eventually moved out of
the dangerous areas before the typhoon hit.
</P>
<P>
High winds, tidal waves and thunderstorms affected 32 coastal
dikes and a dozen harbors in Zhoushan, a city of archipelagos in
Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
Airports in Ningbo, Wenzhou, Zhoushan and Hangzhou have been
closed. Some sections of road were washed away and telecom routes
cut down in the thunderstorm. One ship in Sanmen County sank.
</P>
<P>
The Qiantang Dyke, critical for the protection of Hangzhou, the
provincial capital, today remained under the constant supervision
of local people and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the foresight of the local governments, some one
million residents in the coastal region were moved to safer places
before the typhoon, keeping the damage and injuries to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's key economic center, was also affected by the
typhoon and accompanying storms and tidal waves.
</P>
<P>
The Hongqiao International Airport was closed at 7 p.m. last
night. Some 95 flights were cancelled and more than 100
delayed. Latest reports said that the airport resumed operation
early this morning.
</P>
<P>
River and rail transport in the city were also seriously
influenced by the bad weather.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu, neighboring Zhejiang, also reported big storms and
tidal waves. The provincial and local governments have led
residents in the work of draining waterlogged areas.

<P>
BANGKOK, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet today formally
decided to cut its budget for the 1998 fiscal year by 59 billion
baht (about 2 billion u.s. dollars), local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The cut was made in a bid to meet the requirement of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is on the way to provide
a huge financial rescue funding package to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The budget slashing was also made on the base that the
country's economic growth will be at three percent this year, and
the current account deficit will be no more than three percent of
the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Thailand previously set the 1998 national budget at 982 billion
baht (32.7 billion dollars). officials from the budget bureau said
that the cut will not affect the country's economic growth as it
will mainly fall on consumer spending.

KATHMANDU, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's tourism has registered
an increase in foreign exchange earnings and improvement in
facilities in recent years.
</P>
<P>
While foreign exchange earnings from tourism in the fiscal year
1994-95 stood at about 157 million U.S. dollars, this figure rose
by 6.1 percent to 167 million dollars in the following fiscal
year, said the Economic Survey for Fiscal Year 1996-97 issued by
the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
During the first eight months of the 1996-97 fiscal year which
ended on July 14, the tourism has netted in 96 million dollars,
the survey said.
</P>
<P>
As of mid-January 1996, the total number of hotels across Nepal
was 520 with 21,807 beds, including 72 star hotels and 448
non-star hotels.
</P>
<P>
This figure has rose to 632 vs 25,638 one year later, with star
and non-star hotels standing at 79 and 553 respectively, the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is now trying its utmost to get ready for the Visit Nepal
Year '98 in order to further promote the tourism, one of its major
sources of foreign exchange.

<P>
The provincial government of northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province in 1991 started to promote a "brand-name strategy" among
the local enterprises, the article said, and in the years since,
an overwhelming majority of provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions across the country have followed suit.
</P>
<P>
It gave two examples: the "Little Swan" washing machine and the
"China" and "Great Wall" brand pencils.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1979 in Wuxi, east China's Jiangsu Province, the
Little Swan Holdings Ltd. has developed rapidly into the country's
largest producer of fully automatic washing machines.
</P>
<P>
The article said that this is because the company has always
placed much emphasis on the buildup of its brand-name and worked
to upgrade its equipment, technology and management system.
</P>
<P>
It said that the "Little Swan" washing machine has for six
consecutive years enjoyed a market share higher than 40 percent,
and has been exported to more than 30 foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the Shanghai-based China No.1 Pencil Holdings
Ltd., producer of the nationwide famous "China" and "Great Wall"
brand pencils, shares similar experience with the Little Swan
company.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past four years, the pencil company has managed to
develop its products from the original four categories and 103
kinds to today's nine categories and 258 kinds," it said. "It
presented over 60 new products in 1996 alone."
</P>
<P>
To date, the article said, the annual profit of China No.1
Pencil Holdings Ltd. accounts for some 95 percent of the total
profits of all other pencil producers in the country.
</P>
<P>
It went on to say that another important factor in the change
of the operations system for enterprises is to continually exploit
the market in accordance with the characteristics of their own
products.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the Pearl River Piano Group based in Guangzhou,
capital of south China's Guangdong Province, formed several years
ago a "Pearl River piano management and sales community," through
which it established trade connections with over 130 sales units
across the country.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, the group also managed to set up over 80
sales outlets in northern, northeastern, northwestern and eastern
China, where its sales record used to be very poor," the article
said. "Now the group can sell more than 15,000 pianos in these
regions each year."

<HEADLINE> Number of Immigrants to Israel Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A total of 33,000 immigrants
arrived in Israel so far this year, representing a 16 percent drop
over the number in the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A report of Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics released today
shows shows that during the January-July period 26,900 immigrants
arrived from the former Soviet Union, 17 percent less than that of
last year. In 1996, immigrants to Israel totaled 70,600, of whom
58,900 were from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the figures show a 6 percent decrease over the number
of the same period in 1996 in immigration from the American
countries, which stood at 2,500 people. About 1,000 came from the
United States, or a 9 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
Among the immigrants arriving this year, 30 percent are below
the age of 19, and 44 percent between ages of 20 and 49.
</P>
<P>
Anomie Blumenthal, chairwoman of the Knesset (parliament)
Immigration Committee, said the statistics indicated that Israel
wasn't doing enough to absorb immigrants.
</P>
<P>
"The wave of (terrorist) attacks and the negative image...has
not encouraged immigration," she said.
</P>
<P>
But other officials blamed the decline in the number of
newcomers on a drying reservoir of potential immigrants,
particularly in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Immigration and absorption ministry spokesman Arik Hellman
attributed the decline in the number of immigrants to Israel to
the improving of conditions of Jews abroad, especially in Russia,
where many Jews can find jobs. Meanwhile, unemployment rate in
Israel has been rising.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Sidelined By Stock Market Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
weaker today following a fall in the price of gold overnight and
news that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) retained a very
optimistic outlook on inflation for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
Overnight in the United States, the gold price fell 4.6 U.S.
dollars to 321.1 an ounce and was at 321.5 late local today.
</P>
<P>
The RBA's August bulletin containing its quarterly update on
financial markets and the economy said monetary policy was
providing some expansionary inputs to the economy.
</P>
<P>
The currency finished at 73.74 U.S. cents down from 74.26
previously, and it had traded as low as 73.65 U.S. cents during
the afternoon session.
</P>
<P>
"After the bulletin, it reacted to headlines about inflation
and expectations built quickly in dealers minds about a future
rate cut," said NAB foreign exchange manager Derek Price.
</P>
<P>
And while economists said, the RBA's quarterly report does not
ruled out the prospect of another rate cut, monetary policy was
likely to remain on hold for now.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar ended at 87.12 from
87.00 against yen and at 1.3539 from 1.3458 against mark.

It said that the company now ranks first in China in terms of
quality, production and sales of pianos. Last year it produced
over 50,000 pianos, half of the country's total output.
</P>
<P>
The Firs Group, one of the country's leading clothing
manufacturers, can serve as another example of successful
marketing, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
Based in Ningbo, a port city in east China's Zhejiang Province,
the Firs Group owns over 20 marketing companies throughout China,
with a sales promotion contingent of more than 1,200 people. It
also opened over 500 special counters and collection stores in all
large and medium-sized cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Group's overall sales exceeded 1.4 billion yuan,
which helped bring its net assets up to nearly 700 million yuan,
the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article also took the economic success of Guangdong as
evidence of the importance of marketing.
</P>
<P>
Since China began its reform and opening up drive, it said, the
overall output value of Guangdong's light industry has topped the
country for ten years in a row. In 1996, the province's light and
textile industries scored a remarkable sales volume of 117.5
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province's export volume has also ranked number
one in China for a dozen years. Last year the figure was over 110
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
One of the important factors behind this is the backing of a
huge sales network, the article said.
</P>
<P>
"A flexible and scientific operations system is indispensable
for the acquisition of high-quality products and a vast market,"
the article concluded.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning to Become China's Leading Flower Production Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
province has now become the country's largest bulb-root flower
planting and cut flower producer.
</P>
<P>
Situate in temperate zone with favorable light, humid and
temperature for flower growing, Liaoning is abundant in flower
resources like azalea, Chinese rose, and other 150 kinds of wild
flowers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that by the end of 1996, flower planting
acreage reached 2,410 hectares, a 100-fo1d increase over that of
five years ago. Cut flower and potted flower production bases of
Liaoning were set up in the cities of Shenyang and Anshan.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning now has more than 170 enterprises engaged in flower
business, with over 500 flower strains. Flower products began to
enter markets in Japan and the Republic of Korea, with the annual
output value of nearly one billion yuan (120 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
To accelerate flower industry, Liaoning introduced quintessence
flowers like lily and tulip. It invested 30 million yuan (3.6
million US dollars) in setting up flower demonstration farms or
flower centers, with the first completed in July.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is setting up flower trading center in Shenyang,
flower wholesale market in Dalian, and three other flower markets
in its western and northern parts. It is estimated that by the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Finance has
recently issued a notice urging financial departments at all
levels to stop random fees, fines and apportions targeting the
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"The work should be done in combination with the effort to
rectify the financial and economic order," the notice said.
</P>
<P>
The financial departments should work together with other
relevant departments to strictly examine the fees and fines
collected by governments at all levels and their subordinate
agencies, by administrative and government institutions, and by
social groups, the notice urged. Funds set up by them should also
be examined, it added.
</P>
<P>
All the fees and fines banned by the central government must be
canceled and made known to the public that they have been
canceled, it noted, adding that those unreasonable items that
evidently add to the financial burden of enterprises must be
resolutely revoked.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Defeats Currency Speculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) chief executive Joseph Yam said that speculation against
the Hong Kong dollar last Thursday and Friday had been defeated,
local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The speculative activities were all small deals between 20
million and 30 million U.S. dollars, today's Hong Kong Standard
quoted Yam as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that none of the bigger hedge funds was operating
against the local currency Friday, according to another English
newspaper South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
"Some people who sold the Hong Kong dollar on Friday have
bought back on Monday in the London trades," Yam said. "We have
won the game so far with the help of the banks which pushed the
interest rates up."
</P>
<P>
The monetary official said he felt comfortable with the
exchange rates at 7.74 to 7.75 HK dollars to the U.S. dollar since
the official peg between the two currencies is at about 7.80 HK
dollars to one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed his confidence in the fundamental strength of the
local economy, saying that Hong Kong, which comes to be a
service-oriented economy, would not lose its competitive edge even
if other Asian currencies were depreciated.

Population Welfare Abida Hussain said today the country is the
most crowded one in the region in terms of population intensity.
</P>
<P>
A country-wide survey has revealed that six persons live in a
house whereas the desired family size was four per house, Abida
said when addressing an international conference held in Karachi,
Pakistan's largest city, according to a report by Associated Press
of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"We have to make a choice between the 'sustainable' or 'non-
sustainable' development process and decide which side we wanted
to go in next 15 years," Abida was quoted as saying at the
conference named "South Asia '97 - Toward a Progressive Economic
Union".
</P>
<P>
Abida said Pakistan's present population is 132 million and
environment does not allow the country to exceed beyond 200
million people.
</P>
<P>
For a sustainable development, the family size has to be
reduced from the present four to two children in next five years
to contain population growth, she said.

<HEADLINE> Chief Executive Optimistic About HK Sharemarket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Tung Chee Hwa, said
today that he is optimistic about the future of the Hong Kong
sharemarket, though the Hang Seng Index finished the day with a
loss of 619 points.
</P>
<P>
The fall from the previous close of 16,096 set last Friday,
partly due to the influence from Wall Street's slide in currency
trading, will soon be curbed, experts here believed.
</P>
<P>
Stock markets were lower around the world Monday, following
Friday's steep 247-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial
average on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, stock markets in Japan, the
Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia
and New Zealand have also been slumping.
</P>
<P>
"People are still uncertain about how long speculation on the
local currency is going to drag on," the experts said, adding that
the Hang Seng Index was still at a very high level and predicting
the 33-member blue-chip index would plunge by about 800 to 1,000
points in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters here earlier today, SAR Chief
Executive Tung stressed that he has strong confidence in the
fundamental strength of Hong Kong's economy, noting that any
attempts to hit the Hong Kong dollar would be defeated.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A 30-year-old man drowned during
torrential rains in the Philippine capital of Manila after he fell
into a creek on his way home, the Philippine News Agency said
today.
</P>
<P>
The victim, Joey de la Cruz, drowned at the Lilac Creek in
Masinag, Antopolo, in Manila, while going home during heavy rains
last night, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers are still searching for his body, it said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first casualty of the torrential rains which
started in the northern Philippines on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The torrential rains intensified by typhoon have caused massive
flooding in the northern Philippines, affecting business
operations and normal lives of people in Manila and the rest of
Luzon.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports by the official Disaster Coordination Council
said that two to three feet thick of mud water rampaged through
Pasig-Potrero river in Pamanga and two feet thick mud water at
Sacobia river in Bamban, in Central Luzon.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that some 10,000 families living in high-risk
areas near the river have been alerted to take precautionary
measures in case of continuous heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
In the capital of Manila, thousands of families were evacuated
to schools, chapels and village halls, the Department of Social
Welfare and Development said.
</P>
<P>
The torrential rains forced some government offices, shops and
schools to close as the flooding prevented people from going to
work.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Philippine Airlines canceled 13 more domestic and
three more international flights scheduled for today because of
the monsoon rains.

<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Work in the Philippines'
government agencies and state-run corporations were suspended
today due to heavy flooding caused by torrential monsoon rains in
the northern and central Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ruben Torres ordered in an announcement the
suspension of services in all government agencies and firms,
except some vital ones.
</P>
<P>
Transactions were also canceled on the Philippine Stock
Exchange and the country's currency market due to the flooding
which interrupted transportation in most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Many low-lying parts of the streets in the capital city were
flooded by waist-deep or knee-deep water due to continuing monsoon
rains. Many commuters and cars were seen stranded along the
flooded streets.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 families have been evacuated to higher and
safer ground in Metro Manila due to flash floods menacing their
houses in low-lying areas.
</P>
<P>
In central Luzon, heavy rains loosened tons of volcanic ash on
Mount Pinatub and turned it into mud flows, posing threat to
several villages at the foot of the volcanic mountain.
</P>
<P>
Massive monsoon rains, intensified by typhoon Winnie, began to
batter Luzon Island and Visayas since Sunday.

<HEADLINE> China's Coastal Enterprises Change Operation Mechanism (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Huge profit has been generated
for enterprises in east China's coastal areas which have changed
their operations systems in response to market demand, People's
Daily, the leading newspaper in China, reported today.
</P>
<P>
The front page article pointed out that the key to a successful
enterprise lies in the constant innovation of its products. It
cited the Ziguang Machinery Corporation Ltd. in Shanghai, China's
largest industrial city, as an example.
</P>
<P>
This enterprise, the largest of its kind in Shanghai, once was
on the verge of bankruptcy. In early 1995, it still suffered
losses of over 11 million yuan (about 1.3 million US dollars), and
had to lay off 30 percent of its employees.
</P>
<P>
After careful market analysis, it presented in 1995 three new
products, which were all in urgent market demand. Sales of these
goods accounted for 30 percent of the company's overall business
volume of that year.
</P>
<P>
In the following year, the company developed four other new
products, which brought in some 80 percent of its total profit.
And the eight new products the company took out this year are
expected to contribute some 90 percent of the annual profit.
</P>
<P>
Within only two years, the products of Ziguang have gained high
popularity across the country and also in the global market, with
the company's per capita sales volume four times as much as the
average index in China's machine-building industry.
</P>
<P>
"The most important reason for Ziguang's success is that it has
found a channel to link its own products with the market," the
article said.

<HEADLINE> French Oil Group Confirms Discovery of Offshore Oil in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The French oil group Elf-Aquitaine
today confirmed that it has discovered a big offshore oilfield
1,360 meters underwater off Angola, which appears to be the
biggest oilfield ever discovered in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The new oilfield, baptized Dalia, is the second oilfield
discovered off Angola by Elf-Aquitaine, which discovered the
Girassol oilfield in the same area deemed to have the same oil
potential as the Brazilian Campos basin.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary tests, Dalia has between three and 3.5
billion barrels of oil reserve, compared with between 900 million
and 1.4 billion barrels in Dirassol, Agence France-Presse quoted
Elf officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Both Dalia and Dirassol are located about 200 kilometers
northwest of Luanda, the capital of Angola.
</P>
<P>
Elf said that the commercial potential of Dalia is yet to be
evaluated by experts, but its discovery confirmed the huge oil
reserve in the offshore area of Angola, where experts think exist
three to five big oilfields.
</P>
<P>
The Elf Exploration Angola, an affiliate of Elf-Aquitaine, is
operating 35 percent of the oil production in Angola, in
collaboration with several other Western oil groups including Esso
Exploration Angola, British Petroleum Exploration Angola, Statoil,
Norsk Hydro, and Fina Exploration.
</P>
<P>
Girassol will begin producing oil by 2000, with a primary
production capacity of 100,000 barrels per day, and a potential of
200,000 barrels per day, said Elf officials.

groups's international distribution force of more than 2.5
million Dollars in the first financial year.

<P>
"All South Africans will have the opportunity to get involved
in the Amway business, through which individuals can establish
their own independently run businesses without major capital
outlays," Beaumont said.
</P>
<P>
The launch into South Africa would create the first

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Cross-Examined in Defamation Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong was cross-examined in the High Court today for three
hours by Mr. George Carman, the Queens Counsel hired by Workers'
Party chief J.B. Jeyaretnam, who is being sued by government
leaders for defamation.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Carman suggested that Mr. Goh and ruling People's Action
Party (PAP) leaders had started legal action against Workers'
Party Secretary General Mr. Jeyaretnam to bankrupt him and keep
him out of Parliament, according to a local television report.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Goh said this was not true as Mr. Jeyaretnam was no threat
to the PAP and to himself. He also said he had been prepared to be
magnanimous towards Mr. Jeyaretnam during the out-of-court
discussions, which took place on Monday. However, no details of
the discussions can be revealed in court.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Carman also questioned Mr. Goh on his views of democracy
and why Mr. Goh said he was being magnanimous when he had asked
for substantial damages.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Goh replied that when his integrity as a leader has been
attacked he had to stand up and protect it.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Goh said the police report filed by Mr. Tang Liang Hong has
accused the Prime Minister of being a liar and of criminal
conspiracy. He said that it was like a Molotov cocktail and Mr.
Tang had given it to Mr. Jeyaretnam to hurl at the Prime Minister
at a critical time.
</P>
<P>
Goh said if politicians and ministers in Singapore do not
protect their integrity, they would be finished.
</P>
<P>
The PAP leaders, including Prime Minister Goh and Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew, are suing Mr. Jeyaretnam for telling a
Workers' Party election campaign rally on January 1 this year that
his team-mate in the Cheng San Group Representation Constituency,
lawyer Tang Liang Hong, had just placed before him two reports
the latter made to the police against the Prime Minister and his
team.
</P>
<P>
The PAP leaders claimed the words Jeyaretnam used implied that
they had conspired to commit criminal defamation against Mr. Tang
by labeling him an anti-Christian, anti-English educated Chinese
chauvinist.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Start Reforms Dialogue Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The constitutional reform talks
between the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) and the
Opposition are scheduled to commence on August 20, according to a
"Kenya Times" report today.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper quoted Secretary of the nine-man
Religious Mediating Team Rev. Mulava Musyimi as saying
that the Muslim community's two representatives were back to the
Religious Community Mediation Committee.
</P>
<P>
Muslim members of the committee last Friday pulled out of the
dialogue, charging that the chairman of the dialogue committee was
not impartial.
</P>
<P>
Musyimi noted that the post of the committee set up last
Wednesday had been abolished to be replaced by rotating
chairpersons.
</P>
<P>
The National Convention Executive Council (NCEC), an umbrella
body of opposition parties, announced last Thursday the formation
of a 50-member team to hold dialogue with the ruling KANU.
</P>
<P>
The KANU Parliament Group is scheduled to have a meeting this
morning to do preparations for the coming dialogue with the
Opposition tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The KANU National Executive Council last month decided to
effect constitutional, legal and administrative changes before
the forthcoming General Elections to be held later this year.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Attorney General Amos Wako has since published two
bills, seeking to repeal or amend some of contentious laws, and
to empower President Daniel arap Moi to appoint a commission to
review constitutional changes.

<P>
COLOMBO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops at
dawn today began to Bombard Puliyankulam town in the Northern
province held by Tamil rebels, according to military sources here
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The sources said air force fighter planes provided air cover to
the advancing troops by targeting the artillery positions of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Puliyankulam town,
about 200 kilometers north of the capital.
</P>
<P>
A Vavuniya based military source was quoted as saying this
morning that the town was just 500 meters ahead from the
advancing troops.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of the Jaya Sikuru (Sure of Victory) operation
was launched by the government troops on May 13 to open a key
supply line along a highway from the government-held town of
Vavuniya to Kilinochchi in Jaffna peninsula, which runs through
the rebel-held territory.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting for a separate Tamil state
in the north and east of the country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in Community Clash up to 50 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Continued clashes between two
communities in southwest Nigeria's Osun State have left 50 people
dead, 160 others hospitalized and at least 70 houses burnt,
despite a dusk-to-dawn curfew.
</P>
<P>
about 45 of those receiving treatment at hospitals are
reported on the danger list, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The situtaion with the presence of hundreds of armed anit-riot
policemen could not be said to have improved as the atmosphere in
the two communities are still charged and tension soaked.
</P>
<P>
The event began with a peaceful demonstration last Friday by
about 5,000 Modakeke youths, in protest of relocating the
Ife-East local government headquarters from Modakeke to Oke-Ogbo
in Ile-Ife.
</P>
<P>
The denouncement of the Ife leader by Modakeke youths
reportedly raised anger of the Ife people. When more students
joined both sides on Saturday, fighting escalated from throwing
stones to each other to exchange of gunfire and burn of houses.
</P>
<P>
The clashes, which calmed down about mid-Sunday after the
arrival of anti-riot policemen, resumed hours later and lasted
till the next day. Dane guns, matchets, axes and broken bottles
were used by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Local government and traditional rulers have urged the warring
communities to embrace dialogue to avoid further bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time fighting broke out between the two
communities. One politician from Modakeke was killed in 1983 in
an attack launched by thugs hired by the rival party.
</P>
<P>
The ugly incident, before which the peoples of Ile-Ife and
Modakeke area were living together in peace, sowed the seed of
discard between them.
</P>
<P>
The Ife-Modakeke clash is the second of similar nature in the
country this year.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, bloodshed caused by the move of a local
government site from the Ijaw community to where the Itsekiri
people live claimed the lives of tens of people in the oil
producing city of Warri in southern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The communal crisis led to huge losses to oil production with
a big number of properties damaged.

<HEADLINE> China Demands Japan's Clarification on Senior Official's Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- China earnestly hopes that the
Japanese side will "refrain from doing anything again that amounts
to an interference in China's internal affairs or jeopardizes the
Sino-Japanese relations."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang made the
remarks here today in response to a question on Japanese Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama's statement concerning the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Kajiyama clearly indicated in a TV Asahi interview program on
August 17 that the so-called "surrounding areas" pertaining to the
scope of the Japanese-U.S. security cooperation should "naturally
include the Taiwan Straits."
</P>
<P>
Shen said that China is "seriously concerned" about the
above-mentioned remarks made by Seiroku Kajiyama, a chief member
of the Japanese Government, and asked the Japanese Government to
make "a clear-cut clarification" on Kajiyama's statement.
</P>
<P>
The position of the Chinese side on the issue of
Japanese-U.S. security cooperation is clear and consistent, Shen
said.
</P>
<P>
As is known to all, Shen pointed out, Taiwan is an inalienable
part of the Chinese territory, and the Taiwan question is purely
China's internal affairs. This has become a consensus of the
international community, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side has made solemn commitment on this in the
Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the Treaty of Peace and
Friendship Between China and Japan, said Shen, emphasizing that
"Japan should therefore strictly honor its commitment."
</P>
<P>
He said, "the Chinese side earnestly hopes that the Japanese
side will be consistent in words and deeds, and refrain from doing
anything again that amounts to an interference in China's internal
affairs or jeopardizes the Sino-Japanese relations."

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian State-owned Commercial Bank to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's state-owned
National Bank of Commerce (NBC) is expected to be dissolved on
September 30 to give way to two new banks which become
operational the following day.
</P>
<P>
This proposal is to be deliberated in the National Assembly
and waiting for endorsement next week, according to local press
reports today.
</P>
<P>
Government bills moved in the National Assembly say that the
two new banks -- the National Bank of Commerce (NBC) Ltd. and the
National Microfinance Bank (NMB) Ltd. are to start operations on
October 1.
</P>
<P>
The move will legally initiate the restructuring of NBC and
pave way for its privatization.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin Mkapa told some members of parliament from
the ruling party earlier that NBC is a big burden to the
country's economy as it has been suffering huge losses, forcing
the government to pump in tax-payers' money in billions of
shillings (one US dollar equals 600 shillings) for its survival.
</P>
<P>
However, several politicians and pressure groups have fears
that privatization of NBC will deprive the people in the rural
areas, particularly small holders such as farmers and business
operators access to credit.
</P>
<P>
The bills say that unlike the present bank which was
established by a statute in 1967 and given monopoly in the
country's commercial banking, the new banks will be incorporated
as companies by September 25.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Praises Teamsters Union, UPS Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has praised the agreement reached by the Teamsters union and
United Parcel Service (UPS) Late Monday night to end a 15-day
strike that crippled package deliveries nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, following 80 hours of talks over five days, was
announced by Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, who was joined at an
early morning news conference by Teamsters President Ron Carey and
the company's chief negotiator, David Murray.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, whose administration had resisted calls form business
groups to intervene and end the strike, praised both sides, saying
that "the issues that were at the heart of their negotiations are
important to our nation's economic strength and to all Americans."
</P>
<P>
Murray said that both sides compromised to reach the deal. "To
our employees: we hope to welcome you back very soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Murray and Carey declined to provide details of the
agreement, but a source familiar with the deal said it was for a
five-year contract that increased the base wage for part-time
workers and did not include a contentious pension proposal made by
the company.
</P>
<P>
It also would convert thousands of part-time jobs into
full-time positions.
</P>
<P>
The union's national bargaining committee and local union
leaders who represent UPS workers were told to fly to Washington
on Tuesday to receive the package for approval -- the final steps
before a rank-and-file vote.
</P>
<P>
The Teamsters, representing nearly two-thirds of the UPS' 302,000
U.S. employees, went on strike August 4.
</P>
<P>
During the strike, the Teamster Union insisted that the company
add more full-time positions. It also opposed the UPS' plan to
withdraw from the Teamsters' multi-employer pension and health
funds and establish a separate benefit fund for UPS workers.
</P>
<P>
Carey had insisted that the union would not agree to any offer
unless it included more full-time jobs and limits on
subcontracting.
</P>
<P>
About 58 percent of UPS jobs are filled by part-time workers,
and their eight-dollars-an-hour base salary has not increased
since 1982. The company created 46,000 jobs last year, 38,000 of
them being part-time.
</P>
<P>
In addition to an annual 1.5 percent wage increase for
full-time workers, the company's original offer included a 3,060
dollars bonus for full-time employees. Full-time UPS drivers earn
19.95 dollar an hour on average.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Peso Depreciates Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine currency of peso
has dropped to another record low of 30.07 peso against the U.S.
dollar after a six-day straight plunge which culminated on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Since Southeast Asian currencies were attacked by speculators
in July, the peso has fallen by 14 percent to the present level
from a fixed rate of 26.4 peso to one dollar.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the new round of depreciation was attributed to
the pressure exerted by other declining Southeast Asian currencies
and the Philippine Central Bank's decision to cut key interest
rates and stay away from the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
After the International Monetary Fund provided a bail-out
package to shore up the Thai currency, the baht is stabilizing.
However, other Asian currencies soon succumbed to new speculative
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian ringgit plunged by 3.5 percent to a 41-month low
of 2.7430 ringgit against the dollar on August 12. Two days later,
the Indonesian rupiah plummeted to 2,762 rupiah to one dollar, a
record low since 1973, forcing the country to float it freely.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore dollar, the safe heaven currency of Asia, also
fell victim to the current currency turmoil sweeping the region,
tumbling to a three-year record low of 1.514 per U.S. dollar last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Central Bank governor Gabriel Singson said the baht
has so far dipped 23.2 percent, the rupiah 17.1 percent, the
ringgit 9.5 percent and the Singapore dollar 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The whole region is experiencing the same pressure and the
fall of the peso was not due to a weak domestic economy", analysts
said, "The new attacks on the peso could not be remedied
internally, but should be addressed by the region as a whole."
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, added that the peso's situation was
aggravated by the Central Bank's recent move to cut key interest
rates and the adoption of a hand-off policy at the foreign
exchange market.
</P>
<P>
To preserve the country's economic gains, the bank recently
lowered its overnight borrowing rate from 32 percent to 14 percent
while the lending rate, the term borrowing rate and other key
interest rates are also dropping.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the declining interest rates reduce the incentive
for investors to hold their funds in pesos and make it less costly
to buy up the greenback, allowing some commercial banks to play
around the market.
</P>
<P>
"Although there was a strong demand for dollar from importers,
it is not enough to push the rate to the present level. Banks are
just playing with the market, testing at what level the rate would
settle," analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Following the suit of Malaysia and Indonesia, the Central Bank
also abandoned its futile defense of the peso. From August 11, it
has been absent at the foreign exchange market, neither selling
nor buying U.S. dollars to stabilize the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
When the peso was first attacked in early July, the bank
actively intervened in the local market by selling 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars in less than 10 days and raising the overnight
borrowing rate to a record high of 32 percent. But all the
measures failed to protect the peso.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that it would continue its hand-off policy this
week, determined to let the market decide the rate between the
peso and the dollar even as currency traders expect the peso to
dip further.
</P>
<P>
"The drop of the peso is not over. The rate would went up
further in the next few days considering the continued weakening
of other Asian currencies and if the Central Bank continues
staying away from the market," analysts said.

the top spot in the number of cases and the second in investment
amount.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Tanzania, Zimbabwe to Implement Commodity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Uganda, Tanzania and Zimbabwe
are to kick off later this year a three-year regional commodity
project to boost the credit worthiness of their exporters,
reported the local newspaper "The Crusader" today.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources here were quoted as saying that under the 9.1
million U.S. Dollar project, collateral warehouse systems will be
established in the economies of the three countries over the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the Common Fund for Commodities (CFC)-backed
project is expected to kick off later this year, with the
executing countries contributing some counter-funding, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The fund will offer a grant of slightly over 3.7 million
Dollars, and a loan of 1.74 million dollars is expected from the
Bank of the Preferential Trade Area (PTA).
</P>
<P>
Local banks will provide 787,000 Dollars, the International
Coffee Organisation 15,000 Dollars and the rest will come from
implementing countries.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's contribution towards the project is estimated at
538,503 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The collateral warehouse system is enabling exporters borrow
funds for their operation once their commodities have entered
their warehouses.
</P>
<P>
Some eastern African countries including Zambia and
Mozambique, have reportedly adopted the system.
</P>
<P>
The project, once implemented, will benefit all export
commodities, especially coffee.
</P>
<P>
This would be a big relief to small coffee exporters here in
Uganda who are operating dismally due to the failure to raise
pre-financing funds from Europe.

<HEADLINE> China Registers Steady Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Continuing steady growth of
China's national economy during July featured a slight dip in
industrial production and investment in fixed assets, a rapid
increase of foreign trade, and a low inflation rate, according to
a monthly economic report released by State Statistical Bureau
(SSB).
</P>
<P>
Industrial enterprises above the county-level generated a July
value-added volume of 162.5 billion yuan, a real term rise of 8.4
percent over the corresponding 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
The July heat wave sparked slower than average growth for the
the industrial sector when compared to the first half of this
year. However, the sales rate for industrial products reached
96.34 percent, the highest level since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The SSB report showed that China's industrial sector achieved a
value-added volume of 1.15 trillion yuan for the January-July
period, up 11 percent from the previous year's same period, with
the sales rate rising by 0.7 percentage points to 94.86 percent.
</P>
<P>
Investments in fixed assests during the first seven months of
the year hit 639.2 billion yuan, up 10.5 percent from the previous
year's period and 3.8 percentage points lower than the average for
the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, July retail sales for consumer goods
reached 210.3 billion yuan, a real term year-on-year rise of 12.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Total retail sales for the January-July period jumped 12
percent to 1.5 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The July foreign trade volume of 28.4 billion US dollars
represented an 19.8 percent increase over the 1996 period. Exports
were up 25.7 percent to 15.6 billion dollars, with imports rising
13.4 percent to 12.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The nation's revenues grew by 24.6 percent on annual basis,
with expenditures rising by only 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
SSB statistics show that deposits in China's financial
institutions grew by 68.5 billion yuan, or some 58.1 billion yuan
less than in the corresponding 1996 period. Loans fell by 25.7
billion yuan to 54.4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China's inflation rate fluctuated slightly in July with retail
prices rising by a mere 0.6 percent and consumer prices edging up
by 2.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Introduce Laws to Combat Sea Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is
soon to introduce special legislation to combat acts of piracy at
sea, Ministry of Port Development sources said today.
</P>
<P>
They said that while the government was trying to develop
Colombo as a transshipment port in the South Asian region, wrong
signals were being sent to the international shipping community
that Sri Lanka was not a safe place for transshipment activity.
</P>
<P>
Additionally it is feared that the frequency of ships calling
at Colombo would be reduced if piracy was allowed to continue
since the laws and procedures currently in place were inadequate
and inappropriate to deal with piracy.
</P>
<P>
International shipping agencies have cautioned at the increase
in piracy in many parts of the world. The estimated loss due to
piracy has been placed at 200 million US dollars in 1996.

<HEADLINE> China's Environmental Monitoring System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- China has established a
nationwide environmental monitoring system with more than 4,000
stations staffed by over 70,000 technical personnel.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yangzu, deputy director of the National Environmental
Protection Agency (Nepa), told conferees attending today's opening
of the Fifth National Environmental Monitoring Conference that
ministries and governments in different administrative regions
have engaged in joint efforts to guarantee that the system
operates smoothly.
</P>
<P>
China's Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995) featured the
establishment of a "National Environmental Monitoring Network" and
four special transregional networks covering the Yangtze River
Valley, offshore areas and various other environmentally
vulnerable regions.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that urban monitoring stations regularly
monitor more than 80 percent of atmospheric, water and noise
pollution levels, with rural stations providing 56 percent
coverage in their respective areas.
</P>
<P>
A number of stations also monitor soil conditions, wildlife and
various ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
Monitoring centers have enabled local governments and related
departments throughout the nation to reach appropriate decisions
on environmental management.
</P>
<P>
China has also drafted a plan for the development of an even
more extensive environmental monitoring system between 1996-2000,
and a year 2010 blueprint to perfect the system by placing
priority on the expansion of special monitoring networks and urban
centers.

<HEADLINE> Job Creation Urged For Uganda's Former WNBF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,000 former rebels
of the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) are in need of farm tools and
other ways for their lives, "The New Vision" reported today.
</P>
<P>
John Obala, Council Secretary of Koboko District in northwest
Uganda, told the paper that former rebels are visiting his office
for capital to start their business or help in finding jobs.
</P>
<P>
The WNBF rebels surrendered to the government and were freed
after the collapse of WNBF in mid-March. But hundreds of the
former rebels captured by the government troops are still in
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
But the freed former rebels have found no jobs for themselves.
</P>
<P>
Obala appealed to the government to take steps to get the
former rebels resettled, otherwise, he warned, they could engage
in negative activities and become a threat to local security.
</P>
<P>
An early report said Uganda National Rescue Front Part Two
(UNRF II), a breakaway group from WNBF, have recruited some 1,000
youths in the area for military training in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The authorities concerned have noticed the need of the former
WNBF members, with the Uganda army having conscripted 700 of them.
</P>
<P>
James Kazini, Commander of the fourth division, said the
Uganda army absorbed some 2,000 of them to escort convoys in the
northwest.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Appeals to Parliament to Approve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian new President Mohammad
Khatami, a former liberal-minded cleric, today called on the hard
liner-dominated parliament to approve his cabinet lineup.
</P>
<P>
The parliament began debate on the proposed 22-member cabinet
this morning.
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement to the parliament session, Khatami
defended his choices by assuring the MP's that Iran's Supreme
Leader Ali Khamenei was not opposed to any of his ministers.
</P>
<P>
"I have taken caution that I would not choose anyone whom the
Leadership (Khamenei) would oppose, although the Leadership is
above such mundane opposition," said Khatami, who was sworn in on
August 4 as the fifth president.
</P>
<P>
According to Iran's constitution, every single candidate for
the ministerial post must win the parliament's vote of confidence
before undertaking the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing conservatives headed by Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri currently form a parliamentary majority
occupying 140 seats of the 270-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
While the liberal camp, which supports the economic policy of
Former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, take up about 100
seats. The rest seats are controlled by independents.
</P>
<P>
Khatami defended his choice of ministers by saying that
they were well-educated, excellent managers and had a record of
revolutionary activities.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri who presided over today's session said that the
deliberation will last a total of 15 hours.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri was the rival of Khatami in the presidential
elections last May. Khatami gained 20 million votes, defeating
Nateq-Nouri by 13-million-vote margin.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, Khatami submitted the list of his cabinet
ministers to the Parliament. The results of debates will be
announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed cabinet includes five ministers from the previous
administration, five with ministerial experience since 1979, and
several provincial governors.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Khatami's ministers were chosen in a
bipartisan way in a bid to appease the conservatives in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, Khatami's choice for Culture and Islamic Guidance
Minister, Ata'ollah Mohajerani, shows that Iran's new president
has stuck to his original campaign promise to foster cultural
liberalism in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani is a well-known liberal who served as Legal and
Parliamentary deputy to Rafsanjani between 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani's liberal weekly "Bahman" was forced to close in
1996 under pressure from conservatives.
</P>
<P>
To the conservatives, Mohajerani is notorious for having
supported resumption of ties with the U.S., a subject which is
considered a tabu in Iranian society after the 1979 Islamic
revolution.

<P>
PARIS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After the French city Strasbourg's pollution level surpassed
level two -- 180 micrograms of ozone per cubic meter -- in the
afternoon on Monday, the municipal government has asked car drivers
going to the city to park their cars in two parkings at the
periphery of the Alsacian metropolis and take tramways to downtown
area at a cost of 14 francs (2.3 U.S. dollars). Meanwhile, pollution
in Paris and the northern city of Lille also surpassed level two on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
-- The Swedish government has restricted the selling of alcohol
to 392 state-owned shops which serve customers above 20 years old
between 10 to 18 o'clock from Monday to Friday. Inhabitants in rural
areas without such shops have to order alcohol through the post.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The decision by the government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
to use a part of defense spending to finance job creation has
aroused strong criticism from the center-right opposition and
unions. The reduction of defense spending could be the first subject
of confrontation between the government and President Jacques
Chirac, who has promised to ``see to it that our armed forces
continue to have at their disposal the necessary resources for their
renovation, maintenance of capacities and their training.''

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Massive Flooding Reported in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Torrential rains intensified by
Typhoon "Ibiang" since Monday have caused massive flooding in the
Northern Philippines, affecting business operations and normal
lives of people in Manila and the rest of Luzon, officials said
today.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports by the official Disaster Coordination Council
said that two to three feet thick of mud water rampaged through
Pasig-Potrero river in Pamanga and two feet thick mud water at
Sacobia river in Bamban, in Central Luzon.
</P>
<P>
The 26-kilometer megadike system along both sides of
Pasig-Potrero river has remained undamaged by mud water flows so
far, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
But they said that some 10,000 families living in high-risk
areas near the river have been alerted to take precautionary
measures in case of continuous heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
In the capital of Manila, thousands of families were evacuated
to schools, chapels and village halls, the Department of Social
Welfare and Development said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the department said that the affected families,
who are living in low-lying villages in the capital city, were
evacuated early this morning as flood waters rose to chest deep.
</P>
<P>
Official disaster response operation teams are closely
monitoring the situation in Manila and other parts of the country,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The torrential rains forced some government offices, shops and
schools to close as the flooding prevented people from going to
work.
</P>
<P>
But so far, no casualties have been reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Philippine Airlines canceled more domestic and
international flights scheduled for today because of the monsoon
rains.
</P>
<P>
The airlines announced that 13 domestic flights and three
international flights from Manila to Jakarta, Singapore and Kuala
Lumpur have been canceled.
</P>
<P>
Other flights bound for international destinations will operate
with some delays, it said.
</P>
<P>
Three international flights held last night and rescheduled for
today are still awaiting departure clearance. These flights are
scheduled to leave Manila for Los Angeles, Frankfurt and Brisbane.

DHAKA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
refixed the prices of all petroleum products, obviously keeping
pace with the international market as well as considering
devaluation of the country's currency Taka against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>

According to local newspapers, the cabinet meeting on Monday

devalued Taka again in less than one month from 44 taka to 44.45
taka against one dollar.
</P>
<P>
The rate of diesel has been refixed at 12.95 taka per liter
from 12.70 taka while petrol and octane prices rose sharply to 21
taka and 23 taka from 13.70 taka and 14.65 taka respectively.
</P>
<P>
As per the new rates, each liter of kerosene has been refixed
at 12.95 taka, furnace oil 5 taka, light diesel oil 14 taka. The
government also increased the price of liquefied petroleum gas
fixing it at 250 taka per cylinder, up from 185.28 taka.
</P>
<P>
Energy Ministry officials said that the new measure would
recover the estimated loss of five billion taka (about 112 million
dollars) in the petroleum sector.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC), the lone importer of
petroleum products, placed a proposal in early June to raise the
petroleum prices.
</P>
<P>
But the cabinet turned down the proposal then considering the
hardship of the consumers and the natural effect on transport
sector, irrigation and the cost of industrial products.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the donor countries and agencies including the World
Bank have been pressing the government hard to stop the huge
subsidy in the petroleum sector by raising petroleum prices.
</P>
<P>
The price structure of widely-used petroleum products was
framed six years ago.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Rockets Northern Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- In a major escalation of
clashes in South Lebanon, Hezbollah forces fired 45 rounds of
Katyusha rockets into northern Israel today.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Israeli Army said the rocket attack came
about early in the morning, and the rockets hit its northern
border town Kiryat Shimona and other places near the northern part
of the Lake Kinneret (or Sea of Galilee).
</P>
<P>
The army said there were low casualties in the attack,
although no exact figures were available at this time.
</P>
<P>
It added that the anti-Israeli Hezbollah forces had claimed
responsibility for the attack, which is the most serious since
Israel and Hezbollah forces reached ceasefire in April last year
after Israel's Operation Grapes of Wrath.
</P>
<P>
Today's Hezbollah attack was apparently an revenge operation
for the Monday's shelling of the southern Lebanese town Sidon by
the pro-Israeli South Lebanese Army (SLA), which killed six
Lebanese civilians and wounded 36 others.
</P>
<P>
The SLA shelling was reportedly the revenge attack for the
death of two teenager children of a late SLA commander, who were
killed in a roadside bombing planned by Hezbollah. Late Hezbollah
forces retaliated by shelling Jezzine, killing a 60-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
Monday's civilian fatalities were the highest since the
Operation Grapes of Wrath. Both Israel and Lebanon had submitted
complaints to the five-nation committee monitoring the ceasefire
understanding, which barred both sides from attacking civilians.
</P>
<P>
Israel on Monday moved quickly to distance itself from the
latest clashes between SLA and Hezbollah forces. Criticizing the
shelling on Sidon, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai expressed
"the deepest regret over the attack on innocent civilians,"
saying it was totally against Israel's policy.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai told reporters in Haifa that Israel had conveyed
messages to the Lebanese Army and other parties in the conflict in
an attempt to prevent an escalation. He said Israel had no
interests in a deterioration of the situation, but had every
interest in stabilizing it.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Allow Hostile Foreign Merger, Acquisition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korean will allow hostile
merger and acquisition (M&AMP;A) of domestic firms by foreigners,
hoping this can help facilitate foreign capitals' participation in
the financially-ailing domestic business, government officials
said here.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government would strongly regulate moves
of domestic companies to jointly defend a target firm from the
hostile takeover bids as an act of collusion, said the officials
from the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE).
</P>
<P>
The current rules ban hostile M&AMP;As, and friendly ones are only
allowed for enterprises with assets of less than 2 trillion won
(2.23 billion U.S. dollar).
</P>
<P>
New measures also include asking conglomerate owners and
executives to take the responsibility for managerial mistakes, and
punishing those involved in bribery.
</P>
<P>
In the case of the M&AMP;As of financially troubled enterprises,
the government would closely re-examine the effectiveness of the
current regulation forcing M&AMP;A carriers to buy over 50-percent
stakes in the targeted firms, noted the officials.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Teamsters union and
United Parcel Service (UPS) reached a tentative agreement tonight
to end a 15-day strike that disrupted package deliveries
nationwide, the Associated Press (AP) reported.
</P>
<P>
A news conference to announce the deal was scheduled for late
tonight, AP quoted unidentified sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The settlement followed more than 80 hours of talks since
Thursday, with pressure from Labor Secretary Alexis Herman and
some prodding from President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Details of the agreement were not immediately available, but a
source close to the talks said it was for a five-year contract
that increased the base wage for part-time workers and did not
include a contentious pension proposal made by the company, AP said.
</P>
<P>
The Teamsters, representing nearly two-thirds of UPS' 302,000
U.S. employees, went on strike August 4. Their contract expired
July 31.
</P>
<P>
Normally, UPS moves everyday 12 million bundles and parcels, or
the equivalent of five percent of the nation's gross domestic
product. But with the support of package delivery giant's 2,000
pilots, the Teamsters virtually shut the company down, leaving
business owners scrambling to find alternative carriers.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear if the workers would return to their jobs
immediately, or if they would wait for local union leaders to send
the contract out to their members for a vote.
</P>
<P>
During the strike, the Teamster Union insisted that the company
add more full-time positions. It also opposed UPS' plan to
withdraw from the Teamsters' multi-employer pension and health
funds and establish a separate benefit fund for UPS workers.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration had resisted calls from business
groups to intervene and end the strike. The White House said the
work stoppage did not pose a threat to the nation's security and
health, the standard for intervention under the 1947 Taft-Hartley
Act.
</P>
<P>
But Herman publicly urged both sides back to the bargaining
table, pressing for an end to the biggest strike in more than two
decades.
</P>
<P>
The first hint of progress came last Thursday when UPS Chief
Executive Officer James Kelly suggested the company was willing to
modify its "last, best and final offer."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Clinton said the union and the company should
"redouble their efforts and settle this strike and they ought to
do it today."
</P>
<P>
Throughout the standoff, the company had sought to bypass union
negotiators and appeal directly to employees by distributing
copies of its proposal at plant gates and through the mail, and
insisting that its final offer be put to a vote.

<HEADLINE> 2 Die in Fresh Philippine Ship Wreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Two were drowned and one missing
in a sea mishap Sunday afternoon in a central Philippine province,
bringing the death toll to 25 from a series of sea accidents last
week, a Coast Guard officer confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Commander Crisolito Agustin, regional Coast Guard operation
chief in Cebu, the central Philippines, told Xinhua by telephone
that two were rescued when a motorboat with five people on board
capsized because of strong waves in Negro Occidental province.
</P>
<P>
The boat was on its way to Bantayan Island in Cebu from
Escalante Island in Negros Occidental, Agustin said.
</P>
<P>
Agustin also confirmed that rescue operations are still going
on in rough waters near Maripipi Island in central Biliran
province, where an inter-island passenger ferry sank early Friday
morning, killing at least 12 of the 137 people on board.
</P>
<P>
He said 10 people are still missing and 12 people are still
unaccounted for. The unaccounted for include those who are
unidentified and who survived but failed to register with the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
In another tragedy last Friday, a tourist boat overturned in
Manila Bay reportedly because of strong waves, killing seven Hong
Kong tourists.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, four people died when a motorboat went down off
Talisay Island in Masbate province, the southern tip of Luzon
Island.
</P>
<P>
These sea tragedies prompted President Fidel Ramos Monday to
order the maritime industry and the departments of transportation
and communications and national defense to undertake joint efforts
to ensure safety of life at sea.

<P>
BANGKOK, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand saw 7,607 workers laid
off during the first seven months of this year, exceeding the
5,008 recorded throughout last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase in unemployment was attributed to the country's
economic downturn, according to a report released by the Thai
Labor and Social Welfare Ministry Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 7,607 workers sacked this year, 1,403 were laid off
after the government announced the floating of the baht in early
July.
</P>
<P>
Among the sacked were many employees of the 58 finance firms
whose operations were suspended by the government in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
The ministry urged agencies concerned nationwide to set up
centers to prevent any further dismissals, while pledging to seek
every possible means to ensure that sacked workers receive
compensation according to the law.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also urged the public and private sectors to
provide low-interest loans and necessary training for those
workers sacked to help alleviate the hardship they face, while
calling on employers to seek alternative means to avoid lay-off.

<HEADLINE> Chinese NPC Delegation Visits Armenia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YEREVAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China has made remarkable
progress in its reform and it is of help for Armenia to use the
experience of countries including China as reference in its own
development.
</P>
<P>
Babken Araktsyan, speaker of the National Assembly of the
Republic of Armenia, said this today to Chinese National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee Vice-Chairman Wang Bingqian who
heads a visiting delegation here.
</P>
<P>
The visit by the Chinese delegation "is another step forward in
Sino-Armenia relations" and will further close links between the
two countries' parliaments, said Araktsyan.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the two parliaments are faced with enormous
tasks and it is encouraging to see them willing to deepen their
contacts and cooperate in politics, economy, culture, science and
other areas.
</P>
<P>
Araktsyan also hoped the two countries would further develop
economic cooperation, saying there is great potential in this area.
</P>
<P>
Wang conveyed greetings to Araktsyan from Chinese NPC Standing
Committee Chairman Qiao Shi and said that Sino-Armenia relations
have been developing smoothly ever since the two countries
established diplomatic relations in 1992.
</P>
<P>
To develop friendly and cooperative ties between the two on the
basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence will be
beneficial not only to the two peoples but also to world peace and
stability, he added.
</P>
<P>
China was glad to see broader exchanges in areas such as trade,
science and culture and closer ties between the two parliaments.
Wang also expressed his belief that Sino-Armenia relations would
enter a new stage because of the joint efforts of the two
governments.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting the two parliaments exchanged notes on
presenting 500,000 yuan (about 60,241 U.S. dollars) worth of
office equipment to the Armenian National Assembly by the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the Armenian National Assembly, the
Chinese delegation arrived in the Armenian capital of Yerevan at

<HEADLINE> Feature: Philippines Plagued by Sea Tragedies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines still holds the
record, of course, for the worst ever sea tragedies in the world
history.
</P>
<P>
This was the sinking of the inter-island vessel Dona Paz just
four days before Christmas in 1987. The collision between the
vessel and a tanker left 4,341 people dead.
</P>
<P>
The vessel, overloaded with passengers going home to central
Leyte province for the holidays, collided with the tanker Vector.
</P>
<P>
But this month, the Philippines broke another record, perhaps
also a world record, for three sea accidents taking place within
24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, strong winds and big waves overturned an
inter-island ferry, Kalibo Star, off Biliran province around
02:30, killing 12 persons and leaving at least 16 missing.
</P>
<P>
Around 15:00 that day, three people drowned and three were
missing when a small boat sank off Talisay town in Masbate.
</P>
<P>
Barely two hours later, the third tragedy occurred. A ferry
boat, King Roger, carrying 49 people, mostly tourists from Hong
Kong, China, was buffeted by strong winds and heavy waves 300
meters off the Manila Bay. Seven tourists from Hong Kong died in
the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Who should be blamed for the accidents?
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Coast Guard blamed overloading as the culprit. A
navy spokesman said that the 4.46-ton wooden-hulled King Roger was
built for only 17 people, but carried 49 people when it sank.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Kalibo Star was also overloaded with
steel bars and other construction materials, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Philippine Star said in an editorial: "Part of the
reason could be the government's failure to make ship operators
pay the proper price for lives lost due to greed or negligence."
</P>
<P>
"How many ship owners have been sent to jail? Does anyone even
remember who owned the inter-island ferry Dona Paz?" it asked.
</P>
<P>
"Since then, a number of major maritime disasters have also
occurred during the Christmas season, claiming hundreds of lives,"
the paper added.
</P>
<P>
A country with more than 7,000 islands, the Philippines has the
highest number of maritime accidents in Asia. A study by the Japan
International Cooperation Agency showed that the Philippines had a
yearly average of 224 sea accidents from 1982 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia had 270 accidents annually while Japan had 738
involving collisions, fire accidents and capsizing, it said.
</P>
<P>
But the number of casualties was higher in the Philippines,
where 661 people were dead or missing on a yearly average during
the 1982-1990 period. Indonesia had an average of 273 dead or
missing while Japan had 261 during the period.
</P>
<P>
The higher number of casualties in the Philippines during that
period was due to the collision of Dona Paz and the tanker Vector,
and the sinking of the ferry Marilyn in 1988.
</P>
<P>
In October 1988, about 500 people died or were missing when the
ferry Marilyn sank in a storm in the central Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Though the death toll from last Friday's three accidents was
much less compared with the 1987 and 1988 ones, the tragedies have
shocked the Philippines and the rest of the world, because of the
death of seven foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
To prevent such tragedies, the Philippine authorities have
detained Rogelio Alenzula, owner of King Roger, and its skipper
Romeo Parcon. They were charged Monday with "reckless imprudence
resulting in multiple homicide" due to the accident, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Also shocked by the tragedies, President Fidel Ramos Monday
called on the Department of Transportation and Communications, the
Department of National Defense and the entire maritime industry to
undertake joint efforts to ensure the safety of life at sea.
</P>
<P>
The local press also appealed to the people working in the
maritime industry to draw lessons from last week's tragedies by
observing safety regulations, which seem to have been often
ignored.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Foreign Minister to Push U.N. Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Foreign Minister Gennady
Udovenko says he will actively boost United Nations reforms during
his tenure as the president of the 52nd U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko told the Russian Interfax news agency that
U.N. reforms should, firstly, focus on strengthening its role in
handling a range of priority issues, such as peace, security and
disarmament as well as economic, social, humanitarian, ecological
and human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
The 52nd U.N. General Assembly is scheduled to open on
September 16 in New York, and is supposed to work out steps for
the materialization of U.N. reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, the reforms would be no easy tasks since different
member countries or groups had their own interests, Udovenko noted.
</P>
<P>
With the end of the "Cold War" period, the United Nations
should reposition itself, Udovenko added. As the would-be
president for the U.N. General Assembly, he saw himself shouldering
heavy responsibilities in the fulfillment of reforms already
underway.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko will continue to be the Ukrainian Foreign Minister
while he serves as the the president of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He said he would take an objective attitude towards various
issues discussed at the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ukraine had a special interest in developing
relations with countries in Africa, South Asia and the Pacific
region, Udovenko added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Improve Measurement Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is stepping up its
efforts to create a national measurement center to better the
country's measurement work to help improve the quality of its
industrial products and strengthen its scientific research.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment is speeding
up its work to set up the National Metrological Institute to
provide primary measurement standards and calibration services
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's industrial products represented an increasing share
of the country's export volume, so quality control to meet
international specifications has become crucial for Thailand,
officials from the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Accurate measurement is also vital to other activities like
scientific research and development, pollution control, medical
services, etc., they added.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today said that Thailand lacks high-accuracy
measurement or calibration equipment and it has to send its
measurement instruments and equipment abroad for calibration,
which has resulted in unreliable measurements.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is reportedly planning to combine its metrological
service provided by its agencies, including the Science Service
Department and the Thailand Institute of Scientific and
Technological Research, and put it under the national measurement
center.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Displaced Tamils Keep Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- About 800 displaced Sri Lankan
Tamils who are stranded at Trincomalee town in the east Monday
launched a fast, demanding that the government immediately send
them back to Jaffna Peninsula in the north.
</P>
<P>
They are among the 8,000 persons registered with the government
to return to Jaffna but have been stranded in Trincomalee as the
passenger boat service to Jaffna has been suspended since July 3,
according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
There are reportedly about 2,000 others waiting for transport
to Jaffna Peninsula from Trincomalee town.
</P>
<P>
Since August last year, about 60,000 persons had been
transported to Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
But with the suspension of the boat service in July, many have
been stranded in and around Trincomalee.
</P>
<P>
The owners of the vessels are unwilling to expose the safety of
their vessels and crew to possible attacks by the Tamil rebels who
have been fighting for a separate state in the north and east of
the country since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that those who had left their home due to the
fighting and were waiting for transport to the north, were mainly
teachers, students, workers, elderly persons and children.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Develop Indigenous Medicines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is
planning to develop the cultivation of indigenous medicinal plants
and herbs for which there is an increased demand locally and a
vibrant export market in Western countries, particularly Europe.
</P>
<P>
According to Ministry of Forestry and Environment sources
today, the ministry has granted 6.8 million U.S. dollars to
develop the cultivation and embark on a home garden medicinal
plant and herb cultivation program in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the ministry are touring the country conducting
awareness programs in the villages. An awareness program was held
at Kataragama, about 200 kilometers south of Colombo last week,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
A survey reveals that Sri Lanka spends as much as 500,000 U.S.
dollars annually on the import of indigenous medicines and this
valuable foreign exchange could be conserved with the development
of the cultivation of indigenous medicinal plants and herbs.
</P>
<P>
The sources said there was a significant shift among Westerners
to Eastern indigenous treatment.
</P>
<P>
Hence, there was also great export potential for Eastern
indigenous medicines, they added.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Overhaul Its Research System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Italy will thoroughly overhaul its
research system this year so as to meet the country's changing
industrial needs.
</P>
<P>
The shake-up stems from recognition that the present state of
Italian research is not sufficient for future industrial
development, the ANSA news agency today quoted University
Minister, Luigi Berlinguer, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Berlinguer, who is also minister for scientific research,
outlined his plans for the future of national research in a
special report to be considered by parliament.
</P>
<P>
The plans include setting-up of a new coordination center, the
creation of new bodies to oversee research work, new functions for
existing research centers and, most importantly, a reorganization
of financing to draw more cash from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Berlinguer recognized the need for a research system which
would put Italy in line with other industrialized countries. It
would marry the politics of research and innovation to other
strategic state decisions, from questions of national security to
economic relations, ANSA said.
</P>
<P>
According to the plans, the new tendency would be towards
decentralization, with major autonomy for research bodies, a
redefinition and simplification of their roles accompanied by a
reduction in their numbers.
</P>
<P>
A new "committee for research and technology" (CRT), composed
of science experts from Italy and abroad, nominated by the prime
minister himself, would report directly to the prime minister and
the university minister.
</P>
<P>
Wider research targets and budgets would be under the control
of the government's existing Economic Planning Committee (CIPE),
Berlinguer said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Italian scientific and economic community
would provide a national consultancy network and it was hoped that
a "national assembly" would meet regularly to decide key issues
of policy and financing, ANSA said.

MOSCOW, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian "Progress M-35" cargo
ship redocked successfully with Mir space station today at 4:52

</P>
<P>
The redocking was conducted by Russian cosmonaut Vladimir

cables were intentionally disconnected in order to seal off the
module.
</P>
<P>
The Progress M-35 cargo ship, which entered the orbit in July,

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian PM: Understand Domestic Situations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Prime Minister Valeriy
Pustovoitenko stressed the need for government officials to
understand domestic situations at a press conference today after
he visited Poltava and Sumy Oblasts on August 15 and 16.
</P>
<P>
He said he will make frequent working trips to the regions of
the country and also send his subordinates down there.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Pustovoitenko toured the Akhtyrka Oil and Gas
Company in Sumy. The Akhtyrka oil field, which has been exploited
since 1961, accounts for 50 percent of oil and about eight percent
of natural gas extracted in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
He hoped to extend the life-span of the oil field to at least
50 years with an average oil production of 2.5 million tons every
year.
</P>
<P>
In view of continuously shrinking imports of Russian crude oil
to Ukraine, which once accounted for 80 percent of Ukraine's
consumption but now barely reach 40 percent, he viewed domestic
oil extraction as an increasingly vital factor to national
security.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Akhtyrka oil field, the Ukrainian prime minister
also visited the Sumy Chemical Production Company, which is
Ukraine's largest manufacturer of phosphate fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prime minister blamed some of his Cabinet
members for traveling abroad instead of visiting local provinces
to gather first-hand information.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The average price of the OPEC
crude seven slipped to 18.04 U.S. dollars per barrel last week, 52
cents down from the 18.56 dollars in the previous week, the OPEC's
secretariat said today.
</P>

started early July that saw 17.86 dollars per barrel, up from
June's average 17.37 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The price began to rally since the end of June after oil
ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) agreed to freeze their production quotas for six months to
boost prices.
</P>
<P>
The price had fallen steadily from a peak of 25 dollars per
barrel in January because of Iraq's possible reentry into the
world oil market and the OPEC members' violation of oil production
quotas.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Hits New Low Against US Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah hit
another low Monday surpassing the 3,000 level against the U.S.
dollar as share prices slumped 2.3 percent, local press today
quoted dealers here as saying.
</P>
<P>
Spot rupiah, which opened at 2,930/45, plunged to 3,005 at
midday trading before recovering to 2,970/2,995 at close.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah weakened against the dollar after the central bank
scrapped its intervention band last Thursday, effectively floating
the unit, on sustained speculative attacks on all regional
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah, which started the year at 2,363 to the dollar, had
fallen almost 27 percent by Monday, with further weakness seen
possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the Jakarta Stock Exchange, share prices dropped
2.3 percent Monday, with composite index closing 19.928 points
lower at 597.778.
</P>
<P>
Stock dealers said the index dropped 35.187 points to 582.512
during the launch break after descending 49 points to 565.78 in
the morning session.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the fall to the unclear direction of the
rupiah.

<HEADLINE> PSG Penalised for European Cup Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Paris St Germain's European Cup
campaign suffered a major setback on Monday when UEFA penalised
them two goals for fielding a suspended player against Steaua
Bucharest in a preliminary round first leg match.
</P>
<P>
UEFA had altered the club's 3-2 defeat in Bucharest last week
to a 3-0 loss after ruling that defender Laurent Fournier was
ineligible.
</P>
<P>
Fournier, who played the whole match against Steaua, should not
have been on the pitch because of his bookings from last season.
</P>
<P>
The punishment meant that PSG will have to score at least three
goals in the return match in Paris on August 27 to have a hope of
progressing to extra time and a penalty shoot-out.

The Australian

correction reverberated throughout the Asia-Pacific region
following a plunge on Wall Street last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries plunged 76 points within 30 minutes before
pegging back some of the losses to finish at 2618.5, down 47.7
points, or 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian coalition government has split over heroin
trial in Canberra, with Health Minister Michael Wooldridge
admitting publicly yesterday it was virtually dead even before the
government examines issue today.
</P>
<P>
Some regions are preparing for supplying heroin to
drug-addicted people in a controlled way following the approval of
proposals on heroin trial last month by most of Australia's state
and territory health ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Toyota will invest up to 740 million U.S. dollars in
Melbourne, Victoria, over the next seven years, as it launches a
new family car to take on the Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore,
the cars produced by Toyota's competitors in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- Australia must deregulate its labor market more if it wants

<HEADLINE> Italian Sports Chief Reacts Angrily to Attack on Rome's Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rome, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian sports chief Mario Pescante
today responded angrily to a sharp attack on Rome's campaign to
host the 2004 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Pescante, president of the Italian Olympic Committee, said
articles such as the one in the Milan daily Corriere della Sera on
Friday, "are acts of terrorism, more serious, more dangerous than
the bombs which exploded in Stockholm."
</P>
<P>
The Mayor of Rome, Francesco Rutelli, and the head of the Rome
2004 committee, Raffacle Ranucci, have both announced libel suits
against the newspaper and the author of the article, Ernesto Galli
della Loggia.
</P>
<P>
Loggia in the article claimed that the only way to win the
right to stage the Games was by bribing members of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC), and he speculated that
those promoting Rome's candidacy were engaged in such "dirty work".
</P>
<P>
Pescante said the damage done by the article would be
considerable, "We give the impression of a country in which debate
has fallen to the lowest level, to that of trashy article."
</P>
<P>
The IOC is due to decide on September 5 which city will host
the 2004 Games. Other short-listed candidates are Athens, Buenos
Aires, Cape Town and Stockholm.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan for Sustained Dialogue with India: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari expressed his hope that a sustained and structured
dialogue between Pakistan and India would address all outstanding
issues between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want confrontation and we believe that with
sincerity and serious purpose, all outstanding issues including
the Kashmir dispute can be resolved through peaceful means,"
Leghari said when he met with a U.S. congressional delegation
here.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Leghari and the U.S. congressional
delegation exchanged views on the regional situation and
Pakistan's relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
He briefed the delegation on recent development in
Pakistan-India relations and emphasized that the recent decision
of the Pakistani government to initiate dialogue with India was a
positive development.
</P>
<P>
About Afghanistan, Leghari said the fratricidal conflict was
adding to the miseries of the Afghan nation.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan being a neighboring state was interested in the
restoration of peace and stability in Afghanistan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Explaining Pakistan's policy towards Afghanistan, the President
said: "We have no favorites and therefore we have no preference
for one group over the other."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he added, supports intra-Afghan dialogue for the
establishment of a broad-based government, representative of all
ethnic groups in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to extend full support to the efforts of the U.N.
for restoration of peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about Pakistan-U.S. relations, Leghari said both
countries have a long history of friendship and such relationship
will be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
The visiting U.S. congressmen said that as a body, the Congress
desires to maintain and encourage good relations with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The congressmen said they value the long standing relations
with Pakistan which despite some ups and downs remains an
important partner for the U.S.

<HEADLINE> German Banks Do Not Expect Major Rate Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Federation of German
Banks said today that it does not expect any major increases in
German interest rates for the time being.
</P>
<P>
In its August economic report, the German banks group predicted
that the German central bank, the Bundesbank, was likely to
tighten up money supply cautiously in the next few months "in
order to avoid overreaction on the markets."
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank might limit its move to just raising the
securities repurchase rate which applies to short-term liquidity
provided to banks, the federation said.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank has threatened to raise interest rates in order
to arrest strong rises in consumer prices and check the German
mark's steady decline against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Despite the threat, it chose to leave the repurchase rate
unchanged at 3.0 percent on August 12. The two benchmark rates,
the discount rate and the Lombard rate, have also been left intact
at historical lows for over one year.
</P>
<P>
It is widely assumed that a rate increase in Germany carries
the risk that it could choke economic growth and undermine Bonn's
efforts to combat unemployment higher than 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The weak German mark, which has fallen about 18 percent against
the dollar so far this year, makes imports to Germany more
expensive but helps the export sector that has been so crucial to
Germany's nascent recovery from a five-year economic slump.
</P>
<P>
Due to declining labor costs and relatively stable growth in
money supply, German banks did not see any acute inflation danger
in Germany.
</P>
<P>
They also saw little danger of major increases in long-term
interest rates in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urges Joint Efforts to Resolve Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The British government today
appealed to the international community to make joint efforts to
put an end to the stalemate of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with UN mediator and special Cyprus envoy
Diego Cordovez today, Britain's Foreign Office minister Doug
Henderson said, "We are all determined that the parties should
continue to be brought together and a solution should be sought
for this difficult situation."
</P>
<P>
"We are determined that the situation should not be allowed to
fester. All countries must bring their best endeavors to try to
help specific parts of the negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, a former British colony, became an independent republic
in 1960 and entered the British Commonwealth in 1961. The island's
Greek and Turkish communities have been locked in fierce disputes
and armed clashes over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, which stationed international peacekeeping
forces in Cyprus since 1964, has been trying to find a proper
solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Henderson noted that the Cyprus people should realize that the
time had come for them to bury their enmity and start living
together in peace.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Cyprus have to recognize this is a changing
situation and that they need to make the changes in the same way
changes have been made in other parts of the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Cordovez, who is due to visit Cyprus
later this year, said, "I feel that support from Britain and other
governments has to continue. If we maintain consultations and
adopt a coherent approach, we can get out of this problem."

<HEADLINE> German Economy on Course for 2.5 Percent Growth: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- German economy is expanding at a
pace which will enable the government to meet its earlier
projections of 2.5 percent growth for 1997, the German economics
minister said today.
</P>
<P>
According to Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, the German
economy grew by 1 percent in the second quarter from the previous
quarter and was up between 2.5 percent and 3.0 percent from a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
This would bring Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) growth
to 2 percent in the first half of 1997, corresponding with Bonn's
projections of 2.5 percent growth for the whole year and 2.5 to 3
percent for 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
While domistic demand remained weak, German exports continued
to expand and were expected to grow faster than the growth of
world trade in 1997, Rexrodt said.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that German unemployment was still on the
increase and could only expect a modest decline next year.
</P>
<P>
The overall unemployment was likely to be over 4.3 million in
1997, up 350,000 from the previous year. The government expected
joblessness to decline by 100,000 in 1998, Rexrodt said.

<HEADLINE> Germany Warns Kenya Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany today warned people
visiting Kenya of "the dramatically worsening security situation"
there, advising them in particular not to travel to the northeast
area of Kenya, where crimes are prevalent.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry also suggested that travelers should avoid
the area between Malindi and Lamu where Somali gangs are active.
</P>
<P>
"With the start of election campaigns, regional and limited
acts of violent conflict linked with opposition and student
demonstrations must be expected," said the ministry in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The capital of Nairobi and the port city of Mombasa are high
crime areas and tourists should avoid both city centers after
dark, in addition to all overland roads, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that more than 30 people have been killed in a
series of attacks in and around Mombasa over the past week.
</P>
<P>
Foreign tourists in Kenya are facing growing street crime,
robbery, assault and car-jackings, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The German Foreign Ministry also voiced opposition to travel by
car north of the entrances to the Samburu National park and to the
Shava National Reserve in regions north of Lake Baringo and
Kitale.
</P>
<P>
People intended to visit Lake Turkana should only travel there
by air, it added.
</P>
<P>
It meanwhile noted that it was not telling tourists to stay
away from Kenya, saying, "There is no general travel warning for
Kenya."
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 German tourists visit Kenya each year, it was
reported.

<HEADLINE> Dow Bounces Back From 76 Points Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street bounced
back today, with a burst of buying by bargain hunters.
</P>
<P>
The Dow rebounded over the final two hours of trading, erasing
a 76-point slide and then rising 108.70 to 7,803.36.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a slim margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 517.16 million
shares as against 530.34 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market measures also rallied into the close, led by the
technology group, which had been struggling after a disappointing
profit report from Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list, rose 11.68 to 912.49.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index, which lost nearly 25 points Friday,
rebounded from a 16-point loss today and rose 7.49 to 1,569.52.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 4.45 to 473.55, but the American
Stock Exchange composite index slipped 0.02 to 634.59.
</P>
<P>
The session started smoothly, with most indexes edging higher
as bargain hunters tried to take advantage of Friday's sharp
decline.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that even with Friday's 247-point slide -- the
Dow's second biggest point drop ever after the 508-point Black
Monday crash of October 19, 1987 -- the famed blue-chip gauge is
still up more than 19 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
No rate hike is expected at Tuesday's Opening Committee meeting
of the Federal Reserve, but central bank officials could take
action when they meet again in September.

<HEADLINE> US Welcomes Israel's Partial Transfer of Tax Refunds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
welcomed Israel's decision to release 30 percent of tax refunds to
the Palestinians, and pressed on the Israelis to lift all the ban
to that tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
"We welcomed this decision. We believe this is a step in the
right direction.... We feel a little better today than we did
yesterday about the prospects for getting the peace process back
on track," State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
approved the transfer of 30 percent of the refunds -- 12 million
dollars -- it has frozen after the July 30 suicide bombing attack
at a Jerusalem market that killed 14 Israelis and two bombers.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's decision came after the Palestinians began to help
the Israelis in the bombing investigation, the prime minister's
chief adviser David Dar Illan said. "We got the information we
asked for on the terrorist strike."
</P>
<P>
But 12 million dollars was far less than the 70 million dollars
Israel owes to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"We don't accept these compromises," Palestinian Economics
Minister Maher Masri said. "We need to be paid in full, and we
need to be paid on time."
</P>
<P>
Rubin also said it was "counterproductive" by withholding the
tax revenue, and the United States believes the money should be
released now. "We think that is not the best way to encourage
cooperation" by withholding the money, he said.

<HEADLINE> Rubin: China Has Not Violated Commitment on Arms Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government believes
that China has taken no action to violate its commitment on arms
sales, the State Department announced here today.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that China has taken no actions that we have been
able to confirm to violate the commitment it's made on May 11,
1996," said spokesman James Rubin at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to an allegation by Washington Times Saturday
that China has violated a pledge not to provide nuclear weapons
materials to facilities in Pakistan operating without
international safeguards.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that the story "fundamentally and seriously
misquoted" a report from the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency (ACDA) and "completely got it 180 degrees wrong."
</P>
<P>
The ACDA report said, "China stated that it would provide no
assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities. Our current
information does not provide a basis for concluding that China has
acted inconsistently with that statement."
</P>
<P>
"He (the Washington Times reporter) wrote the opposite," Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
"Our view, unlike the view quoted and attributed to the United
States government, is that we believe that China has taken no
action to violate that commitment," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
China has consistently stated its opposition to weapons
proliferation and taken part in varied worldwide disarmament
activities. In recent years, China and the U.S. have conducted
dialogues on the non-proliferation issue in order to seek a common
ground for cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Force Italy to Goalless Draw at Universiade Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CATANIA, Sicily, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Brazil forced hosts Italy
to a goalless draw at the opening match of the Universiade football
tournament at Trapani on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian team, technically better but physically weaker
than their Italian opponents, survived ruthless attacks from the
Italian eleven, especially in the last 25 minutes, and held on to the
final whistle.
</P>
<P>
The first half was a even game as neither team could gain an upper
hand over the others. But as the Brazilians appeared tired in the
second half, the Italian team began to take advantage.
</P>
<P>
Though the Italian launched fierce attacks at the Brazilian
goal, their efforts were turned down by tough defence from the
Brazilians and at the same time, most of their shots were wide or high
into the sky and cast little threat to the Brazilian goal.
</P>
<P>
According to the official results issued by the organising
committee, China trounced Czech Republic 4-0 while the United States
beat Nigeria 3-0. China led group D with better goal difference
over the United States.

<HEADLINE> Report: US Development of Nukes Undermines Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
undermining an international treaty on banning all nuclear test by
working hard at updating the design of its nuclear arms, said a
report to be released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Declassified excerpts from an Energy Department document that
includes the government's plan to improve the reliability of its
nuclear weapons arsenal were first reported in today's editions of
The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
The document obtained by the Natural Resources Defense Council,
a private organization in Washington that advocates arms control
and monitors U.S. arms programs, states, "The laboratories are
currently working on programs to provide new or modified designs."
</P>
<P>
The arms control group distributed copies of its own report,
End Run, citing the declassified document of the Energy
Department. The group planned to make the report public at a news
conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"While the U.S. government is not now designing or producing
advanced new types of nuclear weapons, it is enlarging its
capabilities to do so, while continuing to design nuclear
explosive packages to replace warheads on existing systems such as
the Navy's Trident II missiles," said Christopher Paine, a
co-author of the report.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, Paine and his partner Matthew McKinzie said
that some of the ongoing and planned activities of the U.S.
administration come into conflict with its policies on nuclear
test ban.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. sought and achieved both the indefinite extension of
the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1995 and the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty in 1996, partly on the strength of assurances that
it would not design new nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Paine said the document, Stockpile Stewardship and Management
Program, shows that the U.S. is still operating as if the Cold War
has not ended.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the U.S. government is planning to
develop within the coming decade comprehensive three-dimensional,
computer simulations of nuclear weapons performance, a "virtual
testing" capability.
</P>
<P>
The government also plans to design, simulate, and flight-test
weapon prototypes, and certify both the nuclear and
stockpile-to-target performance of new weapon designs as possible
replacements for existing stockpile weapons.
</P>
<P>
"If implemented over the next decade as planned," said Paine,
"this program is poised to erode important U.S. non-proliferation
objectives as well as undermine political assurances the U.S.
government has supplied to other nations."
</P>
<P>
However, Energy Department officials insist the plans described
in the document only modernize old designs. They said the goals
include increasing the life of warheads and their safety and
security but not their explosive power.

<HEADLINE> US Agrees to Join Negotiations on Land Mines Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States announced
today that it will participate in negotiations to agree on a
150-nation treaty banning antipersonnel land mines by year's end.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the U.S. government will continue to work on
establishing a global ban through a U.N. Conference on
Disarmament, a longer process it prefers to the country-by-country
treaty, the White House said in a statement from Martha's
Vineyard, where President Bill Clinton and his family began a
three-week vacation Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation in the Conference on Disarmament on new steps in
this area remains essential since that body's membership includes
most of the major producers and exporters of antipersonnel land
mines," White House spokesman Barry Toiv said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is committed to pursuing the most promising
opportunities for ending the use of antipersonnel land mines,
which every year cause enormous suffering around the world."
</P>
<P>
The United States had been holding out for negotiating only the
global deal through the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The proposed 150-nation treaty, to be negotiated further in
Ottawa, Canada, beginning September 1 and signed by December,
would ban mines designed to kill and injure people. But it would
not ban antipersonnel mines meant to stop tanks or other military
vehicles.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Curb Losses to End Off Early Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
all defied expectations of big losses and ended off early lows
today following last Friday's steep drop on both sides of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares bounced back from
an early 1.5 percent slide as the big stock market crash forecast
over the weekend failed to materialize.
</P>
<P>
Bargain hunters and stronger futures gave the market a boost,
dealers said. The index had fallen by 86.5 points to 4,779.3
initially following Wall Street's huge losses Friday, but it
recovered strongly to end just 30.8 points or 0.63 percent down at
4,835.0.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares ended lower on the back of Friday's
sharp losses on Wall Street, but well off its 4 percent decline
early today, with the DAX-30 index dropping 74.26 points, or 1.79
percent to close at 4,078.60.
</P>
<P>
Leading stocks in Paris had lost over 3 percent at one stage of
the session on the back of the Dow's plunge Friday and a decline
by the dollar before ending down 51.71 points, or 1.77 percent, at
the close to stand at 2,870.13.
</P>
<P>
Market sentiment was aided by a revival in the dollar, said
traders.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Report Shows Women Percentage  Increasing in Criminal Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The latest Justice Department
report shows that a growing percentage of the adults on probation
and parole across the United States are women.
</P>
<P>
Although men still commit many more crimes, there has been a
"dramatic increase in the number of women arrested" over the past
decade, The Washington Post today quoted an official of the
department's Bureau of Justice Statistics as saying.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, there were more than 650,000 women on probation, 21
percent of all probationers, and 79,000 women on parole, 11
percent of that total. In 1990, women made up 18 percent of all
probationers and 8 percent of all parolees.
</P>
<P>
The report said there were almost 3.9 million adults on
probation or parole at the end of 1996, an increase of 3.4 percent
from the year before. Another 1.6 million were locked up in jail
or prison, putting the total correctional population in the
country at a record 5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
Officials said there has been an increasing use of
incarceration since 1985, when only one of four adults under
correctional supervision was in jail or prison. In 1996, the ratio
was three to 10.
</P>
<P>
Overall, women accounted for 17 percent of all arrests in 1986
and 20 percent in 1995, the most recent year of which those
numbers are available. Fraud, larceny, theft and drug offenses are
more prevalent among women than men.
</P>
<P>
The study also shows more probationers and parolees are being
locked up for new offenses. In 1996, 18 percent of all
probationers released for supervision were later incarcerated for
a rule violation or a new crime, compared with 8 percent in 1985.
Forty percent of those exiting parole were put behind bars again,
compared with 35 percent in 1985.

<HEADLINE> US: DPRK Light-Water Reactor Ground-Breaking "Milestone" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
called Tuesday's ground-breaking of the construction of the
light-water nuclear reactors in the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) "an important milestone" to achieve the
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"We think that it increases the chances that North Korea's
nuclear program will stay frozen and ultimately be dismantled,"
State Department spokesman James Rubin said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK agreed to dismantle its graphite nuclear reactors in
1994 on condition that the United States and its allies should
help build two light-water reactors.
</P>
<P>
And the United States, South Korea and Japan have since formed
a consortium, called the Korean Energy Development Organization,
to provide about 5 billion dollars for the project.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the DPRK's freeze and dismantling of its nuclear
program is "monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency,
and "it is nearing completion of a project with the United States
to safely store its spent nuclear fuel" of the graphite reactors.
</P>
<P>
"The bargain that we struck with North Korea is working," Rubin
said.
