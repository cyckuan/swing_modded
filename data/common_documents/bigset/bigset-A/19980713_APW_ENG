	   PARIS (AP) _ A car plowed into a group of fans celebrating
France's World Cup victory early Monday, injuring about 60 people,
some seriously, rescue officials said.
	   The accident occurred as the capital exploded in joy after
France beat Brazil for the championship. At least a million people
streamed to the Champs-Elysees to celebrate.
	   A woman zigzagging down the avenue from the Arc de Triomphe in a
black Volkswagen plowed into the partying fans, injuring about 60 _
seven seriously, officials said. None was critically injured.
	   ``Apparently it was a crazy car, which drove for several dozen
meters (yards), knocking over people on its way,'' said Cmdr.
Philippe Lavoil, a rescue official. Two hundred rescue workers in
dozens of ambulances arrived to treat the victims.
	   Helmeted riot police lined the avenue, keeping diehard revelers
and curiosity-seekers at bay.
	   The driver was attacked by the crowd before police intervened,
according to witnesses. The car was seen lying on its side.
	   The driver ``has fled but has been identified,'' Lavoil said.
	   Reports that the driver was apparently drunk could not be
confirmed. There were suggestions she may simply have panicked when
the car was set upon by crowds of revelers.
	   Witnesses said the woman dragged some people for several meters
(yards) after hitting them.
	   One witness, Stephan Gueroui, 24, said he'd seen the car coming
down the Champs-Elysees the wrong way, then veered diagonally
across the avenue.
	   ``A car was coming down the Champs-Elysees in the wrong
direction,'' he said. ``It hit a group who was crossing.''
	   His face was swollen and bleeding. He said he'd been caught in a
brawl and gotten hit with a can.

	   PARIS (AP) _ From plazas to boulevards to cafes to living rooms,
from the smallest villages to the biggest cities, a single glorious
chant echoed across France: ``We are the champions!''
	   France's stunning World Cup victory over Brazil Sunday night
sent the country into a paroxysm of patriotic celebration not seen
since the Liberation.
	   ``The day of glory has arrived,'' France's national anthem goes,
and on this night the French sang it everywhere, and like they
truly believed it.
	   The merrymaking was marred, however, by an accident on the
Champs-Elysees, the grand avenue crowned by the Arc de Triomphe. An
apparently panicked driver careened out of control and plowed into
a crowd of revelers, injuring 60 people, seven seriously.
	   The celebratory mood of the early morning hours quickly turned
into horror as dozens of ambulances and 200 rescue workers
converged on the scene. Some of the victims were treated on the
ground. None were critically injured, however, officials said.
	   It was a sour note in an otherwise ecstatic night for the
French, who have never had a World Cup championship despite having
invented the tournament.
	   This was the first time a host team won the World Cup since
Argentina's victory in 1978. Brazil won the trophy in 1994, its
fourth time.
	   ``Amazing! World champions for the first time!'' shouted
Christian Junker, 19, carrying one end of a giant French flag as he
rushed out of the Saint-Denis stadium after the game.
	   He and two friends _ all with faces painted the red, white and
blue of the flag _ had traveled from the Lorraine region and slept
the previous night on the grass, near the Eiffel Tower.
	   The three, all students, took issue with the prevailing view of
French fans as less devoted than those in other countries.
	   ``Not true! We believed in our team all along,'' said Julien
Charoin, 20. And the triumph, they said, would mean a new sense of
unity for France, which has its problems with racial and class
tensions.
	   ``This victory brings everyone together,'' said Cedric Trunzler,
21. ``There are many races and religions here. But we are all
French. We all won.''
	   France found itself unified by a multiracial team. Lilian
Thuram, a black from the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, scored two
goals against Croatia to win the semifinal.
	   On Sunday, though, it was the beloved Zinedine Zidane, the son
of an Algerian night watchman in Marseille, who was the hero. His
two goals gave France an unbeatable lead. For the icing on the
cake, Emmanuel Petit scored a third with less than a minute to go.
	   Zidane far outshined Brazil's Ronaldo, who nearly missed the
game with an injured ankle.
	   ``Brazil was comatose,'' said one of its dejected fans, Cesar
Lapaglia, 27. ``We just didn't play,'' he said into his drink at a
Brazilian bar in the Left Bank. ``And France deserved everything it
got.''
	   ``I'm going back to my hotel,'' said Jose Luiz Pascoal, 38, who
came from Rio de Janeiro to support the Brazilian team.
	   ``I just don't know what happened,'' he said outside the
stadium. ``I'm very, very sad. Won't be able to work for a week.''
	   When the final whistle sounded, shouts of ``We are the
champions'' echoed from crowds moving toward the Champs-Elysees
from all over Paris: the Left Bank, the packed City Hall plaza, the
elegant shopping streets of the Champs-Elysees area.
	   They partied in front of the vast Louvre museum and the
manicured Tuileries gardens, and also in front of ``Paris Sexy
Folies'' in a gritty northern neighborhood.
	   Youths used beer cans for soccer balls, or anything else they
could find.
	   Traffic was impossible. Cars that could manage to move at all
were often surrounded by groups of raucous fans. People begged
taxis to stop, usually to no avail.
	   It wasn't much different in other parts of the country. In
Bordeaux, Lille and Marseille, thousands clogged central squares
and jumped into fountains to celebrate.
	   In Brazil, where a fifth victory was expected, fans expressed
disbelief. Many Brazilians had tears in their eyes as they stared
at a large public television screen mounted on Copacabana beach.
	   ``We lost, but second is still great,'' said Marinede da Costa,
a 28-year-old secretary who watched on the Copacabana screen.
	   But the glory belonged to France, and as the sun came up Monday,
the car horns were still honking away.

Harvard-educated mayor, banana tycoon both claim win in Ecuador

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ A Harvard-educated mayor with a reputation
for honesty and a populist banana tycoon both claimed victory in
Sunday's presidential runoff in politically unstable Ecuador.
	   Centrist Quito Mayor Jamil Mahuad celebrated an apparent victory
over Alvaro Noboa, the country's richest man, after a respected
exit poll announced that he had an ample 7-point lead.
	   But the lead shrank abruptly, narrowing to 2.6 percent by the
time the final poll results were tallied, creating a technical tie.
The poll had a margin for error of 1.6 percentage points.
	   Poll organizers did not explain what caused the sudden shift.
	   According to the poll, which was sponsored by seven television
stations, Mahuad had 51.3 percent to just over 48.7 percent for
Noboa. The poll has been accurate in past votes.
	   A second exit poll by the private company Cedatos gave Mahuad a
7-point lead.
	   The winner will replace interim President Fabian Alarcon, ending
17 months of transitional government that began when Congress
removed eccentric former President Abdala Bucaram from power for
``mental incapacity'' in February 1997.
	   In keeping with the tradition of political surrealism in this
Andean nation of 12 million people, Noboa declared himself the
winner as well, saying his private poll showed him with a lead of 3
percentage points.
	   ``Ecuadoreans! I thank God for this spectacular victory,'' said
Noboa, 47, who vowed to send his supporters into vote-counting
stations to make sure officials did not rob him of his supposed
win.
	   For two days following Bucaram's removal in 1997, three people
had simultaneously claimed to be president of Ecuador. Congress
named Alarcon as president.
	   Authorities called for calm and asked supporters not to
celebrate victory prematurely.
	   ``We must ask people to wait for the official results, which
will be known on Wednesday,'' said Eduardo Villaquiran, vice
president of Ecuador's elections board.
	   It was the sixth time in the past two years that Ecuadoreans
have been called on to vote in elections or referendums.
	   Many Ecuadoreans disgusted by the political circus did not vote,
choosing instead to watch the World Cup soccer final pitting Brazil
against France, which coincided with the voting.
	   ``We are all united, hoping for victory. Brazil's victory, of
course,'' said unemployed electrician Jose Caiza. Brazil lost.
	   Mahuad's campaign was boosted by national embarrassment over
Bucaram's chaotic six-month tenure, which was plagued by strikes,
protests and corruption charges.
	   Mahuad, who has a master's degree in public administration from
Harvard University in the United States, charged that Noboa was the
disgraced former president's puppet candidate.
	   Noboa ran the Central Bank during Bucaram's government and was
his political ally. From exile in Panama, Bucaram supported Noboa's
candidacy.
	   Noboa called himself the candidate of the poor despite his
wealth. He offered to create one million jobs and dish out the
``beating of the century'' to Ecuador's discredited political
elite.
	   Fearing Noboa's populism, Ecuador's major political parties and
much of its business community backed Mahuad.
	   ``If the new president is another populist, we are going to
continue being Latin America's political oddity,'' said political
analyst Fabian Corrales.
	   The winner will inherit a country with its democracy in tatters
and its economy in crisis. Ecuador has been staggered by El
Nino-driven floods earlier this year, poverty and falling prices
for its main export, oil.
	   His first task will be to rebuild much of the roads, bridges and
schools on Ecuador's Pacific coast, which were washed away by El
Nino's rains.
	   ``Given the depth of this crisis, Ecuador doesn't need a
president _ we've had many. We need a leader who will give us back
our faith,'' said columnist Jorge Ortiz of the national newspaper
Hoy.

Thai foreign minister tells Australia not to withdraw from region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia must not withdraw from
Southeast Asia in response to the region's economic crisis, Thai
Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan told Australian businesses and the
government Monday.
	   ``No country is an island,'' Surin told reporters. ``We have
been integrated, it cannot be reversed.''
	   Surin said he was in Australia to familiarize himself with the
nation's current views on the Asian financial crisis and to
convince Australian business of opportunities in Asia.
	   ``The one message that I would like to impart to the businessmen
down here in Australia is to stay engaged, because the fundamentals
in the economies of Southeast Asia, particularly in the ASEAN, are
still very, very strong.
	   Australia was one leg of the tripod of Southeast Asian
prosperity, the other two being Japan and Thailand, he said.
	   ``Australia has convinced all of us in Southeast Asia and
Thailand that you belong to the region and this is not the time to
withdraw or to shrink back because if there is a vacuum there will
be others who will want to fill the vacuum,'' Surin said.
	   Australia and Thailand could only benefit from each other's
co-operation and support.
	   Surin also said said that Thailand is not concerned about the
emergence of Pauline Hanson's right-wing populist One Nation party,
which opposes Asian immigration.
	   Surin said he will meet with Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
on Tuesday to discuss issues including the political situation in
Cambodia.
	   He will also meet with Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister
Tim Fischer and Defense Minister Ian McLachlan during his visit.
	   Discussions would include the transfer of defense technology,
including military telecommunications, he said.

Flood-swollen Yangtze stops shipping through Three Gorges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With flood waters along the Yangtze River surging
to dangerous levels, China has halted shipping through the renowned
Three Gorges, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Monday.
	   The Ministry of Communications closed the second of two
navigation channels through the gorges Saturday night as the river
swelled to its highest levels after days of heavy rains upstream,
Xinhua reported.
	   The other channel, through a temporary lock built specifically
for use in the high waters of the rainy season, was shut down
Friday, the report said.
	   Stranded passengers were put on other, unspecified modes of
transport, and shipping was unlikely to resume for several days,
Xinhua said.
	   Chinese engineers diverted the Yangtze, the world's third
longest river, in November to allow construction of the Three
Gorges Dam, the world's largest hydroelectric project. Xinhua did
not mention the flood waters' effect on construction.
	   So far at least 650 people have died in flooding from rains that
began earlier and have been heavier than usual.

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ While everyone was watching the NBA players in
the wrestling match Sunday, a bodyguard snuck in and decided
things.
	   Dennis ``Rodzilla'' Rodman and Karl ``The Mailman'' Malone were
the main attractions in the tag-team match that was decided by a
last-minute, dirty entrance from a bodyguard.
	   When it was over, it was the quiet, workmanlike Malone who acted
like the wild, authority-defying Rodman usually does.
	   Rodman, a member of the NBA champion Chicago Bulls, and
``Hollywood'' Hulk Hogan beat Malone, a member of the NBA Finals
runner-up Utah Jazz, and ``Diamond'' Dallas Page before a sellout
crowd of 12,000 and a pay-per-view television audience.
	   After Malone delivered a series of head butts to Rodman and
Hogan, the crowd began screaming at Hogan and that's when the
team's beefy bodyguard entered the ring.
	   After Page entered the ring for Malone, the unidentified
bodyguard quickly slammed Page to the canvas. Hogan pounded Page
with finishing blows to a referee's count.
	   Hogan and Rodman were declared winners of World Championship
Wrestling's ``Bash at the Beach.''
	   But a defiant Malone disagreed with the result. He grabbed the
referee around the neck and slammed him into the canvas. He then
spit at a crowd that had gathered around Hogan and Rodman and he
left the ring at San Diego State's Cox Arena while flashing Page's
trademark diamond symbol with his hands.
	   Lisa Padgett, 26, said her husband, John, 26, begged her to come
to the match with him.
	   ``I got talked into it, that's how come I'm here,'' she said.
``He watches it like four times a week on television. I don't watch
it at home, but it's awesome here.''
	   The Padgetts paid dlrs 125 each for ringside seats one day
before the match.
	   Malone and Page were wearing purple latex pants. Rodman
sauntered into the ring with a bandana on his head to hide his
latest hair color _ or perhaps lack of hair. The bandana stayed in
place throughout the tussle.
	   ``Dennis dances to a different tune,'' said Hogan, who worked
out daily with Rodman in preparation for the match. ``This is a
forum where he can achieve and perform to his utmost. Dennis can
get into the ring and do what he does best.''
	   It isn't the first time Rodman has teamed up with Hogan for a
chance to thump on grown men and not get booted or fined for it.
But this time he brought an NBA rival into the fray.
	   Representatives for World Championship Wrestling, a subsidiary
of Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., planned to pay Malone and
Rodman for the pay-per-view cable TV match, but they wouldn't say
how much.
	   As for Rodman and Hogan, they tag-eamed last July in Florida for
Rodman's wrestling debut, and after Game 3 of the NBA Finals this
year, the two paired for a World Championship Wrestling event in
Auburn Hills, Michigan.
	   Rodman skipped practice, was fined, and the Bulls went on to
beat Malone and the Jazz for their sixth title.
	   ``Malone,'' Hogan snarled, ``the guy that already is a loser on
and off the court.''
	   However, Malone vowed to hand-cancel Rodman with the help of
Page. For Malone, it's living out his boyhood dream to ``wrassle''
with the big guys.
	   ``Him and his little coward friend will get beat in the ring,''
Malone predicted earlier in the week of his rumble with Rodman.
	   Hogan said the only plan of attack he and Rodman had for Malone
and Page was to ``romp and stomp them.''
	   ``We're going to go ahead and embarrass Mr. Clean Cut,'' Hogan
said.
	   Malone, who weighs 254 pounds (115 kilos) to Rodman's 248 (112
kilos), said he wasn't worried about an injury jeopardizing his
basketball career.
	   He said the Jazz didn't agree with many of the things he likes
to do, like riding motorcycles, but he has to live his own life.
Besides, he didn't plan on getting hurt.
	   As for Rodman, he said he does whatever he wants.
	   And Hogan said wrestling allows Rodman to be as bad as the crowd
wants him to be.
	   ``I think he likes it a lot better,'' Hogan said, noting that if
Rodman tires of criticism in the NBA, he always has a place in
professional wrestling and could probably make more money doing it.
	   ``It's not rocket science,'' Hogan said. ``The wilder he is, the
more T-shirts we sell.''

Political uncertainty in Japan causes jitters in Asian markets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian markets opened sharply lower Monday
following the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's humiliating defeat
in Japanese parliamentary elections, but some profit-takers cashed
in and were picking up bargains by midday.
	   The LDP won 44 of the 126 seats at stake in Sunday's elections
to the Upper House, far fewer than the 69 which it needed to gain
an outright majority and below the 61 it held previously.
	   Election results spurred calls for Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto to resign. That caused worry among investors about who
would be the next prime minister and if he will be able to be able
to push through the aggressive reforms necessary to pull the
economy out of its worst recession since World War II.
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index _ the market's key indicator
of blue-chips _ fell below the 8,000-point-level at mid-morning,
marking its lowest midday level since June 17. It was quoted at
7,963.94 points, down 241.83 points or 2.9 percent.
	   Tokyo's Nikkei stock average was lower at midday, but well up on
intraday lows as investors took advantage of the market's earlier
sharp drop to pick up bargains. The Nikkei average of 225 selected
issues ended Monday's morning session at 16,073.58, down 16.48
points from Friday's close.
	   Share prices on the Seoul stock market narrowed losses on the
Japanese yen's slight recovery against the U.S. dollar.
	   However, the market's main index was still lower on the yen's
sharp fall versus the dollar earlier Monday. At the midday break,
the Korea Composite Stock Price Index was down 1.80 points at
303.17.
	   Southeast Asian currencies remained skittish because of the
yen's volatility. The U.S. dollar was quoted at 1.7300 Singapore
dollars, just a fraction below 1.7305 late on Friday.
	   In Malaysia, the U.S. dollar was at a midrate of 4.2575 ringgit,
down from 4.2800 at the market's opening.
	   In Thailand, the dollar was at 41.83 Thai baht, compared with
42.10 at the opening. The Philippine peso was trading at an average
of 42.262 Philippine pesos from Friday's closing average of 42.119.
	   Indonesia's rupiah was trading slightly higher against the U.S.
dollar as the market welcomed the new chairman of the ruling
Golongan Karya, or Golkar, party.
	   The Indonesian rupiah was trading at 15,100 rupiah against the
dollar in the spot market, higher than 15,300 late Friday.

Gas leak disrupts downtown Melbourne
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A gas leak downtown on Monday
prompted the evacuation of hundreds of people from city buildings
while trams, trains and other traffic were halted for hours.
	   Gas could be smelled over a wide area of the central business
district.
	   Fearing an explosion, acting police inspector Brian Hillier said
about 800 to 1,000 people were evacuated from buildings in Flinders
Street around the King Street intersection.
	   The city loop underground train line was also closed.
	   ``If the gas levels get higher and there's some form of ignition
then there could be an explosion,'' he said.
	   A worker using a backhoe cut a one-foot (30-cm) high pressure
gas line at an aquarium construction site between an overhead
railway line and the Yarra River.
	   The gas leak was about 330 feet (100 meters) from Crown Casino
on the other side of the river, though the casino was not affected.
	   Gas company crews plugged the leak Monday afternoon.
	   The only person reportedly affected by the leaking gas was a
44-year-old man evacuated from a nearby office building.
	   After being treated for gas inhalation he developed chest pains
and was taken to the Alfred Hospital, an ambulance officer said.
	   His condition was not immediately available.

Former Tamil rebel leader flown to Singapore for medical care
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A former Tamil rebel leader turned
politician who was beaten into a coma by more militant Tamils has
flown to Singapore for medical care, an associate said Monday.
	   Douglas Devananda, secretary general of the Eelam People's
Democratic Party (EPDP), was attacked by last month Tamil inmates
in Kalutara prison near the capital, Colombo, where he was
inquiring into the prisoners' welfare. Devananda, 40, recovered
consciousness after treatment in Colombo, but doctors said he
needed more sophisticated care.
	   ``He is out of danger but needs surgery,'' said Sangarapillai
Sivathasan, a member of parliament of the EPDP.
	   Devananda formed the EPDP after breaking away from another rebel
group in 1985. Trained in guerrilla warfare in Lebanon, he later
shunned violence, and his party took part in legislative elections
in 1994, winning nine seats in the 225-member house.
	   The party also won the majority of seats on 10 of 17 councils in
local government elections in the northern Jaffna peninsula in
January. Jaffna is the Tamil heartland. There were, however,
allegations that the EPDP had manipulated the polls.
	   Tamil militants say Sri Lanka's Tamils are discriminated against
by the majority Sinhalese. More than 50,000 people have been killed
in years of fighting between the rebels and government forces.

<TEXT>
	   Party leaders have already begun discussing who would replace
Hashimoto. Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and former Chief Cabinet
Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama were seen as the most likely successors.
Hashimoto will stay in office until a successor is chosen.
	   Hashimoto's resignation would likely confuse Japan's efforts to
pull itself out of its worst recession since World War II, and
concerns over a leadership change sent share prices plunging early
Monday.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average fell 217.48 points,
or 1.35 percent, to 15,872.58 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. It regained most of the losses later on profit-taking.
	   The dollar, meanwhile, soared in early trading to 144.06 yen, up
2.73 yen from 141.33 yen late Friday in Tokyo and above 140.93 yen
in late New York trading Friday.
	   ``We must fix the economy as soon as possible'' said Takashi
Imai, head of the powerful Japan Federation of Economic
Organizations. ``We cannot afford to have a political vacuum.''
	   The Liberal Democrats' performance fell far short of the 69
seats they needed to regain a majority in the chamber, which it
lost in 1989, and also was well below its strength going into the
polls of 61.
	   They now have 102 in the 252-seat upper house.
	   Voters vented their frustration at the LDP's inability to get
the economy back on track. Unemployment is at a record high,
bankruptcies are swelling and Japan's financial system is wobbling
under massive bad loans.
	   The conservative, pro-business Liberal Democrats will continue
to rule because they have firm control over the more powerful lower
house, which can pass the national budget and choose the prime
minister without the approval of the upper house.
	   The party will need the cooperation of other parties to pass key
legislation, however.
	   The LDP's defeat has emboldened opposition parties, who are now
calling for the dissolution of the lower house and for general
elections to be held soon.
	   Analysts said that in the long run, the electoral humiliation
may prompt the LDP and the government to work harder to get the
economy back on track.
	   For the time being, however, the political situation was likely
to remain confused.
	   Foreign Ministry officials said Hashimoto's scheduled official
visits to the United States and France will probably be canceled.
He was to leave next week, and use the trips to try to win support
for his administration's efforts to jumpstart the economy.
	   Defense Minister Fumio Kyuma has canceled plans to visit
Washington from Tuesday, a ministry spokesman said.
	   The Liberal Democrats' sense of near panic was apparent as the
voting neared.
	   The party flip-flopped repeatedly on cutting income taxes, which
many voters, as well the United States, considered a key factor for
economic recovery.
	   The Democrats _ a liberal, relatively new party that has
recently emerged as the main opposition threat to the LDP _
promised such a tax cut early in the campaign. They won 27 seats, a
gain of nine, and now hold 47 in the entire upper house house.

Power outage sends Vietnamese fans scurrying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A power blackout in Hanoi 20 minutes after
the start of the World Cup final sent thousands of fans scurrying
to friends' homes to watch the match in the wee hours Monday
morning.
	   A substation that provides electricity to nearly 20,000 people
in the capital's Cua Nam district broke down at 2:20 a.m., a few
minutes before France scored its first goal en route to a 3-0
victory over Brazil.
	   Many people began rushing around to find other alternatives,
which wasn't too difficult with so many residents staying up late
to watch the match.
	   Others went to bed in hopes of watching the rebroadcast at 6:30
a.m., only to discover that the power was still off when they got
up. It was expected to be restored later Monday.
	   Soccer is a national passion in Vietnam, where most World Cup
matches were shown live. Streets were virtually deserted when play
was under way, except for clusters of people sitting outside homes
or shops with big-screen television sets.
	   On the downside, police said burglaries were up when matches
were on. In addition, two people committed suicide after losing big
bets on matches.

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Reds-Diamondbacks capsule to show that Konerko's home
run was to left field &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ After a long pause for him, Mark McGwire is
right back on track.
	   The St. Louis slugger, who ended a 21 at-bat homerless slump
with a game-winning shot on Saturday, hit his major league-leading
39th and 40th homers in Sunday's 6-4 victory over the Houston
Astros.
	   In the first inning, McGwire hit the first pitch he saw from
Sean Bergman (8-5) off the wall beyond the visitor's bullpen in
left field.
	   He struck out in the third and drew his major league-leading
19th intentional walk in the fourth before hitting No. 40 on a 2-1
pitch from Scott Elarton to lead off the seventh, a 415-foot
(126-meter) drive.
	   McGwire broke his own record for reaching 40 homers the fastest,
getting there in 281 at-bats. He did it in 294 at-bats in 1996,
when he finished with 52 homers.
	   McGwire has 427 career homers, passing Billy Williams for 23rd
on the list. He's only three away from the team homer record of 43
set by Johnny Mize in 1939.
	   McGwire had no homers or RBIs in July and was homerless in 21
at-bats before his two-run, upper-deck shot in the 11th won
Saturday's game 4-3.
	   Juan Acevedo (4-2) and three relievers combined on a
nine-hitter.
 &UR; Cubs 3, Brewers 0 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, Mark Clark pitched a three-hitter for his first
shutout in more than four years and Scott Servais drove in all
three Chicago runs.
	   Clark (5-8) retired 16 of the last 18, walked two and struck out
five in the third three-hitter and shutout of his career. The
right-hander's last shutout came against Detroit on May 13, 1994.
	   A crowd of 50,735 pushed the weekend attendance to 184,432,
making it the second largest four-game set in Brewers history.
	   Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa went 0-for-3 with a walk.
	   Brad Woodall (4-4) allowed six hits in seven innings.
 &UR; Mets 5, Expos 2 &QC; 
	   In New York, Brian McRae hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning
and reliever Jeff Tam got his first major league win.
	   Butch Huskey, benched on Saturday for Todd Hundley's return,
started in right field and went 4-for-4. Hundley started in left
for the second straight game and was 0-for-2 with a walk before
leaving for a pinch-hitter in the seventh.
	   Trailing 2-1, Huskey singled with one out and McRae followed by
driving Javier Vazquez's (3-7) first pitch over the right-field
wall. It was his 12th homer this season and second in two days.
	   Tam (1-0) pitched 1 2-3 perfect innings in relief of Hideo Nomo,
who surrendered only two hits in 5 1-3 innings but walked seven.
	   Dennis Cook struck out the side in the ninth for his first
save.
 &UR; Phillies 10, Pirates 4 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Mark Lewis, Doug Glanville and Gregg Jefferies
hit two-run homers and Philadelphia finished off its second
consecutive three-game sweep of Pittsburgh.
	   The Phillies' 27th comeback victory of the season was their
sixth win in a row and moved them four games over .500 at 46-42 _ a
21-game turnaround from a year ago, when they were 25-63.
	   The Pirates, winless since the All-Star break, have lost six in
a row and eight of nine, plus 10 of their last 12 at home.
	   Carlton Loewer (4-1) withstood Desi Relaford's three-base
throwing error in a two-run Pirates' first inning to allow three
runs _ only one earned _ and five hits over six innings.
	   Pirates starter Esteban Loaiza (6-5) took the loss.
 &UR; Marlins 5, Braves 3 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Florida took three of four games in a weekend series
from Atlanta, handing Tom Glavine his first road loss.
	   The Marlins had already defeated Denny Neagle and Greg Maddux
before beating Glavine (12-4).
	   Rookie Mike Redmond had three hits and drove in two runs for
Florida, which has won 18 of 30 and trails fourth place Montreal by
just 1 1/2 games.
	   Chipper Jones homered for the Braves, who lost to Florida in
last year's NLCS.
	   Glavine was tagged for 11 hits and five runs in six innings. He
entered with a 7-0 record and 1.39 ERA in road games. On Saturday,
the Marlins dealt Maddux his first road loss since April 2, 1997.
	   Rookie starter Brian Meadows (8-6) won his fourth straight
decision.
 &UR; Padres 6, Dodgers 3
	   In Los Angeles, Ken Caminiti hit three home runs and drove in
five runs as San Diego opened a season-high seven-game lead in the
NL West.
	   The switch-hitting Caminiti hit his first two homers
right-handed against the Dodgers' Brian Bohanon (2-5), a two-run
shot in the first and a solo homer in the third.
	   He got his first career three-homer game batting left-handed
against Antonio Osuna in the eighth.
	   Joey Hamilton (7-9) pitched six innings and hit his fourth
career homer.
 &UR; Rockies 5, Giants 3
	   In Denver, Dante Bichette continued to wield a hot bat since the
All-Star break, driving in three runs as Colorado completed a
three-game sweep.
	   Bichette, 7-for-13 with nine RBIs in the last three games,
helped the Rockies to only their second sweep of a three-game set
this season and their first since the opening series of the year in
Arizona.
	   Pedro Astacio (7-9) survived a ragged first inning, allowing
three runs and eight hits in 6 2-3 innings for the win. Mike Munoz
got one out for his third save.
	   Barry Bonds had a two-run homer for San Francisco.
 &UR; Reds 5, Diamondbacks 3
	   In Phoenix, Paul Konerko, a high school star in suburban Phoenix
just four years ago, hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning to
give Cincinnati its seventh consecutive win.
	   Konerko, in his third game with the Reds after coming to
Cincinnati in the trade that sent reliever Jeff Shaw to the Los
Angeles Dodgers, slammed a 1-0 pitch from reliever Alan Embree over
the left field wall with nobody out in the ninth.
	   Barry Larkin drove in two runs with three hits, including his
third homer in two games, as the Reds won for the 12th time in 13
games.
	   Arizona starter Brian Anderson (6-8) remained winless in his
home park. John Hudek (2-4) got the win in relief of starter Pete
Harnisch.

Profiles of possible Hashimoto successors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Several possible successors have emerged to Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who announced Monday he would step down
after his party suffered a major defeat in parliamentary elections.
Here is a look at the two strongest contenders:
	   KEIZO OBUCHI _ Japan's 61-year old foreign minister and head of
the largest faction in the ruling party, Obuchi is seen as the most
likely successor to outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   The soft-spoken Obuchi, who took his current Cabinet post last
year during a reshuffling of portfolios, is known for his subtle
political strategy and ability to avoid making enemies.
	   But he is not viewed as a brilliant innovator.
	   Obuchi is best known in Japan for ushering in the newest
imperial era after the death of Emperor Hirohito. As Chief Cabinet
Secretary in 1989, Obuchi formally announced the start of the
``Heisei'' era with the ascension Emperor Akihito to the
Chrysanthemum Throne.
	   Obuchi first served as a Cabinet official in 1979, when he was
selected to jointly hold the portfolios of the Management and
Coordination Agency and Okinawa Development Agency.
	   In 1993, he became the Liberal Democrats' secretary-general, one
of the three key party posts, under Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
	   A year later Obuchi took control of the biggest of several rival
factions in the LDP, succeeding former Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita.
	   Obuchi was first elected to Japan's lower house of Parliament in
1963 while still a graduate student at Tokyo's prestigious Waseda
University. He is one of many LDP politicians who have claimed
seats first won by their fathers.
	   Obuchi's constituency in Gunma Prefecture (state) north of
Tokyo, is the home of two former prime ministers __ Yasuhiro
Nakasone and late Takeo Fukuda.
	   ___
	   SEIROKU KAJIYAMA _ A senior lawmaker in the ruling LDP.
Kajiyama, 72, most recently served as the chief secretary in
Hashimoto's first Cabinet.
	   Since leaving the Cabinet, he has been among the harshest
critics of the administration from within the ruling party, pushing
for faster action to deal with bad loans hobbling Japanese banks.
	   Kajiyama has served as home affairs and trade minister, but
earned notoriety overseas for controversial remarks he made while
serving as justice minister in 1990.
	   After a police roundup of foreign prostitutes in Tokyo, he said
that prostitutes in Japan and blacks living in the United States
both ``ruin the atmosphere of the neighborhoods they move into.''
	   He retracted the remarks after they provoked an uproar in the
United States. Kajiyama did not resign but was replaced in a
subsequent Cabinet reshuffle.
	   He stepped back into the limelight by becoming secretary-general
of the LDP in 1992. He resigned a year later, however, after the
party was toppled from power for the first time in 38 years by an
opposition coalition.
	   As chief spokesman in Hashimoto's first Cabinet, he stirred up
more controversy by suggesting that women who served as sex slaves
for Japanese troops during World War II __ many of whom were
Chinese or Korean __ probably did it for the money.
	   Kajiyama has been elected to the lower house of Parliament nine
times from Ibaraki prefecture in northeastern of Tokyo. He
graduated from Nihon University in 1949.

Explosion outside of PLO headquarters injure one Palestinian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian was injured Monday when a bomb
went off near the Orient House, the PLO's unofficial headquarters
in east Jerusalem, the police said.
	   The 40-year-old east Jerusalem resident was injured in the head
and legs when he came in contact with a plastic bag containing the
bomb which had been placed near a trash can some 30 meters (36
yards) outside of the Orient House, police spokesman Shmuel
Ben-Ruby said.
	   In the past the Orient House has been the scene of angry
protests by right wing Israelis who have demanded that the
government shut down the compound.
	   The Orient House has been described as the core of a future
government complex of the Palestinian Authority in east Jerusalem
where the Palestinians want to establish a future capital.
	   Israel in the past has complained that the Palestinian Authority
was violating the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy accords by operating
offices in the disputed eastern sector but has stopped short of
shutting down their operation.
	   East Jerusalem was annexed by the Israel from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast War.
	   Under the autonomy accords the Palestinian Authority may only
operate in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and not in Jerusalem whose
status is to be determined in future negotiations.

Russian Prime Minister Kiriyenko arrives in Japan for talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko arrived in
Japan on Monday to discuss bilateral economic cooperation and a
proposed peace treaty.
	   But the timing of the visit could not be worse as Japanese Prime
Ryutaro Hashimoto announced his resignation shortly after Kiriyenko
arrived.
	   Hashimoto resigned to take responsibility for a major electoral
defeat by his ruling Liberal Democratic Party in Sunday's elections
for Parliament's upper house.
	   Kiriyenko, the first Russian premier to visit Japan, was to seek
further Japanese economic assistance during his two-day stay by
expanding bilateral cooperation programs, part of his efforts to
overcome Russia's financial turmoil.
	   Hashimoto, with strong personal ties to Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, had been a key driving force behind the increasingly
friendly atmosphere between the two countries, which have never
signed a peace treaty ending World War II.
	   Japanese Foreign Ministry officials were afraid that Hashimoto's
resignation could send a chill through relations between the two
countries.
	   During his visit, Kiriyenko was also scheduled to meet with
Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, considered as a possible successor
to Hashimoto.
	   The Russian premier is expected to stress the importance of
carrying forward the bilateral economic programs agreed between
Hashimoto and Yeltsin, Kyodo News service reported.
	   But discussion of a territorial dispute over a group of islands
northeast of Hokkaido and disputed between the two countries, was
unlikely, Kyodo said.
	   On Tuesday, Kiriyenko will meet with top Japanese business
leaders before leaving for China.

Stunned by election, Japan business heads urge action on economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Stunned by the defeat of Japan's ruling party in
parliamentary elections, business leaders on Monday urged the
government to act quickly to fix the country's hobbled economy.
	   The losses of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's Liberal
Democratic Party on Sunday provided plenty of proof that voters are
frustrated with the status quo, said the head of the country's
biggest business lobby.
	   ``The election shows that voters are deeply dissatisfied with
the economic situation,'' said Takashi Imai, chairman of the Japan
Federation of Economic Organizations and Nippon Steel Corp.
	   Hiroshi Okuda, president of Toyota Motor Corp., called on the
government to stabilize Japan's shaky financial system, cut a
ballooning deficit and put the economy back on track for recovery.
	   ``It's a very harsh outcome,'' Okuda said in a statement Monday.
	   After the poor performance by pro-business Liberal Democrats in
the poll for the upper house of Parliament, Hashimoto announced on
Monday that he would resign. A successor was not immediately named.
	   Jiro Nemoto, chairman of the Japan Federation of Employers
Associations, or Nikkeiren, warned that confusion in the wake of
the election could delay urgent economic policy measures.
	   Nemoto urged the newly resurgent opposition to work with the LDP
_ which still controls the more powerful lower house of parliament
_ to speed passage of needed legislation for boosting the economy.

Thai monk threatens curse on government officials over statue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai monk has threatened to put a
curse on government officials who intend to destroy a controversial
Buddha statue at his temple.
	   ``I really want to know who will dare to demolish this statue,''
Phra Khru Sopitsutakhun, the monk, was quoted as saying in Monday's
The Nation newspaper. ``Anyone who dares to do that may meet an
indescribable curse.''
	   Thai government officials and high-ranking members of the
Buddhist clergy have condemned the statue at the temple in
Chachoengsao province, 30 kilometers (19 miles) east of Bangkok, as
sacrilegious and offensive, and have said they will pull it down.
	   The 10-meter (33-foot) statue portrays the Buddha standing with
his right foot on top of a globe of the world.
	   ``Posing with one foot on the globe is like sneering at the
world,'' Education Minister Chumpol Silapa-archa was quoted as
saying in local media on Sunday. ``There is no such thing in either
Buddha's teachings or our tradition.''
	   The Education Ministry oversees the Buddhist clergy, which only
permits the Buddha to be depicted in certain poses that carry
specific symbolic meanings.
	   The monk, however, said his statue conformed to Buddha's
teachings, showing how he rose from earth to a higher plane of
enlightenment. He said the pose showed Buddha protecting the world.
	   He offered to compromise with the government by covering the
statue with a cloth and charging anyone who wants to see it
unveiled 100 baht (dlrs 2.50)

Japan's prime minister resigns over party election upset
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with detail; RECASTS throughout
 &UR; By ERIC TALMADGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned Monday
for his ruling party's stunning defeat in elections dominated by
voter anger over his failure to pull Japan out of its worst
recession since World War II.
	   But Hashimoto's resignation was almost certain to further impede
Japan's efforts to pull itself out of the deepening recession, and
business leaders were voicing concerns that a political vacuum
could sidetrack reform efforts already underway.
	   Hashimoto grimly conceded defeat and said he would resign to
take responsibility for the Liberal Democratic Party's winning just
44 seats out of the 126 contested _ half of Parliament's upper
house _ in Sunday's elections.
	   ``The defeat was my fault,'' he told a press conference at party
headquarters after party leaders approved his decision to resign
Monday afternoon.
	   ``I'm responsible for all that happened, and my ability was not
sufficient,'' he said, his eyes red and fatigue clear on his face.
	   Hashimoto will stay in office until a successor is chosen. It
was unclear how long that might take.
	   Discussions have already begun on who the replacement should be.
LDP powerbrokers Keizo Obuchi, Japan's foreign minister, and former
Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama were seen as the most
likely successors.
	   Neither, however, is seen as an economic specialist.
	   The sudden political confusion sent markets on a rollercoaster
ride Monday.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average fell 217.48 points,
or 1.35 percent, to 15,872.58 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. But then it gained strongly after Hashimoto's official
announcement.
	   The dollar, meanwhile, soared at one point to 144.06 yen, up
2.73 yen from 141.33 yen late Friday in Tokyo and above 140.93 yen
in late New York trading Friday.
	   ``We must fix the economy as soon as possible'' said Takashi
Imai, head of the powerful Japan Federation of Economic
Organizations. ``We cannot afford to have a political vacuum.''
	   The conservative, pro-business Liberal Democrats will continue
to rule because they have firm control over the more powerful lower
house, which can pass the national budget and choose the prime
minister without the approval of the upper house.
	   But the party's performance Sunday fell far short of the 69
seats they needed to regain a majority in the upper chamber, which
it lost in 1989, and also was well below its strength going into
the polls of 61.
	   They now have 102 of the upper house's 252 seats.
	   With unemployment at a record high of 4.1 percent, bankruptcies
soaring and Japan's financial system wobbling under massive bad
loans, voters vented their frustration at the LDP's inability to
get the economy back on track.
	   The weakened party will now need the cooperation of other
parties to pass key legislation.
	   Getting such cooperation was not expected to be easy: opposition
parties on Monday were already calling for the dissolution of the
lower house and general elections.
	   Analysts said that in the long run, the electoral humiliation
may prompt the LDP and the government to work harder to get the
economy back on track.
	   For the time being, however, the political situation was likely
to remain fluid.
	   Hashimoto acknowledged that he would likely cancel scheduled
official visits to the United States and France, saying he will
telephone the leaders of those countries soon.
	   He was to leave next week, and use the trips to try to win
support for his administration's efforts to jumpstart the economy.
	   The Liberal Democrats' sense of near panic was apparent as the
voting neared. It flip-flopped repeatedly on cutting income taxes,
which many voters, as well the United States, considered a key
factor for economic recovery.
	   Emerging strongly in the elections were the Democrats _ a
liberal, relatively new party headed by the charismatic Naoto Kan,
who promised such a tax cut early in the campaign. They won 27
seats, a gain of nine, and now hold 47 in the entire upper house.

	   SEATTLE (AP) _ The Seattle Mariners' problems are taking the fun
out of Ken Griffey Jr.'s game.
	   ``How can you smile when you're losing?'' Griffey asked after
the Mariners' 8-5 loss to Anaheim on Sunday.
	   Even with an dlrs 8 million salary, last year's AL MVP and
nine-time All-Star center fielder sounds like he also has lost some
of his zest for baseball. He's not the happy kid he once was.
	   ``The first couple of years, it was `Oh, he smiles too much. He
doesn't take the game seriously,''' Griffey said. ``Now, I don't
smile because we're losing. Now, they say, `What's wrong with him?'
	   ``I've got the image of some villain in baseball. They're
comparing me to this person or that person because I don't smile.
Where's the happy medium? Go out and smile. Come back in and smile.
Is that fair? No.''
	   Despite the Mariners' 39-53 record that has put them in last
place in the AL West, Griffey is having another wonderful season.
	   Maybe better than 1997, when he led the AL with 56 homers and
the major leagues with 147 RBIs.
	   Griffey is leading the AL with 37 home runs, 79 runs and 242
total bases. He's second in RBIs with 82. After going 2-for-3
Sunday, he's hitting .299.
	   Griffey and All-Star shortstop, Alex Rodriguez, are carrying a
team that was the consensus favorite to win its division. Instead,
the Mariners find themselves 14 games under .500 and 13 games out
of first place.
	   It would take some kind of miracle for the Mariners to leap
ahead of the Angels, Texas and Oakland to win a division they won
two of the last three seasons.
	   Griffey said he's reluctant to say too much to his teammates.
	   ``Say if you're the best player in the league and you have a
team meeting,'' he said. ``Then you say, `Let's go. Let's go.'
	   ``Then they're going to look at you and say, `We don't have your
talent level and we can't play where you're at.'''
	   Griffey was booed at Coors Field in Denver at the All-Star game
last Monday during batting practice because he refused to enter the
home-run derby. He said the boos forced him to change his mind, and
he wound up winning the contest.
	   Since the Mariners returned for the second half of the season,
Griffey has been more approachable for the news media.

Report: Thai worker, seeking money, kills employer's child
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Angry over his employer's refusal to
give him money, a Thai furniture worker beat his boss's 11-year-old
daughter to death and seriously injured her two younger sisters, a
newspaper reported Monday.
	   The two sisters, aged nine and six, are in intensive care at a
Bangkok hospital after allegedly being beaten with a wooden club by
Luan Kaewsri, The Bangkok Post said.
	   Hospital staff said Namfon sae Lim was dead on arrival, and that
after surgery both Supansa and Alisa sae Lim were still unconscious
and in serious condition with cracked skulls.
	   Police said Luan had come to the home of his boss, Vilailak sae
Lim, to ask for money and was angered when she wasn't home,
according to the Post.
	   He then took his rage out on the young girls.
	   Luan, 21, told police he intended to use the club to threaten
his boss. He said she had given him money in the past but then
began to scold him when he made more requests for money and made
mistakes on the job.

Russian Prime Minister Kiriyenko arrives in Japan for talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hashimoto's comments in 7th-8th grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko arrived in
Japan on Monday to discuss bilateral economic cooperation and a
proposed peace treaty.
	   But the timing of the visit could not be worse as Japanese Prime
Ryutaro Hashimoto announced his resignation shortly after Kiriyenko
arrived.
	   Hashimoto resigned to take responsibility for a major electoral
defeat by his ruling Liberal Democratic Party in Sunday's elections
for Parliament's upper house.
	   Kiriyenko, the first Russian premier to visit Japan, was to seek
further Japanese economic assistance during his two-day stay by
expanding bilateral cooperation programs, part of his efforts to
overcome Russia's financial turmoil.
	   Hashimoto, with strong personal ties to Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, had been a key driving force behind the increasingly
friendly atmosphere between the two countries, which have never
signed a peace treaty ending World War II.
	   Japanese Foreign Ministry officials were afraid that Hashimoto's
resignation could send a chill through relations between the two
countries.
	   ``I do not wish Japanese-Russian relations, which are finally
beginning to improve, to move backwards,'' Hashimoto said at the
news conference where he announced he was stepping down.
	   ``Such a thing should not happen. Regardless of my resignation,
we must push forward relations between Japan and Russia,'' he said.
	   During his visit, Kiriyenko was also scheduled to meet with
Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, considered as a possible successor
to Hashimoto.
	   The Russian premier is expected to stress the importance of
carrying forward the bilateral economic programs agreed between
Hashimoto and Yeltsin, Kyodo News service reported.
	   But discussion of a territorial dispute over a group of islands
northeast of Hokkaido and disputed between the two countries, was
unlikely, Kyodo said.
	   On Tuesday, Kiriyenko will meet with top Japanese business
leaders before leaving for China.

Orangemen march on big day clouded by death of three children

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant Orangemen were
preparing to march on their big holiday Monday, chastened and
divided by the deaths of three boys in the violence swirling around
their defiance of a government order to avoid one Catholic
neighborhood.
	   Some prominent Orangemen had called for an end to the week-long
confrontation between marchers and security forces near Portadown,
following the Sunday morning firebombing that killed the Quinn
brothers, Richard, 10, Mark, 9 and Jason, 7, in their home in
Ballymoney, 40 miles (60 kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   Their Catholic mother and her Protestant partner escaped safely.
	   ``After last night's attack a 15-minute walk down Garvaghy Road
by the Orange Order would be a very hollow victory because it would
be in the shadow of the coffins of three little boys who wouldn't
even know what the Orange Order is about,'' said the Rev. William
Bingham, chaplain to the Orange Order in County Armagh.
	   Last week, Bingham was one of four Orange officials who met with
Prime Minister Tony Blair pressing their demand to walk down that
road, despite the hostility of Catholic residents there and an
order from the Parades Commission blocking the march.
	   The Portadown district Orange Lodges defiantly declared that
their protest would continue until they walked the Garvaghy Road.
But they asked Orangemen not to join them Monday in the pastures
near Drumcree Anglican church for a mass confrontation with police
and British troops.
	   Police said the province had remained relatively quiet
overnight, compared with previous days.
	   However, despite the Balleymoney killings, there was another
attempt to burn down a building.
	   A pub in Antrim, west of Belfast, sustained smoke damage after
an object was thrown through the front window, and police fired
plastic bullets at a crowd gathered near a bonfire in the same
area.
	   Plastic bullets were also discharged to quell disturbances in
south Belfast, where a gang of youths set fire to a truck and
officers in Londonderry were attacked by a crowd throwing gasoline
bombs and stones, police said.

Ties between Malaysia and Singapore strained again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Recent squabbling between
Singapore and Malaysia is further straining already tenuous ties
between the Southeast Asian neighbors.
	   Singapore's recent jabs at Malaysia's new international airport
left transport minister Ling Liong Sik sniffing that the southern
neighbor was just jealous of the glittering dlrs 2.3 billion Kuala
Lumpur International Airport.
	   ``It is the behavior of a competitor who likes to run down the
airport, so that fewer passengers will be using our airport,'' Ling
said over the weekend.
	   ``They also see the airport has the potential to be the hub of
regional air transportation,'' said Ling who has been at KLIA
almost daily to solve problems that have dogged the new airport,
which Malaysia claims is the world's largest.
	   What really angered Ling were stories like the one in the
Singapore Straits Times last week, based on an Internet account of
one frustrated Singaporean passenger at KLIA.
	   ``The airport is not as big as (Singapore's) Changi, but it
seems so much bigger, because we are walking all the time,'' wrote
Daren Lim Chee Wei, a shipping executive and frequent flier. ``An
airport should be designed for air travel. Looking good should be
secondary.''
	   Relations began souring in recent weeks after Tourism Minister
Sabaruddin Chik accused Singapore of deliberately striking Malaysia
from a list of tourist destinations for delegates to a Rotary
convention.
	   Then came the spat over shifting of a railroad border post.
Malaysia said no to Singapore's plans to move its customs,
immigration and quarantine checkpoint from the island's Tanjung
Pagar train station to a new site.
	   Singapore proposed to submit the dispute to the International
Court of Justice. Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi said a
settlement could be reached if Singapore sincerely wanted to
improve ties with Malaysia.
	   That appeared to spill over into the sensitive issue of water.
About half of the water consumed daily by Singaporeans comes from
Malaysia, under two treaties. One of those treaties expires in 2011
and the other in 2061. Singapore wants a clearly defined,
longer-term treaty.
	   ``We have assured them that we will give them the water but
there must be conditions to supplying water,'' Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said cryptically last week. He did not specify the
conditions.
	   The troubles come one year after the neighbors settled a row
over Singapore senior minister Lee Kwan Yew's description of the
southern Malaysian state of Johor Baru as ``notorious for
shootings, muggings, and car-jackings.''
	   Malaysia was mollified by an apology, but Foreign Minister
Abdullah warned: ``This episode has deeply hurt Malaysians of all
sections of society and that restoration of the old level of
relationship would take time.''
	   There is a long line of mistrust between Singapore and Malaysia,
said Roger Rasiah, associate professor of economics at the
University of Malaya.
	   ``There has been mistrust, even when Singapore was within
Malaysia,'' Rasiah said. ``Singapore leaders always believed they
were superior.''
	   Britain allowed Singapore to govern itself in 1959, with Lee as
prime minister. In 1963, Singapore was incorporated into Malaysia,
an experiment which failed two years later after wrangling between
Lee and the late Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman.
	   Singapore still remains Malaysia's third-largest trade partner
and an important gateway into Malaysia. More than 200,000
Malaysians cross over to Singapore each day to work.

Taiwan to probe alleged exploitation of migrant workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Authorities said Monday they would look
into allegations that migrant workers are exploited by recruiters
who charge them exorbitant fees.
	   Wu Lien-pei, an official of the government Labor Council, said
refunds will be ordered if any firms are found to have collected
fees for services that they never provided.
	   ``We will look into the fees, item by item,'' Wu said. ``But
exploitation may be an overstatement. There are less conscientious
people in every trade.''
	   The comments came one day after Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said he had ordered local officials to hold talks with
Taiwanese authorities on the plight of Filipino workers in Taiwan.
	   Filipino and Thai factory workers demonstrated Friday outside
the office of the Labor Council.
	   Protesters said they were charged fees of up to 20,000 Taiwan
dollars (U.S. dlrs 570) a year for services that they never
received. For many, the fees amount to a month's pay.
	   They said the brokerage firms threaten to have them deported if
they refuse to pay the fees.
	   There are 240,000 foreign laborers, mostly from the Philippines
or Thailand, working in factories, construction sites or as maids
in Taiwan.
	   Taiwan has imported foreign workers as wages soared in recent
years and many construction sites or factories failed to recruit
local workers.

Australian energy company complains of Indonesian payment problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's Energy Equity Corp., a
stakeholder in Indonesia's Sengkang gas and power project, said
Monday that an Indonesian state-owned power company has failed to
pay two electricity bills in full.
	   Energy Equity said Perusahaan Listrick Negara has only partially
paid a March invoice from the Sengkang Power project due to be paid
in full by July 10, leaving U.S. dlrs 1.9 million owed to the
project.
	   An April invoice also has U.S. dlrs 1.9 million outstanding, the
company said.
	   Energy Equity owns 47.5 percent of the U.S. dlrs 220 million
Sengkang project in South Sulawesi. Its partners in the project
include U.S. power company El Paso Energy Corp. with 47.5 percent
and Indonesia's PT Trihasra Sarana Jaya Prnama with 5 percent.

Gas leak disrupts downtown Melbourne
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Fire Department estimate of 4,500 people
evacuated &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A gas leak downtown on Monday
prompted the evacuation of 4,500 people from city buildings, while
trams, trains and other traffic were halted for hours.
	   Gas could be smelled over a wide area of the central business
district.
	   Metropolitan Fire Brigade Senior Sgt. Greg Pearson said the gas
was being sucked through air-conditioning systems in city
buildings, forcing the evacuation of some 4,500 people.
	   The city loop underground train line was also closed.
	   A worker using a backhoe cut a one-foot (30-cm) high pressure
gas line at an aquarium construction site between an overhead
railway line and the Yarra River.
	   The gas leak was about 330 feet (100 meters) from Crown Casino
on the other side of the river, though the casino was not affected.
	   Gas company crews plugged the leak Monday afternoon.
	   The only person reportedly overcome by the leak was a
44-year-old man evacuated from a nearby office building.
	   After being treated for gas inhalation he developed chest pains
and was taken to the Alfred Hospital, an ambulance officer said.
	   His condition was not immediately available.

Explosion outside of PLO headquarters injure one Palestinian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian man was injured Monday when a
bomb exploded near the Orient House, the PLO's unofficial
headquarters in east Jerusalem, the police said.
	   The 40-year-old east Jerusalem resident was injured in the head
and legs when he came in contact with a plastic bag containing the
bomb, which had been placed near a trash can some 30 meters (36
yards) outside of the Orient House compound, police spokesman
Shmuel Ben-Ruby said.
	   In the past the Orient House has been the scene of angry
protests by right-wing Israelis who have demanded that the
government shut down the site.
	   The Orient House has been described as the core of a future
government complex of the Palestinian Authority in east Jerusalem,
where Palestinians want to establish a future capital.
	   Israel in the past has complained that the Palestinian Authority
was violating the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy accords by operating
offices in the disputed eastern sector but has stopped short of
shutting down the Orient House.
	   Israel annexed East Jerusalem after seizing it from Jordan in
the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Under the autonomy accords, the Palestinian Authority may only
operate in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and not in Jerusalem, whose
status is to be determined in future negotiations.

China seeks wider contacts with Taiwan to push reunification
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Seeking to steer Taiwan into reunification talks,
China is calling for more exchanges with the island, the official
People's Daily reported Monday.
	   China desires increased contact with Taiwanese from ``all
political parties and all walks of life,'' the People's Daily, in
its overseas edition, quoted Vice Premier Qian Qichen as saying.
	   Concerned about the rise of pro-independence political groups on
Taiwan, China has invited once-shunned leaders of the main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party to visit, along with
politicians from the ruling Nationalists and other parties.
	   Exchanges reached a high tide in the first half of the year,
with 461 Taiwanese visiting China as part of official scholarly or
political delegations and 3,544 Chinese traveling to Taiwan for
such purposes, the paper said.
	   Increased visits come as the two organizations charged with
handling relations _ China's Association for Relations Across the
Strait and Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation _ move toward
ending their three-year break in dialogue. Top negotiators may meet
as early as this fall to discuss restarting talks.
	   Qian was quoted as saying that the range of contacts between the
two organizations should be expanded. That could help develop
consensus on an agenda for future talks leading to reunification,
the paper quoted him saying.
	   China has been pushing for years for direct talks on
reunification, but Taiwan has preferred to negotiate practical
issues such as fishing agreements before moving on to more
sensitive, difficult political questions.
	   Divided since Mao Tse-tung's communists drove Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalists from the mainland in 1949, China and Taiwan both claim
to want reunification. Taiwanese leaders have said such a time
should wait until China is more democratic and prosperous, like the
island.

Russia, IMF reach tentative agreement on bailout package, official
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and the International Monetary Fund have
reached tentative agreement on a huge bailout package aimed at
stabilizing the country's turbulent markets, Russia's lead
negotiator said Monday.
	   Russia wants dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion, and most of the
money is expected to come from the IMF, while the World Bank and
some private lenders are also likely to contribute to the package.
	   ``We have reached concrete agreements to the satisfaction of
both parties,'' Russia's top negotiator, Anatoly Chubais, told the
Interfax news agency Monday.
	   No details were released, but Chubais and the head of the IMF
delegation, John Odling-Smee, planned a Monday afternoon news
conference to outline the deal.
	   The loan could do a number of things to relieve pressure on the
Russian economy, which has been shrinking slighting this year after
showing signs of modest growth last year.
	   The infusion of money could help stabilize the stock and bond
markets, which have taken heavy hits in recent months and resulted
in a mass exodus of foreign investors.
	   Also, the loan could help prevent a possible devaluation of the
ruble, which has been the government's biggest fear. A weaker ruble
would raise prices and inflict additional economic hardship at a
time when labor unrest is on the rise.
	   Any loan agreement will still need formal approval by IMF
officials in Washington and it was not clear what conditions, if
any, the IMF would impose on Russia.
	   The IMF has often been critical of Russia's inability to collect
taxes, which leaves the government chronically short of cash to pay
millions of workers and pensioners.
	   The Yeltsin administration recently proposed more than 20
measures to stabilize the economy, most of them aimed at reforming
the tax system.
	   However, the opposition-led parliament has balked at measures
that would raise taxes, and it's not clear whether they will give
their blessing to the entire program. Parliament plans a special
session beginning Wednesday for further debate on the measures.
	   In May, investors began fleeing Russia's financial markets in
droves, spooked by several factors: a sharp drop in the prices of
Russia's oil exports, a wave of labor protests, and general
skittishness linked to the Asian financial crisis.
	   The stock market has lost more than half its value since the
beginning of the year, and the Central Bank has been spending down
its hard-currency reserves to support the ruble.
	   Much of the IMF loan is expected to go to shore up the Central
Bank's reserves, as well has help meet Russia's short-term debt
payments, which make up about one-third of the federal budget.
	   An international loan would give the government breathing space,
but economists note that it will not solve long-term problems that
include the need to establish an adequate tax collection system.

One year on and victims of Israel's bridge collapse have no answers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The families of four Australians
killed in last year's Israeli bridge collapse vowed Monday to
launch an international campaign against the Israeli government and
future Maccabiah Games if there is no independent inquiry into the
tragedy.
	   Tuesday is the first anniversary of the collapse that killed
Greg Small, Yetty Bennett, Elizabeth Sawicki and Warren Zines, and
injured dozens of their Australian teammates.
	   ``The government of Israel once and for all needs to take charge
of this entire matter and a first step is an independent Knesset
inquiry,'' Colin Elterman said.
	   ``After a year of asking nicely, our patience is running out.''
	   The families' call comes ahead of a Knesset debate Wednesday on
a motion for an inquiry and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's scheduled visit to Australia next month.
	   Elterman said if there was no inquiry or proper compensation, a
worldwide campaign will be launched against the Israeli government
and anyone involved in future Maccabiah Games.
	   ``Australia will also not send a team to the 2001 `Games of
Shame,''' he said.
	   ``We are not doing this out of a sense of vengeance. We're doing
it because it's a lesson to others in Israel to look at public
safety.''
	   Elterman's 16-year-old daughter Sasha spent 10 months in
critical condition in a hospital after she was thrown into the
polluted Yarkon River in Tel Aviv.
	   Small and Bennett, both from Sydney, drowned while fellow Sydney
resident Zines and Sawicki, from Melbourne, died weeks later from
complications believed to be the result of swallowing polluted
river water.
	   The 370-strong Australian delegation was marching into the Ramat
Gan stadium for the opening ceremony of the 15th Maccabiah Games,
or so-called Jewish Olympics, on July 14 when the bridge collapsed.
	   The families and members of the local Jewish community held
memorial services last week.
	   But Elterman said they had refused to take part in official
memorials in Israel as they were organized by the Maccabi World
Union _ the Jewish sporting body that organized the games.
	   He said the families have repeatedly called for a parliamentary
inquiry into the collapse as well as the resignations of the
Maccabi World Union executive _ but their pleas had fallen on deaf
ears.
	   The Maccabi World Union had consistently denied responsibility,
laying all the blame on the bridge builders, and last week scrapped
an internal inquiry, he said.
	   Five people, including the games' organizing committee chairman,
are on trial in Tel Aviv on charges of criminal negligence.
	   Zines' son Adam said the collapse was totally avoidable and he
would be urging Netanyahu to act immediately.
	   ``The comments Mr. Netanyahu and others have been saying is `We
must do all we can to avoid such a tragedy.' But these are just
words if there is no action to back them up,'' he said.
	   ``I want to know from him what his intentions are and what he
plans to do to make sure this never happens again.''

<TEXT>
	   SAINT DENIS, France (AP) _ It was samba soccer at its very best,
played with style and substance. Played to a rhythmic beat that
began early in the day and went on unrestrained for hours.
	   You expect such things in the World Cup final. You simply don't
expect them from France.
	   The French took every page four-time champion Brazil has written
on the world's most popular sport and rearranged them with Gallic
flair. They used Brazil's recipe of attacking, entertaining soccer
for a 3-0 rout Sunday night for their first world title, setting
off the biggest celebrations the nation has seen since World War II
ended.
	   ``This was the greatest evening of my life,'' said goalkeeper
Fabien Barthez.
	   ``It's all that we expected. It's incredible. There are no
words,'' added playmaker Zinedine Zidane.
	   The stars of the night were Zidane, the Marseille magician, and
Barthez, the bald-headed goalkeeper who looks like he could stare
shots away from the net.
	   The celebrants could be found all over Stade de France, and in
every corner of the country, from the Mediterranean to the beaches
of Normandy. Never has France had a team like this, and never have
the French displayed the passion for the sport they showed in this
tournament.
	   ``We won the final because we wanted it the most,'' French coach
Aime Jacquet said. ``It was the result of hard work. We really
worked as a team. There was good will and friendship between all of
us.
	   ``We played better and better because we had confidence and we
proved we had great players.''
	   While the French players stormed the field at the end, the
population streamed into the streets to honor the heroes, the first
host to win it all since Argentina in 1978.
	   ``We are all so happy, that's the least we can say,'' French
President Jacques Chirac said. ``What is the most incredible thing
tonight is that we have an impression each and every French citizen
has won this Cup.''
	   They certainly wanted to share in it. Young fans hung out of
cars hours after the game, waving flags, saluting each other and
their team. One kid, no more than 7 or 8, sat on a man's lap and
slowly drove, while in the backseat other youngsters reached out to
touch the people in the automobile in the next lane.
	   Unfortunately, things got a little carried away in Paris when an
apparently panicked driver zigzagged down the Champs Elysees, where
a million people gathered to party. The female driver plowed into a
group of fans, injuring about 60.
	   On the field after the conquest of mighty Brazil, which was
seeking an unprecedented fifth world title, but instead put on a
dismal performance, Barthez kneeled in prayer in front of his net,
tears flowing down his cheeks. Zidane kissed every teammate he
could get near, while others lay on the field, kicking their legs
in the air in delirious joy.
	   Then all of the winners gathered arm in arm and jumped up and
down, hands in the air, inviting their countrymen to join along.
They had carried the weight of a nation's expectations for five
weeks, and now they wanted to haul their countrymen right up into
the stands to collect the Jules Rimet Trophy.
	   ``When I took the field,'' Barthez said, ``I said to myself,
`Tonight, you'll be the world champion.' I've known we could be the
world champs for some time.''
	   But they were underdogs Sunday, even at home. After all, this
was Brazil, which long ago combined the flow of the samba with the
intricacies of top-level soccer.
	   Except this was a Brazilian team unlike any other. It was flat,
a bit dispirited by a pregame injury to two-time world player of
the year Ronaldo. Although he started, he never was a factor.
	   ``We didn't manage to respond,'' captain Dunga said. ``France
was the better team.''
	   It didn't seem that way for much of the tournament. Although
France won all seven games, it needed almost all of overtime to
beat Paraguay in the second round. And it went to a shootout
against Italy in the quarterfinals after a 0-0 tie. Its win over
Croatia in the semifinals left doubts, too.
	   Zidane erased them early.
	   The son of Algerian immigrants, Zidane turned the nation's hopes
into magnificent reality with one of the best performances in World
Cup finals history. He scored twice on headers _ his first goals of
a tournament he began by getting suspended for two games. By the
time Emmanuel Petit made it 3-0 in the final seconds, the French
festival had begun.
	   ``I badly wanted to score at least one goal in this World Cup
and I only had the final left to do it,'' Zidane said. ``It's the
most important match of my life.''
	   And certainly the most memorable.
	   Zidane's first score came off a mistake by Roberto Carlos, who
conceded a corner kick when he couldn't clear the ball along the
right sideline. Petit's kick found the head of Zidane, who climbed
over defender Leonardo to send it home.
	   Zidane also set up a breakaway for Stephane Guivarc'h on which
goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel barely got his hand on the shot.
Moments later, Youri Djorkaeff's corner kick was headed by Zidane
between the legs of Roberto Carlos and into the net to make it 2-0.
	   ``I was so hungry to score a World Cup goal that I made it
two,'' he said.
	   The French secured their place in the pantheon of great teams by
throttling the defending champions. France did it in its first
tournament appearance since 1986 _ when it eliminated Brazil in a
quarterfinal shootout. And it won despite being a man down for the
last 22 minutes after defender Marcel Desailly was ejected for
rough play.
	   Brazil won its titles in 1958, 1962, 1970 and four years ago.
Its only previous loss in the final came at home in 1950 to
Uruguay.
	   But that game was close. This one never was.
	   ``The whole nation was behind France,'' Brazil coach Mario
Zagallo said. ``The fifth title will have to be some other time.
This wasn't our day. France was better.''
	   And finally, nearly 70 years after Rimet, a Frenchman, devised
the World Cup, its home is in France.
	   ``All that I know is that the Cup will stay in France for the
next four years,'' said Zidane, who made very sure of it.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Dealt a stunning defeat at the polls, Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced Monday that he will resign and
acknowledged voter frustration over his failure to bring Japan out
of its deepest recession in decades.
	   The sudden resignation threw Japanese politics into confusion,
and was for the time being almost certain to impede efforts to pull
the economy out of its worst economic mess since World War II.
	   Business leaders immediately voiced concerns that a political
vacuum could sidetrack reform efforts already underway.
	   Hashimoto grimly conceded defeat and said he would resign after
his Liberal Democratic Party won just 44 seats out of the 126
contested _ half of Parliament's upper house _ in Sunday's
elections.
	   ``The defeat was my fault,'' he told a press conference at LDP
headquarters after party leaders approved his decision to resign
Monday afternoon.
	   The other three top party executives also expressed their
willingness to resign.
	   ``I'm responsible for all that happened, and my ability was not
sufficient,'' he said, his eyes red and the fatigue of two weeks of
hard campaigning clear on his face.
	   Hashimoto will stay in office until a successor is chosen. It
was unclear how long that might take.
	   Discussions have already begun on who the replacement should be.
	   LDP powerbrokers Keizo Obuchi, Japan's foreign minister, and
former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama were seen as the
most likely successors. Neither is seen as an economic specialist.
	   The political upheaval sent markets on a rollercoaster ride.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average fell 217.48 points,
or 1.35 percent, to 15,872.58 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. But it rebounded strongly after Hashimoto's official
announcement.
	   The dollar, meanwhile, soared at one point to 144.06 yen, up
2.73 yen from 141.33 yen late Friday in Tokyo and above 140.93 yen
in late New York trading Friday.
	   ``We must fix the economy as soon as possible'' said Takashi
Imai, head of the powerful Japan Federation of Economic
Organizations. ``We cannot afford to have a political vacuum.''
	   The conservative, pro-business Liberal Democrats will continue
to rule because they have firm control over the more powerful lower
house, which can pass the national budget and choose the prime
minister without the approval of the upper house.
	   But they fell far short of the 69 seats they needed to regain a
majority in the upper chamber, which it lost in 1989, and also was
well below its strength going into the polls of 61.
	   They now have 102 of the upper house's 252 seats.
	   With unemployment at a record high of 4.1 percent, bankruptcies
soaring and Japan's financial system wobbling under massive bad
loans, voters vented their frustration at the LDP's inability to
get the economy back on track.
	   The weakened party will now need the cooperation of other
parties to pass key legislation.
	   That was not expected to be easy _ opposition parties on Monday
were already calling for the dissolution of the lower house and
general elections.
	   Analysts said that in the long run, the electoral humiliation
may prompt the LDP and the government to work harder to get the
economy back on track.
	   For the near term, however, the political situation was likely
to remain fluid.
	   Hashimoto said he would cancel scheduled official visits to the
United States and France. He was to have left July 19, and use the
trips to try to win support for his administration's efforts to
jumpstart the economy.
	   The Liberal Democrats' sense of near panic was apparent as the
voting neared. It flip-flopped repeatedly on cutting income taxes,
which many voters, as well the United States, considered a key
factor for economic recovery.
	   Emerging strongly in the elections were the Democrats _ a
liberal, relatively new party headed by the charismatic Naoto Kan,
who promised such a tax cut early in the campaign.
	   They won 27 seats, a gain of nine, and now hold 47 in the entire
upper house.

Ombudsman launches investigation into airport chaos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Faced with mounting public pressure to find out
what went wrong at Hong Kong's new airport, the government's
ombudsman launched an independent investigation on Monday to see
whether administrative errors caused the costly chaos.
	   Government officials have been accused of bowing to political
pressure to open the airport prematurely to coincide with the visit
of Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who dedicated it on July 2.
Others questioned why safety permits were issued when there were
obvious mechanical problems.
	   Passenger services have been improving steadily since the
airport was opened for commercial business last Monday. Most
travelers reported satisfactory services.
	   Air cargo transportation also has resumed partially with the
government's help. The main cargo handler, Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals, slapped an embargo on most cargo shipments and moved
part of the operation back to the old airport last Tuesday because
of mechanical and computer glitches at the new terminal.
	   The cargo embargo could cut 0.1 percent off Gross Domestic
Product this year, when the economy registered negative growth for
the first time in 14 years.
	   Ombudsman Andrew So said he would investigate whether there had
been administrative errors that led to the rocky start, and whether
anyone should be held financially responsible, government-owned
Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   Last week, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and the legislature
announced they, too, would launch their own independent
investigations.
	   The dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport, built on reclaimed
land at the tip of the isolated outlying Lautau Island west of
downtown Hong Kong, replaced 73-year-old Kai Tak airport.

Human rights group says Iraq executed 35 detainees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq has executed 35 political prisoners
arrested during a failed uprising in southern Iraq after the 1991
Gulf War, a human rights group said Monday.
	   The prisoners were from three Shiite Muslim towns, the Iraqi
Communist Party's Center for Human Rights said. The bodies were
handed over to their families in late May and early June, it said.
	   The London-based group listed the names of the executed
prisoners, including a woman arrested in al-Hillah, a town 100
kilometers (65 miles) south of the capital Baghdad. It said all
were executed inside Abu Ghraib prison west of Baghdad.
	   There was no way to confirm the report, and the secretive Iraqi
government rarely responds to such charges.
	   But in April, Max van der Stoel, a former Dutch foreign minister
who heads a U.N. human rights commission investigating abuses in
Iraq, said purges inside prisons and other executions may have
accounted for 1,500 deaths in the country last year.
	   All 35 prisoners were said to be residents of Iraq's southern
provinces, which is mainly populated by Shiite Muslims.
	   Shiite Muslim rebels rose up against the government after Iraq
was defeated in the Gulf War. Despite early successes, the uprising
was crushed and a brutal government crackdown ensued.
	   The group called on U.N. groups and human rights organizations
to exert greater efforts to end the executions.

Indonesian military warns East Timorese not to raise rebel flag
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian military on Monday warned
pro-independence activists in East Timor not to display the flag of
the territory's separatist rebel movement.
	   Lt. Col. Supadi, chief of staff of the local military command in
the former Portuguese colony, said action will be taken against
anti-Indonesian protesters who raise the flag of the Fretilin
guerrilla group. He did not elaborate.
	   Protests are expected in East Timor later this week to coincide
with the visit of Jamshed Marker, the United Nation's special envoy
for the troubled territory.
	   ``We will take action against whoever raises a flag other than
the red and white one,'' Supadi said, referring to the red and
white Indonesian flag.
	   The Fretilin flag is red, black and yellow with a star.
	   In recent weeks, demonstrators have raised rebel flags during
pro-independence rallies in East Timor, which was invaded by
Indonesia in 1975 and annexed a year later. Tens of thousands of
people died in ensuing fighting and famine.
	   Gen. Wiranto, armed forces chief, gave the order not to display
the rebel flag, Supadi said.
	   Wiranto issued a similar warning to pro-independence activists
in Irian Jaya, where flags of a rebel group in the remote province
have also been raised at rallies. He said that showing the flag was
``treasonous'' and would not be tolerated.
	   Fretilin, which has dwindled in strength under pressure from the
Indonesian military, has been fighting for independence in East
Timor for decades.
	   According to Supadi, some guerrillas have left the jungle to
join pro-independence activists in the capital, Dili.
	   Fearing attack by native Timorese, at least 20,000 non-Timorese
Indonesians are reported to have fled the troubled half-island
territory since late last month.
	   Officials and some immigrants said they were scared by possible
mass protests during the visit of Marker, the U.N. envoy. However,
because of security concerns, it is unclear whether he will visit
East Timor or conduct meetings elsewhere in Indonesia.
	   The United Nations still recognizes Portugal as the
administering power of the territory it had colonized for more than
four centuries.

Best might be ahead for record-setting Pak
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS to ADD quotes, details; edits throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSTY MILLER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYLVANIA, Ohio (AP) _ Se Ri Pak has won two straight majors and
rewrote the LPGA record book in the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic.
	   And she's just getting started.
	   ``I have many, many things to learn,'' the 20-year-old South
Korean said after routing the field by nine strokes Sunday. ``This
is a good start, but I must do much work. I am not finished yet.''
	   Her final-round 5-under-par 66, after record rounds of 61 and
63, left her at 23-under 261. The victory, less than a week after
winning the U.S. Women's Open in a playoff Monday, was worth dlrs
120,000.
	   The 261 total is the lowest in a 72-hole U.S. LPGA tournament,
four strokes better than the previous record set by Wendy Ward in
the 1997 Fieldcrest Classic on a par-72 course and matched by Lisa
Walters in this year's Oldsmobile Classic on a par-72 course and
Kelly Robbins in last year's Farr on the 6,319-yard (5776-meter),
par-71 Highland Meadows Golf Club.
	   Her 23-under score in relation to par matched the lowest in LPGA
history, set by Ward last year and tied by Walters.
	   ``I am only 20 years old. I have many, many years left,'' she
said. ``I can play many many years, can play in many, many
tournaments. I will play my best in every tournament.''
	   While speaking in the interview room, she cuddled her beagle
puppy, Happy. She has won two tournaments in as many starts since
buying the dog _ ``For dlrs 300!'' she exclaimed _ just before the
Open.
	   She need not worry about the cost. She has only three top-10
finishes in 16 starts this year, but all three were wins. Her other
victory came in another major, the LPGA Championship. She leads the
money list with dlrs 645,170.
	   Pak's 61 in the second round was the lowest score ever in an
LPGA event. Her 63 in the second round gave her the lowest
consecutive rounds in tour history.
	   She also became only the third player, following Louise Suggs in
1952 and Jane Geddes in 1986, to follow a U.S. Women's Open victory
with another win her next start.
	   Pak has been compared to Tiger Woods. Others have measured her
rapid start on the women's tour with that Nancy Lopez, who won nine
tournaments as a rookie in 1978, or with another Hall of Famer,
Betsy King.
	   Pak said she has a long way to go to measure up to those
players.
	   ``That is my future,'' she said. ``I want to be like Nancy
Lopez, like Betsy King. If they play good or not, they are nice to
people and treat them like friends. They do many things to help
people. I am really happy that people see me like Nancy or Betsy
King.''
	   The former track sprinter got off to a relatively slow start.
She had three birdies and a bogey on the front side _ three-putting
at the par-4 4th. The birdies came on putts of 14 feet (4.27
meters) at No. 3, 12 feet (3.66 meters) at No. 7, and 10 feet (3.05
meters) above the hole at No. 8.
	   She started the back side by rolling in two long birdie putts
and then at No. 16 rammed in a 25-footer (7.62-meter shot) to get
to 23-under.
	   She encountered her only real difficulty of the day when she
pulled her second shot to the par-5 17th into a stand of fir trees
left of the green. She punched out to the front fringe and left her
lengthy first putt 8 feet (2.44 meters) short. But she rolled in
the par putt while the gallery went wild.
	   At the par-5 closing hole, with the outright record on the line,
she left her approach 20 feet (6.10 meters) short.
	   ``Too fat,'' she said with a laugh. ``I try, but I hit too
fat.''
	   Her birdie putt slid right of the hole, then she tapped in to
thunderous applause.
	   ``People say you can make new record,'' she said. ``But golf is
not easy.''
	   Her lead never dropped below seven shots all day.
	   ``Realistically, I was playing for second,'' said Lisa Hackney,
who shot a 65 and was able to only carve one stroke out of a
10-shot deficit. ''
	   Pak's final-round playing partner, Karrie Webb, had a 67 and was
third at 13-under 271.
	   ``She's only 20, but her game has matured,'' said Webb, who has
known Pak since their amateur days. ``Especially out here. When I
played with her in Korea, she did not have a good game plan. Now
her course management has gotten a lot better.''
	   Pak was tied for 63rd in the 144-player field after shooting a
par 71 in the opening round.
	   ``This is the best week for me,'' she said.

Subway workers begin 24-hour strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Commuters faced inconvenience Monday as a 24-hour
strike by London's subway workers began to bite.
	   The strike got under way last night, but no real disruption to
services was expected until the Monday morning rush-hour.
	   Thousands of members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union
were expected to take part in the action after talks with
management had ended without an agreement.
	   The union's action came after it failed to obtain government
assurances that neither train service nor employee's jobs and
pensions would be affected by plans for private firms to help run
parts of the system.
	   More than 2 million people, including commuters and tourists,
travel every day on the London Underground, popularly known as the
``tube.''
	   The union, which represents one-third of the underground staff,
staged a 48-hour walkout last month that disrupted subway services,
closing down nearly 20 stations.

	   DETROIT (AP) _ Roger Clemens struck out 10 in the first five
innings for his fifth straight win and Ed Sprague homered twice
Sunday, leading Toronto to a 7-2 win over Detroit.
	   Jose Canseco hit a tie-breaking two-run double in the eighth
inning, and Shannon Stewart and Shawn Green added homers for the
Blue Jays.
	   Tony Clark homered as the Tigers lost for the third time in 10
games.
	   Clemens (10-6) gave up two runs and five hits in 7 1-3 innings.
It was his 86th career double-digit strikeout game and third this
year.
	   Detroit rookie Brian Powell allowed two runs and three hits with
no walks and three strikeouts, leaving after Sprague's leadoff
homer in the eighth. Reliever Doug Brocail (4-2) took the loss.
 &UR; Twins 11, Indians 6 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, rookie Eric Milton took a perfect game into the
sixth inning and David Ortiz drove in a career-high four runs for
Minnesota.
	   Milton (5-7) didn't allow a hit or baserunner until David Bell
hit his seventh homer with two outs in the sixth.
	   By then, the Twins had built a 10-0 lead on 13 hits off Charles
Nagy (7-6) and Jose Mesa.
	   Milton allowed three runs and four hits in 6 2-3 innings, with
four strikeouts and no walks.
	   Nagy yielded six runs and nine hits in 4 1-3 innings, his
shortest outing in 19 starts this season. He allowed his major
league-high 26th homer.
	   Cleveland's Travis Fryman hit his 17th home run in the ninth,
his third homer in three days.
 &UR; Royals 4, White Sox 3 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Jeff Conine blooped an RBI single for his fourth hit
of the game as Kansas City scored twice in the ninth inning.
	   Shane Mack singled off Matt Karchner (2-3) and Dean Palmer
doubled off the top of the right-field wall before Jeff King hit a
game-tying sacrifice fly to right. Conine then dropped a single
into shallow right to score Palmer.
	   Scott Service (3-1) pitched 1 2-3 innings of hitless relief for
the win. Jeff Montgomery pitched the ninth for his 20th save,
striking out Chad Kreuter with the tying run at second to end it.
	   Magglio Ordonez and Wil Cordero hit back-to-back homers in the
second for Chicago.
	   Sal Fasano's fourth homer tied it 2-2 in the fourth.
 &UR; Yankees 9, Devil Rays 2 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, the Yankees won their 10th straight
game for their longest winning streak in four years after scoring
seven ninth-inning runs.
	   The Yankees' 14th victory in 15 games enabled them to keep pace
with the 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates for baseball's best start this
century at 65-20.
	   The expansion Devil Rays have lost a season-high 10 straight.
	   New York loaded the bases with no outs against Roberto Hernandez
(0-4) without getting the ball past the mound, then took a 3-2 lead
when the Devil Rays closer hit Chuck Knoblauch with a pitch.
	   Derek Jeter followed with a two-run single and Tino Martinez
doubled off Scott Aldred to drive in three more runs and break the
game open.
	   David Wells pitched five innings for the Yankees before leaving
with a bruised right toe. Mike Stanton (4-0) pitched the final 1
1-3 innings for the victory.
 &UR; Orioles 11, Red Sox 7 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Eric Davis hit his 10th career grand slam and
drove in a season-high five runs as the Orioles completed their
first four-game sweep of Boston in 18 years.
	   Boston got a homer from Mo Vaughn in a six-run fifth before the
Orioles scored four runs in their half and held on.
	   Doug Johns (3-2) pitched 2 2-3 innings for his first major
league victory as a reliever and Alan Mills got four outs for his
first save.
	   It was Baltimore's first four-game winning streak since a
seven-game run in early April, and first at home against Boston
since July 25-27, 1961.
	   Vaughn went 3-for-4 with three RBIs for the Red Sox, whose
four-game losing streak is their longest since a six-game skid from
May 23-29.
	   Jin Ho Cho (0-2) lost his second major league start.
 &UR; Angels 8, Mariners 5 &QC; 
	   In Seatle, Dave Hollins hit a three-run homer as Anaheim
regained first place from Texas in the AL West with only its second
win in nine games.
	   The Angels gave Jason Dickson (9-6) a 6-1 lead with a five-run
second inning, capped by Hollins' 10th homer of the season, against
Bill Swift (8-5).
	   Troy Percival pitched the ninth for his 26th save.
	   Ken Griffey Jr., the AL's home-run leader with 37, went 2-for-3
with two walks and his 10th stolen base.
	   Jay Buhner, Dan Wilson and Joey Cora homered for the Mariners,
giving them 144 in 92 games, tops in the majors.
	   Dickson allowed four runs on seven hits and a walk in six
innings, while Swift gave up seven runs on 10 hits and a walk in
six innings.
 &UR; Athletics 7, Rangers 5 &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California, Jimmy Haynes pitched seven strong
innings as Oakland avoided a four-game series sweep.
	   Haynes (7-3), who won a career-high third straight decision,
allowed two unearned runs on nine hits and was helped by two Texas
runners getting thrown out at the plate and one at third.
	   The Rangers closed to 7-5 in the ninth on pinch-hitter Mark
McLemore's infield RBI single and a two-run double by pinch-hitter
Domingo Cedeno. But Bill Taylor struck out Roberto Kelly with a man
on for his 19th save.
	   Darren Oliver (4-7) retired the first 13 Oakland batters, but
got just two more outs, leaving in the sixth after allowing five
runs and five hits with three walks.
	   The Rangers had a five-game winning streak snapped.

Dollar rises, Tokyo stocks finish higher after elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Monday after
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a stunning defeat
in parliamentary elections. Tokyo stock prices finished higher.
	   The dollar bought 142.64 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 1.31
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
level of 140.93 yen, also on Friday.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average climbed 270.33
points, or 1.68 percent, closing at 16,360.39 points. On Friday,
the Nikkei index shed 356.89 points, or 2.17 percent,
	   The dollar surged in early Asian trading as investors dumped the
yen following the surprisingly poor showing of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party in Sunday's election for Japan's upper house of
Parliament.
	   But the dollar's rally soon ran out of steam, as Japanese
investors who bought the U.S. currency near its highs earlier in
the session hurried to take profits, traders said.
	   At one point in morning trading, the dollar moved as high as
144.50 yen, its highest intra-day level in Tokyo since June 16,
when the currency rose to 146.75 yen.
	   Despite the election results, the conservative, pro-business
Liberal Democrats will continue to rule because they have a stable
majority in the more powerful lower house, which can pass the
national budget and choose the prime minister without the approval
of the upper house.
	   The outcome of Sunday's elections underscores widespread
frustration in Japan with the LDP's inability to come up with the
right policies to get Japan's recession-plagued economy back on
track toward recovery.
	   In an afternoon news conference, Hashimoto, who has been Japan's
leader since January of 1996, announced he would resign to take
responsibility for his party's election defeat.
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei index at one point slipped 280
points amid political uncertainty following the ruling party's poor
election showing.
	   But the index recovered its early losses on buying as investors
felt the government will still implement the reform plans it has
promised internationally, even with a change of prime ministers,
traders said.
	   Foreign investors and domestic bargain hunters were among the
major buyers that helped reverse the course.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 14.94 points, or 1.20 percent, to 1,256.44. On
Friday, the TOPIX closed down 20.78 points, or 1.65 percent.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.405 percent from Friday's finish of 1.370
percent, driving its price down to 110.40 yen from 110.66 yen.

New financial watchdog inspects troubled Long-Term Credit Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Officials from Japan's newly established financial
industry watchdog on Monday began inspecting bad-debt burdened
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
	   It was the first inspection of a Japanese bank conducted by the
Financial Supervisory Agency since its establishment in June, an
agency official said.
	   Ailing Long-Term Credit Bank, saddled with 1.4 trillion yen
(dlrs 9.86 billion) in problem loans, recently started negotiations
with Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corp., a major Japanese trust bank,
about a possible merger.
	   Many Japanese banks are burdened with a total of 76 trillion yen
(dlrs 535 billion) in bad loans, making them wary of extending new
credit and impeding Japan's economic recovery.
	   The agency official, speaking on condition of anonymity, refused
to provide details on the inspection.
	   The Yomiuri newspaper, however, reported that inspectors will
take about a month to check whether the bank's loans to its related
non-bank financial institutions are in arrears.
	   The agency, which took over duties formerly held by the Finance
Ministry, will also carry out inspections of 18 other major banking
institutions in the near future.
	   The new watchdog is part of a larger reform effort initiated by
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to cut off cozy ties between the
financial industry and Japan's powerful bureaucracy.
	   Last month, concern about the fate of Long-Term Credit Bank
emerged after Moody's Investors Services lowered its credit rating
for the bank and sent its share prices plunging.
	   Monday afternoon, Hashimoto expressed his intention to resign as
prime minister in the wake of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party's
stunning defeat in Sunday's parliamentary elections.

Human rights group says Iraq executed 35 detainees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq has executed 35 political prisoners
arrested during a failed uprising in southern Iraq after the 1991
Gulf War, a human rights group said Monday.
	   The prisoners were from three Shiite Muslim towns, the Iraqi
Communist Party's Center for Human Rights said. The bodies were
handed over to their families in late May and early June, it said.
	   The London-based group listed the names of the executed
prisoners, including a woman arrested in al-Hillah, a town 100
kilometers (65 miles) south of the capital Baghdad. It said all
were executed inside Abu Ghraib prison west of Baghdad.
	   There was no way to confirm the report, and the secretive Iraqi
government rarely responds to such charges.
	   But in April, Max van der Stoel, a former Dutch foreign minister
who heads a U.N. human rights commission investigating abuses in
Iraq, said purges inside prisons and other executions may have
accounted for 1,500 deaths in the country last year.
	   All 35 prisoners were said to be residents of Iraq's southern
provinces, which is mainly populated by Shiite Muslims. Shiites
comprise a slight majority in Iraq, but Sunni Muslims dominate the
government.
	   Shiite rebels rose up against the government after Iraq was
defeated in the Gulf War. Despite early successes, the uprising was
crushed and a brutal government crackdown ensued.
	   The group called on U.N. groups and human rights organizations
to exert greater efforts to end the executions.

ASEAN to discuss end of non-intervention policy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo Available
 &UR; By DAVID THURBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, based since its start on non-interference in each others'
internal affairs, has matured and is ready to consider more direct
involvement and criticism, an official said Monday.
	   ``Times have changed. After 31 years we are now adults and we
should be able to discuss our problems frankly,'' Philippine
Secretary of Foreign Affairs Domingo Siazon said.
	   He said ASEAN foreign ministers, at a meeting this month in
Manila, will probably begin ``a major change in ASEAN's policy from
non-intervention to a more pro-active policy of flexible
engagement.''
	   The shift comes as Southeast Asian countries are becoming more
aware that problems in one nation _ such as currency devaluations,
political unrest or haze caused by forest fires _ often affect its
neighbors.
	   ``The realization that we are all together in the same boat is
becoming clear,'' Siazon said.
	   The policy shift would make it easier, for example, for ASEAN
members to talk to Indonesia about its forest fires, which each
year blanket much of the region in dangerous haze.
	   Siazon said the proposed change in the once-sacred
non-intervention policy will not be part of the formal agenda at
the foreign ministers' meeting, and is likely to be discussed
instead during informal events such as dinners or golf games.
	   The non-intervention policy has long been a sensitive issue
because of non-democratic governments in some ASEAN countries. But
Siazon noted that political and economic reforms are now occurring
in most ASEAN members.
	   The foreign ministers' meetings, which begin July 24, ``will
most probably be a turning point in ASEAN's history,'' he said in a
briefing to reporters. ``Today, all the countries in ASEAN are in a
state of change.''
	   Siazon, Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan, and Malaysian
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim have all called publicly for
ASEAN to shift to a more flexible engagement policy.
	   Siazon, however, said he does not expect an immediate consensus
from all nine ASEAN members.
	   ASEAN began to stretch its non-intervention policy last year
when it postponed Cambodia's bid for membership because of a coup
led by co-premier Hun Sen. Since then ASEAN has urged the Cambodian
government to normalize politics by holding elections, which are
scheduled for July 26 _ during the ASEAN meetings.
	   Siazon said the Philippines will push for an early acceptance of
Cambodia into ASEAN if the polls are shown to be ``free, fair and
credible.''
	   The foreign ministers also plan to discuss how the region should
deal with new countries attempting to develop nuclear weapons,
Siazon said.
	   ``Pakistan and India have crossed that bridge. We need to
determine measures to prevent the next ones from crossing the
bridge,'' he said.
	   He said ASEAN would urge India and Pakistan not to install any
nuclear warheads on missiles and would encourage them to ``put the
(nuclear) genie back in the bottle,'' perhaps in exchange for
development assistance.
	   ASEAN consists of Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Official: Philippine Airlines may close if ground personnel strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A strike by ground personnel of
Philippine Airlines could ruin a rehabilitation plan and force
Asia's oldest airline to shut down, an airline official said
Monday.
	   PAL's 5,000-member ground personnel union has threatened to
strike to force the airline to accept back thousands of employees
it sacked to stave off losses worsened by a devastating strike by
more than 600 pilots last month.
	   Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma assumed jurisdiction of the
dispute involving the ground personnel on Friday, saying a work
stoppage could harm the Philippine economy.
	   Laguesma said his order stops the ground personnel from
proceeding with a strike and also prevents management from
dismissing more employees.
	   But PAL senior vice president Avelino Zapanta said the airline
has received information that the Philippine Airline Employees'
Union is considering defying the no-strike order.
	   He said a strike by PALEA could harm an airline rehabilitation
plan approved by the government's Securities and Exchange
Commission and eventually force the flag carrier to halt
operations.
	   ``Another strike would be the last blow,'' he said. ``We appeal
to the union to think of the future of the remaining employees, the
airline and the country.''
	   The union filed a strike notice with the labor department last
month. A mandatory 15-day ``cooling off'' period following the
notice ended Monday, after which the union would have been legally
able to strike had the labor secretary not intervened.
	   Under the rehabilitation plan, PAL is slashing its work force,
disposing of 40 of its 54 planes, suspending more than two-thirds
of its routes and selling some subsidiaries. The commission also
allowed the airline to defer payments on maturing financial
obligations worth dlrs 2 billion.
	   The airlines' 625 pilots went on strike for 22 days last month,
aggravating financial losses caused by Asia's currency storm and
setting back an ambitious dlrs 4 billion modernization program. PAL
fired all the striking pilots after they ignored a government
return-to-work order.
	   At the height of the pilots' walkout, PAL laid off 5,000 of its
more than 13,000 workers to minimize losses, forcing the airline's
ground personnel and flight attendants to threaten to strike as
well. More than 3,000 of the terminated employees were PALEA
members.
	   President Joseph Estrada said he has urged PAL's main owner,
business tycoon Lucio Tan, to reduce the number of layoffs and
flight cutbacks to ease the labor unrest.
	   Estrada reportedly plans to meet separately with airline and
union officials this week.
	   PAL officials say the 57-year-old airline lost more than dlrs 50
million in revenue because of the pilots' strike.

Finance Minister: Malaysia will slip into recession this year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim
forecast Monday that Malaysia will slip into recession this year,
confirming the worst fears of financial analysts.
	   The gross domestic product would contract by 1 to 2 percent in
1998, Anwar said.
	   Malaysia's economy contracted by 1.8 percent in this year's
first three months, compared to 6.9 percent growth in the previous
quarter.
	   Until now, the government had maintained that it would be able
to achieve GDP growth of between 2 and 3 percent for 1998.
	   Even last week, Anwar had said that Malaysia would have to
revise its growth target but would try to halt a slide into
recession.

Nine students kidnapped in southern Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Renegade Muslim rebels have
kidnapped nine college students returning home for a weekend stay
on a strife-torn southern Philippine island, a local official said
Monday.
	   Vice Gov. Bonnie Balamo said the students, five women and four
men, were kidnapped Saturday in a remote village in Lamitan town on
Basilan Island. Police said the victims are children of rich Muslim
traders on Basilan.
	   Balamo identified the kidnappers' leader as Wahab Sakape, a
former Moro National Liberation Front leader who reportedly has
turned to banditry. He said Sakape demanded a ``huge ransom'' for
the students but declined to give the exact amount.
	   The students, from different colleges in Zamboanga, returned to
Basilan to be with their parents over the weekend. The jeep they
were riding in was stopped by Sakape's men and taken to an
undisclosed hideout, Balamo said.
	   Balamo said he is negotiating with an emissary of Sakape for the
release of the students.
	   The government signed a peace pact with the MNLF in 1996 to end
a quarter-century rebellion that killed more than 120,000 people.
However, some of its members became bandits and resorted to
kidnapping and other crimes to support themselves.
	   Two smaller Muslim rebel groups _ the fundamentalist Abu Sayyaf
and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front _ are still fighting the
government.
	   All three groups are believed to have a presence on Basilan.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant Orangemen marched on
their big holiday Monday, chastened and divided by the deaths of
three boys in the violence swirling around their defiance of a
government order to avoid one Catholic neighborhood.
	   Some prominent Orangemen had called for an end to the week-long
confrontation between marchers and security forces near Portadown,
following the Sunday morning firebombing that killed the Quinn
brothers, Richard, 10, Mark, 9 and Jason, 7, in their home in
Ballymoney, 40 miles (60 kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   Their Catholic mother and her Protestant partner escaped safely.
	   ``After last night's attack a 15-minute walk down Garvaghy Road
by the Orange Order would be a very hollow victory because it would
be in the shadow of the coffins of three little boys who wouldn't
even know what the Orange Order is about,'' said the Rev. William
Bingham, chaplain to the Orange Order in County Armagh.
	   Last week, Bingham was one of four Orange officials who met with
Prime Minister Tony Blair pressing their demand to walk down that
road, despite the hostility of Catholic residents there and an
order from the Parades Commission blocking the march.
	   The Portadown district Orange Lodges defiantly declared that
their protest would continue until they walked the Garvaghy Road.
But they asked Orangemen not to join them Monday in the pastures
near Drumcree Anglican church for a mass confrontation with police
and British troops.
	   Another contentious parade, through the Lower Ormeau area of
Belfast, was delayed Monday morning after a telephone caller warned
of bombs near the Orange hall. Army specialists carried out
controlled explosions to neutralize two suspicious packages.
	   The BBC said a bomb warning came with code words from the Irish
National Liberation Army, an IRA splinter group that has refused to
observe a cease-fire.
	   Catholic residents on the Ormeau Road had called off plans to
try to stop the march after the killings Sunday, and said they
would protest peacefully at the side of the road. They hung banners
along the route saying: ``Shame.''
	   Police said a pub in Aghoghill, 25 miles (40 kms) northwest of
Belfast, was damaged by smoke in an arson attempt overnight, and
police fired plastic bullets at a crowd gathered near a holiday
bonfire in the area.
	   An Orangeman was taken to a hospital after being attacked during
a Catholic demonstration at a parade Sunday night in Keady, 40
miles (65 kms) southwest of Belfast.
	   Plastic bullets were also discharged to quell disturbances in
south Belfast, where youths set fire to a truck and officers in
Londonderry were attacked by a crowd throwing gasoline bombs and
stones. However, police said it was one of the quietest nights of
the past week.

Price gouging for Chinese work permits investigated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Labor officials gouged farmers seeking jobs in
China's capital, charging up to 26 times the usual price for work
permits, the official Workers Daily reported Monday.
	   Ma Zhongchen, Henan province's governor and Communist Party
chief, has ``strongly criticized'' the illegal peddling of the
employment permits farmers are supposed to have to work in Chinese
cities, the newspaper said.
	   Officials from the Henan labor bureau charged up to 26 yuan
(dlrs 3) for the much demanded permits, which normally go for 1
yuan (12 cents), the newspaper said.
	   Permits were sometimes sold in bulk at inflated prices to
private dealers and other organizations, including province-backed
construction enterprises, the paper said.
	   Investigators from the bureau have been assigned to the case,
the report said. It did not say whether any arrests have been made.
	   Seeking to control a ``floating population'' of up to 150
million itinerant laborers, China requires workers to apply for
permission to leave their rural homes to seek work in cities. Many
go illegally.

Georgian militia blamed in attack that kills five Russian troops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A pro-government militia was responsible
for a landmine attack that killed five Russian peacekeeping troops
in this former Soviet republic, the top Russian commander claimed
Monday.
	   The powerful landmine went off Sunday while Russian troops were
looking for mines on a road in the breakaway province of Abkhazia,
Russian commander Gen. Sergei Korobko was quoted as saying by the
Interfax news agency. Three more Russian soldiers were wounded.
	   Korobko blamed the White Legion, a militia that supports
Georgia's central government and often clashes with the separatists
in Abkhazia.
	   The White Legion has accused the Russian peacekeepers of siding
with the separatists and has frequently threatened to attack the
Russian forces.
	   But the chief of the White Legion, Zurab Samushia, denied the
Russian claims and blamed Abkhazian separatists for the bombing.
	   Samushia said the White Legion had threatened to attack Russian
troops for their alleged support of the separatists during clashes
in Abkhazia in May, but it has never acted on the threats.
	   ``Accusations against us are absolutely unfounded,'' Samushia
told the Associated Press.
	   Georgia's Interior Ministry said Sunday that the explosion
occurred when a Russian armored vehicle hit a land mine. It also
blamed the attack on Abkhazian fighters.
	   Russian peacekeepers were deployed in the Black Sea province of
Abkhazia in 1994 to separate Georgian government troops and
Abkhazian separatist forces following a war. The Russian troops
have helped prevent the resumption of a full-scale conflict, but
the region remains restive and there has been no real progress
toward a political settlement.

Activists urge restraint by Indonesian military in Irian Jaya
</HEADLINE>
province &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Activists and social workers urged the
Indonesian military Monday to show restraint in Irian Jaya
province, where security forces have clashed with pro-independence
protesters.
	   One policeman and one demonstrator have been killed in recent
protests in the remote province, where a small band of separatist
rebels has been fighting for decades.
	   In Jakarta, members of private organizations visited the
government-backed National Human Rights Commission to complain
about reports that the military was persecuting civilians in Irian
Jaya.
	   Even though it is a government agency, the commission has often
been critical of its sponsor.
	   Willi Sawaki, an organizer of The Solidarity Committee of Irian
People, told the commission that soldiers had allegedly raided
homes and were interrogating suspected protesters.
	   Pro-independence activists have been growing bolder in Irian
Jaya, as well as the disputed territory of East Timor, since the
resignation in May of authoritarian President Suharto.
	   His successor, B.J. Habibie, has pledged democratic reform but
has ruled out giving way to separatist demands.
	   A member of the human rights panel, Baharudin Lopa, said a
commission team had already been sent to Irian Jaya but he urged
patience as investigators collect information.
	   Indonesia took over Irian Jaya, the western half of New Guinea,
in 1963. Six years later, in a U.N.-sponsored vote, people in the
former Dutch colony formally chose integration with Indonesia.

At least 13 killed in a clash between rival warlords
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ At least 13 people were killed in an
apparent turf battle between rival warlords in the Central Asian
nation of Tajikistan, officials said Monday.
	   The clash between the two warlords, Nazim Yunusov and Mullo
Kasym Ismati, appeared to be part of a personal feud, though the
details remained unclear. The fighting broke out Sunday near the
town of Kofarnikhon, some 30 kilometers (20 miles) east of the
capital, Dushanbe.
	   Yunusov was among 13 fighters killed in battles that also left a
number of civilians wounded, Tajikistan's Interior Ministry said.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency quoted unidentified officials as
saying that at least 20 people were killed in the fighting.
	   The Commission for National Reconciliation, which includes
members of the government and former rebel factions, went to
Kofarnikhon on Monday to investigate the causes of the conflict.
	   The government and mostly Islamic opposition signed a peace
agreement last year, formally ending a five-year civil war in the
impoverished nation.
	   The government has given amnesty to the rebels and brought their
leaders into the cabinet. But sporadic clashes have continued,
often fueled by clan rivalries and personal disputes among various
warlords.

Thailand and Cambodia to open historic temple to tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to
let tourists visit an ancient and historic Cambodian Buddhist
temple that had been kept off limits in recent years because of a
guerrilla war, the Thai army said Monday.
	   Until recently, the ruins of the Preah Vihear temple, perched on
a cliff near the border with Thailand, were a stronghold of radical
Marxist Khmer Rouge guerrillas fighting the government in Phnom
Penh.
	   Two Belgian tourists who journeyed to the 800-year-old
Angkor-era temple from Thailand in 1994 were murdered by the
guerrillas. The area is also strewn with land mines.
	   The temple will be reopened to tourists around the end of July,
said a Thai army officer stationed along the border, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   The Thai and Cambodian armies will cooperate in clearing mines
from the area around the temple, he said.

Indonesia's economic crisis hits hamburger chain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ There are fewer Big Mac hamburgers to
munch on in Indonesia because of economic turmoil.
	   One-fifth of the 101 McDonald's fast food restaurants in
Indonesia have shut due to sluggish sales and recent riots over
price increases, company officials said Monday.
	   McDonald's Indonesia Family Restaurants, which operates the
Indonesian franchise of U.S. hamburger giant McDonald's Corp., said
14 outlets were closed as a result of slumping consumer purchasing
power.
	   Another six restaurants were destroyed in riots in May that led
to the downfall of President Suharto.
	   As many as 1,200 people were killed in unrest in Jakarta and
thousands of vehicles, shops and homes were damaged.
	   The rupiah has dropped more than 80 percent in value since last
year, pushing millions of people into poverty and crippling
businesses.
	   The currency plunge has hurt McDonald's restaurants especially
hard because many of its products, such as the potatoes for its
french fries, are imported.
	   The price of a Big Mac in Indonesia is 10,400 rupiah (70 U.S.
cents).

Small bomb outside of PLO headquarters injures one
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new detail throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian man was slightly injured Monday
when a small bomb went off near the PLO's unofficial headquarters
in east Jerusalem, the police said.
	   Faisel Husseini, the top Palestinian official in Jerusalem, told
reporters that police suspected Jewish extremists, but police said
only that they were investigating. No group immediately claimed
responsibility.
	   The small explosive device was planted in a trash can about 30
meters (yards) outside the Palestinian complex known as Orient
House, police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said.
	   Police chief Yair Yitzhaki said preliminary tests indicated no
connection between this bomb and others set off in Arab areas of
Jerusalem this year. He said the device was too small to have
caused much damage.
	   The bomb squad briefly cordoned off the area to search for
evidence and collect debris.
	   The injured man, a 40-year-old Palestinian from east Jerusalem,
suffered leg and head cuts that were described as light.
	   Israel has complained that the Palestinian Authority is
violating autonomy accords by having offices in the city's disputed
eastern sector.
	   The accords allow the Palestinians to run government offices
only in the West Bank and Gaza, pending negotiations on Jerusalem's
final status. In the past, Orient House has been the scene of angry
protests by right-wing Israelis demanding its shutdown.
	   The Palestinians describe the complex as the seat of their
future government in east Jerusalem, which they claim as their
capital. Israel, though, claims sovereignty over all Jerusalem.
	   The city's eastern sector was annexed by Israel, which captured
it from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant Orangemen marched on
their big holiday Monday, chastened and divided by the deaths of
three boys in the violence swirling around their defiance of a
government order to avoid one Catholic neighborhood.
	   Some prominent Orangemen had called for an end to the week-long
confrontation between marchers and security forces near Portadown,
following the Sunday morning firebombing that killed the Quinn
brothers, Richard, 10, Mark, 9 and Jason, 7, in their home in
Ballymoney, 40 miles (60 kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   Their Catholic mother and her Protestant partner escaped safely.
	   ``After last night's attack a 15-minute walk down Garvaghy Road
by the Orange Order would be a very hollow victory because it would
be in the shadow of the coffins of three little boys who wouldn't
even know what the Orange Order is about,'' said the Rev. William
Bingham, chaplain to the Orange Order in County Armagh.
	   Last week, Bingham was one of four Orange officials who met with
Prime Minister Tony Blair pressing their demand to walk down that
road, despite the hostility of Catholic residents there and an
order from the Parades Commission blocking the march.
	   The Portadown district Orange Lodges defiantly declared that
their protest would continue until they walked the Garvaghy Road.
But they asked Orangemen not to join them Monday in the pastures
near Drumcree Anglican church for a mass confrontation with police
and British troops.
	   Another contentious parade, through the Lower Ormeau area of
Belfast, was delayed Monday morning after a telephone caller warned
of bombs near the Orange hall. After Army specialists carried out
controlled explosions to neutralize two suspicious packages, the
Orangemen began marching under rainy skies, some holding umbrellas.
	   The BBC said,

Australians count injuries as they prepare for Springboks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australia's rugby union team was a
side of walking wounded Monday as it left for Perth and the second
stage of their Tri Nations series against South Africa on Saturday.
	   The Australian team paid a painful price for its 24-16 Tri
Nations and Bledisloe Cup test triumph over New Zealand at the
Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday.
	   Prop Richard Harry was ruled out of Saturday's test against
South Africa at Perth's Subiaco Oval with a damaged kneecap, while
winger Ben Tune and reserve Jason Little were doubt. Tune also
suffered a knee injury while Little missed the Melbourne game with
a calf strain.
	   Australian manager John McKay said Monday both would be rested
until later in the week before a decision was made on whether they
could play.
	   Also carrying injuries are hooker Phil Kearns (ribs), winger Joe
Roff (shoulder), centers Tim Horan (knee) and Daniel Herbert (leg),
five-eighth Steve Larkham (arm) and reserve forward Willie
Ofahengaue (knee), but McKay said all were expected to play.
	   Seasoned prop Dan Crowley will be promoted to the starting side
to take Harry's place, while Queensland front rower Glenn Panoho
will move to the bench. (djp)

Sri Lanka sets up hot line for complaints against military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's president has set up a
24-hour telephone hot line to handle complaints about military
harassment of minority Tamils.
	   Complaints range from rudeness to rape and murder. Ten days ago,
a court sentenced five soldiers and a policeman to death for
gang-raping and killing a high school senior in the northern Jaffna
Peninsula, then murdering her mother, a teenage brother and a
neighbor who came looking for her.
	   Police and government soldiers looking for Tamil Tiger
guerrillas often search Tamil neighborhoods in Colombo, the
capital, and detain hundreds of civilians, mostly young men and
women.
	   Most of them are released within hours, but some are detained
for weeks or months without trial.
	   The guerrillas are fighting for a separate homeland for the
island nation's ethnic Tamil minority, claiming widespread
discrimination by the majority Sinhalese who dominate the
government and military. More than 54,000 people have been killed
since the fighting began in 1983.
	   Complaints phoned in or faxed to the justice ministry will be
reviewed by a seven-member committee that includes three Tamil
lawmakers, the president's office said in a statement. The
committee can issue orders to the police and military.

Orgy of World Cup coverage in French media
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Sports writers, political columnists, and even the
financial newspapers all had something to say Monday about what
victory in the World Cup means for France.
	   French media joined the nation in celebrating the the World Cup
upset with an orgy of coverage devoted to the stunning 3-0 win by
Les Bleus against Brazil.
	   ``For Eternity,'' blared the headline of the sports daily
L'Equipe, which has heaped criticism on French coach Aime Jacquet
for putting together what the newspaper considered a dull team.
	   ``It's ours,'' said the headline of the daily Le Parisien, with
a picture of an ecstatic Jacquet holding the coveted golden trophy
high over his head.
	   Pride, euphoria, glory. Those were just some of the emotions
expressed in the pages of French newspapers.
	   For some commentators, victory went beyond sport. They expressed
hope the win will help combat racism in a country where the
right-wing National Front regularly gets 15 percent of the vote.
	   Some of the greatest heroes of the French team, including
Sunday's two-time scorer, Zinedine Zidane, are the children of
immigrants.
	   For Le Figaro, a conservative daily, the French victory was a
``lesson'' in ``unity'' for a nation that is now irreversibly
multiracial.
	   France stands to gain in other ways as well, according to the
financial daily Les Echos.
	   ``France's emerges with its image magnified,'' said Les Echos,
pointing out what the newspaper called the impeccable organization
the country's organization of the World Cup.
	   Throughout the World Cup, France's superb fast trains, its
fashion and food were on display and may bring the country fresh
economic rewards.
	   Amid the euphoria, some newspapers, however, raised some
troubling issues: the persistent presence of soccer hooligans and
the dangers they pose and the problem of ticket fraud that plagued
this year's World Cup.

Site of Versace slaying becomes morbid tourist attraction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY109, NY121 &QL; 
 &UR; By BRENDAN FARRINGTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI BEACH, Florida (AP) _ Five friends _ three in bikinis, two
in shorts and T-shirts _ walk down Ocean Drive when they stop
suddenly in front of a three-story Mediterranean-style mansion.
	   Four reach into their bags for cameras, one grabs a video
camera. They peer through the black iron gates at wooden front
doors nearly two stories tall and framed in an ornate coral
archway.
	   ``It's beautiful,'' says 21-year-old Tania Arduini of Easton,
Connecticut, as she and her friends click away.
	   The home at 1116 Ocean Drive has become one of the most popular
destinations on trendy South Beach since its owner, Italian fashion
designer Gianni Versace, was gunned down on the front steps on July
15, 1997.
	   Tourists from around the world seek it out to shoot photos, many
posing with broad smiles in front of the steps where he died.
	   Joann Wyatt stands across the street from the mansion. Earlier
this year, she was in Paris and stood outside the tunnel where
Princess Diana died. Outside Versace's mansion, she holds a camera
and waits.
	   ``I don't want people in the shot,'' she tells her friend.
	   As a group finishes its photo shoot in front of the mansion's
gates, Wyatt raises her camera, only to lower it again as a family
of six walks up to the steps. Then a car pulls up. It's a full five
minutes before the 49-year-old Atlanta woman finally gets her shot.
	   Her friend, Angie Smith, also has a camera in hand, but doesn't
take any pictures. She already has a few.
	   ``I came by shortly after the incident, I'm ashamed to say, just
to see the scene,'' said Smith, of Boynton Beach, smiling
sheepishly. ``It's part of American culture _ morbid fascination.
It's like rubberneckers on the highway looking at an accident.
They've seen it a thousand times but they still slow down.''
	   Versace paid dlrs 6.6 million for two buildings in 1992, and
spent millions more to create the 13,250-square-foot
(1,200-square-meter) mansion, now owned by his family.
	   Nearby at the Adrian Hotel, manager Stella Borza is bothered by
the tourist circus.
	   ``I don't think it's funny to have tourists coming over to take
pictures. Versace deserves more respect,'' Borza said. ``When he
was alive, people would pass and not even know he lived there.''
	   Farther down the block, at The Clevelander Hotel and bar,
manager Cecilie Jorgensen believes there's nothing wrong with the
fascination.
	   ``That's the way we are. Humans are curious. Everyone wants to
be a part of something, good or bad,'' she said. ``Versace meant so
much to South Beach ... He brought in tourism. He made it a fashion
mecca by bringing in other designers.''
	   Another place linked to Versace is the News Cafe, where the
designer picked up a newspaper minutes before suspected serial
killer Andrew Cunanan shot him twice in the back of head at
point-blank range. Nine days later, with police closing in, Cunanan
committed suicide in a houseboat 2 1/2 miles (four kilometers) from
Versace's home.
	   Versace, who was 50, made the cafe part of his daily routine.
Now people from around the world stop in and ask what Versace was
like, said Richard Brittingham, the news shop's manager.
	   ``Those of us who did have an occasion to talk with him found

very valuable and well-liked member of our family of customers.''
	   Brittingham is turned off by the tourists who flock to Versace's
mansion. But he doesn't mind those who visit out of genuine
respect.
	   ``We need to do a little justice to those people who really did
admire the gentleman and want to be close to ... where he spent his
time.''

Russia, IMF reach tentative agreement on bailout package, official
</HEADLINE>
says &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After weeks of negotiations, Russia and the
International Monetary Fund have reached tentative agreement on a
huge bailout package designed to stabilize the country's turbulent
financial markets, a top Russian official said Monday.
	   Russia wants dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion, and most of the
money is expected to come from the IMF, while the World Bank and
some private lenders are also likely to contribute to the package.
	   ``We have reached concrete agreements to the satisfaction of
both parties,'' Russia's lead negotiator, Anatoly Chubais, told the
Interfax news agency Monday.
	   No details were released, but Chubais and the head of the IMF
delegation, John Odling-Smee, planned a Monday afternoon news
conference to outline the deal.
	   Citing unidentified government sources, Interfax said that the
IMF would provide dlrs 12.5 billion in loans. Other lenders planned
to kick in additional money.
	   The loan should help ease short-term pressure on the struggling
Russian economy, which has been shrinking for most of this decade
and pushed millions of Russians into poverty.
	   The money could help restore confidence to the stock and bond
markets, which have taken heavy hits in recent months as foreign
investors have abandoned Russia. Also, the loan could prevent a
possible devaluation of the ruble, which has been the government's
biggest fear.
	   A weaker ruble would raise prices and inflict additional
economic hardship at a time when strikes and protests are on the
increase. After years of skyrocketing prices, annual inflation is
currently under 10 percent and the government wants to preserve one
of its few economic successes.
	   While a big loan should provide some breathing space, economists
note that it does nothing to address perennial problems such as the
government budget deficit and a porous tax collection system.
	   Any loan agreement will still need formal approval by IMF
officials in Washington and it was not clear what conditions the
IMF planned to impose on Russia.
	   The IMF has often been critical of Russia's inability to collect
taxes, which leaves the government chronically short of cash forces
millions of workers to wait months before receiving their pay.
	   The Yeltsin administration recently proposed more than 20
measures to stabilize the economy, most aimed at reforming the
unwieldy tax system.
	   However, the Communists who lead parliament have balked at
measures that would raise taxes, and it's not clear whether they
will give their blessing to the entire program. Parliament plans a
special session Wednesday for further debate on the measures.
	   Russia's latest financial crisis struck in May, the result of
several factors: a sharp drop in the prices of Russia's oil
exports, a wave of labor protests, and general skittishness linked
to the Asian financial crisis.
	   The stock market has lost more than half its value since the
beginning of the year, and the Central Bank has been spending its
hard-currency reserves to support the ruble, which is trading at
about 6.2 to the U.S. dollar.
	   Much of the IMF loan is expected to go to shore up the Central
Bank's reserves, as well has help meet Russia's short-term debt
payments, which make up about one-third of the federal budget.

Communists, debuting liberals big winners in Japanese vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Japan-Election &QL; 
 &UR; TOK113 &QL; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ One of the biggest surprises in Japan's
parliamentary elections wasn't how many voters abandoned the
long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party _ but where they turned.
	   The biggest winner by far was the Democratic Party, a new,
liberal party with a charismatic leader in former Health Minister
Naoto Kan but very little in the way of solid policy on critical
issues.
	   Even more surprisingly in a country renowned for its capitalist
successes, another big winner was the Japan Communist Party, which
doubled its strength in Parliament's upper house.
	   The Democratic Party picked up nine new seats, securing their
place as the largest opposition force.
	   ``Voters have clearly said `No' to the Hashimoto
administration,'' said Kan. ``The people have lent an ear to what
we said and they are giving us a chance.''
	   Analysts saw the results as particularly significant, not
because they indicate a shift toward Marxism or feel-good
liberalism, but because they suggest just how fed up Japanese
voters have become with mainstream politics.
	   ``Voters have felt betrayed by other parties,'' said Shigenori
Okazaki, a political analyst at SBC Warburg Japan Inc. ``The last
resort for these people is the Communists.''
	   Disgruntled voters turned out in far higher numbers than
expected to hand the conservative LDP a resounding defeat in the
elections for half the seats in the 252-seat upper house of
Parliament.
	   The ruling party lost 17 seats. Its leader, Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto, has announced he will resign.
	   While a dozen small opposition forces struggled to keep the
seats they already had, the Communists, along with the Democratic
Party of Japan, pulled well ahead.
	   The 76-year old Communist Party added nine new seats,
leapfrogging two other parties to become the second-largest
opposition force.
	   The parliamentary victory adds to the Communists' already strong
position in regional politics, where they hold more local assembly
seats than any other party.
	   ``We are becoming too big for other parties to ignore,'' said
Ayumi Ikeda, a Communist Party assemblywoman in Tokyo.
	   Most opposition parties campaigned on calls for tax cuts.
	   Hashimoto's party raised the national sales tax 2 percentage
points last year _ triggering a stubborn slump in consumption and
contributing to the worst economic recession since World War II.
	   But the tax-cut campaigns worked better for some parties than
for others.
	   The largest opposition force, the Democratic Party, did much
better than expected in Sunday's election, while the
farther-to-the-left Social Democratic Party got trounced.
	   ``It was a very tough election,'' Socialist party Leader Takako
Doi said early Monday.
	   Many voters were unable to forgive the Socialists for joining
forces with their longtime foe, the LDP, in a coalition government
four years ago.
	   That alliance fell apart earlier this year, but not before the
Socialists had abandoned many of their long-held beliefs in order
to get along better with the LDP.
	   Election results showed voters didn't appreciate the flip-flop.
	   The Socialists lost seven seats, retaining only five in the
252-seat chamber.
	   The Sakigake Party, another former coalition, member didn't pick
up a single one.

Small bomb outside of PLO headquarters injures one
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new detail throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian man was slightly injured Monday
when a small bomb exploded near the PLO's unofficial headquarters
in east Jerusalem, police said.
	   Faisel Husseini, the top Palestinian official in Jerusalem, told
reporters that police suspected Jewish extremists, but police said
only that they were investigating. No group immediately claimed
responsibility.
	   The small explosive device was planted in a trash can about 30
meters (yards) outside the Palestinian complex known as Orient
House, police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said.
	   In the past, Orient House has been the scene of angry protests
by right-wing Israelis demanding its closure.
	   Police chief Yair Yitzhaki said preliminary tests indicated no
connection between this bomb and others set off in Arab areas of
Jerusalem this year. He said the device was too small to have
caused much damage.
	   The injured man, a 40-year-old Palestinian from east Jerusalem,
suffered leg and head cuts that were described as light.
	   The bomb squad briefly cordoned off the area to search for
evidence and collect debris.
	   Israel has complained that the Palestinian Authority is
violating autonomy accords by operating offices in the city's
disputed eastern sector. The accords allow the Palestinians to run
government offices only in the West Bank and Gaza, pending
negotiations on Jerusalem's final status.
	   The Palestinians describe the complex as the seat of their
future government in east Jerusalem, which they claim as their
capital. Israel, though, claims sovereignty over all Jerusalem.
	   Israel annexed the city's eastern sector after capturing it from
Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.

Finance Minister: Malaysia will slip into recession this year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim
admitted Monday that Malaysia will slip into recession this year,
confirming the worst fears of financial analysts.
	   The gross domestic product would contract by 1 to 2 percent in
1998, Anwar said.
	   Malaysia's economy contracted by 1.8 percent in this year's
first three months, compared to 6.9 percent growth in the previous
quarter. Results of the second quarter have not been announced.
	   Until now, the government had maintained that it would be able
to achieve GDP growth of between 2 and 3 percent for 1998.
	   Even last week, Anwar had said that Malaysia would have to
revise its growth target but would try to halt a slide into
recession.
	   Anwar said two government packages totaling 12 billion ringgit
(dlrs 3 billion) in June had helped cushion the economic fall. He
said there would be more such measures.
	   ``Based on the economic performance in the first quarter and the
latest economic indicators, there is a big possibility that the GDP
contraction will increase if there are no new measures,'' Anwar
told Parliament on the opening day of a new session.
	   ``Nevertheless, with the new measures, especially the
government's fiscal incentives, the GDP contraction is expected to
be smaller, in the region of 1 to 2 percent.''
	   However, independent analysts predicted that Malaysia's economic
condition would worsen.
	   ``We expect something up to minus 4,'' said Kanika Singh, an
economist with Independent Economic Analysis, a Singapore-based
research company.
	   ``There are a lot of question marks about how they (Malaysian
officials) can turn around the economy.''
	   Anwar said a new agency would be created to help recapitalize
the country's struggling banks, explaining that banks would have to
seek new capital if the financial crisis continued.
	   In the worst case, this recapitalization could amount to 16
billion ringgit (dlrs 4 billion), Anwar added.
	   A new committee will be formed to accelerate and evaluate
corporate debt restructuring.
	   ``We want to make it easier and speed up efforts to restructure
corporate debt,'' he said.
	   He predicted that Malaysia would incur a budget deficit of 10
billion ringgit (dlrs 2.5 billion), or 3.7 percent of the gross
national product, while the annual rate of inflation would hover
around 8 percent.
	   Acknowledgement of Malaysia's recession, defined as contraction
over two consecutive quarters, comes one year after the Asian
crisis began.
	   In the crisis, millions of people have lost their jobs,
companies have gone bankrupt and governments have fallen in
Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia, where International Monetary
Fund-supervised bailouts totaling dlrs 120 billion are under way.
	   Malaysia's worsening situation could have an impact on
neighboring Singapore, which so far has said it would be able to
resist recession, said Singh, the economist. Singapore's trade was
closely linked with Malaysia's, she said.

Orgy of World Cup coverage in French media
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with new 5th graf on TV and radio coverage &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Sports writers, political columnists, and even the
financial newspapers all had something to say Monday about what
victory in the World Cup means for France.
	   French media joined the nation in celebrating the the World Cup
upset with an orgy of coverage devoted to the stunning 3-0 win by
Les Bleus against Brazil.
	   ``For Eternity,'' blared the headline of the sports daily
L'Equipe, which has heaped criticism on French coach Aime Jacquet
for putting together what the newspaper considered a dull team.
	   ``It's ours,'' said the headline of the daily Le Parisien, with
a picture of an ecstatic Jacquet holding the coveted golden trophy
high over his head.
	   Pride, euphoria, glory. Those were just some of the emotions
expressed in the pages of French newspapers. Radio and TV talk
shows turned to soccer, and the winning goals were replayed _ and
replayed again and again _ on the country's main television
stations.
	   For some commentators, victory went beyond sport. They expressed
hope the win will help combat racism in a country where the
right-wing National Front regularly gets 15 percent of the vote.
	   Some of the greatest heroes of the French team, including
Sunday's two-time scorer, Zinedine Zidane, are the children of
immigrants.
	   For Le Figaro, a conservative daily, the French victory was a
``lesson'' in ``unity'' for a nation that is now irreversibly
multiracial.
	   France stands to gain in other ways as well, according to the
financial daily Les Echos.
	   ``France's emerges with its image magnified,'' said Les Echos,
pointing out what the newspaper called the country's impeccable
organization of the World Cup impeccable.
	   Throughout the World Cup, France's superb fast trains, its
fashion and food were on display and may bring the country fresh
economic rewards.
	   Amid the euphoria, some newspapers, however, raised some
troubling issues: the persistent presence of soccer hooligans and
the dangers they pose and the problem of ticket fraud that plagued
this year's World Cup.

Russia, Cyprus reaffirm missile deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin and visiting Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides on Monday reaffirmed a deal that will
send Russian anti-aircraft missiles on Cyprus, but they declined to
set a date.
	   Russia is selling the S-300 missiles to Clerides' government,
which controls the ethnic Greek side of the divided island nation.
	   Turkey, which supports the ethnic Turkish side of the island, is
angered by the deal and has threatened military action to prevent
the deployment of the weapons.
	   During their Kremlin meeting, Yeltsin and Clerides ``confirmed
their readiness to fully meet their obligations'' on the missile
contract, Yeltsin's foreign policy advisor, Sergei Prokhodko, told
reporters after the talks.
	   Clerides also thanked Yeltsin for Russia's efforts to help
settle the long-standing dispute in Cyprus between the Greek and
Turkish communities, Russian news reports said.
	   Before arriving in Moscow, Clerides said he was ready to delay
the missiles deployment if Turkey agreed to discuss
demilitarization of the island.
	   The S-300 is similar to the U.S. Patriot missile that gained
famed during the Gulf War when it was used to against Iraqi
missiles.
	   Russian officials previously said they planned to deliver the
missiles in August, but Cyprus asked that delivery be postponed
until the fall, according to news reports.
	   Yeltsin and Clerides didn't discuss the timetable for the
delivery of the missiles, Prokhodko said.
	   Cyprus has been divided into Greek and Turkish communities since
1974, when Turkish troops invaded following an abortive coup by
ethnic Greeks who supported union with Greece.
	   Clerides' government is recognized internationally, while the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state is recognized only by Turkey.
	   The United States and Western European governments have called
on Cyprus to cancel the missile order, and the United Nations has
also voiced concern over the deal, fearing it could escalate
tensions on the island.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A laundry has refused to return washed linen to
soldiers in a southern Russian town until the military pays several
months of debt for the cleaning service, a news agency reported
Monday.
	   The laundry in Izobilnoye, 1200 kilometers (740 miles) south of
Moscow, can't afford to pay wages, electricity or water bills, so
it decided to withhold clothes from railway troops who have not
paid their bills, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The Russian army, like many businesses and institutions in
Russia, is chronically short of cash.

Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced Monday that he will resign and
acknowledged voter frustration over his failure to bring Japan out
of its deepest recession in decades.
	   The sudden resignation threw Japanese politics into confusion,
and was for the time being almost certain to impede efforts to pull
the economy out of its worst economic mess since World War II.
	   Business leaders immediately voiced concerns that a political
vacuum could sidetrack reform efforts already underway.
	   Hashimoto grimly conceded defeat and said he would resign after
his Liberal Democratic Party won just 44 seats out of the 126
contested _ half of Parliament's upper house _ in Sunday's
elections.
	   ``The defeat was my fault,'' he told a press conference at LDP
headquarters after party leaders approved his decision to resign
Monday afternoon.
	   The other three top party executives also expressed their
willingness to resign.
	   ``I'm responsible for all that happened, and my ability was not
sufficient,'' he said, his eyes red and the fatigue of two weeks of
hard campaigning clear on his face.
	   Hashimoto will stay in office until a successor is chosen.
	   Party officials said they hope to hold a vote of LDP lawmakers
on June 21 to nominate Hashimoto's replacement. The successor would
then have to be approved by Parliament, which is not expected to
reconvene until after July 26.
	   Discussions have already begun on who the replacement should be.
	   LDP powerbrokers Keizo Obuchi, Japan's foreign minister, and
former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama were seen as the
most likely successors. Neither is seen as an economic specialist.
	   The political upheaval sent markets on a rollercoaster ride.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average slid some 280
points at one point in the morning but recovered as investors
decided the government will probably stick by its reform plans.
	   The dollar surged against the yen in early Asian trading, but
soon ran out of steam as traders rushed to take profits. In late
afternoon, the dollar bought 142.42 yen, up 1.09 yen from late
Friday in Tokyo.
	   Concern, however, remained.
	   ``We must fix the economy as soon as possible'' said Takashi
Imai, head of the powerful Japan Federation of Economic
Organizations. ``We cannot afford to have a political vacuum.''
	   The conservative, pro-business Liberal Democrats will continue
to rule because they have firm control over the more powerful lower
house, which can pass the national budget and choose the prime
minister without the approval of the upper house.
	   But they fell far short of the 69 seats they needed to regain a
majority in the upper chamber, which it lost in 1989, and also was
well below its strength going into the polls of 61.
	   They now have 102 of the upper house's 252 seats.
	   With unemployment at a record high of 4.1 percent, bankruptcies
soaring and Japan's financial system wobbling under massive bad
loans, voters vented their frustration at the LDP's inability to
get the economy back on track.
	   The weakened party will now need the cooperation of other
parties to pass key legislation.
	   That was not expected to be easy _ opposition parties on Monday
were already calling for the dissolution of the lower house and
general elections.
	   Analysts said that in the long run, the electoral humiliation
may prompt the LDP and the government to work harder to get the
economy back on track.
	   For the near term, however, the political situation was likely
to remain fluid.
	   Hashimoto said he would cancel scheduled official visits to the
United States and France. He was to have left July 19, and use the
trips to try to win support for his administration's efforts to
jumpstart the economy.
	   The Liberal Democrats' sense of near panic was apparent as the
voting neared. It flip-flopped repeatedly on cutting income taxes,
which many voters, as well the United States, considered a key
factor for economic recovery.
	   Emerging strongly in the elections were the Democrats _ a
liberal, relatively new party headed by the charismatic Naoto Kan,
who promised such a tax cut early in the campaign.
	   They won 27 seats, a gain of nine, and now hold 47 in the entire
upper house.

Tokyo stocks rebound on hopes for reform, dollar climbs

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices rebounded Monday as investors
decided that Japan would continue economic reforms even after the
government shakeup from Sunday's elections. The U.S. dollar climbed
against the yen.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average climbed 270.33
points, or 1.68 percent, closing at 16,360.39. On Friday, the
Nikkei index had shed 356.89 points, or 2.17 percent.
	   The index slid some 280 points at one point in the morning amid
uncertainty following the parliamentary election setback for Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's governing party. Hashimoto later
announced that he would resign.
	   But the index recovered as investors concluded that even with a
change of prime ministers, the government would carry out reform
plans it has promised internationally, traders said.
	   Foreign investors and domestic bargain hunters were among the
major buyers helping to send prices back up.
	   The outcome of Sunday's elections underscored widespread
frustration in Japan with the Liberal Democratic Party's inability
to speed Japan's recession-plagued economy back toward recovery.
	   Despite the defeat in elections for Parliament's upper house,
the pro-business Liberal Democrats still will form the government
because they have a stable majority in the more powerful lower
house, which can pass the national budget and choose the prime
minister.
	   Among Monday's gainers were domestic demand-related issues,
major banks and distribution-related issues. Some pharmaceutical
issues were among losers.
	   Trading was moderate, with an estimated 389 million shares
changing hands on the first section, down from Friday's 597
million. Advances outnumbered retreats 710 to 447, with 119 issues
unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 14.94 points, or 1.20 percent, to 1,256.44. On
Friday, it had fallen 20.78 points, or 1.65 percent.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 142.42 yen, up 1.09 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
140.93 yen on Friday. In Monday's trading, the dollar ranged
between 141.70 yen and 144.50 yen, its highest intra-day level
since June 16, when the currency traded at 146.75 yen.
	   The dollar surged in early Asian trading as investors dumped the
yen following the surprisingly poor election showing of the
governing party.
	   But the dollar's rally soon ran out of steam as Japanese
investors who bought the U.S. currency near its highs rushed to
take profits, traders said.
	   Traders said there was little direct impact on the foreign
exchange market from Prime Minister Hashimoto's announcement that
he will resign.
	   ``Our interest now is who is going to succeed'' the outgoing
prime minister, said Takashi Nakauchi, foreign exchange manager at
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.415 percent from Friday's finish of 1.370
percent, driving its price down to 110.33 yen from 110.66 yen.

	   PARIS (AP) _ From plazas to boulevards to cafes to living rooms,
from the smallest villages to the biggest cities, a single glorious
chant echoed across France: ``We are the champions!''
	   France's stunning World Cup victory over Brazil Sunday night
sent the country into a paroxysm of patriotic celebration not seen
since the Liberation.
	   ``The day of glory has arrived,'' France's national anthem goes,
and on this night the French sang it everywhere, and like they
truly believed it.
	   The merrymaking was marred, however, by an accident on the
Champs-Elysees, the grand avenue crowned by the Arc de Triomphe.
	   As more than a million people gathered on the avenue, an
apparently panicked driver careened out of control and plowed into
a crowd of revelers, injuring 80 people, 11 seriously.

Orangemen march on big day clouded by death of three children

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant Orangemen marched on
their big holiday Monday, chastened and divided by the deaths of
three boys in the violence swirling around their defiance of a
government order to avoid one Catholic neighborhood.
	   Some prominent Orangemen had called for an end to the week-long
confrontation between marchers and security forces near Portadown,
following the Sunday morning firebombing that killed the Quinn
brothers, Richard, 10, Mark, 9 and Jason, 7, in their home in
Ballymoney, 40 miles (60 kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   Their Catholic mother and her Protestant partner escaped safely.
	   ``After last night's attack a 15-minute walk down Garvaghy Road
by the Orange Order would be a very hollow victory because it would
be in the shadow of the coffins of three little boys who wouldn't
even know what the Orange Order is about,'' said the Rev. William
Bingham, chaplain to the Orange Order in County Armagh.
	   Last week, Bingham was one of four Orange officials who met with
Prime Minister Tony Blair pressing their demand to walk down that
road, despite the hostility of Catholic residents there and an
order from the Parades Commission blocking the march.
	   The Portadown district Orange Lodges defiantly declared that
their protest would continue until they walked the Garvaghy Road.
But they asked Orangemen not to join them Monday in the pastures
near Drumcree Anglican church for a mass confrontation with police
and British troops.
	   Another contentious parade, through the Catholic Lower Ormeau
area of Belfast, was delayed for more than an hour Monday morning
after a telephone caller warned of bombs near the Orange hall. Army
specialists carried out controlled explosions to neutralize two
suspicious packages.
	   The BBC said a bomb warning came with code words from the Irish
National Liberation Army, an IRA splinter group that has refused to
observe a cease-fire.
	   Catholic residents on the Ormeau Road called off plans to try to
stop the march after the killings Sunday and protested peacefully
at the side of the road. They hung banners along the route saying:
``Shame.''
	   Only a single muffled drum kept the beat as the Orangemen
marched past the silent protesters, who unleashed scores of black
balloons as the parade passed. It was so quiet you could hear the
rain spattering on the protestors' black flags, which had been
improvised from sticks and plastic garbage bin liners.
	   The marchers passed a betting shop with a black granite plaque
listing the names of two teen-agers and three adults murdered there
by loyalists in 1992.
	   Local resident Alan Kelly said he was pleased with the protest.
``It's the only form of expression that people can give. Any other
protest would have resulted in violence,'' he said. Kelly was there
with his 7-month-old daughter Danielle and his wife, Angela, whose
brother was shot to death by loyalists just a few blocks away in
1988.
	   Just as the parade ended without incident, the sun burst out.
	   Elsewhere, police said a pub in Aghoghill, 25 miles (40 kms)
northwest of Belfast, was damaged by smoke in an arson attempt
overnight, and police fired plastic bullets at a crowd gathered
near a holiday bonfire in the area.
	   An Orangeman was taken to a hospital after being attacked during
a Catholic demonstration at a parade Sunday night in Keady, 40
miles (65 kms) southwest of Belfast.
	   Plastic bullets were also discharged to quell disturbances in
south Belfast, where youths set fire to a truck and officers in
Londonderry were attacked by a crowd throwing gasoline bombs and
stones. However, police said it was one of the quietest nights of
the past week.
	   The Orange Order has disclaimed any responsibility for the
roadblocks, attacks on homes and cars, and assaults on police and
soldiers which erupted after the march was stopped July 5. At
Drumcree, hard-liners have thrown bombs at security forces _ and
have been cheered by men wearing the orange collars of the Order.
	   The 12th of July is the biggest holiday on the Orange calendar,
celebrating the defeat of the Catholic King James II by the
Protestant William of Orange at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.
The marches were put back until Monday this year because of the
holiday falling on Sunday.
	   Many Catholics dread the sound of flutes and booming Lambeg
drums, and see the Orange marches as sheer muscle-flexing by the
majority community.
	   David Trimble, an Orangeman and recently elected first minister
of Northern Ireland's new Assembly, abruptly abandoned his support
for the Drumcree marchers after Sunday's killings and urged them
``to come down off the hill.''
	   The split in Orange ranks reflected the deep divisions among
Protestants over the agreement among eight political parties to set
up a new government in Northern Ireland with power shared between
Catholics and Protestants.
	   In Ballymoney, neighbors laid flowers, teddy bears and notes of
condolence outside the blackened home where the boys died.
	   Francis Quinn, whose sister Chrissy Quinn was the boys' mother,
said the family had been harassed for two years.
	   ``They murdered three innocent little children. They weren't
being brought up Catholic or Protestant _ they just were three
kids,'' Francis Quinn said.
	   ``And I'm just _ full of hate,'' he said haltingly.
	   ``This last couple of years we've been terrorized ... threats,
letters, bombs through the windows, it goes on and on,'' he added.

Cambodian opposition politician describes election as farce

<TEXT>
	   TRAM KOK, Cambodia (AP) _ Two weeks before Cambodians are
scheduled to vote, opposition politician Sam Rainsy said Monday the
election will be ``a farce'' aimed at legitimizing power seized by
strongman Hun Sen in a coup last year.
	   He predicted that Hun Sen's ruling party will ``artificially''
win a majority in the July 26 polls, even though, if the elections
were free and fair, ``the majority of the people in Cambodia would
vote for change.''
	   ``The next election is going to be a farce with a foregone
conclusion,'' Sam Rainsy said, after speaking to a crowd of about
500 supporters at a rally 90 kilometers (56 miles) southeast of
Phnom Penh.
	   The elections are the first since last July's coup, when Hun Sen
ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his co-prime minister,
shattering a tense dual premiership formed after U.N.-sponsored
elections in 1993.
	   In an effort to gain international legitimacy and aid that was
cut following his violent takeover, Hun Sen _ who was sole prime
minister before 1993's election _ agreed to go ahead with this
year's polls.
	   There has been widespread criticism that Hun Sen has stacked the
official electoral bodies in his favor, denied the opposition equal
access to the media and used intimidation and violence in an effort
to ensure he wins.
	   There have been at least six politically motivated killings in
the past six weeks, according to human rights workers.
	   Sam Rainsy said that while he and other opposition leaders have
succeeded in drawing large crowds in the run-up to the elections,
many people have been intimidated from coming to his rallies by
local authorities loyal to Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party.
	   Sam Rainsy predicted that Hun Sen's party would win 70 of the
122 seats in the National Assembly; a coalition of parties that
support Hun Sen would win 15 to 20 seats; and that he and Prince
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party would win the remaining 40 seats.
	   ``I am looking beyond the elections,'' Sam Rainsy told
reporters, adding that he was the campaign as an opportunity to
meet the people and raise his political profile.
	   ``I am building an alternative after the election to the present
communist regime,'' he said.
	   Hun Sen's pre-1993 government was a single-party communist
state.
	   Supporters waving blue flags with the Sam Rainsy Party's logo _
a single candle _ shouted ``Bravo! Bravo!'' as he arrived at the
pagoda in Tram Kok village and in an hour-long speech began
attacking Hun Sen's government as ``communist'' and backed by
Vietnam.
	   Hun Sen is identified by many Cambodians with the decade-long
Vietnamese occupation that followed Hanoi's invasion in 1979, which
ousted the genocidal Khmer Rouge from power. The government in
which Hun Sen served was set up and protected by the Vietnamese.
	   Sam Rainsy and Ranariddh have both tried to use the widespread
hatred of Vietnam, Cambodia's traditional enemy, as a way to win
votes.
	   ``We cannot regard the 20 years-installed government as good,''
said Sam Rainsy. ``We must regard the Khmer people as the boss, not
the Yuon as the boss. I surely believe Cambodians will vote for
Cambodians, not for the Yuon puppet.''
	   Yuon is a derogatory word for Vietnamese.

Pilot strike grounds Norwegian domestic airline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Pilots for the Norwegian domestic airline
Wideroe went on strike Monday, leaving some remote parts of
northern Norway without airline service.
	   The Norwegian Airline Pilots Association ordered all 258 pilots
employed by the carrier to strike after state mediators gave up
efforts to broker a new contract, saying the gap between the union
and the airline was too big. It was the third strike to hit
Norwegian air travel in one month.
	   The union said Wideroe had not made good on promises of better
wages given during negotiations two years ago. No details of the
union's demands or the employer's offer were immediately available.
	   Wideroe said the strike affects about 3,500 passengers a day.
The airline, which operates Dash-8 propeller planes, is the only
air carrier serving some northern communities.

celebrating the defeat of the Catholic King James II by the
Protestant William of Orange at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.
The marches were put back until Monday this year because of the
holiday falling on Sunday.
	   Many Catholics dread the sound of flutes and booming Lambeg
drums, and see the Orange marches as sheer muscle-flexing by the
majority community.
	   David Trimble, an Orangeman and recently elected first minister
of Northern Ireland's new Assembly, abruptly abandoned his support
for the Drumcree marchers after Sunday's killings and urged them
``to come down off the hill.''
	   The split in Orange ranks reflected the deep divisions among
Protestants over the agreement among eight political parties to set
up a new government in Northern Ireland with power shared between
Catholics and Protestants.
	   In Ballymoney, neighbors laid flowers, teddy bears and notes of
condolence outside the blackened home where the boys died.
	   Francis Quinn, whose sister Chrissy Quinn was the boys' mother,
said the family had been harassed for two years.
	   ``They murdered three innocent little children. They weren't
being brought up Catholic or Protestant _ they just were three
kids,'' Francis Quinn said.
	   ``And I'm just _ full of hate,'' he said haltingly.
	   ``This last couple of years we've been terrorized ... threats,
letters, bombs through the windows, it goes on and on,'' he added.

One killed, 16 wounded in bombings of bars during World Cup final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ At least one person was killed and 16
others injured in blasts in two Kampala bars as patrons were
watching the final game of the World Cup, police said Monday.
	   Police spokesman Eric Naigambi said the blasts occurred
simultaneously Sunday evening, one in downtown Kampala and the
other in a suburb as people came to watch France defeat Brazil 3-0.
	   He did not provide further details.
	   The independent Monitor newspaper said one man was killed
instantly when an undetermined kind of device exploded at the Club
Isabella in Makindye suburb, about 5 kilometers (3 miles) southeast
of Kampala.
	   Another device _ either planted or thrown under a pool table at
the Slow Boat bar in downtown Kampala _ left 12 men and four women
injured when it exploded, the newspaper said.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
	   Police blamed a series of April bombings in Kampala bars and
restaurants that left five dead and dozens injured on Allied
Democratic Forces rebels who operate in western Uganda.
	   In Nov. 1997, police blamed a series of grenade attacks that
killed nine, including a prominent politician, on organized crime.

Kyrgyzstan president can run for 3rd term, thanks to legal
</HEADLINE>
loophole &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kyrgyzstan's president may seek a third term in
office due to a legal loophole that skirts a constitutional
two-term limit, the country's highest court has ruled.
	   President Askar Akayev has led the Central Asian nation since it
gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, and his second
term runs until the year 2000.
	   But the Constitutional Court has ruled that Akayev's first term,
which began in 1991, does not count against the two-term limit
because it began before the current laws took effect in 1995.
	   A similar case is looming in Russia, where the Constitutional
Court will decide this fall whether President Boris Yeltsin's first
term counts against the two-term limit. Yeltsin's aides have argued
that his first term should not count because he was elected before
the Soviet Union collapsed.
	   After the Soviet Union broke up, Akayev was seen as one of the
most moderate of the Central Asian presidents, and western
observers said his 1995 re-election was based on a legitimate
ballot.
	   But recently he has been criticized by human rights activists
for cracking down on free speech and not following through with
democratic reforms.
	   Kyrgyzstan, a rural nation of some 4 million people, has a weak
economy based on agriculture and sheep farming. It is one of the
poorest of the former Soviet republics.

Death toll in in Central Asian flood rises to 92
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The death toll from floods in a mountainous region
along the Uzbekistan-Kyrgyzstan border now stands at 92, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported Monday.
	   The floods occurred after heavy runoff from melting glaciers
swelled rivers and broke a dam last week on the Kuban-Kel lake,
which forms the border between the former Soviet republics of
Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.
	   The burst raised the water level below the dam by three to four
meters (nine to 12 feet) and inundated nearby homes.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ There are fewer Big Mac hamburgers to
munch on in Indonesia because of economic turmoil.
	   One-fifth of the 101 McDonald's fast food restaurants in
Indonesia have shut due to sluggish sales and recent riots over
price increases, company officials said Monday.
	   McDonald's Indonesia Family Restaurants, which operates the
Indonesian franchise of U.S. hamburger giant McDonald's Corp., said
14 outlets were closed as a result of slumping consumer purchasing
power.
	   Another six restaurants were destroyed in riots in May that led
to the downfall of President Suharto.
	   As many as 1,200 people were killed in unrest in Jakarta and
thousands of vehicles, shops and homes were damaged.
	   The rupiah has dropped more than 80 percent in value since last
year, pushing millions of people into poverty and crippling
businesses.
	   The currency plunge has hurt McDonald's restaurants especially
hard because many of its products, such as the potatoes for its
french fries, are imported.
	   The price of a Big Mac in Indonesia is 10,400 rupiah (70 U.S.
cents).

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim
forecast Monday that Malaysia will slip into recession this year,
confirming the worst fears of financial analysts.
	   The gross domestic product would contract by 1 to 2 percent in
1998, Anwar said.
	   Malaysia's economy contracted by 1.8 percent in this year's
first three months, compared to 6.9 percent growth in the previous
quarter.
	   Until now, the government had maintained that it would be able
to achieve GDP growth of between 2 and 3 percent for 1998.
	   Even last week, Anwar had said that Malaysia would have to
revise its growth target but would try to halt a slide into
recession.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Officials from Japan's newly established financial
industry watchdog on Monday began inspecting bad-debt burdened
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
	   It was the first inspection of a Japanese bank conducted by the
Financial Supervisory Agency since its establishment in June, an
agency official said.
	   Ailing Long-Term Credit Bank, saddled with 1.4 trillion yen
(dlrs 9.86 billion) in problem loans, recently started negotiations
with Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corp., a major Japanese trust bank,
about a possible merger.
	   Many Japanese banks are burdened with a total of 76 trillion yen
(dlrs 535 billion) in bad loans, making them wary of extending new
credit and impeding Japan's economic recovery.
	   The agency official, speaking on condition of anonymity, refused
to provide details on the inspection.
	   The Yomiuri newspaper, however, reported that inspectors will
take about a month to check whether the bank's loans to its related
non-bank financial institutions are in arrears.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A strike by ground personnel of
Philippine Airlines could ruin a rehabilitation plan and force
Asia's oldest airline to shut down, an airline official said
Monday.
	   PAL's 5,000-member ground personnel union has threatened to
strike to force the airline to accept back thousands of employees
it sacked to stave off losses worsened by a devastating strike by
more than 600 pilots last month.
	   Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma assumed jurisdiction of the
dispute involving the ground personnel on Friday, saying a work
stoppage could harm the Philippine economy.
	   Laguesma said his order stops the ground personnel from
proceeding with a strike and also prevents management from
dismissing more employees.
	   But PAL senior vice president Avelino Zapanta said the airline
has received information that the Philippine Airline Employees'
Union is considering defying the no-strike order.
	   He said a strike by PALEA could harm an airline rehabilitation
plan approved by the government's Securities and Exchange
Commission and eventually force the flag carrier to halt
operations.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's Energy Equity Corp., a
stakeholder in Indonesia's Sengkang gas and power project, said
Monday that an Indonesian state-owned power company has failed to
pay two electricity bills in full.
	   Energy Equity said Perusahaan Listrick Negara has only partially
paid a March invoice from the Sengkang Power project due to be paid
in full by July 10, leaving U.S. dlrs 1.9 million owed to the
project.
	   An April invoice also has U.S. dlrs 1.9 million outstanding, the
company said.
	   Energy Equity owns 47.5 percent of the U.S. dlrs 220 million
Sengkang project in South Sulawesi. Its partners in the project
include U.S. power company El Paso Energy Corp. with 47.5 percent
and Indonesia's PT Trihasra Sarana Jaya Prnama with 5 percent.

Taiwan's Cabinet fires top officials to ease political storm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's premier demanded the resignations
of the justice minister and the intelligence chief Monday after
their political dispute turned into a public farce.
	   The dispute raised doubts over whether the intelligence agency
remains a pawn in struggles for power, even though Taiwan has
become a full-fledged democracy.
	   It also hurt the government's reputation, exposing how senior
officials maneuvered to expand their influence by gaining control
of the powerful intelligence agency.
	   Government spokesman Cheng Chien-jen said that following a brief
meeting with Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao, Premier Vincent Siew
decided that both Liao and Cheng Chuan, acting chief of the
Investigation Bureau, should step down.
	   Their mutual accusations ``have done the government great
harm,'' Cheng Chien-jen quoted Siew as saying. ``It will not be
appropriate for either of them to stay on.''
	   Siew did not say whether there was evidence against Liao, who is
popular because of his rigorous campaign against organized crime.
	   The Investigation Bureau was responsible for cracking down on
political dissent during the martial law era. But as part of the
Justice Ministry, it has focused on criminal investigation in
recent years.
	   Newspapers have said the National Security Council was secretly
involved in the dispute as part of a plan to have the Investigation
Bureau placed under its jurisdiction to help control infiltration
of Chinese spies.
	   The episode began last month when a National Assembly deputy
accused Cheng Chuan of fondling his friend's daughter on a business
trip to France two years ago.
	   Cheng is known to have mastered a traditional Chinese massage
treatment, and he offered to treat her throat illness. But the
deputy quoted the 19-year-old woman's father as saying Cheng failed
in an attempt to rape her only because of her mother's timely
return to the hotel.
	   A Justice Ministry investigation released last week found no
evidence of attempted rape or sexual harassment, but accused Cheng
of misconduct for having touched sensitive parts of the woman's
body.
	   Cheng accused Liao of using the incident to try to bring him
down because he blocked Liao's attempts to gain more control over
the bureau. He also accused Liao of taking away confidential
personnel files from the bureau.
	   Liao denied the charges and accused Cheng of a smear.
	   After the meeting with Siew, Liao issued a statement denying he
intervened in the report on Cheng's alleged misconduct. Liao's two
deputies, Chiang Hao and Hsieh Wen-ting, also resigned because of
Siew's decision.

<TEXT>
	   ANSE BERTRAND, Guadeloupe (AP) _ Marie-Anna Thuram wanted the
best for her children. So she left behind the back-breaking job
cutting sugar cane on an idyllic-looking Caribbean island to seek
her fortune in France.
	   Today, many of France's hopes for a World Cup championship
depend on one of her sons, Lilian Thuram.
	   A banner hanging from a telephone pole in their native village _
in a seaside area of modest homes and palm and breadfruit trees set
along the azure Caribbean Sea _ urges: ``Allez (Go) Thuram! Vive la
France!''
	   When the match started, Thuram's cousins in Anse Bertrande
belted out the French anthem. When France scored the first of three
winning goals, the room erupted: they jumped up and down, threw a
plastic dining table into the air and screamed their joy.
	   ``Where are you now, Brazil?'' they chanted, along with their
mascot for the game _ 8-year-old Keven with his face painted red
and blue, waving a French flag and wearing an old French soccer
team shirt from his cousin Lilian that trailed around his knees.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Cuban exile group to fly to spot of 1996 shootdown
	   MIAMI (AP) _ The Cuban exile group Brothers to the Rescue plans
Monday to retrace the flight of two planes shot down by Cuban MiGs.
	   Three planes plan to leave Opa-locka Airport and fly toward Cuba
on the same path taken Feb. 24, 1996, when four members of the
group were killed during the shootdown in international airspace.
	   The group's leader, Jose Basulto, said the flights are a
symbolic search and rescue mission to protest the earlier sinking
of the tugboat ``Trece de Marzo.''
	   The boat was hijacked by Cubans fleeing the communist country in
1994 and sank, killing 41 people on board, when a Cuban gunboat
rammed it about 11 kilometers (seven miles) north of the island.
	   ``We're simply going to fly a mission to the point where our
airplanes were shot down,'' said Basulto, who was in the only plane
to escape during the 1996 shootdown.
	   ``We're going to be dropping a smoke marker on the location,
dropping some flowers and saying a prayer for all the victims that
have fallen,'' Basulto said. ``All the martyrs.''

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish pilots and warplanes have
conducted assault exercises in Israel against Russian S-300
anti-aircraft missiles _ the same weapons system Greek Cypriots
plan to deploy later this year, a newspaper said Monday.
	   Turkey claims the deployment is a menace both to Turkish

strikes against them.
	   Last week's exercise coincided with training by Greek Cypriots
on the S-300s in Russia.
	   In Israel, six Turkish F-16s practiced radar evasion, electronic
jamming and bombing runs against their targets, the daily Hurriyet
reported. Military officials refused to comment on the report.
	   Turkey and Israel have been developing strategic ties since
1996, exchanging warplanes for training, conducting naval maneuvers
and signing several defense and trade deals.
	   Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, visiting Israel last week,
dismissed the concerns of some Arab countries that the expanding
relations threatened regional stability.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded
the Mediterranean island after an abortive coup that aimed to unite
the island with Greece. All international efforts to solve the
impassse have failed.

Legislators grant Arafat more time on Cabinet shakeup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IMAD MUSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian lawmakers gave
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat a second two-week extension Monday
for carrying out a promised Cabinet reshuffle.
	   The Palestinian legislature had set July 10 as a deadline for
Arafat to name a new Cabinet or face a first-ever vote of no
confidence over allegations of corruption.
	   ``We will give the extension and wait for the results,'' said
Speaker Ahmed Quriea. The new deadline is July 25.
	   Arafat's request came in a letter to Quriea that was read to
lawmakers.
	   ``I have not completed the necessary consultations regarding the
formulation of a new government,'' the Palestinian leader wrote.
	   Arafat has been trying to bring opposition factions into the
government _ chiefly his biggest political rival, the Islamic
militant group Hamas, which has spurned offers to join the Cabinet.
	   Of the 24 Cabinet slots, seven need to be filled in any event.
Two ministers died this year, four resigned, and the appointment of
one minister was never approved by the legislature.
	   Last year, all but two ministers submitted their resignations to
Arafat after an audit reported revealed widespread corruption.
Arafat accepted the resignations June 25.

Iran minister calls for united front with Arabs against Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran wants to forge a united front with Arab
countries to thwart potential threats from Israel, Iran's defense
minister said in comments published Monday.
	   ``We will not abandon the Arab countries in their confrontation
against threats by the Zionist regime,'' the minister, Ali
Shamkhani, said in an interview with the Arabic-language Al-Ittihad
daily of the United Arab Emirates. Excerpts were reprinted in
several Iranian newspapers Monday.
	   ``To confront these threats, Iran is trying to create an
Iran-Arab axis,'' Shamkhani said.
	   Iran's Islamic government has long denied Israel's right to
exist and opposes Palestinian negotiations with it.
	   For about a decade, one of Iran's ambitions has been to create a
defense alliance in the oil-rich Gulf that it would lead. The
Iranians, who oppose the presence of U.S. and other foreign forces
in the strategic waterway, want a regional force to protect it.
	   Gulf countries were long wary of revolutionary Iran, although
relations have improved since the election in May 1997 of President
Mohammad Khatami, a moderate Iranian cleric. None of the countries,
however, has welcomed a defense pact with Iran.
	   Shamkhani said that Israel, which has said it has the capability
to launch a pre-emptive attack against a key nuclear facility in
southern Iran, ``represents a danger for our national security.''
	   Russia has been building Iran's only large nuclear reactor in
the port city of Bushehr. Iran says the 1,000-megawatt facility
will be used only to generate power. But the United States and
Israel have said it could be used to develop nuclear weapons.
	   Iran says it is not interested in acquiring them, and notes that
its facilities have been endorsed by the Vienna-based International
Atomic Energy Agency.
	   ``If they want to attack, let them try, because we will
retaliate ... and make the aggressor suffer a severe setback,''
Shamkhani said.

Hospitals to check water for Legionella
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Some Czech hospitals will check
their water systems regularly for bacteria that cause Legionnaires'
disease, the news agency CTK reported Monday.
	   The agency said the country's chief hygienist, Jiri Vytlacil, is
planning to ask all Czech hospitals where patients' immunity is
suppressed _ for transplants, for instance _ to carry out the
checks.
	   The move follows the death of four patients in a top Prague
hospital last month. The four died at the IKEM hospital of
pneumonia they contracted after kidney transplant operations. Their
bodies were later found to contain Legionella bacteria.
	   All transplants in the hospital were immediately halted. Organ
recipients are extremely vulnerable to infection because their
immune system are artificially suppressed to prevent rejection of
donated organs.
	   Legionnaires' disease is contracted mainly by inhaling airborne
water droplets containing the Legionella bacteria. Symptoms include
fevers and pneumonia.
	   It is named for its first known victims, members of the
Pennsylvania American Legion, who contracted the disease at a 1976
convention.

Hong Kong share prices close lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices closed lower in Hong Kong for a
second consecutive session Monday, pushed down by the political
uncertainty in Japan following that country's parliamentary
elections.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 106.57 points, or 1.3 percent, closing at 8,099.20. On Friday,
the index had slumped 228.01 points, or 2.7 percent.
	   Turnover amounted to 4.05 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
519 million), down from Friday's 4.74 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 607 million).
	   Brokers said share prices opened lower in reaction to the defeat
of Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party in parliamentary
elections on Sunday.
	   They said the index recovered some lost ground in the afternoon,
helped by a rebound on the Tokyo stock market after the initial
pessimism over the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto faded.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong fell 1.10 Hong Kong dollars to
34.60, and Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 40 cents to 30.80.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 1.50 dollars to
180.50, and Hang Seng Bank fell 1.40 dollars to 40.60.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa fell 90 cents to 37.70, and Swire
Pacific ``A'' fell 10 cents to 27.30.

Men terrorize woman with snakes to rob her
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Muggers with snakes are terrorizing
women in downtown New Delhi, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   In the latest incident Saturday, the Times of India said, three
men with snakes draped over their necks and arms surrounded a
three-wheeled taxi and started thrusting the snakes toward the
passenger. The passenger, Roshni, handed over money and jewelry and
the trio ran away.
	   Roshni, who uses one name only, said the experience was
traumatizing.
	   ``Those bloodshot eyes and the snakes slithering all around keep
coming back to me,'' she was quoted as telling the Times.
	   Police say the same men have attacked several other women, the
Times reported. It was unclear what snake species the robbers have
used.
	   Cobras and other snakes swaying as street performers play flute
music are a common sight in India.

Chinese dissident tried for helping colleague escape
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese dissident charged with helping a fellow
democracy campaigner flee China told a court Monday he was innocent
and had been mistreated by police, a rights group reported.
	   During a 3 1/2-hour trial in southern Guangzhou city, Fan Yiping
said he did not aid the flight of well-known government critic Wang
Xizhe in late 1996, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   The trial ended with a verdict to be issued later, the group
said. Officials with the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court,
contacted by telephone, refused to provide details on the trial or
even confirm whether it took place.
	   The Information Center said political motives, not real crimes,
were behind Fan's prosecution. It noted that Fan was detained in
March, more than 16 months after Wang left the country, but only a
month after Fan met with an exiled dissident who slipped into China
to organize an opposition party.
	   Fan is facing two to seven years in prison for ``organizing
illegal flight,'' the group said. It added that 50,000 Chinese
illegally leave Guangzhou and surrounding Guangdong province for
neighboring Hong Kong every year, and most of those caught are only
fined.
	   Fan's trial comes amid a renewed tightening of controls on
dissent. On Friday, police in eastern Zhejiang province detained
nine people involved in setting up an opposition political party.
Three of them have been formally arrested, a step that indicates
likely prosecution or imprisonment at a labor camp, while two
others also remained in custody. The remaining four campaigners
were released Saturday.
	   The Information Center reported that police also detained two
veteran democracy campaigners for several hours in northeastern
Changchun city Monday. The detentions occurred as Li Peng, head of
China's legislature, visited the auto factory where the two _ Tang
Yuanjun and Leng Wanbao _ used to work.
	   According to the Information Center's account of Monday's trial,
Fan, his lawyer and younger brother all argued his innocence. The
veteran dissident said he only suggested a way Wang could contact a
gang specializing in smuggling people out of China but took no part
in his flight. A judge stopped him from continuing when he began to
describe his mistreatment by police.
	   Despite calls for more open trials by Chinese leaders, Guangzhou
officials gave all the passes for public seating to Fan's friends
and relatives; a heavy police presence prevented Hong Kong
journalists from entering, the Information Center said.

Indonesia says Hashimoto resignation will not affect ties with
</HEADLINE>
Japan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia expects to maintain good
relations with Japan in the wake of the resignation of Japanese
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, the government said Monday.
	   Speaking to reporters after meeting with President B.J. Habibie,
State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said the relationship between the two
countries was solid.
	   ``The relationship has been built over a long time and a change
of government either for Indonesia or Japan won't affect ... the
countries' relationships,'' said Akbar, who was elected chairman of
the ruling Golkar party this past weekend.
	   ``We hope Japanese investors will continue to come to
Indonesia,'' said Akbar. ``I expect Japanese investment to continue
and, if possible, to increase.''
	   Weakened by voter discontent over Japan's deepest recession in
decades, Hashimoto's ruling Liberal Democratic Party was defeated
in elections Sunday for the upper house of Parliament.
	   Japan has contributed to a dlrs 43 billion bailout plan for
Indonesia, which is also mired in economic turmoil.

Saudi executed for murdering fellow tribesman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A Saudi man convicted of murdering a
fellow tribesman was beheaded Monday.
	   Munadi Barghash al-Enizi was found guilty of stabbing Jumaa Ayed
al-Enizi in the chest after a dispute, the Interior Ministry said
in a statement. He was executed in the city of Arar, 1,000
kilometers (620 miles) northwest of the capital, Riyadh.
	   His execution brings to 15 the number of people beheaded in the
kingdom this year. Last year, 124 people were executed.
	   Four of al-Enizi's friends helped him kill the man, the ministry
said. Mohammed bin Mugbil al-Enizi, who restrained the victim's
arms while he was stabbed, was sentenced to life in prison. The
others were sentenced to four years in prison for beating up the
victim.
	   Saudi Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for
murder, rape, drug trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are
carried out with a sword and in public.
	   Human rights groups have criticized the executions, saying that
suspects do not receive fair trials, are denied lawyers and do not
have the right to appeal.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with impact of strike on morning rush-hour &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Commuters faced inconvenience Monday as a 24-hour
strike by London's subway workers began to bite.
	   London Underground, which operates the 243-mile (390-kilometer)
system popularly known as the ``tube,'' said all services were
running although most were operating at reduced capacity. But the
striking union said the walkout was having ``a significant effect''
on subway service.
	   The strike got under way Sunday evening but the main impact was
felt during Monday morning's rush hour when 15 subway stations were
closed. Many commuters took to their cars, adding to the usual
heavy traffic in the capital.
	   ``Commuters are not really facing long delays at the moment,'' a
London Underground spokesman said, speaking on condition he was not
identified. ``The larger, central stations are all open. We hope it
will change for the better as the day progresses.''
	   The Rail, Maritime and Transport union, which represents about
one-third of the subway staff, said the strike was being ``solidly
supported'' by its members.
	   The strike was the second walkout called by the union after it
failed to secure agreements on working conditions, job security and
pensions that will be available to workers after the system becomes
partially privatized. The first strike in June lasted 48 hours.
	   London Underground has repeatedly said that, under the
government-backed moves to raise private finance, it can offer no
more assurances than are already on the table.
	   Environmental campaigners supporting the subway strikers tried
to disrupt subway services Monday morning. Three activists from the
group Reclaim The Streets who clambered on to the roof of a subway
train at Bank station were arrested.

<TEXT>
	   TRENTO, Italy (AP) _ Already facing a court-martial in the
United States, two crew members of a Marine jet that severed a ski
gondola cable in the Alps risk further legal action in Italy.
	   An Italian prosecutor began arguments Monday to request the
indictment of the crew in an Italian court. A judge must rule on
the request, and a decision could come as early as later in the
day.
	   Twenty people were killed in the Feb. 3 accident, which set off
a crisis in U.S.-Italian relations and demands by some for a
closing of U.S. bases in Italy.
	   Trento Prosecutor Francantonio Granero has pushed for
manslaughter charges in Italy, even though the Italian government
has acquiesced in American prosecution of the four crewmen.
	   Monday's hearing, which was being closed to the public, took
place just three days after a U.S. general ordered two of the
crewmen tried for manslaughter.
	   Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commander of Marine Corps Forces Atlantic,
ruled Friday that there is enough evidence for a court-martial for
Capt. Richard J. Ashby, the pilot, and Capt. Joseph P. Schweitzer,
the navigator.
	   The general dismissed charges against the two back-seat officers
on the jet.

Taliban army continues its advances in northern Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ After capturing a key northwestern
province, the Taliban religious militia continued to advance on the
opposition's northern strongholds, a senior official said Monday.
	   Contacted by satellite telephone at the Taliban headquarters in
southern Kandahar province, Mullah Abdul Muttmayan said his troops
were heading toward neighboring Jozjan province and its capital of
Shebergan, the headquarters of opposition leader Rashid Dostum.
	   Muttmayan said his soldiers advanced 25 kilometers (15 miles)
after heavy fighting throughout the night and early morning Monday.
	   Opposition casualties were high, he said.
	   ``There are a lot of dead bodies around the fighting area,''
said Muttmayan. ``We don't know the exact number, but we can say a
lot.''
	   Western sources, who didn't want to be identified, also
confirmed the Taliban's capture of Faryab province, although
opposition soldiers on Sunday said they still controlled the
provincial capital, Maimana.
	   Muttmayan said the Taliban also captured two of Dostum's
generals, identified only as Hashim and Yusuf.
	   Recent gains represent the most significant advances for the
Taliban in northern Afghanistan since May 1996, when they were
routed from the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif and thousands of
their soldiers were captured and killed.
	   Muttmayan said the Taliban's big breakthrough came late on
Saturday when they crashed through the opposition's front line.
	   ``When they lost their front line, they lost their morale,'' he
said. ``Most of the people joined the Taliban and that was the big
reason why we advanced so quickly.''
	   The anti-Taliban alliance, which rules in about 15 percent of
Afghanistan, is a collection of small groups which largely
represent the country's minority ethnic groups.
	   Led by Dostum, a former communist general, and ousted Kabul
military chief Ahmed Shah Massood, the opposition is trying to stop
the Taliban from consolidating its hold on the entire country and
imposing its brand of strict Islamic laws.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's defense minister
returned to Seoul Monday to take charge of a massive search for
possible North Korean intruders, a day after the body of a
suspected communist spy was found on an east coast beach.
	   Arriving at Seoul's Kimpo airport after cutting short a visit to
the United States, Chun Yong-taek denounced the alleged incursion
as a ``grave armed provocation.''
	   President Kim Dae-jung called a meeting of his top military and
security advisers for Wednesday to review South Korea's relations
with its northern rival.
	   The episode could put a strain on Kim's policy of trying to open
up the reclusive Stalinist regime through greater cooperation and
cultural and other exchanges. The policy already has been
criticized by his conservative opposition.
	   Meanwhile, soldiers and police, assisted by helicopter gunships,
scoured rocky mountains on South Korea's east coast for possible
intruders.
	   The search was launched after the military discovered the diving
suit-clad body and a self-propelled, semi-submersible craft capable
of carrying up to five people.
	   The 157 centimeter (4.75-foot)-long craft, powered by batteries,
was similar to ones used by North Korean infiltrators in the past.
	   ``We must be prepared for a possibility that some armed agents
could have come ashore,'' Defense Ministry spokesman Kang Jun-kwon
said.
	   After imposing a dusk-to-dawn curfew, thousands of soldiers and
police laid ambushes overnight along strategic inland access routes
on the east coast but failed to detect any traces of intruders.
	   The man's body was found washed ashore about 2 kilometers (1.25
miles) from a major naval base at Donghae, 195 kilometers (117
miles) east of Seoul.
	   Quoting military doctors, the Defense Ministry said that the
body was believed to have been dead for ``less than 24 hours.''
	   The body had no visible signs of injuries or wounds, indicating
that death was a result of heart failure, it said.
	   Found with the body were a Czech-made machine gun, a hand
grenade, a portable oxygen tank, a dagger, a radio set and a sea
map showing underwater features along South Korea's east coast.
	   ``The types of weapons found indicate that the dead spy was from
the operations department under the direct control of (North
Korea's ruling) Workers' Party,'' the chief Defense Ministry
investigator said.
	   The department is notorious for its aggressive intelligence and
infiltration operations against South Korea. The two Koreas remain
technically in a state of war, with no peace treaty signed at the
end of their 1950-53 war.
	   It was the third North Korean infiltration reported along the
east coast, coming less than three weeks after a northern submarine
was found tangled in a fishing net on June 22.
	   Nine bodies were found in the Yugo-class sub, all shot to death
in what military investigators described as a murder-suicide
committed by senior officers to avoid capture.
	   On Sept. 18, 1996, a shark-class North Korean submarine was
found stranded in the same general area off the east coast,
touching off a 53-day manhunt for the craft's 26 occupants.
	   The manhunt by 60,000 soldiers, reservists and police left 37
people dead _ 24 North Koreans and 13 South Koreans _ and sent
relations between North and South Korea plunging to their lowest
level in years.
	   A North Korean infiltrator from that submarine was captured and
another was believed to have returned to the North across the land
border.

Grenade attack footage to be shown on Cambodian TV
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Cambodia-Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Reluctantly bowing to the demands of
an opposition party, Cambodia's National Election Committee agreed
Monday to televise footage of a bloody grenade attack last year on
a political rally led by Sam Rainsy.
	   The committee had asked the Sam Rainsy Party to reconsider its
plan to air the graphic footage during the five minutes a day all
parties are allotted on state-run television in the month preceding
the July 26 election.
	   The March 30, 1997, attack, in which 16 people were killed and
more than 100 wounded, is widely believed to have been ordered by
Hun Sen, then Cambodia's co-prime minister and now its undisputed
strongman. Sam Rainsy, the apparent target, escaped with several
scratches though a bodyguard who was protecting him died.
	   Sam Rainsy has been one of the severest critics of Hun Sen, and
there is some evidence to suggest that Hun Sen's military bodyguard
unit connived in the attack.
	   Sam Rainsy and his Sam Rainsy party are among the main
challengers to Hun Sen in the upcoming election.
	   The tape contains video and still photos taken before and after
the grenade attack, and footage of Sam Rainsy comforting friends
and relatives of the victims at a ceremony marking the first
anniversary of the attack.
	   ``We have decided to have the tape played this evening,'' said
Samraing Kimsan, spokesman for the election committee chairman.
``We respect his right of expression, but we are concerned about
the image of violence in the tape, that it could make people afraid
during the elections.''
	   Rainsy refused to cancel his decision to have the tape
televised, even after election committee chairman Chheng Phon asked
him to reconsider.
	   ``We just want the atmosphere to remain calm,'' Samraing Kimsan
said in reply to a question as to why the committee did not want
the tape to be aired.

Deliberations start in Berlusconi corruption case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Milan judges on Monday started deliberations
in a corruption trial against Silvio Berlusconi, just a few days
after Italy's ex-premier and media magnate was convicted in a
bribery case.
	   A verdict was expected later in the day.
	   Prosecutors asked for 2 1-2-year prison term and a 12 billion
lire (dlrs 6.7 million) fine for Berlusconi, who now leads Italy's
center-right opposition.
	   The All Iberian trial centers on allegations that Berlusconi and
his associates made illegal contributions in 1991 to the Socialist
Party of ex-Premier Bettino Craxi, falsifying the company's books
to cover the outlay.
	   All Iberian was the holding company Craxi allegedly used to
pocket illegal payoffs.
	   Prosecutors asked four years in prison and a fine of 4 billion
lire (dlrs 2.2 million) for Craxi, a co-defendant in the case who
is being tried in absentia. Craxi lives in Tunisia.
	   Last Wednesday Berlusconi was convicted of bribing tax
inspectors and sentenced to two years and nine months in prison. In
December he was convicted in a case centering on a film company
deal and given a suspended 16-month sentence.
	   Berlusconi has long denied the corruption charges, claiming he
is the victim of a political vendetta from prosecutors.
	   Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro last weel criticized
Milan prosecutors for deciding, in 1994, to serve then-Premier
Berlusconi a formal notice of investigation while he was hosting a
U.N. crime conference in Naples. Scalfaro described the move as
ill-timed.
	   Scalfaro's comments have drawn criticism from anti-corruption
hero and Sen. Antonio Di Pietro, who was investigating Berlusconi
at the time while a prosecutor.
	   As president, Scalfaro is the head of the judges' governing body
and has the final authority over the judiciary.

Netanyahu: gap `almost closed' on troop-withdrawal plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Striking an optimistic note, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that Israel was close to
agreement on elements of the Clinton administration's plan for a
troop withdrawal from the occupied West Bank.
	   But the prime minister also voiced a familiar complaint, saying
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority has not put security-related
agreements into effect.
	   ``We have almost closed the gap with the United States now,''
Netanyahu told a national fundraising event. ``The only thing
holding up the process is the Palestinians' refusal to comply with
commitments they have made repeatedly for five years.''
	   Israeli media reports have said Netanyahu would ask his inner
Cabinet later Monday to approve unspecified details of the U.S.
pullback plan. Netanyahu's top aide, David Bar-Illan, would not
confirm the report but called remaining gaps ``narrow'' and
``bridgeable.''
	   The United States has been trying to persuade Netanyahu to agree
to a proposal to relinquish an additional 13 percent of the West
Bank to the Palestinian Authority. Palestinians now have full or
partial control over 27 percent of the West Bank, including the
main population centers.
	   Israel captured the territory from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war. Palestinians hope to make the West Bank the nucleus of a
future state.
	   Among the sticking points are Israel's demand that the PLO take
further action to expunge a provision of its 34-year-old charter
that calls for the destruction of the Jewish state.
	   Netanyahu, addressing an Israel Bonds fundraiser attended mainly
by U.S. business people, cited ``significant progress'' in recent
dealings with the Clinton administration.
	   ``We have achieved important understandings both on Israeli
redployment and on Palestinian compliance,'' he said, adding that
``there are some areas that remain to be closed ... between us and
the Palestinians.''
	   Last week in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright urged the two sides to talk directly to resolve their
differences. Netanyahu said Israel was willing to do so.
	   ``We are prepared to engage in this discussion immediately
without delay,'' he said.
	   The Palestinians, however, said over the weekend that Israel
must first agree to the American troop-withdrawal terms.
	   Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been frozen since
March 1997, when Israel began building a new Jewish settlement on a
disputed hilltop between Bethlehem and Jerusalem.
	   In other developments Monday:
	   _A small bomb exploded outside the PLO's unofficial headquarters
in east Jerusalem, slightly injuring one Palestinian man. There was
no immediate claim of responsiblity.
	   _Arafat won a second two-week extension from the Palestinian
legislature on a promised shakeup of his Cabinet.

Ethiopian premier seeks Kenyan mediation in conflict with Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
arrived Monday to seek help from President Daniel arap Moi in
mediating his country's two-month border conflict with Eritrea.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Newton Buliva said Meles came under
the auspices of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development to
consult with Moi on the ongoing conflict.
	   ``He is holding consultations over the Ethiopia-Eritrea war,''
Buliva said. ``He is seeking help from President Moi on mediation
efforts.''
	   He had no other details.
	   IGAD was set up to help resolve problems among member states in
the Horn of Africa and East Africa.
	   Several nations, including the United States and Rwanda, have
attempted to mediate since border clashes erupted between the two
neighboring Horn of Africa countries on May 6.
	   Tensions escalated in early June when each country bombed the
other and battles raged for a brief period on three fronts.
Hundreds were killed before fighting gave way to a stalemate on the
border where thousands of troops are massed on each side.
	   The countries had enjoyed apparently close relations since
Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, two years after
Eritrean rebels assisted Ethiopian rebels to overthrow a 17-year
military rgime in 1991.
	   The countries are at loggerheads over disputed borders drawn up
by Italian colonizers in the early 20th century.
	   In June, Eritrea rejected a proposal drawn up by the United
States and Rwanda to end the fighting. Further attempts by African
heads of state from Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe and Djibouti have also
made little headway.
	   The presidents of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo also recently travelled to Addis Ababa and Asmara, the
Ethiopian and Eritrean capitals.
	   Meanwhile, both governments continue to accuse each other of
war-mongering.
	   On Sunday, Ethiopia deported 1,000 members of Eritrea's ruling
party who had been residing in Ethiopia, accusing them of spying or
raising funds for the Eritrean war effort.
	   Government spokeswoman Selome Taddesse said the deportees left
Addis Ababa by bus but did not say where they were headed.
	   Many of those deported are well-known businessmen and shop
owners in Ethiopia. Selome said last week that all those rounded up
would be allowed to appoint agents to manage their businesses or
properties.
	   Each country accuses the other of abusing its citizens.
	   The Eritrean People's Front for Democracy and Justice, the
successor to the rebel movement that fought Ethiopia for 30 years
to obtain independence, had an extensive network in Ethiopia.
	   The government closed down the group's main office last month.
Its leaders were among an earlier group of 1,047 Eritreans sent
home.
	   Eritrea claims as many as 6,000 Eritreans have already been
deported from Ethiopia.

Budget cuts have Thai army worried it can't care for troops with
</HEADLINE>
AIDS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's army is worried it can't
care for troops suffering from the virus that causes AIDS because
of budget cuts forced by the country's financial crisis, army
officials said Monday.
	   The percentage of troops suffering from the HIV virus has
dropped from 5 percent of the army five years ago to 1.6 percent
now, said an officer with the army's medical department, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   But the budget for dealing with HIV sufferers also has been cut
drastically from the 30 million baht (dlrs 714,000) of just a
couple of years ago, the officer added. He said he couldn't give a
precise current figure.
	   Thailand is battling its worst financial crisis in modern times,
and even the military, once a sacred cow because of its history of
staging coups, has had to accept cuts in its funding.
	   The officer cited a study by Johns Hopkins University that said
most infected soldiers had contracted the virus through intravenous
drug use, unlike a few years ago when sexual activity was the main
cause.
	   Increased education has helped reduce the number of infected
troops in the army, which has about 275,000 soldiers.
	   The highest percentage of infected troops were serving in
Thailand's north, which borders the opium-rich jungles of Myanmar,
the world's second largest producer of the narcotic.
	   Thailand's army only tests soldiers for HIV after they have
already been recruited.

Iran minister calls for united front with Arabs against Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran wants to forge a united front with Arab
countries to thwart potential threats from Israel, Iran's defense
minister said in comments published Monday.
	   ``We will not abandon the Arab countries in their confrontation
against threats by the Zionist regime,'' the minister, Ali
Shamkhani, said in an interview with the Arabic-language Al-Ittihad
daily of the United Arab Emirates. Excerpts were reprinted in
several Iranian newspapers Monday.
	   ``To confront these threats, Iran is trying to create an
Iran-Arab axis,'' Shamkhani said.
	   Iran's Islamic government has long denied Israel's right to
exist and opposes Palestinian negotiations with it.
	   For about a decade, one of Iran's ambitions has been to create
and lead a defense alliance in the oil-rich Gulf. The Iranians, who
oppose the presence of U.S. and other foreign forces in the
strategic waterway, want a regional force to protect it.
	   Gulf countries were long wary of revolutionary Iran, although
relations have improved since the election in May 1997 of President
Mohammad Khatami, a moderate Iranian cleric. None of the countries,
however, has welcomed a defense pact with Iran.
	   Shamkhani said that Israel, which has said it has the capability
to launch a pre-emptive attack against a key nuclear facility in
southern Iran, ``represents a danger for our national security.''
	   Russia has been building Iran's only large nuclear reactor in
the port city of Bushehr. Iran says the 1,000-megawatt facility
will be used only to generate power. But the United States and
Israel have said it could be used to develop nuclear weapons.
	   Iran says it is not interested in acquiring such weapons, and
notes that its facilities have been endorsed by the Vienna-based
International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   ``If they want to attack, let them try, because we will
retaliate ... and make the aggressor suffer a severe setback,''
Shamkhani said.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant Orangemen marched on
their big holiday Monday, chastened and divided by the deaths of
three boys in the violence swirling around their defiance of a
government order to avoid one Catholic neighborhood.
	   Two men were arrested Monday morning in connection with the
sectarian killing of the Catholic brothers. They were being
questioned by police, the Royal Ulster Constabulary said in a brief
statement.

Singapore stock market down on Hashimoto resignation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore stocks dropped sharply Monday on news
of Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's resignation and
uncertainty over his successor.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index closed 3.4 percent
lower at 1,053.19. It had closed at 1,090.35 Friday.
	   Dealers said market players in Singapore continued to take their
cues from the faltering yen, which broke through the 144 level
against the U.S. dollar on news of Sunday's parliamentary election
results in Japan. It later rebounded to the 142-yen level.
	   Hashimoto announced Monday afternoon that he would resign to
take responsibility for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's
staggering defeat.
	   Although investors in Japan interpreted the resignation as a
sign that economic reforms will be introduced sooner, Singapore
dealers said the rest of Asia remains skeptical that the leader's
resignation will accelerate the process.
	   ``The reforms will face difficulties in implementation and could
be delayed in his absence,'' a local brokerage house director told
Dow Jones Newswires. He noted that the resignation also raises the
question of who will succeed Hashimoto.
	   Finance Minister Richard Hu warned Saturday that Singapore and
the entire region would be hurt if Hashimoto was forced to resign.
	   ``If he's unseated or whatever, then we're going to be facing a
lot of problems,'' Hu had said.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian lawmakers gave
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat a second two-week extension Monday
for carrying out a promised Cabinet reshuffle.
	   The Palestinian legislature had set July 10 as a deadline for
Arafat to name a new Cabinet or face a first-ever vote of no
confidence over allegations of corruption.
	   ``We will give the extension and wait for the results,'' said
Speaker Ahmed Quriea. The new deadline is July 25.
	   Arafat's request came in a letter to Quriea that was read to
lawmakers.
	   ``I have not completed the necessary consultations regarding the
formulation of a new government,'' the Palestinian leader wrote.
	   Arafat has been trying to bring opposition factions into the
government _ chiefly his biggest political rival, the Islamic
militant group Hamas, which has spurned offers to join the Cabinet.
	   Of the 24 Cabinet slots, seven need to be filled in any event.
Two ministers died this year, four resigned, and the appointment of
one minister was never approved by the legislature.
	   Last year, all but two ministers submitted their resignations to
Arafat after an audit reportedly revealed widespread corruption.
Arafat accepted the resignations June 25.

Ties between Malaysia and Singapore strained again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS reference to condition in 11th graf; clarifies in 2nd
graf that jabs were by media &QL; 
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Recent squabbling between
Singapore and Malaysia is further straining already tenuous ties
between the Southeast Asian neighbors.
	   Singapore media's recent jabs at Malaysia's new international
airport left Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik sniffing that the
southern neighbor was just jealous of the glittering dlrs 2.3
billion Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
	   ``It is the behavior of a competitor who likes to run down the
airport, so that fewer passengers will be using our airport,'' Ling
said over the weekend.
	   ``They also see the airport has the potential to be the hub of
regional air transportation,'' said Ling, who has been at KLIA
almost daily to solve problems that have dogged the new airport,
which Malaysia claims is the world's largest.
	   What really angered Ling were stories like the one in the
Singapore Straits Times last week, based on an Internet account of
one frustrated Singaporean passenger at KLIA.
	   ``The airport is not as big as (Singapore's) Changi, but it
seems so much bigger, because we are walking all the time,'' wrote
Daren Lim Chee Wei, a shipping executive and frequent flier. ``An
airport should be designed for air travel. Looking good should be
secondary.''
	   Relations began souring in recent weeks after Tourism Minister
Sabaruddin Chik accused Singapore of deliberately striking Malaysia
from a list of tourist destinations for delegates to a Rotary
convention.
	   Then came the spat over shifting of a railroad border post.
Malaysia said no to Singapore's plans to move its customs,
immigration and quarantine checkpoint from the island's Tanjung
Pagar train station to a new site.
	   Singapore proposed to submit the dispute to the International
Court of Justice. Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi said a
settlement could be reached if Singapore sincerely wanted to
improve ties with Malaysia.
	   That appeared to spill over into the sensitive issue of water.
About half of the water consumed daily by Singaporeans comes from
Malaysia, under two treaties. One of those treaties expires in 2011
and the other in 2061. Singapore wants a clearly defined,
longer-term treaty.
	   ``We have assured them that we will give them the water but
there must be conditions to supplying water,'' Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said cryptically last week. The conditions
reportedly refer to the quality and costs of the water.
	   The troubles come one year after the neighbors settled a row
over Singapore senior minister Lee Kwan Yew's description of the
southern Malaysian state of Johor Baru as ``notorious for
shootings, muggings, and car-jackings.''
	   Malaysia was mollified by an apology, but Foreign Minister
Abdullah warned: ``This episode has deeply hurt Malaysians of all
sections of society and that restoration of the old level of
relationship would take time.''
	   There is a long line of mistrust between Singapore and Malaysia,
said Roger Rasiah, associate professor of economics at University
of Malaya.
	   ``There has been mistrust, even when Singapore was within
Malaysia,'' Rasiah said. ``Singapore leaders always believed they
were superior.''
	   Britain allowed Singapore to govern itself in 1959, with Lee as
prime minister. In 1963, Singapore was incorporated into Malaysia,
an experiment which failed two years later after wrangling between
Lee and the late Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman.
	   Singapore still remains Malaysia's third-largest trade partner
and an important gateway into Malaysia. More than 200,000
Malaysians cross over to Singapore each day to work.

Turkey's top general leaves for talks in U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's top general flew to the United
States on Monday for talks with senior U.S. defense officials about
tensions on Cyprus and in the Aegean Sea.
	   Gen. Ismail Hakki Karadayi, chief of Turkey's general staff, was
scheduled to meet Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the U.S.
Joint Chiefs of Staff, and U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen on
Thursday.
	   He is also to visit NATO's Allied Atlantic Command headquarters
in Norfolk, Virginia.
	   Karadayi's trip follows a visit to Washington last week by Greek
Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos.
	   Tensions between Greece and Turkey _ NATO allies and historic
rivals with longstanding territorial disputes in the Aegean and
over Cyprus _ have intensified during the past year.
	   The purchase by Greek Cypriots of anti-aircraft missiles to be
stationed on the Mediterranean island has further worsened
relations. Turkey has threatened action to prevent the deployment
of the Russian-made S-300 missiles.
	   Greece, in turn, has warned it would intervene in such an event,
raising fears of a military clash between the two countries.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat received a
red-carpet welcome on Tiananmen Square Monday and held talks with
Chinese leaders on reviving the stalled Middle East peace process.
	   At the start of a visit to China, Arafat reviewed an honor guard
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin on the square before entering
the Great Hall of the People for talks.
	   The peace process was a ``major topic'' of their discussions,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Arafat's Palestinian National Authority hopes China will use its
permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council to influence the peace
process, the official newspaper China Daily on Monday quoted Arafat
as saying in an interview.
	   Although not a mediator in the process, China is ``deeply
concerned'' over the current Middle East stalemate and wants to see
signed agreements implemented, the newspaper said.
	   China has long been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause
but over the past decade has developed good diplomatic and strong
economic ties with Israel.

	   Judge Carlo Ancona ruled that the Italian courts lacked
jurisdiction in the case.
	   Trento Prosecutor Francantonio Granero had pushed for
manslaughter charges in Italy even though the Italian government
has acquiesced in American prosecution of the four crewmen.
	   Twenty people were killed in the Feb. 3 accident, which set off
a crisis in U.S.-Italian relations and demands by some for a
closing of U.S. bases in Italy.
	   Monday's hearing took place just three days after a U.S. general
ordered two of the crewmen tried for manslaughter.
	   Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commander of Marine Corps Forces Atlantic,
ruled Friday that there is enough evidence for a court-martial for
Capt. Richard J. Ashby, the pilot, and Capt. Joseph P. Schweitzer,
the navigator.
	   The general dismissed charges against the two back-seat officers
on the jet.

``English Patient'' actor in Budapest for ``Sunshine'' movie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDPAEST, Hungary (AP) _ Sampling goose liver and singing
Hungarian love songs to get himself in the mood, actor Ralph
Fiennes said Monday how he was shaping up for the lead in ``The
Taste of Sunshine'' movie.
	   ``It was one of the best scripts I have ever read in my life,''
said a soft-spoken Fiennes of ``Sunshine,'' as it is referred to,
written and directed by Istvan Szabo, the acclaimed Hungarian
director.
	   The 36-year-old English actor will play all three leads in the
tale of a Jewish family's struggle to maintain their identity over
three generations: a pragmatic lawyer, his Olympic-athlete son and
his political grandson.
	   Fiennes is having fencing lessons, learning to sing Hungarian
love songs, eating best Hungarian food and walking round the
streets of Budapest as he gets familiar with his three roles.
	   The story covers 150 years of central European history; from the
Austro-Hungarian Empire to the days of communism. Most of the 21
weeks of filming will be in Hungary, with brief forays to Berlin
and Vienna.
	   Fiennes' portrayal of a cruel S.S commander in Schindler's List
made him an international star. He was nominated for an Oscar in
``The English Patient.''
	   Also starring is William Hurt in a smaller role. The film will
be ready next Spring in time for the Cannes festival. Producers of
the Canadian Alliance Communications Corp. declined to disclose the
budget.

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ John Cook, runner-up in the 1992
British Open, has withdrawn from this week's championship at Royal
Birkdale.
	   Cook, winner of the Byron Nelson Classic in May, cited
``personal reasons'' for his decision.
	   His withdrawal reduces the number of exempt players to 102,
leaving 54 instead of 53 places available in the final qualifying
competition concluding at four courses Monday.

	   The United States insists it has sole jurisdiction in the case
because of a NATO treaty. Washington maintains the EA-6B Prowler
was flying under the auspices of NATO when it sent the ski gondola
crashing to the ground, killing 19 skiers and the gondola operator.
	   Granero argued that the plane violated the NATO treaty's
mandated flight patterns, and therefore the flight should be
considered a U.S. mission _ which would give Italy jurisdiction.
Granero also challenged the constitutionality of the NATO treaty.
	   Even they had been indicted, it was unlikely the crew would have
come to Italy to face justice. Italian law allows defendants to be
tried in absentia.
	   Seeking the indictment, on charges of multiple manslaughter and
endangering the safety of transport, was well within Granero's
powers; Italian prosecutors have a large measure of independence.
	   The crew's Italian lawyers said the Americans were victims of a
``conflict of power'' between the government and the Italian
courts.
	   They are in the ``paradoxical situation of a double trial and of
a possible double conviction for the same deeds,'' the lawyers,
Bruno and Antonio Malattia, said in a statement Saturday.
	   Ancona also dropped the case against three top U.S. military
officials at the Aviano base in northern Italy, where the jet was
stationed.

Russian impeachment commission to convene July 20, success
</HEADLINE>
unlikely &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A parliament commission set up to prepare an
impeachment motion against President Boris Yeltsin will begin
hearings July 20, a news agency reported Monday.
	   However, several previous attempts to oust Yeltsin in recent
years have collapsed, and the latest effort is given little chance
of success.
	   The commission plans to begin by debating the first charge
brought against Yeltsin _ that his 1991 agreement with Belarus and
Ukraine to dissolve the Soviet Union was illegal, said Commission
Chairman Vadim Filimonov, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The Communists and their allies have accused Yeltsin of several
other transgressions, including launching the botched war in
Chechnya and ruining Russia's economy.
	   After an indictment is prepared, 300 of the 450 members of
parliament's lower house need to support the impeachment motion.
Then it would have to win confirmation from both the Constitutional
and Supreme Courts, as well as the upper chamber of parliament, the
Federation Council.

	   TRENTO, Italy (AP) _ An Italian judge on Monday dropped the case
against the crew members of a Marine jet that severed a ski gondola
cable in the Alps, leaving any decision to U.S. courts.
	   Judge Carlo Ancona ruled that Italian courts lacked
jurisdiction.
	   Trento Prosecutor Francantonio Granero had pushed for
manslaughter charges in Italy even though the Italian government
has acquiesced in American prosecution of the four crewmen.
	   Twenty people were killed in the Feb. 3 accident, which set off
a crisis in U.S.-Italian relations and demands by some for a
closing of U.S. bases in Italy.
	   Monday's hearing took place just three days after a U.S. general
ordered two of the crewmen tried for manslaughter.
	   Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commander of Marine Corps Forces Atlantic,
ruled Friday that there is enough evidence for a court-martial for
Capt. Richard J. Ashby, the pilot, and Capt. Joseph P. Schweitzer,
the navigator.
	   The general dismissed charges against the two back-seat officers
on the jet.
	   The United States insisted it has sole jurisdiction in the case
because of a NATO treaty. Washington maintains the EA-6B Prowler
was flying under the auspices of NATO when it sent the ski gondola
crashing to the ground, killing 19 skiers and the gondola operator.
	   Granero argued that the plane violated the NATO treaty's
mandated flight patterns, and therefore the flight should be
considered a U.S. mission _ which would give Italy jurisdiction.
Granero also challenged the constitutionality of the NATO treaty.
	   Even they had been indicted, it was unlikely the crew would have
come to Italy to face justice. Italian law allows defendants to be
tried in absentia.
	   Seeking the indictment, on charges of multiple manslaughter and
endangering the safety of transport, was well within Granero's
powers; Italian prosecutors have a large measure of independence.
	   The crew's Italian lawyers said the Americans were victims of a
``conflict of power'' between the government and the Italian courts
and would be unfairly subject to a ``double trial.''
	   Ancona also dropped the case against three top U.S. military
officials at the Aviano base in northern Italy, where the jet was
stationed.

Belgium's hopes boosted by Van Herck's recovery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HANK LOWENKRON &QC;

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Needing all the help it can get against the
heavily favored United States, Belgium hopes to have Johan Van
Herck at full strength for this week's Davis Cup quarterfinal.
	   Van Herck, returning from a hamstring injury, went through a
hard practice Saturday for the first time since he was forced to
retire last month from the first round of Wimbledon.
	   ``My injury is fine. I didn't play for two weeks,'' Van Herck
said. ``That was the first time I was able to play like three
hours, so I have a lot of work to do.''
	   The United States is seeking its 18th consecutive home victory.
	   Other challenges for Belgium _ in the quarterfinals of the World
Group for the first time ever _ include playing on a hard court and
against a team that features two players who were once ranked No. 1
in the world.
	   The Belgium team began practicing at the Indianapolis Tennis
Center on Saturday and will be joined by the U.S. team Monday.
	   The U.S. lineup is set. Andre Agassi and Jim Courier will play
singles, and Todd Martin and Richey Reneberg will play doubles.
	   Belgium captain Keon Gonnissen planned to announce his lineup
later in the week. Competition begins with two singles matches
Friday, and Gonnissen has until Thursday morning to make his
decision.
	   He'll be choosing from among four young players _ Filip Dewulf,
Christophe Van Garsse, Van Herck and 17-year-old Xavier Malisse,
who left Belgium to develop his game at Nick Bollettieri's tennis
academy in Florida.
	   ``We're four equally balanced players. We have a lot of choice
to play singles or doubles,'' Van Herck said.
	   The countries are meeting for the first time since 1957 and
Belgium _ a country where only about 20,000 people play tennis _
accepts the underdog role.
	   ``The United States is probably one of the best teams there is.
We have to play them in the United States. It's not a big advantage
for us,'' he said. ``You never know in Davis Cup.''
	   And U.S. players are comfortable on hard courts _ the surface
where they learned the game as opposed to the clay background of
Belgium players.
	   ``It's not our favorite surface,'' said Gonnissen, adding that
his team's success the past two years has raised interest in the
sport at home to previously unreached levels.
	   ``It's a great experience for Belgium. ... This tie is really
important, and all the guys really believe we have a chance.
	   ``It's a no-lose situation, so we don't really care. Nobody is
stressed and nobody will be. It will be a very positive focus and a
very positive concentration.''
	   U.S. captain Tom Gullikson is using the same four players who
defeated Russia 3-2 at Stony Mountain, Georgia, when Courier won
the final two sets of a five-set match to end the tie.
	   It's the first time the United States has gone with the same
four players in two consecutive Davis Cup matches since 1992.
	   ``They're very committed to the team. I think that in Davis Cup,
the most important thing is to play with guys who really want to be
there and have a passion for the team thing,'' Gullikson said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces battling
separatist Kosovo Albanians shelled villages southwest of Pristina
on Monday, killing two people and leaving others wounded or
fleeing, ethnic Albanians reported.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said Pecan and two other villages
45 kilometers (28 miles) southwest of Pristina were shelled. Beside
the two dead, identified by name, 12 others were wounded, said the
center, which is close to Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   The shelling, plus Serb sniping in nearby Suva Reka village, was
resulting in an exodus of ethnic Albanians from the region, said
the center. There was no independent confirmation of the report.
	   The newest outbreak left a total of 12 people reported dead over
three days.
	   France and Britain have said they would introduce a resolution
in the U.N. Security Council threatening new measures against the
warring sides if they do not halt the fighting. Moscow opposes
using NATO military force in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
militants are fighting for independence from Serbia.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-1 in Kosovo, are seeking
independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Hundreds of people have been killed since February when Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on Albanian
separatists who had been attacking Serb police and military
facilities.
	   Both sides reported casualties on the weekend. According to Serb
sources, two Serb policemen were killed when Albanian militants
attacked checkpoints along the province's main roads. And the
militant ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army said seven fighters
were killed in clashes over the weekend.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said Sunday the KLA had handed
over three Yugoslav army deserters to an international humanitarian
group. The report, which could not be independently confirmed, did
not say which group was involved.
	   The deserters, handed over late Saturday, were all from
Montenegro, the smaller republic of Yugoslavia, the center said. It
said the militant KLA still holds more deserters.

Political uncertainty in Japan causes jitters in Asian markets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing figures for all markets &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets slumped Monday following the
Japanese governing party's defeat in parliamentary elections, with
the key index tumbling 3.4 percent in Singapore.
	   But bucking the trend was the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where prices
rebounded after investors decided that Japan would continue
economic reforms even after the government shakeup from Sunday's
elections.
	   The governing Liberal Democrats won 44 of the 126 seats at stake
in Sunday's elections to the upper house, far fewer than the 69 it
needed for an outright majority and below the 61 it held
previously.
	   The key Singapore Straits Times Industrial Index shed 37.16
points, closing at 1,053.19.
	   Traders said Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's
resignation failed to inspire confidence in the Singapore market.
	   Tokyo's 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average rose 270.33
points, or 1.68 percent, closing at 16,360.39. On Friday, the
Nikkei index had shed 356.89 points, or 2.17 percent.
	   The Nikkei slid some 280 points at one point in the morning amid
uncertainty following the election setback for Hashimoto's party.
	   But after Hashimoto announced that he would resign, the index
recovered as investors concluded that even with a change of prime
ministers, the government would carry out reform plans it has
promised internationally, traders said.
	   In currency trading, the U.S. dollar surged in early Asian
trading as investors dumped the yen following the surprisingly poor
election showing of Japan's governing party.
	   But the dollar's rally soon ran out of steam as Japanese
investors who bought the U.S. currency near its highs rushed to
take profits, traders said.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar was quoted at 142.42 yen, up 1.09
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
level of 140.93 yen on Friday.
	   Thai stock prices closed sharply lower as traders waited to see
what would happen in Japan.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 7.51 points, or 2.7
percent, to 266.75.
	   Malaysian shares closed at a new nine-year low as investors
largely ignored the announcement by Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim
of additional measures to stimulate the Malaysian economy, which is
sliding into recession.
	   Kuala Lumpur's benchmark Composite Index, which tracks 100
blue-chip stocks, fell 7.31 points, or 1.71 percent, to 421.31.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower as investors took profits in
reaction to Japan's political developments. The market's key
Weighted Stock Price Index fell 67.63 points, or 0.86 percent, to
7,815.53.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower in lackluster
trading. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 26.00 points, or 1.2
percent, to 2,040.14.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower after the dismal
electoral performance of the ruling party in Japan. The Philippine
Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks fell 26.36 points, or
1.5 percent, to 1,775.85.
	   HONG KONG: Share prices closed lower in Hong Kong for a second
consecutive session. The Hang Seng Index fell 106.57 points, or 1.3
percent, closing at 8,099.20.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed mostly lower, pushed down
by the political turmoil in Japan. The All Ordinaries Index fell
29.3 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,718.6.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed lower in reaction to the political
uncertainty in Japan. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell
3.6 points, or 1.1 percent, to 301.37.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian share prices closed lower. The Composite
Index fell 3.908 points, or 0.8 percent, to 459.673.

Australians count injuries as they prepare for Springboks

 &UR; EDs: ADDS South African team named and team list &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australia's rugby union team was a
side of walking wounded Monday as it left for Perth and the second
stage of their Tri Nations series against South Africa on Saturday.
	   South Africa, meanwhile, named a virtually unchanged side for
the Australian test.
	   The Australian team paid a painful price for its 24-16 Tri
Nations and Bledisloe Cup test triumph over New Zealand at the
Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday.
	   Prop Richard Harry was ruled out of Saturday's test against
South Africa at Perth's Subiaco Oval with a damaged kneecap, while
winger Ben Tune and reserve Jason Little were doubt. Tune also
suffered a knee injury while Little missed the Melbourne game with
a calf strain.
	   Australian manager John McKay said Monday both would be rested
until later in the week before a decision was made on whether they
could play.
	   Also carrying injuries are hooker Phil Kearns (ribs), winger Joe
Roff (shoulder), centers Tim Horan (knee) and Daniel Herbert (leg),
five-eighth Steve Larkham (arm) and reserve forward Willie
Ofahengaue (knee), but McKay said all were expected to play.
	   Seasoned prop Dan Crowley will be promoted to the starting side
to take Harry's place, while Queensland front rower Glenn Panoho
will move to the bench.
	   South African coach Nick Mallett named his test side Monday,
omitting only reserve fly-half Braam Van Straaten from the side
that beat England 18-0 in South Africa on July 5, replacing him on
the bench with Franco Smith.
	   SOUTH AFRICA: Percy Montgomery, Stefan Terblanche, Andre Snyman,
Pieter Muller, Pieter Rossouw, Henry Honiball, Joost Van Der
Westhuizen, Gary Teichmann (captain), Andre Venter, Johan Erasmus,
Mark Andrews, Krynauw Otto, Adrian Garvey, James Dalton, Robert
Kempson. Reserves: McNeil Hendricks, Franco Smith, Werner
Swanepoel, Bobby Skinstad, Ollie Le Roux, Naka Drotske. (djp)

France loves ZZ's top
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Add ZZ's top to the list of famous
French monuments, alongside the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe,
Notre Dame and the Sacre-Coeur.
	   For the rest of his life, everywhere he goes in France, he's the
man. Zinedine Zidane's balding pate changed French sports history
Sunday night, touching off wild celebrations and mass outdoor
parties on the old boulevards that still were going at dawn.
	   From the Atlantique North to the beaches of the Cote d'Azure,
from the Rhone River valley to the chateaux of the Loire, Zidane
became a revered figure. Twice in the first half, he used his head
to redirect corner kicks into the net, and France went on to upset
Brazil 3-0, becoming only the seventh nation to win a World Cup.
	   ``Zidane lit a beacon for us,'' French coach Aime Jacquet said.
	   And he gave the City of Light a night its suddenly soccer-crazed
citizens will never forget.
	   Liberte. Egalite. Fraternite.
	   And now, Zidane.
	   ``It's incredible,'' he said. ``There are no words.''
	   Fans chanted ``Zi-zou'' (his nickname) until they were hoarse.
While Brazil might have soccer's most fabulous feet, its defense
was pretty much a head case when it came to the air game.
	   At 6-feet, 3/4-inches (1.85 meters), Zidane was a full 3 inches
(7.62 centimeters) taller than the two players nearest him on
Emmanuel Petit's corner kick in the 27th minute. Zidane, who had
never scored a World Cup goal before, got away from Dunga, Brazil's
captain, and went over Leonardo, slicing the ball past goalkeeper
Claudio Taffarel and just inside the near post.
	   ``I badly wanted to score at least one goal in this World Cup
and I only had the final left to do it,'' Zidane said.
	   Nineteen minutes later, other side of field, virtually an
instant replay. This time, Youri Djorkaeff took the corner. And
this time, Zidane had more space than some narrow Paris sidewalks.
There was no one within 4 yards (meters), and the two closest
Brazilians were a pair of forwards, Ronaldo and Rivaldo.
	   The sound said it all, 75,000 Andres Cantors shrieking:
``GOOOAALLL!!!''
	   Zidane whose parents came to France from Algeria and who grew up
on the tough streets of Marseille, became the first to score twice
in a World Cup final since England's Geoff Hurst got three against
West Germany in 1966.
	   ``It is remarkable I scored two goals with my head, which is not
my strong point,'' Zidane said.
	   The Brazilians were stunned. Once Germany and Italy were
eliminated from the other side of the bracket, they thought their
fifth title was secure.
	   ``The two goals came from set pieces and upset the balance of
the game,'' Taffarel said. ``We didn't have the strength to
react.''
	   After Zidane's second goal, there were more renditions of ``La
Marseillaise'' in the gleaming Stade de France than good scoring
chances by Brazil.
	   In a first-round game, Zidane was ejected for kicking Saudi
Arabia captain Fouad Amin, and FIFA suspended him for two games,
including the quarterfinal against Paraguay. French captain Didier
Deschamps scolded Zidane for hurting the team.
	   ``His influence is so important,'' Deschamps said then. ``We
expect a lot from him, and he can make the difference.''
	   He sure did. Moments after Deschamps lifted the trophy, forward
Christophe Dugarry went over to Zidane and kissed his head. Kissing
his head might become one of France's favorite pastimes.
	   Players and fans were leaping with joy and cried as Brazil
handed over the world's most coveted trophy. When it comes to
soccer's championship, for next four years, France has cornered the
market.

Flood-swollen Yangtze capsizes ferry, stops shipping
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with five deaths from ferry sinking,
donation by U.S. Embassy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Surging flood waters on the Yangtze River left at
least five people dead in a ferry accident and forced a halt to
shipping through the renowned Three Gorges, China's state media
reported Monday.
	   High waves caused by days of heavy rains forced passengers to
crowd near the front of the ferry, in Sichuan province's Jiang'an
County, on Sunday morning, China Central Television said.
	   The boat listed and then sank, throwing more than 70 people into
the river, CCTV reported. Rescuers saved 53 people and recovered
five bodies, but a dozen or more people were still missing, the
report said.
	   With the ferry accident, at least 655 people have died so far,
more than 170 of them in Sichuan, in flooding from seasonal rains
that began earlier and have been heavier than usual.
	   The U.S. Embassy announced Monday that it was sending dlrs
25,000 to help victims of the floods. The money was given to the
United Nations Development Program, which is coordinating
international relief efforts.
	   With Yangtze waters at dangerous levels, the Ministry of
Communications ordered suspension of shipping through the Three
Gorges, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
	   High waters forced the shutdown Friday of a temporary lock,
built specifically for use in the flood season, and a second
navigation channel was closed Saturday night, Xinhua said.
	   Stranded passengers were put on other, unspecified modes of
transport, and shipping was unlikely to resume for several days,
Xinhua said.
	   Chinese engineers diverted the Yangtze, the world's third
longest river, in November to allow construction of the Three
Gorges Dam, the world's largest hydroelectric project. Xinhua did
not mention the floodwaters' effect on construction.

Islamic body elects Jerusalem's chief Muslim cleric as head
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jerusalem's mufti, or chief Muslim cleric, on
Monday was elected chairman of the Higher Islamic Council, the
highest Islamic body in the city.
	   Ikrema Sabri was appointed mufti in 1994 by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat. His term as council chairman will run three years.
	   Sabri received 18 out of the 46 votes cast. In second place was
Mohammed Nussibeh, from a prominent Jerusalem family, with 14
votes.
	   The council was established in 1967 after Israel captured east
Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan in the Mideast war. The
council's duties include guardianship of Islamic holy sites.

Lawsuits try new ways of holding handgun makers liable for
</HEADLINE>
violence &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTHA IRVINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Taking a cue from successful tobacco lawsuits,
officials of at least two cities _ Chicago and Philadelphia _ are
thinking of taking similar action against handgun makers.
	   They want companies to pay for everything from the cost of a
murder investigation to the dlrs 200 or so it costs to hose blood
off city streets.
	   ``You have to have somebody to haul the body away. You have to
go back and start the initial investigation, and so on and so on.
... You're looking at literally thousands of dollars,'' says
Patrick Camden, a Chicago police spokesman.
	   Chicago's lawyers are looking at ways handgun makers market
their wares. They say some companies play up features that might
appeal to gang members and other criminals _ including an
oil-resistant surface that evades fingerprints and a small size
that makes a gun easier to hide.
	   ``They make weapons more dangerous than they have to be and then
they brag about it,'' says Lawrence Rosenthal, Chicago's deputy
corporation counsel who's leading the lawsuit research.
	   Several private lawsuits around the country also take issue with
handgun makers' marketing techniques. One filed last month in
Chicago, Young vs. Bryco Arms, accuses manufacturers of making,
advertising and selling guns that are public nuisances and appeal
to criminals.
	   ``They know damned well when they send those guns off the
shipping docks that there are a couple of murders in those
crates,'' says Stephen Young, whose 19-year-old son, Andrew, was
gunned down in 1996 as he drove down an Evanston, Illinois, street.
	   But one law professor, Dan Polsby of Northwestern University,
thinks the lawsuits are weak _ particularly one in New York that
claims gunmakers and sellers have created an oversupply of guns in
Southern states that travel northward on an ``iron pipeline.''
	   ``It is remarkably, remarkably silly,'' says Polsby, an
authority on firearms law.
	   But he adds that he thought much the same of the tobacco
lawsuits.
	   ``The example of cigarettes should serve to remind one that
plaintiffs can fail a lot of times in a row before they start to
succeed,'' Polsby says.
	   In one earlier lawsuit in New York, a federal court jury in
March decided that a gun company and its owners were not
responsible for an attack in which a young man was killed on the
Brooklyn Bridge. Jurors agreed with the defense, which argued that
a manufacturer cannot control what is done with its weapons after
they are sold.
	   A spokesman at Bryco Arms, the California-based company that
made the semiautomatic 9 mm handgun that gang members used to kill
Andrew Young, says his father's assertion is ludicrous. Bruce
Jennings said the company's ads are low-key and target law-abiding
citizens who buy guns for sport or protection.
	   A lawyer for another handgun maker said any legal action should
target the shooter, not the gun.
	   ``Nobody wins when legal products are used illegally and harm
somebody. Nobody wins when cars are stolen to commit crimes. Nobody
wins when people drive drunk,'' says Anne Kimball, an attorney for
Massachusetts-based Smith and Wesson. ``But to try to ascribe the
blame to the manufacturer doesn't ... attack the real area of
concern.''
	   That's part of the point Smith and Wesson and other handgun
makers, including Glock Inc., have been making in private talks
with representatives from the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
Philadelphia officials have been part of the talks and have, so
far, held off on filing their lawsuit.
	   Officials of several other cities, including Detroit, are
watching closely and considering filing their own lawsuits.
	   ``We need to see progress, or we're going to have to get a
little more aggressive,'' says Anthony Neely, a spokesman for
Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer.

	   PARIS (AP) _ From plazas to boulevards to cafes to living rooms,
from the smallest villages to the biggest cities, a single glorious
chant echoed across France: ``We are the champions!''
	   France's stunning World Cup victory over Brazil Sunday night
sent the country into a paroxysm of patriotic celebration not seen
since the Liberation.
	   ``The day of glory has arrived,'' France's national anthem goes,
and on this night the French sang it everywhere, and like they
truly believed it.
	   The merrymaking was marred, however, by an accident on the
Champs-Elysees, the grand avenue crowned by the Arc de Triomphe.
	   As more than a million people gathered on the avenue, a panicked
driver careened out of control and plowed into a crowd of revelers,
injuring 80 people, 11 seriously.
	   The celebratory mood of the early morning hours quickly turned
into horror as dozens of ambulances and 200 rescue workers
converged on the scene. Some of the victims were treated on the
ground. None were critically injured, however, officials said.
	   The driver, a 44-year-old schoolteacher who is undergoing
psychiatric treatment, panicked and ran away from the scene, said a
source close to the investigation into the accident, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   After wandering around Paris for several hours, she called her
son who took the distraught woman to a police station in suburban
Paris where she was detained, the source said.

Massive hunt under way for possible communist intruders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with formal protest to North Korea, grafs 5-8; trims &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's defense minister
returned to Seoul Monday to take charge of a massive search for
possible North Korean intruders, a day after the body of a
suspected communist spy was found on an east coast beach.
	   Arriving at Seoul's Kimpo airport after cutting short a visit to
the United States, Chun Yong-taek denounced the alleged incursion
as a ``grave armed provocation.''
	   President Kim Dae-jung called a meeting of his top military and
security advisers for Wednesday to review South Korea's relations
with its northern rival.
	   The episode could put a strain on Kim's policy of trying to open
up the reclusive Stalinist regime through greater cooperation and
cultural and other exchanges. The policy already has been
criticized by his conservative opposition.
	   At the border village of Panmunjom, the U.N. Command, a
signatory to the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War,
protested the alleged spy incursion at a colonel-level meeting with
North Korea.
	   The command said in a news release that its American
representative condemned the raising of military tensions on the
divided Korean Peninsula and asked North Korea to stop further
provocations.
	   The news release did not say how North Korea responded, but
South Korean officials said privately that North Korean officials
denied any knowledge or involvement in the case.
	   The command said it was seeking to hold general officer-level
talks with North Korea earlier than the scheduled July 16 meeting.
	   Meanwhile, soldiers and police, assisted by helicopter gunships,
scoured rocky mountains on South Korea's east coast for possible
intruders.
	   The search was launched after the military discovered the diving
suit-clad body and a self-propelled, semi-submersible craft capable
of carrying up to five people.
	   The 157-centimeter (4.75-foot)-long craft, powered by batteries,
was similar to ones used by North Korean infiltrators in the past.
	   ``We must be prepared for a possibility that some armed agents
could have come ashore,'' Defense Ministry spokesman Kang Jun-kwon
said.
	   After imposing a dusk-to-dawn curfew, thousands of soldiers and
police laid ambushes overnight along strategic inland access routes
on the east coast but failed to detect any traces of intruders.
	   The man's body was found washed ashore about 2 kilometers (1.25
miles) from a major naval base at Donghae, 195 kilometers (117
miles) east of Seoul.
	   Quoting military doctors, the Defense Ministry said that the
body was believed to have been dead for ``less than 24 hours.''
	   The body had no visible signs of injuries or wounds, indicating
that death was a result of heart failure, it said.
	   Found with the body were a Czech-made machine gun, a hand
grenade, a portable oxygen tank, a dagger, a radio set and a sea
map showing underwater features along South Korea's east coast.
	   It was the third North Korean infiltration reported along the
east coast, coming less than three weeks after a northern submarine
was found tangled in a fishing net on June 22.
	   Nine bodies were found in the Yugo-class sub, all shot to death
in what military investigators described as a murder-suicide
committed by senior officers to avoid capture.
	   On Sept. 18, 1996, a shark-class North Korean submarine was
found stranded in the same general area off the east coast,
touching off a 53-day manhunt for the craft's 26 occupants.
	   The manhunt by 60,000 soldiers, reservists and police left 37
people dead _ 24 North Koreans and 13 South Koreans _ and sent
relations between North and South Korea plunging to their lowest
level in years.
	   A North Korean infiltrator from that submarine was captured and
another was believed to have returned to the North across the land
border.

Italian judge throws out case against U.S. Marines in gondola

	   TRENTO, Italy (AP) _ An Italian judge on Monday dropped the case
against the crew members of a Marine jet that severed a ski gondola
cable in the Alps, leaving any decision to U.S. courts.
	   Judge Carlo Ancona ruled that Italian courts lacked
jurisdiction.
	   Trento Prosecutor Francantonio Granero had pushed for
manslaughter charges in Italy even though the Italian government
has acquiesced in American prosecution of the four crewmen. He said
he would decide on an appeal after reading the full decision, which
was expected in 15 days.
	   Twenty people were killed in the Feb. 3 accident, which set off
a crisis in U.S.-Italian relations and demands by some for a
closing of U.S. bases in Italy.
	   Monday's hearing took place just three days after a U.S. general
ordered two of the crewmen tried for manslaughter.
	   Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commander of Marine Corps Forces Atlantic,
ruled Friday that there is enough evidence for a court-martial for
Capt. Richard J. Ashby, the pilot, and Capt. Joseph P. Schweitzer,
the navigator.
	   The general dismissed charges against the two back-seat officers
on the jet.
	   The United States insisted it has sole jurisdiction in the case
because of a NATO treaty. Washington maintains the EA-6B Prowler
was flying under the auspices of NATO when it sent the ski gondola
crashing to the ground, killing 19 skiers and the gondola operator.
	   Granero argued that the plane violated the NATO treaty's
mandated flight patterns, and therefore the flight should be
considered a U.S. mission _ which would give Italy jurisdiction.
Granero also challenged the constitutionality of the NATO treaty.
	   ``We are extremely disappointed'' with the decision, said
Alberto Mioni, a lawyer for two victims from Bressanone, Italy.
	   The son of one of them, Klaus Stampfl, a 29-year-old salesman,
said he was most bothered by the ``lack of attention'' for the
victims from the United States government.
	   President Clinton publicly expressed his sorrow after the
accident, and the United States has promised to pay damages. A U.S.
delegation went to the scene last week.
	   Even if they had been indicted, it was unlikely the crew would
have come to Italy to face justice. Italian law allows defendants
to be tried in absentia.
	   Seeking the indictment, on charges of multiple manslaughter and
endangering the safety of transport, was well within Granero's
powers; Italian prosecutors have a large measure of independence.
	   The crew's Italian lawyers said the Americans were victims of a
``conflict of power'' between the government and the Italian courts
and would be unfairly subject to a ``double trial.''
	   Ancona also dropped the case against three top U.S. military
officials at the Aviano base in northern Italy, where the jet was
stationed.

	   PARIS (AP) _ From plazas to boulevards to cafes to living rooms,
from the smallest villages to the biggest cities, a single glorious
chant echoed across France: ``We are the champions!''
	   France's stunning World Cup victory over Brazil Sunday night
sent the country into a paroxysm of patriotic celebration not seen
since the Liberation.
	   ``The day of glory has arrived,'' France's national anthem goes,
and on this night the French sang it everywhere, and like they

	   As more than a million people gathered on the avenue, a panicked
driver careened out of control and plowed into a crowd of revelers,
injuring 80 people, 11 seriously.
	   The celebratory mood of the early morning hours quickly turned
into horror as dozens of ambulances and 200 rescue workers
converged on the scene. Some of the victims were treated on the
ground. None were critically injured, however, officials said.
	   The driver, a 44-year-old schoolteacher who is undergoing
psychiatric treatment, panicked and ran away from the scene, said a
source close to the investigation into the accident, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.

son who took the distraught woman to a police station in suburban
Paris where she was detained, the source said.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant Orangemen marched on
their big holiday Monday, chastened and divided by the deaths of
three boys in the violence swirling around their defiance of a
government order to avoid one Catholic neighborhood. Two men were
arrested Monday morning in connection with the sectarian killing of
the Catholic brothers. They were being questioned by police, the
Royal Ulster Constabulary said in a brief statement. Some prominent
Orangemen had called for an end to the week-long confrontation
between marchers and security forces near Portadown, following the
Sunday morning firebombing that killed the Quinn brothers, Richard,
10, Mark, 9 and Jason, 7, in their home in Ballymoney, 40 miles (60
kms) northwest of Belfast. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Dealt a stunning defeat at the polls, Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced Monday that he will resign and
acknowledged voter frustration over his failure to bring Japan out
of its deepest recession in decades. The sudden resignation threw
Japanese politics into confusion, and was for the time being almost
certain to impede efforts to pull the economy out of its worst
economic mess since World War II. Business leaders immediately
voiced concerns that a political vacuum could sidetrack reform
efforts already underway. Hashimoto grimly conceded defeat and said
he would resign after his Liberal Democratic Party won just 44
seats out of the 126 contested _ half of Parliament's upper house _
in Sunday's elections. (JAPAN-ELECTIONS)
	   PARIS (AP) _ From plazas to boulevards to cafes to living rooms,
from the smallest villages to the biggest cities, a single glorious
chant echoed across France: ``We are the champions!'' France's
stunning World Cup victory over Brazil Sunday night sent the

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After a weekend of more fighting in
Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, diplomats are searching for new ways
to stop the violence. In Bonn, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
called his Western counterparts on Sunday to share ideas he had
discussed a day earlier with Russia's Yevgeny Primakov in Moscow
the previous day, a German spokesman said. His diplomatic efforts
came amid reports that nine people had died in weekend fighting in
Kosovo.France and Britain have said they would introduce a
resolution in the U.N. Security Council threatening new measures
against the warring sides if they do not halt the fighting. Moscow
opposes using NATO military force in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
militants are fighting for independence from Serbia.
(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Striking an optimistic note, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that Israel was close to
agreement on elements of the Clinton administration's plan for a
troop withdrawal from the occupied West Bank. But the prime
minister also voiced a familiar complaint, saying Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority has not put security-related agreements into
effect. ``We have almost closed the gap with the United States
now,'' Netanyahu told a national fundraising event. ``The only
thing holding up the process is the Palestinians' refusal to comply
with commitments they have made repeatedly for five years.''
Israeli media reports have said Netanyahu would ask his inner
Cabinet later Monday to approve unspecified details of the U.S.
pullback plan. Netanyahu's top aide, David Bar-Illan, would not
confirm the report but called remaining gaps ``narrow'' and
``bridgeable.'' (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China reacted mildly Monday to Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's announced resignation, hoping any
political changes will not affect efforts to improve relations.
	   The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it had ``taken note'' of
Sunday's elections in Japan, a stunning defeat for Hashimoto's
Liberal Democratic Party that prompted his decision to resign.
	   ``We .... hope Japan's political situation will remain stable,''
the ministry said in a brief statement.
	   Hashimoto's resignation comes amid efforts by China and Japan to
strengthen relations. Japan is China's biggest trading partner and
one of its biggest investors, but their relationship is still
haunted by Japan's brutal 1931-1945 occupation of much of China.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin is expected to travel to Japan in
the fall for what Beijing hoped would mark a new beginning in often
frosty relations.
	   Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi was due in Beijing
Wednesday to prepare for Jiang's visit. But it was unclear whether
election fallout would alter his plans. Obuchi was mentioned as a
possible successor to Hashimoto.
	   The Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said that this year, the
20th anniversary of a bilateral friendship pact, marked ``an
important time for China-Japan relations to inherit the past and
continue in the future and continue broadening.''
	   ``We hope and believe that as long as the two sides work
together, further forward development in China-Japan relations can
definitely be brought about,'' the statement said.

Widespread trade in illegal small arms threatens peace, human

 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Seeking to stem the spread of small arms,
especially into tense and unstable countries, representatives of 21
countries began meeting Monday to begin a global drive on
controlling the weapons.
	   ``The great human costs of the excessive accumulation and
uncontrolled proliferation of small arms are the major reason for
our common concern,'' said Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Aslaug
Haga in opening the meeting.
	   No one know how many light weapons there are in the world, but
some experts say at least half the trade in weapons is illegal, and
in some places such as Chechnya it is sometimes cheaper and easier
to buy a gun than a loaf of bread.
	   Haga said regaining control of existing arsenals and
international sales could reduce violence and human rights abuses,
and encourage political and economic development.
	   Although the delegates could not take binding action, they were
expected to adopt a joint statement on Tuesday. They were likely to
call improved laws, record-keeping and information about weapons
sales, and the destruction of surplus weapons.
	   ``We have no illusions that this well be easy. We are addressing
a class of weapons that are important tools in the shady areas
between the legal and the illegal, between the political and the
criminal,'' said Haga.
	   A major problem, she said, is that legal arms sales can quickly
become illegal because of inadequate controls. At the end of some
conflicts, demobilized soldiers, often unemployed, sometimes keep
their weapons, increasing the risk they will use or sell them on
the black market.
	   Countries can also seek to reduce war debt by selling off
legally obtained weapons on illegal markets. And after the Cold
War, major arms producing nations cut stockpiles, with the arms
often ending up in developing countries engaged in or on the brink
of war.
	   Talks in Oslo last year resulted in the international treaty
banning land mines. Inspired by that success, Norway began a drive
to control small arms.
	   In April, Norway hosted a conference on the production of small
arms in volatile West Africa. The 13 participating nations called
for a moratorium on the small-arms trade in their countries.
	   In a letter to this week's meeting, Canadian Foreign Minister
Lloyd Axworthy, often called the father of the land mine treaty,
called for a ban on international sales of military light weapons
to anyone but national states.
	   ``These are the weapons that cause the most death and injury,''
he wrote.
	   The countries at the talks were the United States, Canada,
Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, Brazil, Mexico, Columbia, Indonesia, Japan, the
Philippines, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mozambique, South Africa and
Zimbabwe.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant Orangemen marched on
their big holiday Monday, chastened and divided by the deaths of
three boys in the violence swirling around their defiance of a
government order to avoid one Catholic neighborhood.
	   Two men were arrested Monday morning for questioning about the
firebombing that killed the Quinn brothers: Richard, 10, Mark, 9,
and Jason, 7, in their home in Ballymoney, 40 miles (60 kms)
northwest of Belfast. Their Catholic mother, Chrissy Quinn, and her
Protestant partner escaped safely.
	   Stunned by the killings, some prominent Orangemen called for an
end to the week-long confrontation between marchers and security
forces near Portadown.
	   ``After last night's attack a 15-minute walk down Garvaghy Road
by the Orange Order would be a very hollow victory because it would
be in the shadow of the coffins of three little boys who wouldn't
even know what the Orange Order is about,'' said the Rev. William
Bingham, chaplain to the Orange Order in County Armagh.
	   Last week, Bingham was one of four Orange officials who met with
Prime Minister Tony Blair pressing their demand to walk down that
road, despite the hostility of Catholic residents and an order from
the Parades Commission blocking the march.
	   The Portadown district Orange lodges defiantly declared that
their protest would continue. But they asked Orangemen from other
districts not to join them Monday in the pastures near Drumcree
Anglican church for a mass confrontation with police and British
troops.
	   David Jones, spokesman for the Portadown district Orange lodges,
noted reports that Chrissy Quinn and her family had been harassed
and threatened in the past.
	   ``It would certainly appear that even if the Orangemen had not
been at Drumcree that those murders could have still taken place,''
Jones said.
	   The Orange parade on the Lower Ormeau Road in Belfast, where
there had been violent protests in past years, passed peacefully
Monday as Catholic residents stood silently on the sidewalk..
	   Only a single muffled drum kept the beat as the Orangemen
marched past and it was so quiet you could hear the rain spattering
on the protestors' black flags improvised from plastic garbage bin
liners.
	   ``It's the only form of expression that people can give. Any
other protest would have resulted in violence,'' said local
resident Alan Kelly. He came with his 7-month-old daughter Danielle
and his wife, Angela, whose brother was shot to death by
pro-British loyalists just a few blocks away in 1988.
	   The parade was delayed for more than an hour after a telephone
caller claiming to be from the Irish National Liberation Army
warned of bombs near the Ballynafigh Orange hall. Army specialists
carried out controlled explosions to neutralize two suspicious
packages.
	   Elsewhere, a pub in Aghoghill, 25 miles (40 kms) northwest of
Belfast, was damaged in an arson attempt overnight. Police fired
plastic bullets at a crowd gathered near a holiday bonfire in the
area, and to break up a disturbance in south Belfast.
	   An Orangeman was taken to a hospital after being attacked during
a Catholic demonstration at a parade Sunday night in Keady, 40
miles (65 kms) southwest of Belfast.
	   The Orange Order has disclaimed any responsibility for the
roadblocks, attacks on homes and cars, and assaults on police and
soldiers which erupted after the march was stopped July 5. At
Drumcree, hard-liners have thrown bombs at security forces _ and
have been cheered by men wearing the orange collars of the Order.
	   The 12th of July is the biggest Orange holiday, celebrating the
defeat of the Catholic King James II by the Protestant William of
Orange at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.
	   In Ballymoney, neighbors laid flowers, teddy bears and notes of
condolence outside the blackened home. Francis Quinn said his
sister and the family had been harassed for two years.
	   ``They murdered three innocent little children. They weren't
being brought up Catholic or Protestant _ they just were three
kids,'' Francis Quinn said.
	   ``And I'm just _ full of hate,'' he said haltingly.
	   ``This last couple of years we've been terrorized ... threats,
letters, bombs through the windows, it goes on and on,'' he added.

EU foreign ministers to hear new ideas on Kosovo problem
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
said Monday he has some ``new ideas'' for resolving the Kosovo
crisis that he wants to discuss with European Union foreign
ministers.
	   The ministers, gathered here for their first meeting under the
new Austrian presidency of the EU, were faced with what Austrian
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel called the Union's ``most
pressing external policy topic.''
	   Kinkel, who was in Moscow over the weekend for talks with
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, hinted that the solution
my lie in a conference such as the one at Dayton, Ohio, that ended
the fighting in Bosnia in 1995.
	   Yugoslav security forces have been attempting to put down a
rebellion by ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo,
where they make up 90 percent of the population. Some of the
Albanians want greater autonomy for the region, others, including
the Kosovo Liberation Army, seek independence.
	   ``Last night I had a telephone conversation with (U.S. Secretary
of State) Madeleine Albright and I have brought some new ideas,''
Kinkel said as he arrived for the foreign ministers' meeting.
	   He did not immediately reveal details.
	   ``We have to think anew about several things,'' he said. ``It's
quite clear that what the EU has done so far has not brought the
success we all wanted.''
	   Schuessel said the 15-nation EU had to continue to apply
pressure in order to achieve a dialogue between the forces in the
province.
	   ``Pressure on Belgrade to fulfill the international obligations
has to be maintained,'' he said. ``On the other hand, pressure also
has to be applied to the inhabitants of Kosovo, as a growing
radicalization can be detected. Those Albanian leaders and
politicians that strive for peace have to be supported.''
	   The 16-nation NATO defense alliance is working on plans for an
eventual military intervention if diplomatic efforts fail to end
the fighting.
	   Planning involves a preventive deployment of troops along the
borders of Kosovo in neighboring Albania and Macedonia; A graduated
air campaign within Yugoslavia; and a deployment of ground troops
into Yugoslavia.
	   The emphasis in recent days, however, has swung back to
diplomatic efforts.
	   ``I think it would be appropriate to give the Russians a place
at the table,'' said Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen.
	   France and Britain say they will introduce a resolution in the
U.N. Security Council threatening new measures against the warring
sides if they do not halt the fighting. Moscow opposes using NATO
military force.
	   The six-nation Contact Group - the United States, Russia,
Germany, Britain, France and Italy - warned last week that the
sanctions now imposed on Yugoslavia could also be applied to ethnic
Albanian militants if they block a resumption of negotiations.

Bus attack leaves 10 dead in Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A gang of bandits attacked a convoy of
luxury buses in central Nigeria, killing 10 passengers and wounding
several others, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   The buses were caught in an ambush just after midnight on
Saturday along a highway near the central city of Jos, the Guardian
newspaper said. Jos is about 280 kilometers (175 miles) northeast
of the capital, Abuja.
	   The bandits opened fire on both sides of the buses as the convoy
approached a hill, a survivor was quoted as saying.
	   ``We begged them but they would not listen and continued to
shoot,'' the unidentified survivor was quoted as saying in the
Guardian.
	   Nigeria's rural roads have long been haunted by robbers and
bandits, but armed attacks are on the rise in this troubled and
seemingly lawless country.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets slumped Monday following the
Japanese governing party's defeat in parliamentary elections, with
the key index tumbling 3.4 percent in Singapore. But bucking the
trend was the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where prices rebounded after
investors decided that Japan would continue economic reforms even
after the government shakeup from Sunday's elections. The governing
Liberal Democrats won 44 of the 126 seats at stake in Sunday's
elections to the upper house, far fewer than the 69 it needed for
an outright majority and below the 61 it held previously. The key
Singapore Straits Times Industrial Index shed 37.16 points, closing
at 1,053.19. Traders said Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's resignation failed to inspire confidence in the
Singapore market. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After weeks of negotiations, Russia and the
International Monetary Fund have reached tentative agreement on a
huge bailout package designed to stabilize the country's turbulent
financial markets, a top Russian official said Monday. Russia wants
dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion, and most of the money is expected to
come from the IMF, while the World Bank and some private lenders
are also likely to contribute to the package. ``We have reached
concrete agreements to the satisfaction of both parties,'' Russia's
lead negotiator, Anatoly Chubais, told the Interfax news agency
Monday. No details were released, but Chubais and the head of the
IMF delegation, John Odling-Smee, planned a Monday afternoon news
conference to outline the deal. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim
admitted Monday that Malaysia will slip into recession this year,
confirming the worst fears of financial analysts. The gross
domestic product would contract by 1 to 2 percent in 1998, Anwar
said. Malaysia's economy contracted by 1.8 percent in this year's
first three months, compared to 6.9 percent growth in the previous
quarter. Results of the second quarter have not been announced.
Until now, the government had maintained that it would be able to
achieve GDP growth of between 2 and 3 percent for 1998. Even last
week, Anwar had said that Malaysia would have to revise its growth
target but would try to halt a slide into recession. Anwar said two
government packages totaling 12 billion ringgit (dlrs 3 billion) in
June had helped cushion the economic fall. He said there would be
more such measures. (MALAYSIA-RECESSION)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, based since its start on non-interference in each others'
internal affairs, has matured and is ready to consider more direct
involvement and criticism, an official said Monday. ``Times have
changed. After 31 years we are now adults and we should be able to
discuss our problems frankly,'' Philippine Secretary of Foreign
Affairs Domingo Siazon said. He said ASEAN foreign ministers, at a
meeting this month in Manila, will probably begin ``a major change
in ASEAN's policy from non-intervention to a more pro-active policy
of flexible engagement.'' The shift comes as Southeast Asian
countries are becoming more aware that problems in one nation _
such as currency devaluations, political unrest or haze caused by
forest fires _ often affect its neighbors. (PHILIPPINES-ASEAN)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Officials from Japan's newly established financial
industry watchdog on Monday began inspecting bad-debt burdened
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. It was the first inspection of a
Japanese bank conducted by the Financial Supervisory Agency since
its establishment in June, an agency official said. Ailing
Long-Term Credit Bank, saddled with 1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 9.86
billion) in problem loans, recently started negotiations with
Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corp., a major Japanese trust bank,
about a possible merger. Many Japanese banks are burdened with a
total of 76 trillion yen (dlrs 535 billion) in bad loans, making
them wary of extending new credit and impeding Japan's economic
recovery. The agency official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
refused to provide details on the inspection. (JAPAN-BANK

	   Last Wednesday, Berlusconi was convicted of bribing tax
inspectors and sentenced to two years and nine months in prison. In
December he was convicted in a case centering on a film company
deal and given a suspended 16-month sentence.
	   It was unlikely Berlusconi would serve the other sentences; most
prison terms under three years for white collar crimes are later
suspended.
	   Berlusconi, who heads a center-right political coalition, has
long denied the corruption charges, claiming he is the victim of a
political vendetta by left-leaning prosecutors.
	   The court also fined Berlusconi 10 billion lire (dlrs 5.6
million).
	   Craxi, who now lives in Tunisia and was tried in absentia,
received a four-year term and 20 billion lire fine (dlrs 11.2
million).
	   Prosecutors alleged that Berlusconi and his associates funneled
the illegal contributions to Craxi through a holding company called
All Iberian, and that the books of Berlusconi's businesses were
doctored to cover up the outlay.

Iranian refuses to compete with Israeli in wrestling match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A young Iranian wrestler was thrown out of a
tournament in Russia after he refused to compete with an Israeli,
the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday.
	   The Iranian, Moslem Sadeqi, was disqualified Sunday, it said.
	   The two were participating in an international contest for
competitors between the ages of 12 and 18 in Moscow, it said. The
agency did not name the Israeli wrestler or give Sadeqi's age.
	   Israel and Iran are enemies. Iran supports Palestinians living
under Israeli occupation and rejects negotiations with the Jewish
state. Israel accuses Iran of being a threat to its security.

Singapore and Indonesia sign natural gas deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Indonesia's state-owned oil company Pertamina
and Singapore's government-linked Sembawang Corp. signed an
agreement Monday for the sale of Indonesian natural gas to
Singapore.
	   According to a company statement, Sembawang will import 325
million cubic feet of natural gas per day for 22 years starting in
2001. The gas will flow via a 640-kilometer (400-mile) pipeline
from gas fields in the West Natuna Sea to Singapore.
	   Sembawang will commercially distribute the gas to power
generation, petroleum and chemical manufacturing companies in
Singapore.
	   The gas sales agreement, signed in Jakarta, is the first step in
the long-term plan to sell and deliver natural gas from Indonesia's
West Natuna Sea gas fields to Singapore, Pertamina's partner Conoco
said in a statement Monday.
	   No details on the value of the agreement were provided.

	   The case drew the attention of Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, who last week criticized Milan prosecutors for deciding,
in 1994, to serve then-Premier Berlusconi a formal notice of
investigation while he was hosting a U.N. crime conference in
Naples. Scalfaro described the move as ill-timed.
	   Scalfaro's comments have drawn criticism from anti-corruption
hero and Sen. Antonio Di Pietro, who was investigating Berlusconi
at the time while a prosecutor.
	   As president, Scalfaro is the head of the judges' governing body
and has the final authority over the judiciary.

Chechen police free hostage and arrest three kidnappers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen police manning a roadblock arrested three
suspected kidnappers and freed their businesswoman hostage, a news
agency said Monday.
	   The arrests were part of a broader law-and-order crackdown that
saw 79 people detained late Sunday and early Monday for violating a
state-of-emergency curfew in the breakaway southern province.
Police confiscated 17 submachine guns and two grenade launchers,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   At a roadblock in the capital, Grozny, police on Sunday night
arrested three men wanted for abducting a local businesswoman. The
woman was freed and the suspected kidnappers were jailed, the news
agency said, quoting police officials.
	   Most of the 79 people detained were later released after being
questioned about why that had broken the 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, who imposed a state of
emergency June 23, has ordered a restructuring of the separatist
republic's law enforcement system, a spokesman said Monday.
	   Chechnya remains a center of violent crime and frequent
kidnappings despite the end of its independence war against Russia
two years ago.
	   The state of emergency, which expires Thursday, has led to a
reduction in crime and probably will not be extended, presidential
spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev told the Interfax news agency.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Sports writers, political columnists, and even the
financial newspapers all had something to say Monday about what
victory in the World Cup means for France.
	   French media joined the nation in celebrating the the World Cup
upset with an orgy of coverage devoted to the stunning 3-0 win by
Les Bleus against Brazil.
	   ``For Eternity,'' blared the headline of the sports daily
L'Equipe, which has heaped criticism on French coach Aime Jacquet
for putting together what the newspaper considered a dull team.
	   ``It's ours,'' said the headline of the daily Le Parisien, with
a picture of an ecstatic Jacquet holding the coveted golden trophy
high over his head.
	   Pride, euphoria, glory. Those were just some of the emotions
expressed in the pages of French newspapers. Radio and TV talk
shows turned to soccer, and the winning goals were replayed _ and
replayed again and again _ on the country's main television
stations.
	   European newspapers chimed in with praise and congratulations
for the French team.
	   ``France Super, Brazil Humiliated,'' said the Corriere della
Sera daily in Milan, the Italian city where Brazilian star Ronaldo
plays. ``France can proudly raise to the heavens the first World
Cup in its history,'' said La Stampa of Turin.
	   German papers had the French victory on their front pages. ``The
French are the Soccer Kings,'' was the headline in the mass-market
Bild newspaper. But the story was overshadowed in Bild and other
German newspapers, with the news of Michael Schumacher's third
straight victory Sunday at the British Grand Prix.
	   Although more subdued, Dutch newspapers also paid tribute to the
French team. ``Vive la France. The French are the deserved champion
after trouncing Brazil,'' said De Telegraaf.
	   For some French commentators, victory went beyond sport. They
expressed hope the win will help combat racism in a country where
the right-wing National Front regularly gets 15 percent of the
vote.
	   Some of the greatest heroes of the French team, including
Sunday's two-time scorer, Zinedine Zidane, are the children of
immigrants, or were born in one of France's former colonies.
	   For Le Figaro, a conservative daily, the French victory was a
``lesson'' in ``unity'' for a nation that is now irreversibly
multiracial.
	   France stands to gain in other ways as well, according to the
financial daily Les Echos.
	   ``France's emerges with its image magnified,'' said Les Echos,
pointing out what the newspaper called the country's impeccable
organization of the World Cup impeccable.
	   Throughout the World Cup, France's superb fast trains, its
fashion and food were on display and may bring the country fresh
economic rewards.
	   Amid the euphoria, some newspapers, however, raised some
troubling issues: the persistent presence of soccer hooligans and
the dangers they pose and the problem of ticket fraud that plagued
this year's World Cup.

	   France stands to gain in other ways as well, according to the
financial daily Les Echos.
	   ``France's emerges with its image magnified,'' said Les Echos,
pointing out what the newspaper called the country's impeccable
organization of the World Cup impeccable.
	   Throughout the World Cup, France's superb fast trains, its
fashion and food were on display and may bring the country fresh
economic rewards.
	   Amid the euphoria, some newspapers, however, raised some
troubling issues: the persistent presence of soccer hooligans and
the dangers they pose and the problem of ticket fraud that plagued
this year's World Cup.

Taiwan to probe alleged exploitation of migrant workers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from labor groups, grafs 10-13 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan authorities said Monday they would
look into allegations that migrant workers are exploited by
recruiters who charge them exorbitant fees.
	   Wu Lien-pei, an official of the government Labor Council, said
refunds will be ordered if any companies are found to have
collected fees for services that they never provide.
	   ``We will look into the fees, item by item,'' Wu said. ``But
exploitation may be an overstatement. There are less conscientious
people in every trade.''
	   The comments came one day after Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said he had ordered local officials to hold talks with
Taiwanese authorities on the plight of Filipino workers in Taiwan.
	   Filipino and Thai factory workers demonstrated Friday outside
the office of the Labor Council.
	   Protesters said they were charged fees of up to 20,000 Taiwan
dollars (U.S. dlrs 570) a year for services that they never
received. For many, the fees amount to a month's pay.
	   They said job brokers threaten to have them deported if they
refuse to pay the fees.
	   There are 240,000 foreign laborers, mostly from the Philippines
or Thailand, working in factories and construction sites or as
maids in Taiwan.
	   Taiwan has imported foreign workers as wages soared in recent
years and many construction sites or factories failed to recruit
local workers.
	   The Center of Hope, set up by the Catholic Church to help the
migrant workers, said it will propose to the Taiwan government to
encourage employers to hire their workers directly.
	   Kung Yu-chen, a volunteer worker with the group, said the
recruiters have charged all their expenses to the workers rather
than splitting them with employers.
	   A Filipino worker, for instance, has to pay the recruiter about
90,000 Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 2,500) before coming to Taiwan,
she said.
	   An economic downturn has reduced job opportunities and many
workers have to return home before their two-year period of
employment expires, she said.

New film copies honor Bergman's 80th birthday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ In honor of Ingmar Bergman's 80th
birthday, the Swedish Film Institute announced Monday that it would
spend 300,000 kronor (dlrs 37,000) to make new copies of several of
his classic older films.
	   Bergman, whose birthday is Tuesday, is noted for his searching
and intense movies exploring personal and spiritual issues
	   Among the films to be released in new copies are ``The Seventh
Seal,'' ``The Silence'' and ``Scenes from a Marriage,'' the
institute said.
	   Bergman's last film was 1982's ``Fanny and Alexander'' but he
has directed several theatrical productions since then, most
recently this year's ``The Image-Makers'' at Stockholm's Royal
Dramatic Theater.

France beats Brazil at its own game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to raise number of people injured in car accident to
80. &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT DENIS, France (AP) _ It was samba soccer at its very best,
played with style and substance. Played to a rhythmic beat that
began early in the day and went on unrestrained for hours.
	   You expect such things in the World Cup final. You simply don't
expect them from France.
	   The French took every page four-time champion Brazil has written
on the world's most popular sport and rearranged them with Gallic
flair. They used Brazil's recipe of attacking, entertaining soccer
for a 3-0 rout Sunday night for their first world title, setting
off the biggest celebrations the nation has seen since World War II
ended.
	   ``This was the greatest evening of my life,'' said goalkeeper
Fabien Barthez.
	   ``It's all that we expected. It's incredible. There are no
words,'' added playmaker Zinedine Zidane.
	   The stars of the night were Zidane, the Marseille magician, and
Barthez, the bald-headed goalkeeper who looks like he could stare
shots away from the net.
	   The celebrants could be found all over Stade de France, and in
every corner of the country, from the Mediterranean to the beaches
of Normandy. Never has France had a team like this, and never have
the French displayed the passion for the sport they showed in this
tournament.
	   ``We won the final because we wanted it the most,'' French coach
Aime Jacquet said. ``It was the result of hard work. We really
worked as a team. There was good will and friendship between all of
us.
	   ``We played better and better because we had confidence and we
proved we had great players.''
	   While the French players stormed the field at the end, the
population streamed into the streets to honor the heroes, the first
host to win it all since Argentina in 1978.
	   ``We are all so happy, that's the least we can say,'' French
President Jacques Chirac said. ``What is the most incredible thing
tonight is that we have an impression each and every French citizen
has won this Cup.''
	   They certainly wanted to share in it. Young fans hung out of
cars hours after the game, waving flags, saluting each other and
their team. One kid, no more than 7 or 8, sat on a man's lap and
slowly drove, while in the backseat other youngsters reached out to
touch the people in the automobile in the next lane.
	   Unfortunately, things got a little carried away in Paris when an
apparently panicked driver zigzagged down the Champs Elysees, where
a million people gathered to party. The female driver plowed into a
group of fans, injuring about 80, 11 seriously.
	   On the field after the conquest of mighty Brazil, which was
seeking an unprecedented fifth world title, but instead put on a
dismal performance, Barthez kneeled in prayer in front of his net,
tears flowing down his cheeks. Zidane kissed every teammate he
could get near, while others lay on the field, kicking their legs
in the air in delirious joy.
	   Then all of the winners gathered arm in arm and jumped up and
down, hands in the air, inviting their countrymen to join along.
They had carried the weight of a nation's expectations for five
weeks, and now they wanted to haul their countrymen right up into
the stands to collect the Jules Rimet Trophy.
	   ``When I took the field,'' Barthez said, ``I said to myself,
`Tonight, you'll be the world champion.' I've known we could be the
world champs for some time.''
	   But they were underdogs Sunday, even at home. After all, this
was Brazil, which long ago combined the flow of the samba with the
intricacies of top-level soccer.
	   Except this was a Brazilian team unlike any other. It was flat,
a bit dispirited by a pregame injury to two-time world player of
the year Ronaldo. Although he started, he never was a factor.
	   ``We didn't manage to respond,'' captain Dunga said. ``France
was the better team.''
	   It didn't seem that way for much of the tournament. Although
France won all seven games, it needed almost all of overtime to
beat Paraguay in the second round. And it went to a shootout
against Italy in the quarterfinals after a 0-0 tie. Its win over
Croatia in the semifinals left doubts, too.
	   Zidane erased them early.
	   The son of Algerian immigrants, Zidane turned the nation's hopes
into magnificent reality with one of the best performances in World
Cup finals history. He scored twice on headers _ his first goals of
a tournament he began by getting suspended for two games. By the
time Emmanuel Petit made it 3-0 in the final seconds, the French
festival had begun.
	   ``I badly wanted to score at least one goal in this World Cup
and I only had the final left to do it,'' Zidane said. ``It's the
most important match of my life.''
	   And certainly the most memorable.
	   Zidane's first score came off a mistake by Roberto Carlos, who
conceded a corner kick when he couldn't clear the ball along the
right sideline. Petit's kick found the head of Zidane, who climbed
over defender Leonardo to send it home.
	   Zidane also set up a breakaway for Stephane Guivarc'h on which
goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel barely got his hand on the shot.
Moments later, Youri Djorkaeff's corner kick was headed by Zidane
between the legs of Roberto Carlos and into the net to make it 2-0.
	   ``I was so hungry to score a World Cup goal that I made it
two,'' he said.
	   The French secured their place in the pantheon of great teams by
throttling the defending champions. France did it in its first
tournament appearance since 1986 _ when it eliminated Brazil in a
quarterfinal shootout. And it won despite being a man down for the
last 22 minutes after defender Marcel Desailly was ejected for
rough play.
	   Brazil won its titles in 1958, 1962, 1970 and four years ago.
Its only previous loss in the final came at home in 1950 to
Uruguay.
	   But that game was close. This one never was.
	   ``The whole nation was behind France,'' Brazil coach Mario
Zagallo said. ``The fifth title will have to be some other time.
This wasn't our day. France was better.''
	   And finally, nearly 70 years after Rimet, a Frenchman, devised
the World Cup, its home is in France.
	   ``All that I know is that the Cup will stay in France for the
next four years,'' said Zidane, who made very sure of it.

Week-old baby, mother and grandparents die in fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CUDWORTH, England (AP) _ Fire swept through a home in northern
England early Monday killing a week-old baby, her mother and
grandparents.
	   The baby's 20-year-old father and his 22-year-old brother
escaped through an upstairs window and were taken to hospital
suffering from the effects of smoke inhalation, South Yorkshire
police said. One had slight injuries.
	   The victims were not immediately identified.
	   A neighbor called emergency services reporting an explosion at
the three-bedroom attached home in the village of Cudworth, about
170 miles (270 kms) northwest of London. But divisional fire
officer Kevin Govier said what sounded like an explosion could have
been the crackling of the blaze itself.
	   ``At the moment we don't know what caused the fire,'' he said.
``When the crews arrived the fire was very bad. Flames were coming
out of the window and the whole property was involved, so it was
very difficult for them to get in. It has gutted the house.''
	   An investigation has been launched, he said.
	   Rescue workers tried unsuccessfully to get to the trapped family
members.
	   ``I couldn't get in because the heat was so fierce,'' said
Sergeant Pat Casserly of the South Yorkshire police, the first
officer at the scene. ``I tried to contact the people inside by
banging on the wall but I could get no response. The heat was so
intense that the light fittings on a car outside melted. The scene
was horrendous.''
	   John Hyde, a fireman from nearby Barnsley, said the temperatures
in the house was over 1,500 degrees Centigrade (2,732 degrees
Farenheit).
	   ``It took us a long time to get through the front doorway,'' he
said. ``It seems there was a flashback and a lot of heat was sent
spiraling upstairs. One person was found downstairs near the back
door, another was found in a front bedroom and another and the
child were found in the back bedroom.
	   ``I've been with the fire service for 22 years and this is
certainly one of the most horrendous incidents I have ever had to
deal with. The house is extensively damaged and there's not a
window left,'' he said.

Poor women of ex-Soviet Union lured into sex slavery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY113,115-117 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, thousands
of women seeking to escape poverty have been recruited to work as
prostitutes abroad. Israel is one of the hubs of the sex trade, and
women lured into the work tell stories of modern-day slavery.
	   ___
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In St. Petersburg, the young woman had
nothing. She wanted out; she wanted adventure and she wanted money.
The advertisement she answered in a Russian newspaper said simply:
``Women needed, good money.''
	   She knew before she left Russia that the job meant prostitution.
She says she was promised easy work, good pay, travel.
	   But when the 20-year-old with gray-blue eyes and pale round face
landed in February with forged documents arranged by the
prostitution ring, she was immediately taken to an apartment and
locked inside.
	   Customers began arriving immediately, quickly building to about
20 a day, but she says she never saw any money. An elderly man
regularly dropped off food and condoms.
	   ``I couldn't leave the house,'' she said in an interview at Neve
Tirza Prison. ``I was told that if I left, the police would come
after me.''
	   She did not want her name used, fearing retribution from her
pimps even though she has been in jail awaiting deportation since
being picked up in a March police raid on her brothel.
	   Stories about sex slavery began surfacing shortly after the mass
immigration of Soviet Jews to Israel began in 1989 and eventually
brought nearly 800,000 newcomers to Israel.
	   Israel was an easy target for Russian-based crime gangs, which
used the influx of immigrants as a cover for sneaking in an
estimated 10,000 prostitutes over the past decade.
	   The sex trade quickly grew into a dlrs 450 million-a-year
business in Israel. ``It's a neighborhood grocery store that turned
into a huge chain,'' said Esther Elam of the Israel Women's
Network, a non-profit group.
	   A former police commissioner, Assaf Hefetz, said massage parlors
and backroom brothels have served as seedbeds for Russian-based
gangs trying to take root in Israel.
	   Such gangs already pour dlrs 4 billion into Israel each year,
much of it in money-laundering schemes, and could try to buy
control of politicians, judges and bankers if Israel is not
vigilant, Hefetz said.
	   Earlier this year, a Russian immigrant businessman admitted he
tried to bribe top Israeli politicians and was sentenced to six
years in jail.
	   ``There is the start of a Russian mafia here, and the
infrastructure exists on which it can grow,'' Hefetz said.
	   Tens of thousands of eastern European and Russian women are
believed to have been recruited by prostitution rings for work in
Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.
	   In April 1997, the European Union adopted new guidelines aimed
at eradicating the illegal trade in women. Under the regulations,
foreign prostitutes would not be deported automatically, to give
them time to report offenses against them and testify against their
pimps.
	   But Israel is not part of the EU and has not adopted the
guidelines
	   In Israel, few pimps are caught and even fewer serve time. In
1996, 150 men were arrested on charges of pimping, soliciting and
operating brothels, but only 21 cases went to trial and there were
no convictions. Most cases ended with a plea bargain and fines or
community service.
	   Although in jail, arrested prostitutes live in fear of gang
bosses they have never seen. When asked by a reporter about her
employers, the St. Petersburg woman stared at the wall of her cell
and shook her head, refusing to answer.
	   ``We're too afraid,'' said her cellmate, a slightly worn-looking
23-year-old from Chisinau, Moldova. ``They could get us afterwards
_ maybe not here, but back home.''
	   She said she was a broke, unemployed medical masseuse when she
answered a newspaper ad last winter. Three men and a woman prepared
her for her February trip to Israel.
	   ``They told me to dress modestly and not to wear make-up. They
told me to tell officials at the airport that I was visiting a sick
aunt. They gave me a fake address and phone number to memorize, in
case anyone asked me,'' she said.
	   She worked for two weeks out of an apartment before being taken
to a brothel with three other women. She had her own room and
shared a communal bathroom. Work began at noon and ended around 3
a.m.
	   Two guards took money at the door from clients, and she never
saw her bosses.
	   In Moldova, she was told her employers would keep the first dlrs
6,000 of her earnings to cover the cost of bringing her to Israel.
	   ``But once I arrived in Israel, the terms changed,'' she said.
``I was told that I had to work off the first dlrs 25,000. After
that I could work on my own, but I still had to pay them dlrs 1,000
each month.''
	   She was picked up by police just a month after arriving and
ordered deported. But like most of the other 84 prostitutes
awaiting deportation at Neve Tirza, she doesn't have the money for
a ticket home.
	   Unlike many countries, Israel does not pay airfare for
deportees. However, with the number of illegal workers ordered
deported rising, the government recently announced it would try to
work out payment deals with those awaiting deportation or share
costs with their home countries.
	   ``I called my sister to tell her I was in Israel, but I couldn't
tell her I was in jail,'' the St. Petersburg woman said. ``My
family is poor; they can't buy me anything.''

Small bomb outside Palestinian headquarters injures one
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 2, 9 with Palestinian statement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian man was slightly injured Monday
when a small bomb went off near the PLO's unofficial headquarters
in east Jerusalem, the police said.
	   No group immediately claimed responsibility and police were
still investigating. But the Palestinians blamed extremists and
what they called an atmosphere of incitement against Palestinian
institutions in the divided city.
	   The small explosive device was planted in a trash can about 30
meters (yards) outside the Palestinian complex known as Orient
House, police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said.
	   Police chief Yair Yitzhaki said preliminary tests indicated no
connection between this bomb and others set off in Arab areas of
Jerusalem this year. He said the device was too small to have
caused much damage.
	   The bomb squad briefly cordoned off the area to search for
evidence and collect debris. The injured man, a 40-year-old
Palestinian from east Jerusalem, suffered leg and head cuts
described as light.
	   Israel has complained that the Palestinian Authority is
violating autonomy accords by having offices in the city's disputed
eastern sector. The accords allow the Palestinians to run
government offices only in the West Bank and Gaza, pending
negotiations on Jerusalem's final status.
	   In the past, Orient House has been the scene of angry protests
by right-wing Israelis demanding its shutdown.
	   The Palestinians describe the complex as the seat of their
future government in east Jerusalem, which they claim as their
capital. Israel, though, claims sovereignty over all Jerusalem.
	   Orient House, in a statement issued by its press office, called
the explosion ``a deliberate act committed by extremists who want
to send the region back to days of confrontation and bloodshed.''
	   The city's eastern sector was annexed by Israel, which captured
it from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.

	   TRAM KOK, Cambodia (AP) _ Two weeks before Cambodians are
scheduled to vote, opposition politician Sam Rainsy said Monday the
election will be ``a farce'' aimed at legitimizing power seized by
strongman Hun Sen in a coup last year.
	   Hun Sen's ruling party will ``artificially'' win a majority in
the July 26 polls, even though, if the elections were free and
fair, ``the majority of the people in Cambodia would vote for
change,'' Sam Rainsy said after addressing about 500 supporters at
a rally 90 kilometers (56 miles) southeast of Phnom Penh.
	   Sam Rainsy also reported a series of threats against organizers
of his Sam Rainsy Party in the western province of Pursat, and
called for the National Election Committee to investigate.
	   Two party activists were told by soldiers last Tuesday to ``stop
working for the Sam Rainsy Party right away or you will die,'' said
a statement from his party. Another received a note at his front
door on Saturday that said, ``Gang leader who raises membership for
SRP, I shoot to kill.''
	   Following a political rally led by Sam Rainsy in the province's
Ampoeu Mean district, a police chief demanded a list of the names
of all people who attended, along with their thumbprints, the
statement also said.
	   The elections are the first since last July's coup, when Hun Sen
ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his co-prime minister,
shattering a tense dual premiership formed after U.N.-sponsored
elections in 1993.
	   There has been widespread criticism that Hun Sen has stacked the
official electoral bodies in his favor, denied the opposition equal
access to the media and used intimidation and violence in an effort
to ensure he wins.
	   There have been at least six politically motivated killings in
the past six weeks, according to human rights workers.
	   Sam Rainsy said that many people have been intimidated from
coming to his rallies by local authorities loyal to Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party.
	   He predicted that Hun Sen's party would win 70 of the 122 seats
in the National Assembly; a coalition of parties that support Hun
Sen would win 15 to 20 seats; and that his and Prince Ranariddh's
FUNCINPEC party would win the remaining 40 seats.
	   ``I am looking beyond the elections,'' Sam Rainsy told
reporters, adding that he was using the campaign as an opportunity
to meet the people and raise his political profile.
	   ``I am building an alternative after the election to the present
communist regime,'' he said.
	   Hun Sen's pre-1993 government was a single-party communist
state.
	   Supporters waving blue flags with the Sam Rainsy Party's logo _
a single candle _ shouted ``Bravo! Bravo!'' as he arrived at the
pagoda in Tram Kok village and in an hour-long speech began
attacking Hun Sen's government as ``communist'' and backed by
Vietnam.
	   Hun Sen is identified by many Cambodians with the decade-long
Vietnamese occupation that followed Hanoi's invasion in 1979, which
ousted the genocidal Khmer Rouge from power. The government in
which Hun Sen served was set up and protected by the Vietnamese.
	   Sam Rainsy and Ranariddh have both tried to use the widespread
hatred of Vietnam, Cambodia's traditional enemy, as a way to win
votes.
	   ``We must regard the Khmer people as the boss, not the Yuon as
the boss,'' Sam Rainsy told the crowd. ``I surely believe
Cambodians will vote for Cambodians, not for the Yuon puppet.''
	   Yuon is a derogatory word for Vietnamese.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A car plowed into a group of fans celebrating
France's World Cup victory early Monday, injuring 80 people, 11 of
them seriously, hospital officials said.
	   The accident occurred as the capital exploded in joy after
France beat Brazil for the championship. At least a million people
streamed to the Champs-Elysees to celebrate.
	   A woman zigzagging down the avenue from the Arc de Triomphe in a
black Volkswagen plowed into the partying fans, injuring 80 _ 11
seriously, officials said. None was critically injured.
	   ``Apparently it was a crazy car, which drove for several dozen
meters (yards), knocking over people on its way,'' said Cmdr.
Philippe Lavoil, a rescue official. Two hundred rescue workers in
dozens of ambulances arrived to treat the victims.
	   Helmeted riot police lined the avenue, keeping diehard revelers
and curiosity-seekers at bay.
	   The driver was attacked by the crowd before police intervened,
according to witnesses. The car was seen lying on its side.
	   The driver ``has fled but has been identified,'' Lavoil said. A
police investigation was immediately opened.
	   Later, a source close to the investigation, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the driver was a 44-year-old
schoolteacher who is undergoing psychiatric treatment.
	   The woman driver, whose identity was not provided, panicked and
fled the scene of the accident on foot, said the source.
	   After wandering around Paris for several hours, the driver
called her son who took the distraught woman to a police station in
suburban Paris where she was detained about 8 a.m. (0600 GMT), the
source said.
	   Earlier reports suggested she may have been drunk could not be
confirmed.
	   Witnesses said the woman dragged some people for several meters
(yards) after hitting them.
	   One witness, Stephan Gueroui, 24, said he'd seen the car coming
down the Champs-Elysees the wrong way, then veered diagonally
across the avenue.
	   ``A car was coming down the Champs-Elysees in the wrong
direction,'' he said. ``It hit a group who was crossing.''
	   His face was swollen and bleeding. He said he'd been caught in a
brawl and gotten hit with a can.

Portuguese train services crippled by national rail strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Rail workers Monday staged their fourth
one-day strike in two months, paralyzing national train services
and causing major rush-hour traffic jams in major cities.
	   The state rail company, Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses,
contracted over 300 buses to replace the trains, adding to the long
traffic jams clogging suburban routes, especially in Lisbon and the
second-largest city, Oporto, as more people were forced to use road
transport.
	   The strike was called by the Federation of Rail Workers' Unions
to demand increased productivity bonuses and better working
conditions for employees in charge of safety and signaling
operations.
	   Federation spokesman Jose Manuel Oliveira claimed that more than
95 percent of the union's 13,500 members stayed away from work. The
rail company had no figures for the number of striking employees.
	   Rail company spokesman Pedro Vaz said the two sides failed to
reach agreement in talks last week. He said the strikes, which also
halted freight trains, were hurting the debt-laden company.
	   The railroad is being broken up into two separate companies
covering rail infrastructure and train services in a bid to reduce
its debts, estimated at more than 200 billion escudos (dlrs 1.1
billion), and to prepare the company for privatization.

Hong Kong's economy likely to shrink throughout the year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's economy will shrink throughout the
year and unemployment will continue to rise, a prominent economist
said Monday.
	   Gross domestic product will likely shrink 2 percent this year,
said Ian Perkins, chief economist for Hong Kong's General Chamber
of Commerce. Unemployment, currently at a 15-year high of 4.2
percent, could easily increase by another 0.6 percentage points or
more, Perkins told a Rotary Club luncheon.
	   Perkins predicted a flat economy for 1999 as well, saying growth
may be no more than 1 percent.
	   After resisting Asia's downturn for months, Hong Kong saw its
economy shrink by 2 percent in the first quarter of 1998. Many
analysts and business leaders predicted continued contraction into
the second quarter, which ended June 30. Figures are not out yet,
but a second quarter of economic shrinkage would technically put
Hong Kong in recession.
	   Another 70,000-80,000 people may lose their jobs before the year
is out, Perkins said. He said, however, that unemployment may ease
toward the year's end as the economy picks up a bit.
	   Perkins said that despite the increase in the unemployment rate,
fewer people were actually entering the labor force. Compared to a
6 percent growth in the labor force last year, only 3-4 percent
have entered this year.
	   ``People are just not entering labor force,'' Perkins said.
	   The government has presented three economic packages since early
June, which include pushing forward public infrastructure projects,
a freeze in government land auctions, and additional credit for
small- and medium-size businesses _ traditionally the backbone of
Hong Kong's economy.
	   Economists, business leaders and political parties from across
Hong Kong's spectrum all have said they doubted whether the program
was enough.
	   Legislators buried differences last week and overwhelmingly
backed an aggressive economic stimulus package with deeper tax cuts
and fee reductions than the government has proposed. The move
presented Hong Kong's post-handover government with its first
meaningful opposition.
	   ``The Hong Kong government can do very little more to improve
the economic situation, beyond what it has already done,'' Perkins
said. ``The packages are limited in scope and were cobbled very
quickly.''
	   In a volatile session Monday, Hong Kong stocks were dragged down
by more regional worries _ this time about the stability of Japan's
government and its currency.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator for blue chips,
fell below 8,000 points before rebounding slightly at the market's
close. The index ended down 106.57 points, or 1.3 percent, at
8,099.20.
	   A slowdown in trade and external investments in China, the
current regional crisis, and a probable correction in the United
States also will dampen Hong Kong's growth, Perkins said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces battling
separatist Kosovo Albanians shelled villages southwest of Pristina
on Monday, killing two people and leaving others wounded or
fleeing, ethnic Albanians reported.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said Pecan and two other villages
45 kilometers (28 miles) southwest of Pristina were shelled. Beside
the two dead, identified by name, 12 others were wounded, said the
center, which is close to Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   The shelling, plus Serb sniping in nearby Suva Reka village,
triggered an exodus of ethnic Albanians from the region, said the
center. There was no independent confirmation of the report.
	   The newest outbreak left a total of 12 people reported dead over
three days.
	   France and Britain have said they would introduce a resolution
in the U.N. Security Council threatening new measures against the
warring sides if they do not halt the fighting. Moscow opposes
using NATO military force in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
militants are fighting for independence from Serbia.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-1 in Kosovo, are seeking
independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Hundreds of people have been killed since February when Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on Albanian
separatists who had been attacking Serb police and military
facilities.

Weekend clashes kill 18 Tamil rebels, says military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE: Sri Lankan military censors made minor changes in
this story.
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Naval gunboats attacked a Tamil
guerrilla sea convoy in northeastern Sri Lanka over the weekend,
killing at least nine rebels and destroying three boats carrying
ammunition, the military said Monday.
	   The naval gunboats intercepted the rebel boats off Trincomalee
district, 240 kilometers (150 miles) northeast of Colombo, on
Saturday night.
	   In a statement faxed to news agencies in New Delhi, the Tamil
Tiger rebels said they killed five government fighters in the
Trincomalee clash and claimed no guerrillas were killed. No
independent account was possible because the government bars
reporters form the front.
	   Another nine guerrillas were shot and killed in two other
clashes with government forces elsewhere in Sri Lanka on Sunday,
the military statement said.
	   Army snipers hiding in jungles near Mankulam, a town 245
kilometers (153 miles) north of Colombo, shot and killed five
guerrillas on Sunday, the statement said. The statement added four
rebels were killed by the military in a jungle ambush in eastern
Batticaloa district, 220 kilometers (135 miles) east of Colombo.
	   There were no military casualties in the three the weekend
clashes, the statement said.
	   The guerrillas are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils, saying they are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese, who dominate the government and military.

Men terrorize woman with snakes to rob her
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Muggers with snakes are terrorizing
women in downtown New Delhi, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   In the latest incident Saturday, the Times of India said, three
men with snakes draped over their necks and arms surrounded a
three-wheeled taxi and started thrusting the snakes toward the
passenger. The passenger, Roshni, handed over money and jewelry and
the trio ran away.
	   Roshni, who uses one name only, said the experience was
traumatizing.
	   ``Those bloodshot eyes and the snakes slithering all around keep
coming back to me,'' she was quoted as telling the Times.
	   Police say the same men have attacked several other women, the
Times reported. It was unclear what snake species the robbers have
used.
	   Cobras and other snakes swaying as street performers play flute
music are a common sight in India.

China to import 200,000 tons of rice from Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China has agreed to import 200,000
metric tons of rice from Thailand, despite adopting a ban earlier
this year on imports of the grain, a Thai trade official said
Monday.
	   China has already imported some of the rice and may consider
further purchases after the quota is fulfilled, said Pracha
Charutrakulchai, director general of the Department of Foreign
Trade
	   He added that most of the rice coming under the quota is
higher-priced fragrant rice.
	   China banned imports of rice after domestic production
outstripped demand for the past three years, leaving massive stocks
for export.
	   China agreed to keep importing rice and other commodities from
Thailand after Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thailand's deputy prime
minister and commerce minister, visited there in April.
	   During that visit, Supachai asked Chinese Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji to continue importing Thai goods, especially rice, to help
boost Thai export earnings.
	   Thailand is currently in the midst of a recession.
	   Pracha was part of an official Thai delegation led by Interior
Minister Sanan Kajornprasart that visited China July 3-9.
	   Pracha said China is also likely to import more rubber from
Thailand, and Chinese officials are now negotiating the deal with
Thailand's Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives.
	   Thai Deputy Agriculture and Cooperative Minister Somchai
Soonthornvat said last Friday that Thailand and China had agreed in
principle for Thailand to send China 40,000-50,000 tons of
government stockpile rubber under a counter trade scheme in which
China would provide Thailand with fertilizer of the same value.
	   However, the counter-trade deal would not be finalized until
Thailand can examine samples of the fertilizers, he said.
	   Thailand's existing rubber stockpile stands at 50,000-60,000
tons.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Lawmakers opposed to a proposal
reserving 33 percent of seats in parliament for women stalled the
bill from being introduced in parliament Monday with rowdy protest,
domestic news agencies reported.
	   Members of the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal
party, which represent lower castes and Muslims, say they won't let
the bill be considered unless it includes quotas within the quota
for the minorities they represent.
	   Other parties in the governing coalition are unwilling to make
the changes. If they can get the bill introduced, they believe they
can pass it with the help of opposition parties.
	   Women's organizations supporting the bill were furious with the
delays and said they will protest themselves.
	   S.A. Lalitha, coordinator of the Joint Women's Program, said the
speaker should eject members who are disrupting parliament so the
bill could be introduced. She said women would be willing to
consider the amendments being suggested, but only once the proposal
had been submitted for debate.
	   As soon as parliament opened Monday morning, SP and RJD
lawmakers stormed to the front of the house shouting slogans
against the bill. Supporters of the bill shouted back, and the
bedlam forced the speaker to adjourn the house. Two more attempts
to convene later in the day also failed amid shouting.
	   It was unclear if the bill would be introduced Monday.
	   The bill, meant to increase women's participation in India's
democracy, was first introduced in 1996 by a previous government,
but met with similar opposition and never came to a vote. Women
leaders accused men in parliament of being unwilling to surrender
any control.
	   Despite Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's assurances of
getting the bill passed, it is uncertain whether it will come to a
vote this time.

China may expand elections to the township level: official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China may broaden local elections to the township
level, but only after it has standardized current polling practices
in villages, the official China Daily reported Monday.
	   The newspaper, quoting the Civil Affairs Ministry official in
charge of local elections, Zhang Mingliang, gave no time frame for
expanding the polls.
	   China began experimenting with elections for village leaders in
the 1980s. But the newspaper noted that election practices now vary
widely across the country, and the Civil Affairs Ministry is
revising current law to promote standardization.
	   About 40 percent of villages need to improve the way elections
are held, including how voters are registered and overall polling
supervision, the newspaper quoted Zhang, head of the ministry's
department of basic level government, as saying.
	   Once uniform conditions for those polls are in place, direct
elections could be held at the next-highest level of government,
the township, the report quoted Zhang as saying.
	   Since 1987, China has allowed its 900 million farmers _
three-quarters of the population _ to elect officials in 930,000
villages. Elected village committees decide how public money is
spent and implement national policies like restricting families to
one or two children.

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Silvio Berlusconi, the media baron and
Italian opposition leader, was convicted Monday of corruption in
yet another legal setback to the former premier.
	   A Milan court sentenced him to two years, four months in prison
for making illegal contributions in 1991 to the Socialist Party of
ex-Premier Bettino Craxi.
	   Last Wednesday, Berlusconi was convicted of bribing tax
inspectors and sentenced to two years and nine months in prison. In
December he was convicted in a case centering on a film company
deal and given a suspended 16-month sentence.
	   It was unlikely Berlusconi would serve the other sentences; most
prison terms under three years for white collar crimes are later
suspended.
	   Berlusconi, who heads a center-right political coalition, has
long denied the corruption charges, claiming he is the victim of a
political vendetta by left-leaning prosecutors.
	   As in the previous cases, Berlusconi's political allies in the
center-right Freedom Alliance coalition rallied around their leader
and denounced the verdict as a political attack.
	   ``Berlusconi knows he can count like never before on the strong
solidariety of all his allies,'' said Pierferdinando Casini, leader
of a small centrist party.
	   The court also fined Berlusconi 10 billion lire (dlrs 5.6
million).
	   Craxi, who now lives in Tunisia and was tried in absentia,
received a four-year term and 20 billion lire fine (dlrs 11.2
million).
	   ``The massacre continues: another `special trial' with the
decision already decided even before it begins,'' Craxi was quoted
as saying by the ANSA news agency.
	   Prosecutors alleged that Berlusconi and his associates funneled
the illegal contributions to Craxi through a holding company called
All Iberian, and that the books of Berlusconi's businesses were
doctored to cover up the outlay.
	   Investigators said the payments through All Iberian totaled dlrs
6.6 million.
	   Craxi was a friend to Berlusconi during the go-go 1980s in
Milan, and reportedly gave him political backing as Berlusconi
built up his television empire into the only rival to the state
broadcasting system.
	   Craxi was one of the most prominent of the once-powerful
political figures brought down by the wave of corruption
investigations starting in 1992 known as ``Clean Hands.'' He has
been convicted at least five times for corruption.

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban religious militia said
Monday it was continuing its march on opposition strongholds in
northern Afghanistan after capturing the strategic northwestern
province of Faryab.
	   Contacted by satellite telephone at the Taliban headquarters in
southern Kandahar province, Mullah Abdul Muttmayan said his troops
were heading toward neighboring Jozjan province and its capital of
Shebergan, the headquarters of opposition leader Rashid Dostum.
	   Still about 100 kilometers (60 miles) away, Muttmayan said his
soldiers took another 25 kilometers (15 miles) of enemy territory
in heavy fighting throughout the night and early on Monday.
	   Opposition casualties were high he said.
	   ``There are a lot of dead bodies around the fighting area,''
said Muttmayan. ``We don't know the exact number, but we can say a
lot.''
	   Western sources, who didn't want to be identified, also
confirmed the Taliban's capture of Faryab province.
	   Meanwhile an opposition spokesman, who also was contacted by
satellite telephone at his headquarters in northern Afghanistan,
said his troops have launched a counter offensive.
	   The assault, according to Shamsulhaq Arianfar, was launched
against Taliban soldiers inside the Faryab provincial capital of
Maimana.
	   On Sunday night Arianfar said his troops still were in control
of Maimana, but on Monday he said the Taliban army was inside the
capital and in control.
	   Meanwhile, Muttmayan said the Taliban also captured two of
Dostum's generals, identified only as Hashim and Yusuf.
	   The offensive which began early on Saturday is the biggest push
by Taliban soldiers in northern Afghanistan since May 1996 when
they were routed from northern Mazar-e-Sharif and thousands of
their soldiers captured and killed.
	   Muttmayan said the big breakthrough for the Taliban came late on
Saturday when they crashed through the opposition's front line.
	   ``When they lost their front line, they lost their morale,'' he
said. ``Most of the people joined the Taliban and that was the big
reason why we advanced so quickly.''
	   The anti-Taliban alliance, which rules in about 15 percent of
Afghanistan, is a collection of small groups which largely
represent the country's minority ethnic groups.
	   Led by Dostum, a former communist general and ousted Kabul
military chief Ahmed Shah Massood, the opposition is trying to stop
the Taliban from consolidating its hold on the entire country and
imposing its brand of strict Islamic laws.
	   Fighting also was reported in northern Kunduz province where the
Taliban control the capital city and most of the countryside.

German electronics giant opens office in Cambodia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The German electrical engineering
and electronics giant Siemens AG opened an office Monday in a sign
of business confidence in Cambodia ahead of national elections July
26.
	   Wolfgang Kitz, head of the Phnom Penh office, told a news
conference that Siemens will explore opportunities in
communications, health, information, transportation and household
appliances but has not decided how much to invest.
	   ``To be present even before the elections shows our confidence
in your country because we believe everything will be smooth and
that Cambodia has a promising future,'' Kitz said.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen deposed Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his
co-prime minister in a bloody coup one year ago. Hun Sen has called
new polls that opponents say have been rigged in his favor, but
many investors hope new elections will bring stability.
	   Siemens has head offices in Berlin and Munich and has annual
revenues that exceed dlrs 63 billion.

EU foreign ministers to hear new ideas on Kosovo problem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos BRU101-105
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
said Monday he has some ``new ideas'' for resolving the Kosovo
crisis that he wants to discuss with European Union foreign
ministers.
	   The ministers, gathered here for their first meeting under the
new Austrian presidency of the EU, were faced with what Austrian
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel called the Union's ``most
pressing external policy topic.''
	   Kinkel, who was in Moscow over the weekend for talks with
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, hinted that the solution
may lie in a conference such as the one at Dayton, Ohio, that ended
the fighting in Bosnia in 1995.
	   Yugoslav security forces have been attempting to put down a
rebellion by ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo,
where they make up 90 percent of the population. Some of the
Albanians want greater autonomy for the region, others, including
the Kosovo Liberation Army, seek independence.
	   ``Last night I had a telephone conversation with (U.S. Secretary
of State) Madeleine Albright and I have brought some new ideas,''
Kinkel said as he arrived for the foreign ministers' meeting.
	   He did not immediately reveal details.
	   ``We have to think anew about several things,'' he said. ``It's
quite clear that what the EU has done so far has not brought the
success we all wanted.''
	   Schuessel said the 15-nation EU had to continue to apply
pressure in order to achieve a dialogue between the forces in the
province.
	   ``Pressure on Belgrade to fulfill the international obligations
has to be maintained,'' he said. ``On the other hand, pressure also
has to be applied to the inhabitants of Kosovo, as a growing
radicalization can be detected. Those Albanian leaders and
politicians that strive for peace have to be supported.''
	   The 16-nation NATO defense alliance is working on plans for an
eventual military intervention if diplomatic efforts fail to end
the fighting.
	   Planning involves a preventive deployment of troops along the
borders of Kosovo in neighboring Albania and Macedonia; A graduated
air campaign within Yugoslavia; and a deployment of ground troops
into Yugoslavia.
	   The emphasis in recent days, however, has swung back to
diplomatic efforts.
	   ``I think it would be appropriate to give the Russians a place
at the table,'' said Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen.
	   France and Britain say they will introduce a resolution in the
U.N. Security Council threatening new measures against the warring
sides if they do not halt the fighting. Moscow opposes using NATO
military force.
	   The six-nation Contact Group - the United States, Russia,
Germany, Britain, France and Italy - warned last week that the
sanctions now imposed on Yugoslavia could also be applied to ethnic
Albanian militants if they block a resumption of negotiations.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ After capturing a key northwestern

on its opponents' northern strongholds, a senior official said.

Korea's Cheil Jedang sells DreamWorks stake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's leading food-processing
company, Cheil Jedang, said Monday it has sold a 17 percent stake
in U.S. movie company DreamWorks SKG for dlrs 170 million.
	   The deal will increase the share of DreamWorks held by Paul
Allen, co-founder of the U.S. computer giant Microsoft, to 67
percent and decrease Cheil Jedang's share to 13 percent, company
officials said.
	   Despite the selloff, Cheil Jedang is still the second largest
stockholder and its participation in DreamWorks SKG's management
and distribution rights in the Asian market remain unchanged, they
said.
	   Cheil Jedang attributed the selloff to the economic crisis
gripping South Korea. Many South Korean companies are shedding
assets and overseas businesses to deal with a cash crunch caused by
high interest rates.
	   DreamWorks was founded in 1995 with Cheil Jedang, Paul Allen,
Steven Spielberg and two other investors. It produced ``The
Peacemaker'' in 1997 and ``Deep Impact'' and the new film ``Saving
Private Ryan'' in 1998.

Prosecutors request up to five years in prison for ex-spy agents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Prosecutors on Monday demanded prison
terms of up to five years for six people, including a
Korean-American businessman, charged with plotting to destroy
President Kim Dae-jung's election campaign last year.
	   The six, including five former government spy agents, were
accused of trying to disrupt Kim's presidential campaign by
depicting him as a communist.
	   The smear campaign pulled down Kim's popularity but he
eventually won the election by a plurality of only 300,000 votes.
After taking office in February, Kim ordered a thorough probe of
the smear campaign, led by the government's main spy organization,
the Agency for National Security Planning.
	   A total of 13 people, including the agency's ex-chief, Kwon
Young-hae, were arrested for trial. Kwon and six other agency
officials are being tried separately.
	   All testified in court that they became involved in the smear
campaign on Kwon's order.
	   Prosecutors said the Korean-American businessman, Yoon
Hong-joon, 32, was bribed to hold news conferences in Beijing,
Tokyo and Seoul ahead of December's presidential election to make a
false claim that Kim's election campaign was funded by North Korea.
	   Prosecutors found that Yoon received dlrs 250,000 from the
agency's chief in exchange for holding the news conferences. Yoon,
a frequent traveler to North Korea, worked as an undercover agent
for the agency, they said.
	   Prosecutors requested a five-year sentence for Yoon. They also
sought prison terms ranging from three to five years for five
others, all former mid-ranking spy agents, on libel and other
charges.
	   ``The defendants abused their status to hurt a certain
presidential candidate through a systematic smear campaign,''
senior prosecutor Shin Sang-kyu said.
	   South Korea remains staunchly anti-communist after fighting a
war with North Korea in 1950-53. Under South Korea's past
authoritarian governments, the spy agency often portrayed
dissidents or political opponents as communists to destroy their
careers.

Samsung to build oil refinery in Ghana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Samsung Corp. said Monday it has
signed a dlrs 240 million deal with Ghana's state-run Tema Oil
Refinery Ltd. to build an oil and gas plant in the African country.
	   The refinery will be able to produce 14,000 barrels of gasoline
and liquefied petroleum gas daily, Samsung officials said. It is to
be completed by 2001.
	   Samsung renovated a similar oil refinery in Ghana in 1995 for
dlrs 60 million. Samsung Corp. is a subsidiary of the Samsung
group, South Korea's second largest conglomerate.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with comment from British papers in grafs 10-11 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Sports writers, political columnists, and even the
financial newspapers all had something to say Monday about what
victory in the World Cup means for France.
	   French media joined the nation in celebrating the the World Cup
upset with an orgy of coverage devoted to the stunning 3-0 win by
Les Bleus against Brazil.
	   ``For Eternity,'' blared the headline of the sports daily
L'Equipe, which has heaped criticism on French coach Aime Jacquet
for putting together what the newspaper considered a dull team.
	   ``It's ours,'' said the headline of the daily Le Parisien, with
a picture of an ecstatic Jacquet holding the coveted golden trophy
high over his head.
	   Pride, euphoria, glory. Those were just some of the emotions
expressed in the pages of French newspapers. Radio and TV talk
shows turned to soccer, and the winning goals were replayed _ and
replayed again and again _ on the country's main television
stations.
	   European newspapers chimed in with praise and congratulations
for the French team.
	   ``France Super, Brazil Humiliated,'' said the Corriere della
Sera daily in Milan, the Italian city where Brazilian star Ronaldo
plays. ``France can proudly raise to the heavens the first World
Cup in its history,'' said La Stampa of Turin.
	   German papers had the French victory on their front pages. ``The
French are the Soccer Kings,'' was the headline in the mass-market
Bild newspaper. But the story was overshadowed in Bild and other
German newspapers, with the news of Michael Schumacher's third
straight victory Sunday at the British Grand Prix.
	   In soccer-mad Britain, newspapers indulged in Brazil-bashing, a
few digs at the less than brilliant French team, which,
nonetheless, won overall admiration.
	   ``France take the world by storm,'' said the Times newspaper.
``It was a night to revel in this French triumph and to turn to
another kind of footballing extravagance, to acclaim new
torch-bearers. They were magnificent,'' the Times said.
	   ``There were better teams here. But when they play like this,
there were no more well-rounded ones,'' the Daily Express wrote.
	   Although more subdued, Dutch newspapers also paid tribute to the
French team. ``Vive la France. The French are the deserved champion
after trouncing Brazil,'' said De Telegraaf.
	   For some French commentators, victory went beyond sport. They
expressed hope the win will help combat racism in a country where
the right-wing National Front regularly gets 15 percent of the
vote.
	   Some of the greatest heroes of the French team, including
Sunday's two-time scorer, Zinedine Zidane, are the children of
immigrants, or were born in one of France's former colonies.
	   For Le Figaro, a conservative daily, the French victory was a
``lesson'' in ``unity'' for a nation that is now irreversibly
multiracial.
	   France stands to gain in other ways as well, according to the
financial daily Les Echos.
	   ``France's emerges with its image magnified,'' said Les Echos,
pointing out what the newspaper called the country's impeccable
organization of the World Cup impeccable.
	   Throughout the World Cup, France's superb fast trains, its
fashion and food were on display and may bring the country fresh
economic rewards.
	   Amid the euphoria, some newspapers, however, raised some
troubling issues: the persistent presence of soccer hooligans and
the dangers they pose and the problem of ticket fraud that plagued
this year's World Cup.

Talks with Taiwan no violation of one-China policy, Philippines
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Taiwan-Migrant Workers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada attempted to
assure China on Monday that he did not violate the Philippines'
one-China policy by ordering officials to talk with Taiwanese
authorities on the plight of Filipino workers in Taiwan.
	   ``We have not committed any violation,'' Estrada told reporters.
``It is the duty of the president to protect his people, even if
they are abroad. Nobody will help Filipinos except their
countrymen.''
	   Chinese Ambassador Guan Denming, who met Estrada later Monday,
said he was satisfied with Estrada's explanation.
	   ``We appreciate this expression by President Estrada in this
regard,'' Guan told reporters after the meeting. ``I am grateful.''
	   China opposes any official exchanges with Taiwan by countries
with which Beijing has diplomatic relations.
	   China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province with no right to its
own foreign relations. The Philippines has diplomatic relations
with Beijing, but maintains strong unofficial ties with Taipei.
	   On Sunday, Estrada's office said talks between Philippine and
Taiwanese officials were under way on what to do about recruiters
who charge excessive fees for Taiwan-bound Filipino workers.
	   In January, China strongly protested a reported meeting between
then-President Fidel Ramos and Taiwanese Premier Vincent Siew, who
visited the Manila headquarters of the Asian Development Bank.
	   Before he was inaugurated as president on June 30, Estrada met
with Chan Hsien-chin, Taiwan's cultural and economic representative
in the Philippines, to discuss problems of Filipino workers in
Taiwan.
	   Instead of embassies, Taiwan and the Philippines maintain
economic and cultural offices, which are de facto consular offices.
	   Estrada, who won the May 11 presidential elections on a pro-poor
platform, has said he cannot possibly create jobs at home for the
millions of Filipinos laboring overseas but pledged to seek better
working conditions for them.
	   Press Secretary Rodolfo Reyes said Estrada's directive was an
``informal request'' to crack down on abusive recruiters in Taiwan.
	   ``It was not taken up as a formal agreement (but) to make the
lives of our contract workers bearable,'' Reyes said.
	   On Sunday, Reyes said Estrada was considering a
``government-to-government arrangement'' so that Filipinos can get
better treatment in Taiwan.
	   In Taiwan, authorities said Monday they will look into
allegations that migrant workers are exploited by recruiters.
	   Wu Lien-pei, an official of the government Labor Council, said
refunds will be ordered if any companies are found to have
collected fees for services that were never provided.

Thais fixing holes in border fence with Malaysia to stop crime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police and army personnel in southern
Thailand are fixing more than 600 holes in a barbed-wire fence
along the border to stop illegal trade and gangsters smuggling Thai
women into Malaysia, Thai Border Patrol Police said Monday.
	   The holes were made along a 30-kilometer (18.5-mile) stretch of
the fence in Songkhla province, 950 kilometers (590 miles) south of
Bangkok.
	   Police said Thai gangs were cutting through the fence to smuggle
prostitutes and narcotics into Malaysia. Illegal goods were also
being smuggled into Thailand for sale, police said.
	   The fence is difficult to patrol because it passes through
heavily forested areas, police said.
	   In 1996, Malaysia angered Thailand by constructing a
27-kilometer (17-mile) concrete wall along the border with another
southern Thai province to stop the flow of illegal immigrants from
Thailand.

Ten nations join EU in sanctions on Belarus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Ten non-European Union nations joined
the EU Monday in imposing travel restrictions on Belarus officials
because of a dispute over ambassadorial residences in the Belarus
capital of Minsk.
	   The EU decided to retaliate against orders from the Belarusian
government that several nations vacate their ambassadors'
residences in a diplomatic compound, saying the measures
``constitute an infringement of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic
relations.''
	   The EU action prohibits admission of Belarus officials into any
of the 15 EU member states, from President Alexander Lukashenko,
his cabinet ministers and their deputies to a range of lesser
officials including the chairmen of the State Patent Committee and
the State Committee for Hydrometeorology.
	   Joining the EU were Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic,
Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Iceland and Norway,
who said in a joint statement they ``will ensure that their
national policies conform to that common position.''
	   Diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Greece, Italy, and Japan left Belarus to consult with their
governments over the dispute. The Bulgarian and Polish ambassadors
also were recalled home.
	   Poland, while declaring its solidarity with the EU and
condemning Belarus, declined to join in the action. Citing its
position as chairman of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, Poland said it ``feels it is responsible
before the international community for maintaining a dialogue with
the people of Belarus and for ensuring the conditions for further
operation of the OSCE mission in Minsk.''
	   Belarus has said it needs to repair the plumbing and sewage
system in the compound where the ambassadorial residences are
located. The ambassadors say that under the Vienna Convention,
Belarus has no right to force them out for any reason.

Philippine women's prison to allow conjugal visits with mandatory
</HEADLINE>
contraception &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Philippine prison for women is
proposing that its inmates be allowed to have conjugal visits with
their husbands, but only if they practice birth control, the prison
chief said Monday.
	   Rachel Ruelo, officer in charge of the Correctional Institute
for Women in metropolitan Manila, said women inmates need to
satisfy their ``biological needs'' but should not be burdened with
additional children.
	   ``The problem is pregnancies. It's not practical. We don't want
another liability to a family already devastated by the
imprisonment of a mother,'' she said.
	   The proposal has been criticized by Sen. Loren Legarda, who said
the forced contraception is ``a blatant form of gender-based
discrimination.''
	   She urged a Senate probe of the proposal, saying it would
violate Philippine constitutional guarantees of human rights and a
U.N. convention that seeks to eliminate discrimination against
women.
	   The correctional institute in suburban Mandaluyong, established
in 1966, was designed for 250 inmates. It has more than 620 women
prisoners, 291 of whom are married.
	   It houses women sentenced to terms of three years or more who
have been convicted of crimes like murder, homicide and fraud.
	   The prison currently allows brief visits by husbands and
relatives in designated open areas. Under a proposal to be
submitted to the Department of Justice this month, inmates would be
allowed to spend time with their husbands in a secured prison room
for a specified number of hours on the condition they use
contraceptives.
	   The inmates applauded loudly when the plan was announced to
them, Ruelo said.
	   She said the plan could help prevent inmates' families from
breaking up because husbands could continue to have sexual
relations with detained wives and would have less reason to look
for other partners.

Philippine stocks, peso fall as regional currencies weaken
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell Monday,
weighed down by retreating regional currencies led by the Japanese
yen following the dismal electoral performance of Japan's ruling
party, traders said.
	   The peso slipped in early trading but then regained some of its
losses because of weak dollar demand, dealers said. The dollar
averaged 42.218 pesos for the day, up from 42.119 pesos on Friday.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 26.36 points,
or 1.5 percent, to 1,775.85 after losing 26.19 points on Friday.
	   The broader All Shares Index was down 5.98 points at 557.40
after declining 6.62 points Friday.
	   Losers swamped gainers 55 to 20, with 37 issues unchanged.
	   Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., which accounted for
nearly half of the day's trades, led decliners. PLDT shares lost
5.1 percent on news it had raised its basic monthly rate by only a
third of its original plan in deference to the new government's
request.
	   Analysts said it may take a while before stability returns to
the stock market given the latest development in Japan.
	   ``After the polls in Japan, the big question is when will the
economic reforms be put in place. In the meantime, we wait for
another round of weakening of the yen,'' said Helen Alvarez,
research director of All Asia Securities Corp.
	   The uncertainty and the heightened currency volatility will
force more investors to join those already on the sidelines, she
said.
	   In currency trading, dealers said the impact on the peso of
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's defeat at the polls was
cushioned by light demand for dollars.
	   The outcome of Sunday's election in Japan pushed the peso to its
day low of 42.40 pesos to the dollar in early trading. But, with
little commercial demand for dollars, the peso was able to recoup
some of its early losses.
	   Dealers said the yen will continue to be tensely tracked by the
peso market, but the peso's resistance at 42.50 pesos to the dollar
was seen as fairly solid.

Westwood joins Woods as bookies' favorite for British Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England's Lee Westwood has been installed as joint
favorite with Tiger Woods for this week's British Open at Royal
Birkdale.
	   Bookmakers Ladbrokes reacted to Westwood's victory at last
week's Loch Lomond tournament by cutting his odds to 11-1. It's the
first time since his victory at the 1997 Masters that Woods has not
been the sole betting favorite for any tournament he's played in,
Ladbrokes said.
	   The 25-year-old Westwood has three victories in his last four
European tour starts and seven wins in seven countries in the last
nine months. He would collect a dlrs 1 million bonus if he wins the
Open.
	   ``He is showing the two characteristics that the betting public
dream of, namely consistency and coolness under pressure,''
Ladbrokes spokeman Andy Clifton said.
	   After Woods and Westwood, Ladbrokes lists David Duvall and Colin
Montgomerie at 14-1; Ernie Els, Fred Couples and Jim Furyk at 16-1;
and defending champion Justin Leonard, Tom Lehman and Mark O'Meara
at 25-1.

Central bankers say Japan's economic fundamentals remain strong
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Central bankers meeting in Tokyo Monday said
Japan's economy remains fundamentally strong but urged the country
to act quickly to reform its financial system.
	   German central bank president Hans Tietmeyer, speaking with
reporters after a meeting of the Bank for International
Settlements, said the world should not underestimate Japan's
economic strength.
	   Worries about the world's second-largest economy have increased
in recent months after Japan slipped into its worst recession since
World War II.
	   Tietmeyer, one of 30 central bankers attending the one-day
meeting, urged Japan not to delay plans designed to boost economic
growth and clean up bad loans in the financial system.
	   Japanese banks are burdened with some 77 trillion yen (dlrs 546
billion) in bad loans.
	   BIS President Alfons Verplaeste said that despite those
problems, Japan remained strong.
	   ``This country has very strong fundamentals and fundamentals are
lasting. Solving whatever problems there are is just a matter of
time,'' he said.
	   The Bank for International Settlements sets standards for banks
that operate internationally. Its members meet monthly.
	   Earlier, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan met his
Japanese counterpart, Masaru Hayami, to discuss economic issues,
including Japan's bad debt problem, the Bank of Japan said.
	   The meetings came on the same day that Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto announced he would resign after his party suffered a
major setback in parliamentary elections Sunday.
	   The central bankers wouldn't say whether they had discussed
Japan's political turmoil, but Bank of Japan Governor Hayami said
he hoped a new administration would be formed quickly so Japan
doesn't lose any time solving its financial problems.
	   ``For whoever becomes prime minister, early restructuring of the
financial system, and revitalizing the economy are top
priorities,'' Hayami said.

Ten nations join EU in sanctions on Belarus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Ten non-European Union nations joined
the EU on Monday in imposing travel restrictions on Belarus
officials because of a dispute over ambassadorial residences in the
Belarus capital of Minsk.
	   The EU decided to retaliate against orders from the Belarusian
government that several nations vacate their ambassadors'
residences in a diplomatic compound, saying the measures
``constitute an infringement of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic
relations.''
	   The EU action prohibits admission of Belarus officials into any
of the 15 EU member states, from President Alexander Lukashenko,
his cabinet ministers and their deputies to a range of lesser
officials including the chairmen of the State Patent Committee and
the State Committee for Hydrometeorology.
	   Joining the EU were Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic,
Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Iceland and Norway,
who said in a joint statement they ``will ensure that their
national policies conform to that common position.''
	   Diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Greece, Italy, and Japan left Belarus to consult with their
governments over the dispute. The Bulgarian and Polish ambassadors
also were recalled home.

``English Patient'' actor in Budapest for ``Sunshine'' movie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Ralph Fiennes said Monday that he's
getting himself in the mood for the lead in a new film by sampling
goose liver and singing Hungarian love songs.
	   ``It was one of the best scripts I have ever read in my life,''
said a soft-spoken Fiennes of ``The Taste of Sunshine,'' written
and directed by Istvan Szabo, the acclaimed Hungarian director.
	   The 36-year-old English actor will play all three leads in the
tale of a Jewish family's struggle to maintain its identity over
three generations: a pragmatic lawyer, his Olympic-athlete son and
his political grandson.
	   Fiennes is taking fencing lessons, learning to sing Hungarian
love songs, eating Hungarian food and walking round the streets of
Budapest as he gets familiar with his roles.
	   Most of the 21 weeks of filming will be in Hungary, with brief
forays to Berlin and Vienna.
	   Fiennes' portrayal of a cruel SS commander in ``Schindler's
List'' made him an international star. He was nominated for an
Oscar in ``The English Patient.''
	   Also starring is William Hurt in a smaller role. The film will
be ready next spring in time for the Cannes film festival.
Producers from the Canadian Alliance Communications Corp. declined
to disclose the budget.

New film copies honor Bergman's 80th birthday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ In honor of Ingmar Bergman's 80th
birthday, the Swedish Film Institute announced Monday that it will
spend 300,000 kronor (dlrs 37,000) to make new copies of several of
his classic earlier films.
	   Bergman, whose birthday is Tuesday, is noted for searching and
intense movies exploring personal and spiritual issues
	   Among the films to be released in new copies are ``The Seventh
Seal,'' ``The Silence'' and ``Scenes from a Marriage,'' the
institute said.
	   Bergman's last film was 1982's ``Fanny and Alexander'' but he
has directed several theatrical productions since then, most
recently this year's ``The Image-Makers'' at Stockholm's Royal
Dramatic Theater.

Lufthansa, German railway pledge closer cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Seeking to shift some domestic travel
from planes to trains, Germany's flag carrier, Lufthansa, and the
German railway signed a letter of intent Monday to work on
coordinating services and schedules.
	   The goal is to make it easier to travel by train to Lufthansa's
main hub in Frankfurt, instead of flying there. Starting in 2001,
Lufthansa boss Juergen Weber hopes to eliminate such short hops _
between Frankfurt and Cologne, for example _ thus freeing up
takeoff and landing slots for more lucrative international flights.
	   As part of the Lufthansa-Deutsche Bahn deal, passengers could
check their luggage through at the train station for the Lufthansa
flight they will catch at Frankfurt.
	   The service is already in place at Saarbruecken, although
travelers must drop their bags off the day before. Starting in
September, the service will be extended to five other cities:
Duesseldorf, Cologne, Bonn, Wuerzburg and Nuremberg.
	   Passengers flying on Lufthansa partners United and SAS would
also be able to use the service, he said.
	   The airline and railway said they'd form a working group to
resolve such problems as security checks on the luggage and making
sure the bags get to the airport from the train station on time.
	   Deutsche Bahn chief Johannes Ludewig said his railway also would
work to coordinate schedules better with Lufthansa flights to make
connections easier, and allow for combined train and plane tickets.

Cambodian government wants Khmer Rouge leaders to die in jungle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's defense minister said
Monday the government will no longer put great effort into hunting
down Khmer Rouge leaders hiding in the northern jungles, preferring
instead to just ``let them die.''
	   ``We have no need to waste any energy,'' said Defense Minister
Tea Banh. ``Let them die. They are just a few.''
	   The government has previously insisted that the capture of three
Khmer Rouge chieftains _ Ta Mok, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan _ was
a high priority and that they should be tried for crimes against
humanity.
	   The trio top the wanted list of Khmer Rouge leaders since the
death in April of Pol Pot, who led the genocidal regime that caused
the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians between 1975 and
1979.
	   Mass defections over the past two years have diminished the
Maoist-inspired movement to an estimated few hundred guerrillas.
The three die-hard leaders are in their late 60s and early 70s and
are said to be hiding along the rugged northern border with
Thailand.
	   Ta Mok took over from Pol Pot in a bloody power struggle last
year. Pol Pot died under house arrest of a purported heart attack
as the government army staged a major offensive that captured the
last main Khmer Rouge stronghold.
	   Noun Chea was long considered the No. 2 leader of the group.
Khieu Samphan, one of the group's intellectuals, has long been its
public face.
	   Tea Banh was dismissive of questions about when the trio might
be captured. The government said in the weeks following Pol Pot's
death that their arrest was imminent, but no longer makes such
claims.
	   ``We will still pursue their arrest, but if we cannot find them,
let them die, there is nothing to wonder about,'' Tea Banh said.
	   On several occasions, Cambodian officials have accused Thailand
of harboring the guerrilla chieftains. Thailand denies it.
	   The newspaper Bangkok Post reported Monday that Ta Mok and Khieu
Samphan were residing near the border at Pong Sa Pong, opposite
Thailand's Si Sa Ket province.
	   No mention was made of Nuon Chea, who is believed to be gravely
ill.
	   The Bangkok Post quoted Thai army chief Gen. Chettha Thanajaro,
who returned Sunday from a two-day trip to Phnom Penh, as having
told Cambodian leader Hun Sen that Thailand will arrest Ta Mok if
he tries to cross the border.
	   A score of high-ranking Khmer Rouge have defected to the
government in the past two years in exchange for making peace with
the government, raising the prospect that none of the Khmer Rouge
mass murderers may ever be tried.

Ford to buy engine unit from VW subsidiary

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ U.S. automaker Ford said Monday it will buy the
racing operations of the Cosworth engine company from Audi.
	   Ford and Audi did not disclose a purchase price for Cosworth
Racing, based in Northampton, England.
	   Cosworth Racing and Ford have had close ties for 30 years, and
Ford said the deal will let them keep working together in the
racing engine business while Audi concentrates on Cosworth's other
engine-marking operations.
	   ``The agreement will allow Cosworth Racing to continue to draw
on Ford's global engineering capabilities in meeting our
commitments in Formula One, Indycar and Touring Car Racing,'' said
Martin Whitaker, motorsport director of Ford of Europe, a
subsidiary of the Ford Motor Co., based in Dearborn, Michigan.
	   Cosworth engines have powered 13 Formula One world champions,
secured 10 F-1 constructors' titles and achieved 138 pole positions
and 174 F-1 victories.
	   The announcement came a day after Audi bought Cosworth from the
conglomerate Vickers PLC for 117 million pounds (dlrs 191 million).

Parliament shouldn't send representative to czar's burial, speaker
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament probably will not send an
official delegation to this week's burial service of Russia's last
czar in St. Petersburg, the speaker of the lower house said Monday.
	   Czar Nicholas II abdicated in 1917, a year before he was
executed with his family, and therefore he should simply be buried
where he was killed in the central city of Yekaterinburg, Gennady
Seleznyov, a Communist and speaker of the State Duma, told the
Interfax news agency.
	   Nicholas II ``was no longer an emperor but a private citizen and
it is unclear why a private person should be buried with these
honors,'' Seleznyov said.
	   The Duma will make its decision Tuesday, but Communists account
for the largest bloc, and most are believed to share Seleznyov's
sentiments.
	   Nicholas, his family and several servants were executed by the
Bolsheviks in 1918. Their bones were found buried in a pit near
Yekaterinburg in 1991, and will be interred in a St. Petersburg
cathedral where many of Russia's czars are buried.
	   There have been a number of disputes surrounding the burial, and
it is now scheduled to be a relatively modest, low-key affair. Many
top officials, including President Boris Yeltsin do not plan to
attend.

Immigrants to be limited to one appeal before expulsion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Immigrants and asylum seekers should be limited to
one appeal before being expelled from Britain, the government said
Monday.
	   ``We have a system which has become overwhelmed with numbers,
increasingly complex laws and people deliberately abusing the
system by spinning out a case for so long that it sometimes becomes
very difficult or impractical to remove them from the country,''
said Home Secretary Jack Straw.
	   The government has not yet proposed legislation to implement the
changes, but issued a consultation document which will allow
advocates for immigrants to comment.
	   Would-be immigrants who are refused permission to stay in
Britain can now turn to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal, and then
to the courts.
	   The number of appeals has risen from 25,536 in 1993 to 37,146
last year, the Home Office said, and the cost was more than 150
million pounds (dlrs 240 million) last year, up from 86 million
pounds (dlrs 138 million).
	   More than 1,700 applications for judicial review were made in
1996 and 301 were permitted to proceed, the Home Office said.
	   ``What we are proposing is a single right of appeal where cases
are finally determined within six months at the most,'' Straw said.
	   The home secretary cited the case of an Indian man who lives in
his parliamentary district who has been seeking asylum for five
years, claiming he faced persecution if he went back to his home in
Gujurat. He said the same man had asked for his passport so that he
could take a vacation _ in Gujurat.
	   Claude Moraes, director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of
Immigrants, welcomed the thrust of the reforms, saying the present
tribunal system has been discredited. But he said the reforms won't
go far enough unless applicants have access to better legal
representation and the underlying culture of ``disbelief'' among
officials assessing applications changes.
	   ``The Government had to act on the scandalous backlog of over
50,000 cases which has caused suffering to both the asylum seekers
and their families,'' Moraes said. ``But this mustn't be just a
mechanism for clearing the backlog. It must be fair. It's often the
most genuine asylum seekers whose cases appear the weakest.''

doing to overcome it. It will have a circulation of 60,000, the
statement added.
	   Asia Inc. will continue to be published in Hong Kong as it has
been for the last seven years. The new owners say it will be

World Cup: more than 22 million Brits watched Cup final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ More than 22 million television viewers in Britain
tuned in for the World Cup final, according to official figures
released Monday.
	   Sunday night's game, broadcast live on both BBC1 and ITV, drew a
bigger audience than for England's World Cup games against Romania
and Colombia.
	   It fell short of the 23.7 million who watched England lose to
Argentina earlier in the tournament.
	   Officials said the total British audience was only 2 million
less than the number of viewers in France who watched their own
team beat Brazil 3-0.
	   BBC1 attracted an average of 15.7 million viewers _ peaking at
17.1 million shortly before the final whistle _ with ITV drawing
6.6 million and a peak of 7 million.
	   Viewing was up compared to the last World Cup final, when 17.5
million tuned in for the Brazil vs. Italy game in 1994.

Finance Minister: Malaysia will hit recession this year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with Anwar's reasons for recession; ADDS
byline &QL; 
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Shedding wishful thinking about
the once roaring economy, Malaysia admitted Monday that it would
slip into recession this year, confirming the worst fears of
financial analysts.
	   The gross domestic product would contract by 1 to 2 percent in
1998, Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim said.
	   Malaysia, once regarded as the fastest growing among the Asian
tiger economies, contracted by 1.8 percent in this year's first
quarter, compared with 6.9 percent growth in the previous quarter.
Results of the second quarter have not been announced.
	   Until now, the government had maintained that it would be able
to achieve GDP growth of between 2 and 3 percent for 1998. Even
last week, Anwar had said Malaysia would have to revise its growth
target but would try to halt a recession.
	   Anwar said two government packages totaling 12 billion ringgit
(dlrs 3 billion) in June had helped cushion the economic fall. He
said there would be more such measures.
	   ``Based on the economic performance in the first quarter and the
latest economic indicators, there is a big possibility that the GDP
contraction will increase if there are no new measures,'' Anwar
told Parliament on the opening day of a new session.
	   ``Nevertheless, with the new measures, especially the
government's fiscal incentives, the GDP contraction is expected to
be smaller, in the region of 1 to 2 percent.''
	   However, independent analysts predicted that Malaysia's economic
condition would worsen.
	   ``We expect something up to minus 4,'' said Kanika Singh, an
economist with Independent Economic Analysis, a Singapore-based
research company. ``There are a lot of question marks about how
they can turn around the economy.''
	   Anwar said a new agency would be created to help recapitalize
the country's struggling banks, explaining that banks would have to
seek new capital if the financial crisis continued.
	   In the worst case, this recapitalization could amount to 16
billion ringgit (dlrs 4 billion), Anwar added.
	   A new committee would be formed to accelerate and evaluate
corporate debt restructuring.
	   ``We want to make it easier and speed up efforts to restructure
corporate debt,'' he said.
	   He predicted that Malaysia would incur a budget deficit of 10
billion ringgit (dlrs 2.5 billion), or 3.7 percent of the gross
national product, while the annual rate of inflation would hover
around 8 percent.
	   Among the reasons cited by Anwar for the recession were slower
exports and manufacturing. Manufacturing had slid 5 percent in the
first five months of 1998 because of reduced demand.
	   In the same period, Malaysian exports dropped by 10.3 percent in
dollar terms, mainly because because orders from Japan and some
other Asian buyers fell by 22.5 percent.
	   ``All these developments have forced the government to take
immediate and direct action to revive the country's economy,'' he
said.
	   Acknowledgement of Malaysia's recession, in which a country's
economy shrinks for two consecutive quarters, comes one year after
the Asian crisis began.
	   In the crisis, millions of people have lost their jobs,
companies have gone bankrupt and governments have fallen in
Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia, where International Monetary
Fund-supervised bailouts totaling dlrs 120 billion are under way.
	   Malaysia's worsening situation could have an impact on
neighboring Singapore, which so far has said it would be able to
resist recession, said Singh. Singapore's trade was closely linked
with Malaysia's, she said.
	   Malaysia is the latest to join the string of recession-hit
economies after Japan collapsed into its worst contraction since
World War II. Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia are the other
countries in recession since the Asian contagion struck.

Ford to buy engine unit from VW subsidiary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ U.S. automaker Ford said Monday it will buy the
racing operations of the Cosworth engine company, a day after
German carmaker Audi AG bought Cosworth from the conglomerate
Vickers PLC.
	   Ford and Audi did not disclose a purchase price for Cosworth
Racing, based in Northampton, England.
	   Cosworth Racing and Ford have had close ties for 30 years, and
Ford said the deal will let them keep working together in the
racing engine business while Audi concentrates on Cosworth's other
engine-marking operations.
	   ``The agreement will allow Cosworth Racing to continue to draw
on Ford's global engineering capabilities in meeting our
commitments in Formula One, Indycar and Touring Car Racing,'' said
Martin Whitaker, motorsport director of Ford of Europe, a
subsidiary of the Ford Motor Co., based in Dearborn, Michigan.
	   Audi, a unit of Germany's Volkswagen AG, paid 117 million pounds
(dlrs 191 million) for Cosworth, as part of Volkswagen's earlier
deal to buy Rolls-Royce Motor Cars from Vickers.
	   Volkswagen paid the equivalent of dlrs 780 million when it
closed on the Rolls-Royce deal on July 3. Vickers is getting out of
the luxury auto business to concentrate on other operations,
including defense contracting.

Flight delays continue at Athens airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Heavy air traffic and protests by Olympic
Airways pilots combined Monday to delay flights up to six hours as
the tourism season moved into its peak period.
	   Air traffic control officials said the congestion is expected to
last throughout the summer due to an overbooking of scheduled
flights at the congested Athens airports.
	   The disruptions were compounded by a work-to-rule action by
pilots at the state carrier because of a pay dispute.
	   Flight delays have occurred at Athens' international and
domestic airports since last week. Many Greeks have started their
annual summer holidays to islands and other resorts.

Philippine government charges defiant freeport chief with sedition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government charged the
head of a freeport with sedition Monday for defying an order by
newly inaugurated President Joseph Estrada to quit and for
allegedly ordering followers to set up barricades.
	   The National Bureau of Investigation said Richard Gordon,
chairman of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority, also threatened
to resort to violence to keep his post.
	   Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said Gordon and some of his
followers were charged with sedition before the Department of
Justice, which ordered a probe.
	   Estrada, who was inaugurated as president June 30, fired Gordon
and appointed a longtime Gordon critic, Felicito Payumo, as his
replacement at the freeport and industrial center, a former U.S.
naval base north of Manila.
	   Gordon, who has been chief of the freeport from its beginning,
refused to step down, arguing that he still has a six-year term
following his re-appointment by Estrada's predecessor, Fidel Ramos,
in February. Estrada, however, nullified Ramos' order.
	   Payumo was to take over July 1, but hundreds of Gordon's
supporters barricaded the freeport's gates. Thousands of workers
stayed away from factories in the industrial zone, fearing they
might be caught in a clash between supporters and opponents of
Gordon.
	   Sedition is punishable by 6 to 12 years in prison.
	   Cuevas said the evidence against Gordon included testimony from
undercover NBI agents who said they heard Gordon tell followers to
reject Estrada's order.
	   He said Gordon also threatened bloodshed if the order was
carried out and asked followers to barricade the freeport's gates
to prevent officials from serving his termination paper.
	   The dispute disrupted business at the freeport, with the Subic
Bay Freeport Chamber of Commerce estimating losses as high as dlrs
3.5 million on a single day.
	   Federal Express, which operates its Asian hub at Subic, was
forced to divert flights to Manila's airport and move dependents of
Subic-based pilots to Manila at the height of the conflict.
	   Gordon later won a court order suspending Payumo's takeover for
17 days and operations at the freeport returned to normal.
	   The move by Estrada, a former actor and senator who opposed U.S.
bases in the Philippines, appeared to be in retaliation for efforts
by Gordon's followers to prevent Estrada from making an anti-bases
movie at Subic in 1991.
	   Estrada also accused Gordon of trying to sabotage his
presidential campaign in Olongapo, the city adjacent to Subic.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Lawmakers opposed to a proposal
reserving 33 percent of seats in India's federal parliament for
women kept the bill from being introduced in parliament Monday with
rowdy protest, domestic news agencies reported.
	   Members of the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal
party, which represent lower castes and Muslims, say they won't let
the bill be considered unless it includes quotas within the quota
for the minorities they represent.
	   Other parties in the governing coalition are unwilling to make
the changes. If they can get the bill introduced, they believe they
can pass it with the help of opposition parties.
	   Women's organizations supporting the bill were furious with the
delays and said they will protest themselves.
	   S.A. Lalitha, coordinator of the Joint Women's Program, said the
speaker should eject members who are disrupting parliament so the
bill could be introduced. She said women would be willing to
consider the amendments being suggested, but only once the proposal
had been submitted for debate.
	   As soon as parliament opened Monday morning, SP and RJD
lawmakers stormed to the front of the house shouting slogans
against the bill. Supporters of the bill shouted back, and the
bedlam forced the speaker to adjourn the house. Two more attempts
to convene later in the day also failed amid shouting before
officials acknowledged no session could be held.
	   The bill, meant to increase women's participation in India's
democracy, was first introduced in 1996 by a previous government,
but met with similar opposition and never came to a vote. Women
leaders accused men in parliament of being unwilling to surrender
any control.
	   Despite Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's assurances of
getting the bill passed, it is uncertain whether it will come to a
vote this time.
	   Some parties were ``trying to throttle'' the bill, complained
Venkaiah Naidu, general secretary of Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata
Party, according to Press Trust of India news agency.

Peres, in Jordan, urges no steps on Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres
urged the Israeli government Monday to leave the fate of Jerusalem
to negotiations with Palestinians on a final settlement.
	   Peres said he disagreed with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
policies on expanding West Bank Jewish settlements and a decision
to extend Jerusalem's municipal services to some of the
settlements.
	   ``I don't like to see Jerusalem surrounded by many
controversies,'' he told a meeting of 150 officials, professors and
students in Amman. ``It should be left to the final negotiations.''
	   Peres later met separately with King Hussein and his brother and
heir, Crown Prince Hassan, said a Royal Palace official, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   He declined to provide details on the talks. The Israeli Embassy
said they focused on Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
	   Jordan is eager to see a swift break in the Palestinian-Israeli
deadlock to ease opposition among its predominantly Palestinian
population to the peace treaty it signed with Israel in 1994.
	   Peres is the second in a succession of visits by Labor Party
officials. Lawmaker Yossi Beilin met Hassan on Sunday, and Labor
Party leader Ehud Barak is scheduled to visit Tuesday.
	   At the meeting with students, Peres said that ``maybe the time
has come to change the government of Israel.''
	   ``I did not vote for Mr. Netanyahu, neither did I change my mind
(about him),'' a smiling Peres said.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Kuwait-based Gulf Investment Corp. has
purchased 10 percent of Zamil Industrial Investment Co., one of the
region's largest industrial ventures.
	   GIC would not disclose the value of the private placement
transaction in the announcement Monday, but the capital of the
newly set up company is about 300 million Saudi riyals (dlrs 80
million).
	   ZIIC is a closed Saudi joint stock company that owns three main
subsidiaries: Zamil Glass Industries, Zamil Air Conditioners Co.
and Zamil Steel Buildings.
	   GIC is owned by the Gulf Cooperation Council states of Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.
It says it aims at helping ``expand and diversify the production
base of its shareholders' economies.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's Planning Ministry has presented to
the government a five-year economic and social development plan to
improve living conditions in the impoverished kingdom.
	   The 1999-2003 plan, which must be endorsed by the Cabinet before
it is implemented, is in line with economic reforms introduced in
1989 under the supervision of the International Monetary Fund.
	   The Planning Ministry announced the plan in a statement issued
Monday. But it did not say how much the government would spend on
it.
	   The plan aims to bolster the growth rate to 5 percent a year by
increasing exports and reducing imports, the ministry said. Growth
in 1997 was 0.8 percent.
	   A ministry statement said the budget deficit, which is estimated
at 5 percent, is expected to be cleared by 2003.
	   Unemployment must drop to 8 percent of the labor force by
providing 297,000 job opportunities for Jordanians, possibly
through replacing foreign laborers, it said. The rate is now 15
percent.

Malaysia to lower interest rates directly or indirectly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
said Monday the government will lower interest rates directly or
indirectly to help companies obtain funds to continue their
business, the national news agency reported.
	   Various measures were being taken to save companies facing
financial difficulties because of a sharp drop in the value of
their shares as a result of the economic slowdown and the
depreciation of the ringgit, the Bernama news agency reported
Mahathir as saying.
	   He cited the creation of the Asset Management Co. Bhd, which
would take over troubled companies and buy up their non-performing
loans from banks.
	   ``We will have more companies facing problems but we cannot take
over all of them,'' he added.
	   Tight indirect controls would be imposed to ensure that money
borrowed from banks was spent only in the companies' interest and
not for unhealthy practices, Mahathir said. He did not elaborate.
	   Mahathir said the setting up of agencies like the asset
management company was a normal practice in developed countries,
including the United States, to save companies in financial
difficulties.
	   Touching on the sale of local corporations' shares to foreign
companies, Mahathir said local companies with financial woes were
dependent on foreign capital as they could not obtain loans
locally.
	   ``If they want to sell their shares locally, many companies do
not have cash and cannot borrow money. Hence they are forced to
depend on foreign firms,'' he said.
	   But he said the government would limit their share ownership so
that foreigners do not gain control of the companies.

VW subsidiary Audi plans to sell Cosworth division to Ford
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INGOLSTADT, Germany (AP) _ Volkswagen subsidiary Audi, which is
buying engine maker Cosworth from Britain's Vickers, said Monday it
plans to immediately resell the company's Formula One engine
division to Ford.
	   Ford's Motor Sport division and Audi both announced that they
had signed a letter of intent for the sale, but did not cite a
price for the Formula One operations.
	   In London, Vickers said Monday it had reached full agreement on
its sale of Cosworth for 117 million pounds (dlrs 182 million) next
month to Audi.
	   Analysts say Volkswagen intends to have Cosworth supply
12-cylinder engines for its luxury Rolls-Royce Motor Cars division,
which Volkswagen purchased from Vickers earlier this month.
	   The Cosworth purchase is seen as vital for Volkswagen after
German rival BMW announced it would no longer supply engines for
Rolls Royce models when its contract ends in July 1999.
	   Audi plans to split off Cosworth's 600-employee division that
produces race-car engines and sell that to Ford, which has worked
with Cosworth on the Formula One engines for three decades.

Japan expresses support for IMF bailout plan for Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Hashimoto-Kiriyenko news
conference &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told visiting
Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on Monday that Japan
supports an International Monetary Fund bailout for Russia's ailing
economy.
	   The two leaders also affirmed an agreement for a dlrs 800
million loan to Russia from the Export-Import Bank of Japan,
Hashimoto said at a news conference following their meeting
	   Hashimoto said he told Kiriyenko Japan ``supported the IMF's
efforts to help stabilize the Russian economy.''
	   The IMF tentatively agreed Monday to offer Russia a huge bailout
package to shore up its faltering financial markets and provide a
desperately needed infusion of cash.
	   Details were not immediately released, but Russia had been
seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion.
	   Kiriyenko arrived in Tokyo Monday to discuss economic
cooperation with Japan as a way of bolstering growth.
	   But the timing of the visit could not be worse as Japanese Prime
Ryutaro Hashimoto announced his resignation shortly before their
meeting.
	   Hashimoto resigned to take responsibility for a major electoral
defeat for his governing Liberal Democratic Party in Sunday's
elections for Parliament's upper house.
	   Kiriyenko told reporters that Russia's ties with Japan would not
be affected by Hashimoto's resignation.
	   ``I am disappointed that Prime Minister Hashimoto is stepping
down. I salute him on his efforts to further Russian-Japan
relations,'' Kiriyenko said.
	   Hashimoto and Kiriyenko also agreed Monday to set up a joint
investment facility to help the Russian economy, Hashimoto said.
Kiriyenko was the first Russian premier to visit Japan.
	   Hashimoto, with strong personal ties to Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, had been a key driving force behind the increasingly
friendly atmosphere between the two countries, which have never
signed a peace treaty ending World War II.
	   Japanese Foreign Ministry officials were afraid that Hashimoto's
resignation could send a chill through relations between the two
countries.
	   ``I do not wish Japanese-Russian relations, which are finally
beginning to improve, to move backward,'' Hashimoto said at the
news conference earlier in the day where he announced he was
stepping down.
	   ``Such a thing should not happen. Regardless of my resignation,
we must push forward relations between Japan and Russia,'' he said.
	   Kiriyenko also met Monday with Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi,
considered a possible successor to Hashimoto.
	   On Tuesday, Kiriyenko will deliver a speech to a Japanese
business group before leaving for China.

China congratulates South Korea for weathering economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin praised South Korea
on Monday, saying it has weathered the worst of its financial
crisis and that he hoped it would soon recover its economic
vitality.
	   In a meeting with South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs and
Trade Park Chung-soo, Jiang also said China would continue to play
its part in easing Asia's financial troubles, the state-run Xinhua
News Agency reported.
	   Jiang expressed ``great happiness'' that South Korea's
``financial situation has already passed the most difficult time,''
Xinhua reported.
	   ``He wished that South Korea can overcome its present
difficulties soon and recover its economic vitality,'' it said.
	   For his part, Park praised China for not devaluing its currency,
a move seen as having helped stop Asia from sinking further into
economic depression.
	   Park stressed that ``the stability and development of China's
political and economic situation is extremely important to Asia's
future,'' Xinhua reported.
	   China, the only major communist ally of Seoul's rival, North
Korea, opened formal diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992.
	   Trade between the two countries has since grown significantly,
reaching dlrs 23 billion in 1997.
	   Ministry officials said before his departure that Park would
seek Beijing's support for South Korean President Kim Dae-jung's
policy of expanding contacts and cooperation with North Korea.
	   Jiang said China has consistently hoped for peace and stability
on the Korean Peninsula and has played ``its due role'' in that
regard, Xinhua said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament probably will not send an
official delegation to this week's burial service of Russia's last
czar in St. Petersburg, the speaker of the lower house said Monday.
	   Czar Nicholas II abdicated in 1917, a year before he was
executed with his family, and therefore he should simply be buried
where he was killed in the central city of Yekaterinburg, Gennady
Seleznyov, a Communist and speaker of the State Duma, told the
Interfax news agency.
	   Nicholas II ``was no longer an emperor but a private citizen and
it is unclear why a private person should be buried with these
honors,'' Seleznyov said.
	   The Duma will make its decision Tuesday, but Communists account
for the largest bloc, and most are believed to share Seleznyov's
sentiments.
	   The government said Monday that Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
will not attend the funeral. It had said previously that the
government would be represented by Deputy Prime Minister Boris
Nemtsov.
	   Nicholas, his family and several servants were executed by the
Bolsheviks in 1918. Their bones were found buried in a pit near
Yekaterinburg in 1991, and will be interred in a St. Petersburg
cathedral where many of Russia's czars are buried.
	   There have been a number of disputes surrounding the burial, and
it is now scheduled to be a relatively modest, low-key affair. Many
top officials, including President Boris Yeltsin do not plan to
attend.

Widespread trade in illegal weapons threatens peace, human rights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Seeking to stem the spread of light weapons,
representatives from 21 countries met Monday to create a global
campaign to control the arms that fuel conflicts around the world.
	   ``The great human costs of the excessive accumulation and
uncontrolled proliferation of small arms are the major reason for
our common concern,'' Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Aslaug Haga
said Monday as she opened the meeting.
	   No one know how many light weapons there are in the world, but
some experts say at least half the trade in weapons is illegal. In
places like Chechnya, it is sometimes easier to buy a gun than a
loaf of bread.
	   Haga said regaining control of existing arsenals and
international sales could reduce violence and human rights abuses
and encourage political and economic development.
	   Although the delegates could not take binding action, they were
expected to adopt a joint statement Tuesday calling for tighter gun
laws, better record-keeping on weapons sales, and the destruction
of surplus weapons.
	   ``We have no illusions that this well be easy. We are addressing
a class of weapons that are important tools in the shady areas
between the legal and the illegal,'' Haga said.
	   A major problem, she said, is that legal arms sales can quickly
become illegal because of inadequate controls. At the end of some
conflicts, demobilized soldiers, often unemployed, sometimes keep
their weapons, increasing the risk they will use or sell them on
the black market.
	   Countries can also seek to reduce war debt by selling off
legally obtained weapons on illegal markets. And after the Cold
War, major arms producing nations cut stockpiles, with the arms
often ending up in unstable developing countries.
	   Those in Oslo Monday hope to duplicate the success last year of
delegates who created an international treaty banning land mines.
	   In a letter to this week's meeting, Canadian Foreign Minister
Lloyd Axworthy, a driving force behind the land mine treaty, called
for a ban on international sales of military light weapons to
anyone but national states.
	   ``These are the weapons that cause the most death and injury,''
he wrote.
	   Nations at the talks included the United States, Canada,
Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, Brazil, Mexico, Columbia, Indonesia, Japan, the
Philippines, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mozambique, South Africa and
Zimbabwe.

Japan tuna fleet refused New Zealand port access
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand on Monday banned
Japanese bluefin tuna boats from entering its ports in an
escalating row over Japanese plans to catch more of the threatened
fish species.
	   Australia banned the 65-boat Japanese fleet from its ports and
waters in January after three-nation talks over controlling
southern bluefin tuna catch levels foundered.
	   Japan announced it will take an extra 1,400 tons of the prized
tuna as part of what it is calling a ``experimental'' catching
program to study the rapidly depleting stocks of the migratory
fish.
	   Acting Foreign Minister Simon Upton, announcing the port ban,
said the 65 vessels ``won't be welcome'' in New Zealand. The ban
will ``inconvenience those vessels'' but he expected they would
provision in countries like South Africa and Indonesia.
	   ``Don't ... assume that port closure is the end of this from New
Zealand's point of view. It's an initial response (only),'' he
said.
	   ``If we sign a convention (to control the bluefin tuna fishery)
in good faith we expect the parties to abide by it and we're not
just going to walk away from the convention. We need to see it
work.''
	   ``I think both Australia and New Zealand are quite clear that
they're not going to let this issue die,'' he added.
	   Both South Pacific states say the research catch should be part
of Japan's annual quota _ not additional to it.
	   Japan's Fishery Agency began its research fishing for southern
bluefin tuna in international waters last Friday after talks with
Australia and New Zealand on catch quotas stalled earlier in the
year at the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin
Tuna.
	   The research program began in the Indian Ocean, southwest of
Australia, to confirm the tuna population, said agency spokesman
Joji Morishita.
	   The research fishing is to continue through Aug. 31, with some
of the tuna to be used for studies of their stomach contents, cells
and muscles. They will then be put on the market.
	   The tuna, highly prized in Japan for sashimi, fetches up to U.S.
dlrs 40 a pound (dlrs 100 a kilogram ) on the Japanese market.
	   Morishita said the research fishing is aimed at obtaining
evidence to back Japan's position that the tuna population is
sufficient to allow larger fishing quotas.
	   Japan wants its quota increased by 3,000 metric tons from its
limit last year of 6,065 metric tons. Australia's quota was 5,265
metric tons and New Zealand's 420 metric tons.
	   South Korean, Taiwanese and Indonesian vessels also catch the
tuna, and their estimated 6,000-ton a year take is extra to the
annual quota under the three-nation convention.

Not kosher: religious rules to dampen Israel's millennium bash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It may be the biggest party night on earth, but
in Israel, religious rules are likely to put a damper on
millennium-eve celebrations.
	   That's because December 31, 1999 falls on a Friday, and the
Jewish Sabbath begins at sundown.
	   During the Sabbath, the Israeli religious establishment's
interpretation of Jewish law forbids hotels and restaurants from
staging most kinds of festivities, especially non-Jewish
celebrations.
	   Almost all hotels and restaurants in Israel have a kosher
license that they stand to lose if they break the rules and throw a
glitzy New Year's bash. Without that license, they can't stage
events like weddings and bar mitzvahs that are their commercial
lifeblood.
	   Israel's tourism industry is gloomily accepting the reality that
it's likely to miss out on a lot of business as a result of the
restrictions.
	   ``All I can do is be frustrated,'' said Jonathan Harpaz,
director of the Jerusalem Hotels Association. ``We are in dire
straits.''
	   Typical is the Ramada Renaissance Hotel in downtown Jerusalem.
Spokeswoman Tiki Mula said New Year's Eve is not a Jewish holiday,
and so it will not be observed at the kosher hotel.
	   ``No hotel in Jerusalem will celebrate the New Year, even if it
is the year 2000,'' she said.
	   Israel is expecting 5 million millennium-year visitors, almost
double the usual number. So many are expected that Jerusalem's
mayor has suggested tent cities may be needed to house tourists and
Christian pilgrims.
	   In contrast to the exuberant parties expected to be held across
the globe that night, tourists staying in Jerusalem hotels can look
forward to low-key dinner parties without music and dancing. On the
Sabbath, turning on electricity is prohibited, and most hotels
serve only cold or pre-prepared food.
	   Shmuel Borstein, responsible for issuing kosher licenses in
Jerusalem, said visitors can have modest parties. And some halls
and restaurants might decide that the revenue from such a big night
would be worth risking their licenses for.
	   Rather than count on that, though, many in the tourism industry
are scrambling to find alternative locales for those visitors who
want to ring in 2000 with a bang.
	   David Dassa, who runs a tour agency in Jerusalem that caters
mostly to Christian tourists, said any New Year's Eve parties held
in Jerusalem would inevitably be mediocre. He said he has
complained to Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert about the restrictions,
but hasn't received a response.
	   ``We can't kid ourselves,'' said Dassa. He and others are
already scouting alternative locales, such as Israeli kibbutzim,
which are usually secular in their outlook.
	   The solution for some would-be partiers: leave town. And next
door in the Palestinian lands, hoteliers and restaurateurs are
eager to take up the slack.
	   ``If this happens, we will expect huge amounts of people and we
will use our facilities to absorb any visitors,'' said Nabil
Kassis, who is directing millennium festivities for the biblical
West Bank town of Bethlehem, where Christians celebrate Jesus'
birth.
	   Visitors may face another religious complication, this one on
the Muslim side. New Year's Eve 1999 falls during the monthlong
Islamic festival of Ramadan, when observant Muslims fast from
sunrise to sunset.
	   But Kassis said the Palestinian Authority would make allowances
for hungry tourists.

Asia frets over Japanese political turmoil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Japan-Election &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The resignation of Japan's prime minister Monday
met a chilly reception elsewhere in Asia, where leaders worried
political turmoil could delay moves to fix the troubled region's
biggest economy.
	   The crumbling of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's government
comes as other Asian countries are looking to Japan for help in
putting back together their own shattered finances.
	   ``A strong government in Japan that can provide effective
leadership is a crucial factor in the efforts to restore economic
stability and growth in Asia,'' the Thai Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
	   The ministry said measures to stimulate the Japanese economy,
restructure its financial sector and stabilize the yen were all
``vital'' to the region's economic health.
	   Japan's closest neighbor, South Korea, had no official comment,
but government figures privately fretted that Japanese instability
could hurt the rest of Asia.
	   The resignation, triggered by the defeat of Hashimoto's Liberal
Democratic Party in elections Sunday, received close attention in
the South Korean media.
	   ``In the short term, Japan's political instability will have a
negative impact on Asia's economic recovery,'' the Hankyoreh, a
national daily, said in an editorial.
	   ``But in the long term, his resignation may have a positive
impact, because the next government is certain to push bold
economic programs,'' the paper said.
	   In Beijing, officials reacted mildly to the moves in Japan,
concentrating on a continuation of the two countries' warming
relations rather than on the economy.
	   The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it had ``taken note'' of
Sunday's elections in Japan.
	   ``We ... hope Japan's political situation will remain stable,''
the ministry said in a brief statement.
	   Indonesian leaders also stressed the need to maintain close
relations with Japan despite the impending departure of Hashimoto,
who had been in office for more than two years.
	   Speaking to reporters after meeting with President B.J. Habibie,
State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said ties between the two countries
were solid.
	   ``The relationship has been built over a long time and a change
of government either for Indonesia or Japan won't affect ... the
countries' relationship,'' said Akbar, who was elected chairman of
the ruling Golkar party this past weekend.
	   ``We hope Japanese investors will continue to come to
Indonesia,'' said Akbar. ``I expect Japanese investment to continue
and, if possible, to increase.''
	   In Canberra, Australian Treasurer Peter Costello urged the
incoming Japanese government to stay the course of reform set by
Hashimoto.
	   ``From our point of view it is important that the Japanese
government continue to work on sorting out the financial system,''
he said. ``This is very important to Japan's prospects and Japan's
prospects are very important to Asia's prospects.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ Sports writers, political columnists, and even the
financial newspapers all had something to say Monday about what
victory in the World Cup means for France.
	   French media joined the nation in celebrating the the World Cup
upset with an orgy of coverage devoted to the stunning 3-0 win by
Les Bleus against Brazil.
	   ``For Eternity,'' blared the headline of the sports daily
L'Equipe, which has heaped criticism on French coach Aime Jacquet
for putting together what the newspaper considered a dull team.
	   ``It's ours,'' said the headline of the daily Le Parisien, with
a picture of an ecstatic Jacquet holding the coveted golden trophy
high over his head. ``A jubiliant France celebrates its first World
Cup,'' trumpeted the normally sober Le Monde.
	   Pride, euphoria, glory. Those were just some of the emotions
expressed in the pages of French newspapers. Radio and TV talk
shows turned to soccer, and the winning goals were replayed _ and
replayed again and again _ on the country's main television
stations.
	   European newspapers chimed in with praise and congratulations
for the French team.
	   ``France Super, Brazil Humiliated,'' said the Corriere della
Sera daily in Milan, the Italian city where Brazilian star Ronaldo
plays. ``France can proudly raise to the heavens the first World
Cup in its history,'' said La Stampa of Turin.
	   German papers had the French victory on their front pages. ``The
French are the Soccer Kings,'' was the headline in the mass-market
Bild newspaper. But the story was overshadowed in Bild and other
German newspapers, with the news of Michael Schumacher's third
straight victory Sunday at the British Grand Prix.
	   In soccer-mad Britain, newspapers indulged in Brazil-bashing, a
few digs at the less than brilliant French team, which,
nonetheless, won overall admiration.
	   ``France take the world by storm,'' said the Times newspaper.
``It was a night to revel in this French triumph and to turn to
another kind of footballing extravagance, to acclaim new
torch-bearers. They were magnificent,'' the Times said.
	   ``There were better teams here. But when they play like this,
there were no more well-rounded ones,'' the Daily Express wrote.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair sent a letter of
congratulations to Chirac and Jospin for the ``splendid win''
against Brazil.
	   Although more subdued, Dutch newspapers also paid tribute to the
French team. ``Vive la France. The French are the deserved champion
after trouncing Brazil,'' said De Telegraaf.
	   For some French commentators, victory went beyond sport. They
expressed hope the win will help combat racism in a country where
the right-wing National Front regularly gets 15 percent of the
vote.
	   Some of the greatest heroes of the French team, including
Sunday's two-time scorer, Zinedine Zidane, are the children of
immigrants, or were born in one of France's former colonies.
	   For Le Figaro, a conservative daily, the French victory was a
``lesson'' in ``unity'' for a nation that is now irreversibly
multiracial.
	   The Tribune de Geneve quoted Zaki Laki, a French-based expert on
race relations, that the World Cup had put the National Front on
the ``defensive.''
	   France stands to gain in other ways as well, according to the
financial daily Les Echos.
	   ``France's emerges with its image magnified,'' said Les Echos,
pointing out what the newspaper called the country's impeccable
organization of the World Cup impeccable.
	   Throughout the World Cup, France's superb fast trains, its
fashion and food were on display and may bring the country fresh
economic rewards.
	   Amid the euphoria, some newspapers, however, raised some
troubling issues: the persistent presence of soccer hooligans and
the dangers they pose and the problem of ticket fraud that plagued
this year's World Cup.

German supreme court to rule on disputed language reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's highest court gets its say
Tuesday on a reform of the German language that has set off
passionate debate in this rule-loving nation.
	   The case before the Federal Constitutional Court involves a
complaint by a German couple who claimed their basic parental
rights were violated because their children were taught the new
rules in primary school.
	   The parents, who like the old way of writing, argued that such
sweeping changes should have required approval by parliament, not
only government ministers.
	   Many German academics, authors and parents oppose the language
reform, agreed to by officials from Germany, Switzerland and
Austria in 1996.
	   Numerous legal challenges have sought to stop the changes before
they officially take effect Aug. 1, even though many schools went
ahead and have adopted the new rules early.
	   Citizen groups in the state of Schleswig-Holstein succeeded in
forcing a referendum on the changes. The vote is set for Sept. 27,
alongside federal parliamentary elections.
	   To add to the confusion, the plaintiffs in the constitutional
court in Karlsruhe withdrew their case in a huff last week after
Focus magazine quoted a government source as saying the court had
decided to reject their challenge.
	   But the judges were expected to rule Tuesday anyway, using their
right to decide matters of public interest even when the original
complaint has been dropped.
	   Gunda Diercks-Elsner and Thomas Elsner, from the northern town
of Luebeck, filed the complaint last year arguing that the language
changes _ the first basic reform of German in nearly a century _
deprived them of the right to guide their two sons' education.
	   But at a court hearing last May, the judges seemed skeptical
about the couple's arguments.
	   Other German-speaking nations appear not to be bothered by the
changes. Education officials in Germany have argued the changes are
minor and do not violate anyone's basic rights.
	   The changes include shortening lengthy compound nouns; more
consistent spellings; cutting comma rules from 52 to nine; and
limiting use of the old German letter for a double ``s'' _ which
looks roughly like a capital B.

Imaoka beats Duran, defends Oriental-Pacific featherweight title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Takeo Imaoka narrowly defeated Samuel Duran
of the Philippines on Monday and kept his Oriental and Pacific
Boxing Federation featherweight title.
	   Imaoka knocked Duran down in the fourth round with a left hook,
but Duran punished the Japanese champion late in the 12-round bout
with a series of blows.
	   The Thai referee scored it 116-116, while a Japanese judge had
it 117-116 and a Filipino judge had it 114-113, both for Imaoka.
	   Imaoka was making his second defense of the title he won from
Duran on Nov. 12, 1997.
	   Imaoka weighed 57.1 kilograms (126 pounds) and Duran 56.7
kilograms (125 pounds).

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant Orangemen marched on
their big holiday Monday, chastened and divided by the deaths of
three boys in the violence swirling around their defiance of a
government order to avoid one Catholic neighborhood.
	   Two men were arrested Monday morning for questioning about the
firebombing that killed the Quinn brothers: Richard, 10, Mark, 9,
and Jason, 7, in their home in a Protestant area of Ballymoney, 40
miles (60 kms) northwest of Belfast. Their Catholic mother, Chrissy
Quinn, and her Protestant partner escaped safely.
	   The Orange Order called for a period of silence at all
gatherings Monday as a mark of respect. ``What we want today is a
peaceful today throughout the province,'' said John McCrea, grand
secretary of the Orange Order.
	   The morning passed without confrontations.
	   In Bellaghy in County Londonderry, local Orange leader Robert
Overend led a march to a barricade preventing them from going
through a Catholic area, where they read a statement condemning the
residents, the police and the Parades Commission. But just as they
did last year, they did not try to force their way through.

PLO official urges Arab unity against Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A senior PLO official who has opposed his
organization's peace accords with Israel called Monday for Arab
unity to confront hard-line Israeli policies.
	   Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the political department of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, also said that Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ``provocative acts'' against
Palestinians would lead to a new Middle East war.
	   ``Things are headed toward a new cycle of violence in the region
because of Netanyahu's provocative acts, namely the Judaization of
Jerusalem. These things are bound to lead to a flare-up in the
region,'' he told reporters after meeting with Foreign Minister
Faris Bweiz.
	   Kaddoumi was referring to a new Israeli plan to expand
Jerusalem's municipal authority, which has outraged Palestinians
and Arab states.
	   Kaddoumi, who arrived here Saturday from Syria, discussed with
Bweiz the current deadlock in Arab-Israeli peace negotiations and
the conditions of some 350,000 Palestinians living in refugee camps
in Lebanon.
	   Kaddoumi is a strong opponent of Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreements.
	   ``The (Palestinian-Israeli) negotiations are moving in a vicious
circle,'' Kaddoumi said.
	   ``There is a need for the convening of an expanded Arab and
Muslim summit to adopt a united stand against Israel's
intransigence,'' he added.
	   Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been frozen since
March 1997.

British doctor uses old drill in life-saving bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Newly arrived British doctor Steve
Hindley learned about Australian ``bush medicine'' when he had to
use an old-fashioned hand drill to save the life of an injured
football player.
	   Hindley used the brace-and-bit drill to bore a hole into Hayden
McGlinn's skull to relieve pressure on his brain when the young
Australian Rules player lapsed into unconsciousness after a match.
	   The doctor had started work in Ravensthorpe, a small town 530
kilometers (330 miles) southeast of Perth, the day before the
incident two weeks ago.
	   The 23-year-old McGlinn remembered nothing of a collision with
an opposing player, but later developed a headache, had several
seizures and stopped breathing, published reports said Sunday.
	   Hindley phoned the neurosurgery unit at Sir Charles Gairdner
Hospital in Perth for assistance. They advised him to try to find a
hand drill and sterilize the bit before drilling a hole in
McGlinn's left temple to drain the blood pressing on his brain.
	   McGlinn's girlfriend Dinah, 21, and several teammates joined in
a search for a drill. One was located in a garden shed at a nearby
school.
	   Hindley then performed what is known as ``burr hole'' surgery on
McGlinn.
	   Hospital officials said that if Hayden had not had the urgent
surgery, he almost certainly would have died. Additional surgery
was done at a hospital later to remove the rest of the blood clots,
and McGlinn is now recovering and awaiting transfer to a
rehabilitation hospital.

Russia, Cyprus reaffirm missile deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report of Turkey military exercises in Israel,
Israeli denial. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin and visiting Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides on Monday reaffirmed a deal that will
send Russian anti-aircraft missiles on Cyprus, but they declined to
set a date.
	   Russia is selling the S-300 missiles to Clerides' government,
which controls the ethnic Greek side of the divided island nation.
	   Turkey, which supports the ethnic Turkish side of the island, is
angered by the deal and has threatened to use force to prevent the
deployment of the weapons.
	   A Turkish newspaper, Hurriyet, reported Monday that Turkish
pilots and warplanes conducted assault exercises in Israel against
Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles last week.
	   The Israeli foreign ministry said the report was ``groundless,''
and added that the ties between Turkey and Israel ``are not under
any circumstances aimed against any third party.''
	   Turkey claims the deployment of the missiles later this year is
a menace both to Turkish Cypriots and to Turkey itself, and has
threatened pre-emptive strikes against them.
	   During their Kremlin meeting, Yeltsin and Clerides ``confirmed
their readiness to fully meet their obligations'' on the missile
contract, Yeltsin's foreign policy advisor, Sergei Prokhodko, told
reporters after the talks.
	   Clerides also thanked Yeltsin for Russia's efforts to help
settle the long-standing dispute in Cyprus between the Greek and
Turkish communities, Russian news reports said.
	   Before arriving in Moscow, Clerides said he was ready to delay
the missiles deployment if Turkey agreed to discuss
demilitarization of the island.
	   The S-300 is similar to the U.S. Patriot missile, which was used
against Iraqi missiles during the Gulf War.
	   Russian officials previously said they planned to deliver the
missiles in August, but Cyprus asked that delivery be postponed
until the fall, according to news reports.
	   Yeltsin and Clerides didn't discuss the timetable for the
delivery of the missiles, Prokhodko said.
	   Cyprus has been divided into Greek and Turkish communities since
1974, when Turkish troops invaded following an abortive coup by
ethnic Greeks who supported union with Greece.
	   Clerides' government is recognized internationally, while the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state is recognized only by Turkey.
	   The United States and Western European governments have called
on Cyprus to cancel the missile order, and the United Nations has
also voiced concern over the deal, fearing it could escalate
tensions on the island.

Asia frets over Japanese political turmoil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with White House statement in grafs 18-19 &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Japan-Election &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The resignation of Japan's prime minister Monday
met a chilly reception elsewhere in Asia, where leaders worried
political turmoil could delay moves to fix the troubled region's
biggest economy.
	   The crumbling of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's government
comes as other Asian countries are looking to Japan for help in
putting back together their own shattered finances.
	   ``A strong government in Japan that can provide effective
leadership is a crucial factor in the efforts to restore economic
stability and growth in Asia,'' the Thai Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
	   The ministry said measures to stimulate the Japanese economy,
restructure its financial sector and stabilize the yen were all
``vital'' to the region's economic health.
	   Japan's closest neighbor, South Korea, had no official comment,
but government figures privately fretted that Japanese instability
could hurt the rest of Asia.
	   The resignation, triggered by the defeat of Hashimoto's Liberal
Democratic Party in elections Sunday, received close attention in
the South Korean media.
	   ``In the short term, Japan's political instability will have a
negative impact on Asia's economic recovery,'' the Hankyoreh, a
national daily, said in an editorial.
	   ``But in the long term, his resignation may have a positive
impact, because the next government is certain to push bold
economic programs,'' the paper said.
	   In Beijing, officials reacted mildly to the moves in Japan,
concentrating on a continuation of the two countries' warming
relations rather than on the economy.
	   The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it had ``taken note'' of
Sunday's elections in Japan.
	   ``We ... hope Japan's political situation will remain stable,''
the ministry said in a brief statement.
	   Indonesian leaders also stressed the need to maintain close
relations with Japan despite the impending departure of Hashimoto,
who had been in office for more than two years.
	   Speaking to reporters after meeting with President B.J. Habibie,
State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said ties between the two countries
were solid.
	   ``The relationship has been built over a long time and a change
of government either for Indonesia or Japan won't affect ... the
countries' relationship,'' said Akbar, who was elected chairman of
the ruling Golkar party this past weekend.
	   ``We hope Japanese investors will continue to come to
Indonesia,'' said Akbar. ``I expect Japanese investment to continue
and, if possible, to increase.''
	   Australian Treasurer Peter Costello urged the incoming Japanese
government to stay the course of reform set by Hashimoto.
	   ``From our point of view it is important that the Japanese
government continue to work on sorting out the financial system,''
he said. ``This is very important to Japan's prospects and Japan's
prospects are very important to Asia's prospects.''
	   In Washington, the White House issued a statement emphasizing
its enduring close ties with Tokyo.
	   ``We look forward to working with the new Japanese government
and, in the meantime, we will continue close consultation and
cooperation with the Japanese government,'' the statement said.

Berlusconi convicted in another corruption case in Italy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with appeal announced, separate trial on accounting
charges; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Silvio Berlusconi, the media baron and
Italian opposition leader, was convicted Monday of corruption in
yet another legal setback to the former premier.
	   A Milan court sentenced him to two years, four months in prison
for making illegal contributions in 1991 to the Socialist Party of
ex-Premier Bettino Craxi.
	   Last Wednesday, Berlusconi was convicted of bribing tax
inspectors and sentenced to two years and nine months in prison. In
December he was convicted in a case centering on a film company
deal and given a suspended 16-month sentence.
	   It was unlikely Berlusconi would serve the other sentences; most
prison terms under three years for white collar crimes are later
suspended.
	   Defense lawyer Ennio Amodio said Berlusconi would appeal.
	   Berlusconi, who heads a center-right political coalition, has
long denied the corruption charges, claiming he is the victim of a
political vendetta by left-leaning prosecutors.
	   ``He just keeps getting convictions even when there's no
wrong-doing,'' Amodio said. ``This is because he is a `special
defendant.' ''
	   As in the previous cases, Berlusconi's political allies in the
center-right Freedom Alliance coalition rallied around their leader
and denounced the verdict as a political attack.
	   ``Berlusconi knows he can count like never before on the strong
solidariety of all his allies,'' said Pierferdinando Casini, leader
of a small centrist party.
	   The court also fined Berlusconi 10 billion lire (dlrs 5.6
million).
	   Craxi, who now lives in Tunisia and was tried in absentia, also
was convicted in the case. He received a four-year term and 20
billion lire fine (dlrs 11.2 million).
	   ``The massacre continues: another `special trial' with the
decision already decided even before it begins,'' Craxi was quoted
as saying by the ANSA news agency.
	   Prosecutors alleged that Berlusconi and his associates funneled
the illegal contributions to Craxi through a holding company called
All Iberian, and that the books of Berlusconi's businesses were
doctored to cover up the outlay.
	   A trial on the false accounting charge was scheduled for
September.
	   Investigators said the payments through All Iberian totaled dlrs
6.6 million.
	   Craxi was a friend to Berlusconi during the go-go 1980s in
Milan, and reportedly gave him political backing as Berlusconi
built up his television empire into the only rival to the state
broadcasting system.
	   Craxi was one of the most prominent of the once-powerful
political figures brought down by the wave of corruption
investigations starting in 1992 known as ``Clean Hands.'' He has
been convicted at least five times for corruption.

Brother of U.S. first lady in Cambodia on business trip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The brother-in-law of U.S. President
Bill Clinton met Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Monday and praised the
country, in the throes of a violent election campaign, as a land of
great business opportunity.
	   Tony Rodham, a business consultant, and three associates gave a
news conference in a luxury hotel owned by a local businessman
barred from the United States because of suspected involvement in
drug trafficking. Rodham said he was unaware of the connection.
	   Rodham said that his group was on a private fact-finding mission
to assess the business climate and that opportunities were
``tremendous.'' They also wanted to see ``how the group can assist
in the private sector and humanitarian needs.''
	   They met Hun Sen as part of a long-scheduled visit that comes
two weeks before elections Hun Sen has called to restore legitimacy
and aid lost when he deposed his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, in a bloody contest for power last year.
	   Rodham called the timing of the trip a ``coincidence'' but said
that if the three-day visit ``does help promote a peaceful election
process, then I consider that an added plus.''
	   Rodham's business group was to return Tuesday to the United
States and brief business contacts and clients there about the
types of opportunities that they think are available _
telecommunications, rubber production, medical supplies and many
others.
	   ``We came to see what fits here in Cambodia, and there are many
fits,'' Rodham said.
	   His group has worked together for close to five years and has
made similar fruitful trips to Kuwait, Romania and Japan, he said.
	   The United States has taken a critical stance on Hun Sen since
he deposed Ranariddh last year, refusing to supply direct election
aid to his government.
	   Opponents have accused Hun Sen of using violence, including
murder, and fear to ensure he wins the vote.

Report: Turkish jets trained in Israel against missile sites
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Israel denies the Turkish report

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish warplanes have conducted assault
exercises in Israel against Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles _
the same weapons system Greek Cypriots plan to deploy later this
year, a newspaper claimed Monday.
	   The Israeli foreign ministry immediately called the report
``baseless.''
	   The daily Hurriyet said that six Turkish F-16s practiced radar
evasion, electronic jamming and bombing runs against the S-300
missiles in Israel last week while Greek Cypriots received training
in Russia to operate S-300s.
	   ``As Israel and Turkey announced more than once in the past,
their relationship are not aimed in any way against a particular
target,'' the Israeli foreign ministry added.
	   Turkish military officials refused to comment on the report.
	   Turkey and Israel have been developing strategic ties since
1996, exchanging warplanes for training, conducting naval maneuvers
and signing several defense and trade deals.
	   Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, visiting Israel last week,
dismissed the concerns of some Arab countries that the expanding
relations threatened regional stability.
	   Turkey claims the deployment of the S-300s is a menace both to
Turkish Cypriots and to Turkey itself and has threatened
pre-emptive strikes against them.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded
the Mediterranean island after an abortive coup that aimed to unite
the island with Greece.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A U.S. soldier has died during a desert training
exercise, the U.S. Embassy said Monday.
	   The soldier died Sunday and a ``preliminary medical evaluation
indicates that the cause of death was natural,'' the embassy said
in a statement.
	   The embassy did not disclose the identity of the soldier.
	   The remains of the deceased will be flown to the United States.
	   U.S. forces have conducted war games in Kuwait since the end of
the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The maneuvers are part of a 10-year defense agreement that
Kuwait signed with the United States after the war.

Shipowner arrested in shooting of business rival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A member of a prominent family of
shipowners was arrested Monday in connection with the shooting of a
business rival, police said.
	   Vangelis Ventouris was taken into custody by authorities
investigating the attack on Constantinos Agapitos, 40, who was
wounded in the legs and shoulder when two gunmen shot him five
times early Monday.
	   The Ventouris family, which operates a fleet of ferries, has
faced financial difficulties, Greek media reported.
	   Agapitos told police he began receiving threatening telephone
calls after his recent purchase of the ferry Pangagia Tinou II,
which had been confiscated by a bank from Ventouris Sea Lines, run
by Vangelis Ventouris.
	   Agapitos was shot as he waited at a traffic light in his car in
Greece's main port, Piraeus, about 10 kilometers (six miles) south
of Athens. Doctors said his condition was not life threatening.
	   He told police he recognized at least one of the assailants.
	   Agapitos, whose family owns the Agapitos Lines passenger
ferries, is considered part of the new generation of Greek
shipowners. Agapitos is in charge of the Agapitos Express Ferries
division, which has seven vessels.
	   Andreas Panagos, president of the shipping agents' association,
was quoted by Greek media as saying it ``was natural'' that an
up-and-coming shipowner such as Agapitos ``would create some
enemies.''

Italian judge throws out case against U.S. Marines in gondola

<TEXT>
	   TRENTO, Italy (AP) _ An Italian judge on Monday dropped the case
against the crew members of a Marine jet that severed a ski gondola
cable in the Alps, leaving any decision to U.S. courts.
	   Judge Carlo Ancona ruled that Italian courts lacked
jurisdiction.
	   Trento Prosecutor Francantonio Granero had pushed for
manslaughter charges in Italy even though the Italian government
has acquiesced in American prosecution of the four crewmen. He said
he would decide on an appeal after reading the full decision, which
was expected in 15 days.
	   Twenty people were killed in the Feb. 3 accident, which set off
a crisis in U.S.-Italian relations and demands by some for a
closing of U.S. bases in Italy.
	   Monday's hearing took place just three days after a U.S. general
ordered two of the crewmen tried for manslaughter.
	   Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commander of Marine Corps Forces Atlantic,
ruled Friday that there is enough evidence for a court-martial for
Capt. Richard J. Ashby, the pilot, and Capt. Joseph P. Schweitzer,
the navigator.
	   Dave Beck, an attorney for Schweitzer, said he was glad the
``potential burden'' of Italian charges was lifted. ``Now we have
some monumental problems to take care of trying to get a fair trial
in this country,'' he said.

Israeli jets attack guerrilla positions in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired missiles at
suspected guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon Monday, Lebanese
security officials said.
	   Two fighters fired four air-to-surface missiles at guerrilla
hideouts in the hills and valleys of Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah
stronghold that faces an Israeli-occupied border enclave in south
Lebanon, the officials said.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from the area, but there was no
immediate word on casualties from the raid, the second in south
Lebanon in a week.
	   Lebanese army and Hezbollah anti-aircraft guns fired at the jets
but missed, the officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Last Tuesday, Israeli warplanes attacked suspected guerrilla
positions in Shiite Muslim villages facing the occupied zone
following firefights between Israeli troops and guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah. There were no casualties in that raid.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 members of the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia from the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern towns
from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

Russia, IMF reach agreement on bailout package, official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After weeks of negotiations, the International
Monetary Fund and other lenders have agreed on a dlrs 14.8 billion
loan package to help stabilize Russia's tattered financial markets,
officials said Monday.
	   The tentative deal is in line with Russia's request for up to
dlrs 15 billion to see it through the latest financial crisis.
Millions of Russians have been pushed into poverty by the country's
shrinking economy during the 1990s, and the infusion of cash is
designed to ward off another big downturn.
	   ``We are convinced that these resources will allow us to
significantly strengthen the anti-crisis efforts of the government
and will help to stabilize and strengthen the Russian economy,''
Russia's lead negotiator Anatoly Chubais told journalists Monday.
	   The agreement calls for the IMF to provide dlrs 12.5 billion,
while the World Bank will chip in 1.7 billion and Japan will
provide dlrs 600 million, Interfax reported. In Japan, where
Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko is visiting, the two
countries put the Japanese loan at dlrs 800 million.
	   The IMF's board must formally approve the agreement, and a
meeting is scheduled next Monday in Washington, Chubais said.
	   The latest crisis comes at a time when many Russian workers are
receiving their salaries months late and labor unrest is on the
rise. Also, the Russian ruble has been under threat of a
devaluation, a development that would push up prices and inflict
further economic hardship on all Russians.
	   The loan should provide President Boris Yeltsin's government
with some relief, if only temporarily.
	   ``Without (the loan), it's impossible to bring the economy out
of its tailspin,'' said Alexander Zhukov, head of the budget
affairs committee in parliament. But, he warned, ``if the
government doesn't take urgent, radical steps, it will soon run out
of this money and have to think again about where to borrow.''
	   The money could help restore confidence to the stock and bond
markets, which have taken heavy hits in recent months as foreign
investors have abandoned Russia. The stock market index was up by
almost 4 percent at midday Monday on word of the loan agreement.
	   ``This is good news, and the question is whether the excitement
about the loan will (outweigh) the other problems,'' said Dmitri
Kryukov, trader at Renaissance Capital brokerage in Moscow.
	   Economists have noted that the loan does nothing to address
perennial problems such as the government budget deficit and a
porous tax collection system.
	   ``Unless we see some fundamental change in Russia, I don't
expect to see much change in the market,'' Kryukov added.
	   There was no immediate word on what conditions the IMF would
impose on Russia in exchange for the loan.
	   The IMF has often been critical of Russia's inability to collect
taxes, which leaves the government chronically short of cash.
	   The Yeltsin administration recently proposed more than 20
measures to stabilize the economy, most aimed at reforming the
unwieldy tax system.
	   However, the Communists who lead parliament have balked at
measures that would raise taxes, and it's not clear whether they
will give their blessing to the entire program. Parliament plans a
special session Wednesday for further debate on the measures.
	   Russia's latest financial crisis struck in May, the result of
several factors: a sharp drop in the prices of Russia's oil
exports, a wave of labor protests, and general skittishness linked
to the Asian financial crisis.
	   The stock market has lost more than half its value since the
beginning of the year, and the Central Bank has been spending its
hard-currency reserves to support the ruble, which is trading at
about 6.2 to the U.S. dollar.
	   Much of the IMF loan is expected to go to shore up the Central
Bank's reserves, as well has help meet Russia's short-term debt
payments, which make up about one-third of the federal budget.

	   PARIS (AP) _ After a night of partying and a morning to sleep it
off, hundreds of thousands again took to the Champs-Elysees Monday,
this time to acclaim in person ``Les Bleus'' _ the beloved heroes
of France's World Cup win.
	   The players were planning to ride up the grand avenue in an
open-topped bus, although from the looks of the packed street, it
appeared it wouldn't be easy.
	   Just as they were on Sunday, the subways were again filled with
cheering, chanting people, young and old, their faces still painted
the red, white and blue of the French flag.
	   France's stunning 3-0 victory over Brazil sent the country into
a paroxysm of patriotic celebration not seen since the World War II
Liberation, and it was expected to last through Tuesday _ Bastille
Day.
	   ``The day of glory has arrived,'' France's national anthem goes,
and the French were singing it everywhere.
	   The merrymaking was marred, however, by an accident on the
Champs-Elysees, the grand avenue crowned by the Arc de Triomphe.
	   As more than a million people gathered on the avenue in the
early morning hours, a panicked driver careened out of control and
plowed into a crowd of revelers, injuring 80 people, 11 seriously.
	   The celebratory mood of the early morning hours quickly turned
into horror as dozens of ambulances and 200 rescue workers
converged on the scene. Some of the victims were treated on the
ground. None were critically injured, however, officials said.
	   The driver, a 44-year-old schoolteacher who is undergoing
psychiatric treatment, panicked and ran away from the scene, an
official source said on condition of anonymity.
	   It was a sour note in an otherwise ecstatic night for the
French, who have never had a World Cup championship despite having
invented the tournament.
	   This was the first time a host team won the World Cup since
Argentina's victory in 1978. Brazil won the trophy in 1994, its
fourth time.
	   ``Amazing! World champions for the first time!'' shouted
Christian Junker, 19, carrying one end of a giant French flag as he
rushed out of the Saint-Denis stadium after the game.
	   He and two friends _ all with faces painted the red, white and
blue of the flag _ had traveled from the Lorraine region and slept
the previous night on the grass, near the Eiffel Tower.
	   The three, all students, took issue with the prevailing view of
French fans as less devoted than those in other countries.
	   ``Not true! We believed in our team all along,'' said Julien
Charoin, 20. And the triumph, they said, would mean a new sense of
unity for France, which has its problems with racial and class
tensions.
	   ``This victory brings everyone together,'' said Cedric Trunzler,
21. ``There are many races and religions here. But we are all
French. We all won.''
	   France found itself unified by a multiracial team. Lilian
Thuram, a black from the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, scored two
goals against Croatia to win the semifinal.
	   On Sunday, though, it was the beloved Zinedine Zidane, the son
of an Algerian night watchman in Marseille, who was the hero. His
two goals gave France an unbeatable lead. For the icing on the
cake, Emmanuel Petit scored a third with less than a minute to go.
	   Zidane far outshined Brazil's Ronaldo, who nearly missed the
game with an injured ankle.
	   ``Brazil was comatose,'' said one of its dejected fans, Cesar
Lapaglia, 27. ``We just didn't play,'' he said into his drink at a
Brazilian bar in the Left Bank.
	   ``I'm going back to my hotel,'' said Jose Luiz Pascoal, 38, who
came from Rio de Janeiro to support the Brazilian team.
	   ``I just don't know what happened,'' he said outside the
stadium. ``I'm very, very sad. Won't be able to work for a week.''
	   When the final whistle sounded, shouts of ``We are the
champions'' echoed from crowds moving toward the Champs-Elysees
from all over Paris: the Left Bank, the packed City Hall plaza, the
elegant shopping streets of the Champs-Elysees area.
	   They partied in front of the vast Louvre museum and the
manicured Tuileries gardens, and also in front of ``Paris Sexy
Folies'' in a gritty northern neighborhood.
	   Youths used beer cans for soccer balls, or anything else they
could find.
	   Traffic was impossible. Cars that could manage to move at all
were often surrounded by groups of raucous fans. People begged
taxis to stop, usually to no avail.
	   It wasn't much different in other parts of the country. In
Bordeaux, Lille and Marseille, thousands clogged central squares
and jumped into fountains to celebrate.
	   In Brazil, where a fifth victory was expected, fans expressed
disbelief. Many Brazilians had tears in their eyes as they stared
at a large public television screen mounted on Copacabana beach.
	   ``We lost, but second is still great,'' said Marinede da Costa,
a 28-year-old secretary who watched on the Copacabana screen.
	   But the glory belonged to France, and as the sun came up Monday,
the car horns were still honking away.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ American sailors poured ashore in this
prosperous city-state Monday as one of the U.S. Navy's biggest
aircraft carriers arrived for a five-day visit before continuing to
the Middle East.
	   More than 5,500 sailors serve the carrier and its 80 combat and
support aircraft. Sailors aboard the giant vessel are on average
only 19 years old.
	   ``Our ships are run by teen-agers,'' said Adm. Bill Putnam,
commander of the battle group that includes USS Abraham Lincoln.
	   ``And I feel really good about the opportunity to show this city
to our young generation,'' he added.
	   About 10 percent of the ship's sailors are women, which reflects
the overall gender ratio in the U.S. Navy.
	   U.S. Navy maintains a logistic base in Singapore, a close ally
of the United States.
	   U.S. Ambassador Steven Green told a newspaper Sunday that the
ship's visit demonstrates ``another example of the U.S. commitment
to the region.''
	   ``We have a presence here. We have a responsibility here. And
the United States intends to maintain this presence and
responsibility to its friends,'' Green told The Sunday Times.

NATO chief meets with Bosnian opposition leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - A delegation of Bosnian opposition
leaders met Monday with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana to
brief him on the current situation in Bosnia and discuss the
Alliance's role in the region.
	   The Bosnians held an ``exchange of views'' with Solana on the
NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia and on the alliance's
relations with Partnership for Peace countries, said a NATO
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   He said Solana had invited the leaders of the eight Bosnian
opposition parties to Brussels during his visit to the Balkans
earlier this month.
	   The delegation will meet Tuesday with European Union officials
to discuss topics such as security policy and EU aid programs for
Bosnia.
	   The Bosnians will not meet any of the EU Commissioners, most of
whom will be in Strasbourg this week for their regular Commission
meeting, EU spokeswoman Patricia O'Connor said.
	   Earlier this month, Solana attended a two-day NATO seminar in
Sarajevo on the development of democratic practices in the country.

IMF delegation to visit Ukraine this month
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - A mission of the International Monetary
Fund will arrive in Ukraine on July 23 to continue negotiations
with the government over a dlrs 2.5 billion multi-year loan, a top
official said Monday.
	   It might be the final trip by an IMF delegation before it
recommends that the IMF board of directors approve the loan, said
Valery Lytvytsky, an aide to President Leonid Kuchma.
	   The former Soviet republic is currently negotiating the
three-year loan from the IMF, and has already had a series of talks
with IMF officials over the issue.
	   A high-ranking government delegation met with IMF executives in
Washington last week, where the agreement was reached to send the
IMF mission to Kiev, Lytvytsky told the Interfax news agency.
	   The IMF's approval of the loan would signal resumption of the
fund's aid to Ukraine, which was suspended this spring due to
stalled reforms and excessive state spending.
	   IMF Deputy Director Stanley Fischer visited Ukraine last month
and praised the government's efforts to reform the economy,
indicating that the country may finally meet all the requirements
for disbursement of the loan.
	   Lytvytsky said Ukraine needs to implement 33 conditions to
qualify for the loan. These include parliamentary approval of the
revised 1998 budget with a smaller deficit, implementation of a
number of economic decrees recently issued by Kuchma, and the
signing of new decrees on a new, smaller value-added tax and
administrative reform measures.
	   The government approved the revised budget earlier this month,
bringing the deficit down to 2.3 percent of gross domestic product.
	   However, the Cabinet's reform efforts might be nullified by the
new leftist parliament, which has a right to veto Kuchma's decrees
and is authorized to approve the new budget, prepared by the
government.
	   Kuchma asked lawmakers to approve the new budget last week,
warning that a failure to do so will throw Ukraine into a financial
crisis the country ``will not be able to recover from.''
	   In what may further complicate Ukraine's ongoing talks with the
IMF, the government has failed to keep the budget deficit in the
first half of 1998 within the limits set by the lending agency.
	   The deficit totaled 2.2 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.1 billion) as of
July 1, which is 203 million hryvna (dlrs 102 million) more than
the IMF's target, according to the Finance Ministry.
	   However, Lytvytsky said that the government would soon bring the
deficit into the limits set by the IMF.

World Cup: France savors its `day of glory' after stunning win

	   PARIS (AP) _ After a night of partying and a morning to sleep it
off, hundreds of thousands again took to the Champs-Elysees Monday,
this time to acclaim in person ``Les Bleus'' _ the beloved heroes
of France's World Cup win.
	   The players were planning to ride up the grand avenue in an
open-topped bus, although from the looks of the packed street, it
appeared it wouldn't be easy.
	   Just as they were on Sunday, the subways were again filled with
cheering, chanting people, young and old, their faces still painted
the red, white and blue of the French flag.
	   France's stunning 3-0 victory over Brazil sent the country into
a paroxysm of patriotic celebration not seen since the World War II
Liberation, and it was expected to last through Tuesday _ Bastille
Day.
	   ``The day of glory has arrived,'' France's national anthem goes,
and the French were singing it everywhere.
	   The merrymaking was marred, however, by an accident on the
Champs-Elysees, the grand avenue crowned by the Arc de Triomphe.
	   As more than a million people gathered on the avenue in the
early morning hours, a panicked driver careened out of control and
plowed into a crowd of revelers, injuring 80 people, 11 seriously.
	   The celebratory mood of the early morning hours quickly turned
into horror as dozens of ambulances and 200 rescue workers
converged on the scene. Some of the victims were treated on the
ground. None were critically injured, however, officials said.
	   The driver, a 44-year-old schoolteacher who is undergoing
psychiatric treatment, panicked and ran away from the scene, an
official source said on condition of anonymity.
	   It was a sour note in an otherwise ecstatic night for the
French, who have never had a World Cup championship despite having
invented the tournament.
	   This was the first time a host team won the World Cup since
Argentina's victory in 1978. Brazil won the trophy in 1994, its

	   ``Amazing! World champions for the first time!'' shouted

No longer unbeatable at 400, Johnson slowly coming back
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Michael Johnson isn't used to rebounding from
defeat. He rarely needs to.
	   But the double Olympic champion will be looking to prevent a
losing streak when he lines up for the 400 meters Tuesday night at
the Golden Gala meet.
	   Still fighting injury-related rust, Johnson faded over the final
stretch in Oslo, Norway, last week en route to a startling
third-place finish _ just his second loss of the 1990s in the 400.
	   He'll have a chance to gain some revenge against the two men who
beat him in Oslo, Britons Mark Richardson and Iwan Thomas, at
Rome's Olympic Stadium.
	   Johnson is among more than two dozen world or Olympic champions
competing in the second leg of the new Golden League. The six-meet
series offers dlrs 1 million for anyone who can win at each venue.
	   Other entrants include women's 100 meters world champion Marion
Jones, who will run that race and then have about half an hour to
rest ahead of the long jump; men's 100 world champ Maurice Greene,
who'll face the 200 titlist, Ato Boldon, in the dash; and world and
Olympic 10,000 winner Haile Gebreselassie, looking to lower his own
mark for the 5,000.
	   ``People expect me to go out and win every time. It's not easy
to do that,'' Johnson said Monday. ``It's been difficult with the
injuries. I'm not ready at this point. But at this point I need
races rather than staying home and training.''
	   The American has been hampered for about four months by a hurt
Achilles and problems with both hamstrings.
	   He acknowledged he's far from the spectacular form he displayed
at the Atlanta Olympics, producing an unprecedented sweep of the
200 and 400 titles plus an electrifying record of 19.32 seconds in
the former.
	   ``In 1996 I was completely healthy,'' Johnson said. ``Because of
the injuries now I had to lose some time training. I don't know
what percentage I am now.''
	   Before the off-night in Oslo, Johnson's only defeat of the
decade in the 400 came in June, 1997, when he was fifth in a race
in Paris. That snapped a streak of 58 consecutive wins, dating to
February 1989.
	   Less than two months after the Paris setback, Johnson bounced
back to take a repeat world title in the 400.
	   There have been few setbacks during the brief but brilliant
track career of Jones, a former college basketball standout who on
Monday reiterated her desire to take a crack at five gold medals at
the 2000 Olympics _ in the 100, 200, long jump, 400 relay and 1,600
relay.
	   ``I train to be No. 1. Second place isn't good enough,'' the
world's top-ranked female sprinter said. ``If I'm at my best I
can't be beat.''
	   Greene, by contrast, has suffered something of a sophomore slump
this season. After his burst to prominence in 1997 with national
and world titles in the 100, he pulled out of the U.S.
championships last month with leg and stomach cramps and then was
beaten by veteran Frankie Fredericks at Oslo in what Greene called
``a rusty race.''

Rebels kill official, two children in Rwanda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels killed a local official and
his two children in an attack in northwestern Rwanda, authorities
said Monday.
	   Officials said the rebels shot dead Johnson Ruranjwa, an
official in Kigombwe, about 90 kilometers (55 miles) northwest of
Kigali, and his two children.
	   They then burned his car before disappearing into the nearby
mountains, where they are believed to be hiding.
	   Last week, army spokesman Maj. Emmanuel Ndahiro said government
troops killed more than 50 rebels on Rwanda's northwest border with
the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
	   The rebels had been hiding in the forests or had crossed from
neighboring Congo.
	   Thousands of people have been killed in rebel attacks since the
return from exile in November 1996 of more than 1 million Hutu
refugees.
	   Former Hutu soldiers and militiamen lived among bona fide
refugees when they fled Rwanda in mid-1994, fearing reprisals for
the slaughter of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically
moderate Hutus.
	   The Hutu-organized genocide was stopped in July 1994 when
Tutsi-led rebels took power.
	   But attacks against the Tutsi survivors, local authorities, tea
factories and Hutus suspected of collaborating with the authorities
continue.
	   After the attacks spread from the northwest, a traditional Hutu
strongold, to central and western Rwanda, the army used troops,
tanks and helicopters to restore order.
	   The government has recently claimed success in trying to
convince the predominantly Hutu population to cooperate with the
authorities in arresting those suspected of attacks.

Two people killed, one wounded by World War II shell explosion in
</HEADLINE>
Ukraine &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Two villagers died and one was injured
Monday while trying to dismantle a World War II artillery shell
found in central Ukraine, officials said.
	   The shell exploded before dawn Monday as a 39-year-old resident
of the Novo-Tripovka village attempted to take it apart, using a
hammer and a screwdriver.
	   The man and his 25-year-old common law wife were killed, and a
teenager who also was present received shrapnel wounds in his arm
and leg, said Leonid Demchenko, a district Civil Defense chief in
the Kirovohrad region.
	   ``To our sorrow, people don't care about the dangers of our
World War II heritage,'' Demchenko told the Interfax news agency.
	   Recently, police seized an old artillery shell from another
villager in the area, who tried to smash the find against the
pavement while others watched, Demchenko said.
	   World War II shells and bombs often are found in Ukraine, which
was the site of heavy battles between Soviet and German armies.
Dozens have been discovered recently following rainfalls, floods
and repair works.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hong Kong rider Wong Kam Po raced
to the fastest time Monday in qualifying for the semifinals of the
men's 4-kilometer individual pursuit in the pre-Commonwealth Games
cycling championships.
	   Taiwan's Huang Ho-hsun led qualifiers for the women's
3-kilometer pursuit semifinals.
	   Wong, who earlier won a bronze medal in the 120-kilometer road
race, finished his qualifying race in 4 minutes, 59.97 seconds.
	   The other three in the semifinals later Monday were Thailand's

Lisbon world's fair falls short of visitor targets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Fewer than 50,000 people per day _ less
than half the expected number _ have visited the Lisbon world's
fair during its first 50 days, according to figures published
Monday.
	   The organizers had predicted a total 13 million visits between
opening day on May 22 and closure on Sept. 30. But up to last
Thursday, Expo 98 had received just 2.4 million visits.
	   ``Our studies were too optimistic,'' spokeswoman Clara Ferreira
Alves said.
	   The fair cost some dlrs 2 billion and included a massive
330-hectare (815-acre) urban regeneration project around the
riverside site on the eastern side of the city.
	   Ticket revenue and associated real estate development were
forecast to cover 85 percent of the investment, with taxpayers
meeting the shortfall.
	   Ferreira Alves said real estate sales were exceeding
expectations.
	   ``Ticket revenue is not central to Expo's success. The sale of
landplots will be a lot more significant,'' she said, though she
was unable to provide new figures on the forecast total revenue.

Revenues from Russian arms sales rise in 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's state arms exporter made millions of
dollars more in sales for the first half of 1998 than it did for
the same period last year, a news agency reported Monday.
	   Citing unidentified sources, the Interfax news agency said the
Rosvooruzheniye arms exporter plans to surpass last year's total
sales revenue by a billion dollars.
	   The company attributed the increased revenue to lucrative arms
contracts in a number of new markets, Interfax said, without
providing details.
	   Meanwhile, President Boris Yeltsin met with Rosvooruzheniye
General Director Yevgeny Anayev on Monday to discuss measures for
increasing Russia's arms exports, Interfax said.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Lawmakers opposed to reserving a third
of India's parliament seats for women prevented debate on the
proposal Monday by snatching the bill from the law minister's hands
and ripping it into pieces.
	   ``What has happened today is unprecedented and shameful,'' Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee told reporters later, adding that he
hadn't seen anything like it in more than four decades of his
parliamentary career.
	   Vajpayee, who has vowed to get the bill passed this year, was
consulting with the speaker on the best way to succeed. Parliament
was scheduled to resume Tuesday.
	   Protests had forced parliament Speaker G.M.C. Balayogi to
adjourn proceedings five times Monday. He called lawmakers the
final time late in the evening, determined to have Law Minister M.
Thambi Durai introduce the bill.
	   Nearly 30 lawmakers from three opposition groups, representing
lower castes and Muslims, stormed to the front of the chamber. One
of them, Suresh Yadav of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, took a copy of
the bill from the parliament speaker's desk, then grabbed another
copy from Durai and tore up both.
	   As protesting lawmakers shouted anti-government slogans,
Balayogi announced the session was adjourned for the day.
	   Members of the Rashtriya Janata Dal and other parties said they
won't let the bill be considered unless it includes quotas within
the quota for the minorities they represent.
	   If the government can get the bill introduced, it believes it
can pass it with the help of the main opposition parties _ Congress
and leftist groups.
	   The bill, meant to increase women's participation in India's
democracy, was first introduced in 1996 by a previous government,
but met with similar opposition and never came to a vote. Women
leaders accused men in parliament of being unwilling to surrender
any control.
	   Women's organizations supporting the bill were furious with the
delays.
	   S.A. Lalitha, coordinator of the Joint Women's Program, told The
Associated Press the speaker should eject members who are
disrupting parliament so the bill could be introduced. She said
women would be willing to consider the amendments being suggested,
but only once the proposal had been submitted for debate.

Hopkins study links clinical depression to heart ailments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Men who are clinically depressed are twice as
likely as those who aren't to suffer heart attacks or develop other
heart illnesses, according to a study published Monday.
	   The study by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine confirms what
10 other surveys have found, but researchers at the Baltimore
institution went beyond previous studies by analyzing cholesterol
and blood pressure measurements.
	   However, their study depended on subjects' self-reports of
clinical depression _ defined as a cluster of symptoms such as
sadness and hopelessness persisting two weeks or more _ rather than
on findings from standardized interviews.
	   The researchers tracked 1,190 male medical students enrolled at
Hopkins between 1948 and 1964 and published their findings in the
American Medical Association's Archives of Internal Medicine.
	   Twelve percent of the men reported suffering at least one
episode of clinical depression during 40 years of follow-up since
the study began in 1948. They were twice as likely to develop
coronary artery disease or suffer a heart attack compared to
healthy peers, the study shows.
	   The increased risk was present even for heart attacks occurring
10 years after the first depressive episode, said the researchers,
led by Dr. Daniel E. Ford, who teaches medicine, epidemiology and
health policy management at Johns Hopkins.
	   ``Does depression cause heart disease? I think the evidence
shows that it does,'' Ford said.
	   Additionally, the researchers studied 150 women _ the results
were the same after accounting for other conditions such as
diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking and high cholesterol that
can contribute to heart problems.
	   Scientists aren't sure why depression may lead to heart
problems. Some suspect that stress hormones, which are elevated in
depressed people, may cause harm to the heart when elevated for
long periods. Another theory is that depressed people are more
prone to blood clots.
	   Also unclear is if treating depression would reduce the risk of
premature death from heart disease.
	   Dr. Robert Carney, a medical psychologist at Washington
University in St. Louis, said many studies have shown that
depressed people are up to four times more likely to die if they
have a heart attack.
	   The Johns Hopkins findings are some of the strongest in
suggesting that depression gives rise to heart ailments.
	   Clinical depression ``is a serious illness. People should report
their symptoms to the doctor,'' said Madeline Gallo, spokeswoman
for the National Mental Health Association, adding that other
studies have shown that depression occurs alongside cancer,
diabetes and other major diseases.
	   Symptoms of clinical depression include chronic sadness and
possibly anxiety, coupled with excessive guilt, hopelessness,
restlessness and irritability.

Britain's Boardman first to crash out of Tour de France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CORK, Ireland (AP) _ Chris Boardman, who held the leader's
yellow jersey for the first two days of the Tour de France, was
taken to a hospital Monday after crashing out of the second stage.
	   The crash occurred about 90 miles (150 kms) into the 127.4-mile
(205.5-km) race outside the town of Youghal.
	   The 29-year-old British rider suffered a deep cut above one eye
and was carried by stretcher into an ambulance. He was taken to a
Cork hospital for a precautionary brain scan.
	   Tour director Jean-Marie Leblanc said Boardman fell after the
front wheel of his bike touched the back wheel of his teammate on
the French Gan team, Frederic Moncassin.
	   Leblanc said Boardman struck his head against a post or stone
wall by the roadside, but that he had been protected by his helmet.
The cut above his eye had apparently caused no serious damage,
Leblanc said.
	   The withdrawal makes Boardman ineligible for the rest of the
tour and ended his goal of retaining the yellow jersey into the
first stages in France.
	   Boardman won the 1992 pursuit Olympics gold, and won the
prologue on his Tour debut in 1994. But he smashed his ankle in the
1995 prologue, finished 39th in the 1996 Tour, and in 1997 again
won the prologue but was forced to withdraw at stage 13 because of
crash injuries.
	   He had easily won this year's Dublin prologue, and retained the
yellow jersey Sunday when his main points rival, Mario Cippolini of
Italy, was himself victimized in a less serious crash at the start
of the final sprint.

Luzhkov again determined to keep nature from raining on his parade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With the opening ceremonies of the World Youth
Games threatened by a wet forecast, Mayor Yuri Luzhkov will once
again tinker with the weather to ensure that no one _ not even
nature _ rains on his parade.
	   The Russian Weather Service sent up six cloud-seeding planes to
prevent looming rain clouds from pouring on the games' opening
ceremonies, scheduled for 8:00 p.m. Monday at the giant Luzhniki
stadium, said Weather Service spokesman Anatoly Yakovlev.
	   The planes will use two methods on the clouds _ one to make them
rain before getting to Moscow, and another to keep them from
dumping their water until after they pass over the city.
	   It is not the first time Luzhkov has tried to control the skies.
Last summer during Moscow's 850th birthday celebration, the mayor
ordered similar action, but the technique was only partly
successful; a light drizzle dampened closing ceremonies at the
event.
	   Luzhkov launched the Youth Games with a media blitz and plenty
of fanfare, and wants them to go off without a hitch. With
President Boris Yeltsin, International Olympic Committee head Juan
Antonio Samaranch, and thousands of athletes from around the world
planning to attend the opening ceremonies, Monday's festivities are
particularly important.
	   The games are part of a Luzhkov plan to show that Moscow can
handle big sporting events. He has said that if the games go
successfully he will make a bid for Moscow to host the 2012
Olympics.

Israeli jets attack guerrilla positions in south Lebanon

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired missiles at
suspected guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon Monday, Lebanese
security officials said.
	   Two jets fired four air-to-surface missiles at guerrilla
hideouts in the hills and valleys of Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah
stronghold that faces an Israeli-occupied border enclave in south
Lebanon, the officials said.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from the area, but there was no
immediate word on casualties from the raid, the second in south
Lebanon in a week.
	   Lebanese army and Hezbollah anti-aircraft guns fired at the jets
but missed, the officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army confirmed the raid, saying all
planes returned safely to base.
	   Iqlim al Tuffah, a frequent target of Israeli warplanes, is used
by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group as a base to launch
attacks against Israeli troops and their allied militiamen in the
occupied zone.
	   Last Tuesday, Israeli warplanes attacked suspected guerrilla
positions in Shiite Muslim villages facing the occupied zone
following firefights between Israeli troops and Hezbollah
guerrillas. There were no casualties in that raid.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 members of the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia from the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern towns
from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The U.S. government has been
critical of Cambodian strongman Hun Sen since he staged a coup last
year, but the brother of Hillary Rodham Clinton met him Monday and
praised the country as a land of business opportunity.
	   The visit of Tony Rodham raised speculation that Hun Sen might
use his presence as an image-boosting measure in an election
campaign marred by allegations of violence against opposition
workers. The country votes for a new legislature July 26.
	   Rodham drew controversy last year when the Boston Globe reported
that a Paraguayan official had offered him dlrs 100,000 to arrange
a meeting between his brother-in-law, President Bill Clinton, and
Paraguay's leader. Rodham denied taking it.
	   On Monday, Rodham and three associates gave a news conference at
a Phnom Penh hotel owned by a local businessman barred from the
United States because of suspected involvement in drug trafficking.
Rodham said he was unaware of the connection.
	   Rodham, a Miami-based consultant, said his group was on a
private trip to assess the business climate and that opportunities
were ``tremendous.'' They also wanted to see ``how the group can
assist in the private sector and humanitarian needs.''
	   They met Hun Sen as part of a long-scheduled visit that comes
two weeks before elections Hun Sen has called to restore legitimacy
and aid lost when he deposed his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, in a bloody contest for power last year.
	   Rodham called the timing of the trip a ``coincidence'' but said
that if the three-day visit ``does help promote a peaceful election
process, then I consider that an added plus.''
	   Rodham's group was to return Tuesday to the United States and
brief business contacts and clients there about the types of
opportunities that they think are available _ telecommunications,
rubber production, medical supplies and many others.
	   ``We came to see what fits here in Cambodia, and there are many
fits,'' Rodham said.
	   His group has worked together for close to five years and has
made similar fruitful trips to Kuwait, Romania and Japan, he said.
	   The United States has taken a critical stance on Hun Sen since
he deposed Ranariddh last year, refusing to supply direct election
aid to his government.
	   Opponents have accused Hun Sen of using violence, including
murder, and fear to ensure he wins the vote.

How many people at Berlin's Love Parade? Weigh the trash!
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ What's the best way to tell how many people turned
out for a parade? Weigh the trash they leave behind, Berlin
officials said Monday.
	   Organizers of the 10th annual Love Parade insisted that the
turnout at Saturday's techno music extravaganza matched last year's
1 million, despite the cold, wet weekend weather.
	   But police put the figure at about half that. And the agency in
charge of street cleaning in Berlin said Monday it had picked up
between 150 and 200 tons of trash after the parade, compared to 260
tons last year.
	   Based on the trash, agency spokesman Bernd Mueller said they
estimated some 600,000 people attended the parade.
	   Despite the crush, only 340 people were taken to hospitals,
mostly with minor injuries or for intoxication.
	   Meanwhile, officials in charge of the Tiergarten park surveyed
the damage caused by the youthful partiers to the greenery as the
parade passed through. District mayor Joern Jensen said plants
replaced after last year's parade have been destroyed again.
	   ``It doesn't make sense any more to plant new plants when next
year a new Love Parade will just go through again,'' he complained.

German president says he might consider a second term
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Inching away from his initial refusal
to run again, German President Roman Herzog said Monday that there
were ``possible situations'' that could cause him to seek a second
term.
	   Herzog has become one of Germany's most-admired politicians
since Chancellor Helmut Kohl nominated him four years ago for the
presidency, a non-partisan and mostly ceremonial position chosen by
a special body of lawmakers.
	   With Kohl trailing badly in his bid for a fifth term, some in
Bonn have speculated that Kohl would try to persuade Herzog to
change his mind _ or at least not rule a second term out _ before
the Sept. 27 election in the hope some of Herzog's appeal would rub
off on him.
	   During a state visit to Belgium, Herzog said it was true that he
was not seeking a second five-year term after his current one
expires June 30. ``I don't want it,'' he said.
	   ``But there are possible situations where I can't withdraw
myself,'' he added, without elaborating. He said he would not
discuss the topic again until after the election.

	   PARIS (AP) _ After a night of partying and a morning to sleep it
off, hundreds of thousands again took to the Champs-Elysees Monday,
this time to acclaim in person ``Les Bleus'' _ the beloved heroes
of France's World Cup win.
	   The players inched along the grand avenue in an open-topped bus,
dressed in their World Cup jerseys and displaying the coveted
golden trophy. A crush of adoring fans engulfed the bus, their arms
outstretched.
	   ``I've been up all night,'' said Elisabeth Wallon, 22. ``It was
magnificent. I've never seen a celebration like it.''
	   Just as they were on Sunday, the subways were again filled with
cheering, chanting people, young and old, their faces still painted
the red, white and blue of the French flag.
	   France's stunning 3-0 victory over Brazil sent the country into
a paroxysm of patriotic celebration not seen since the World War II
Liberation, and it was expected to last through Tuesday _ Bastille
Day.
	   ``The day of glory has arrived,'' France's national anthem goes,
and the French were singing it everywhere.
	   The merrymaking was marred, however, by an accident on the
Champs-Elysees, the grand avenue crowned by the Arc de Triomphe.
	   As more than a million people gathered on the avenue in the
early morning hours, a panicked driver careened out of control and
plowed into a crowd of revelers, injuring 80 people, 11 seriously.
	   The celebratory mood of the early morning hours quickly turned
into horror as dozens of ambulances and 200 rescue workers
converged on the scene. Some of the victims were treated on the
ground. None were critically injured, however, officials said.
	   The driver, a 44-year-old schoolteacher who is undergoing
psychiatric treatment, panicked and ran away from the scene, an
official source said on condition of anonymity.
	   It was a sour note in an otherwise ecstatic night for the
French, who have never had a World Cup championship despite having
invented the tournament.
	   This was the first time a host team won the World Cup since
Argentina's victory in 1978. Brazil won the trophy in 1994, its
fourth time.
	   ``Amazing! World champions for the first time!'' shouted
Christian Junker, 19, carrying one end of a giant French flag as he
rushed out of the Saint-Denis stadium after the game.
	   He and two friends _ all with faces painted the red, white and
blue of the flag _ had traveled from the Lorraine region and slept
the previous night on the grass, near the Eiffel Tower.
	   The three, all students, took issue with the prevailing view of
French fans as less devoted than those in other countries.
	   ``Not true! We believed in our team all along,'' said Julien
Charoin, 20. And the triumph, they said, would mean a new sense of
unity for France, which has its problems with racial and class
tensions.
	   ``This victory brings everyone together,'' said Cedric Trunzler,
21. ``There are many races and religions here. But we are all
French. We all won.''
	   France found itself unified by a multiracial team. Lilian
Thuram, a black from the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, scored two
goals against Croatia to win the semifinal.
	   On Sunday, though, it was the beloved Zinedine Zidane, the son
of an Algerian night watchman in Marseille, who was the hero. His
two goals gave France an unbeatable lead. For the icing on the
cake, Emmanuel Petit scored a third with less than a minute to go.
	   Zidane far outshined Brazil's Ronaldo, who nearly missed the
game with an injured ankle.
	   ``Brazil was comatose,'' said one of its dejected fans, Cesar
Lapaglia, 27. ``We just didn't play,'' he said into his drink at a
Brazilian bar in the Left Bank.
	   When the final whistle sounded, shouts of ``We are the
champions'' echoed from crowds moving toward the Champs-Elysees
from all over Paris: the Left Bank, the packed City Hall plaza, the
elegant shopping streets of the Champs-Elysees area.
	   They partied in front of the vast Louvre museum and the
manicured Tuileries gardens, and also in front of ``Paris Sexy
Folies'' in a gritty northern neighborhood.
	   Youths used beer cans for soccer balls, or anything else they
could find.
	   Traffic was impossible. Cars that could manage to move at all
were often surrounded by groups of raucous fans. People begged
taxis to stop, usually to no avail.
	   It wasn't much different in other parts of the country. In
Bordeaux, Lille and Marseille, thousands clogged central squares
and jumped into fountains to celebrate.
	   In Brazil, where a fifth victory was expected, fans expressed
disbelief. Many Brazilians had tears in their eyes as they stared
at a large public television screen mounted on Copacabana beach.

Israeli jets attack guerrilla positions in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired missiles at
suspected guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon Monday, Lebanese
security officials said.
	   Two jets fired four air-to-surface missiles at guerrilla
hideouts in the hills and valleys of Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah
stronghold that faces an Israeli-occupied border enclave in south
Lebanon, the officials said.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from the area, but there was no
immediate word on casualties from the raid, the second in south
Lebanon in a week.
	   Lebanese army and Hezbollah anti-aircraft guns fired at the jets
but missed, the officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army confirmed the raid, saying all
planes returned safely to base.
	   Iqlim al Tuffah, a frequent target of Israeli warplanes, is used
by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group as a base to launch
attacks against Israeli troops and their allied militiamen in the
occupied zone.
	   Last Tuesday, Israeli warplanes attacked suspected guerrilla
positions in Shiite Muslim villages facing the occupied zone
following firefights between Israeli troops and Hezbollah
guerrillas. There were no casualties in that raid.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 members of the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia from the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern towns
from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

Governor appeals to miners to lift rail blockade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Siberian regional governor appealed to striking
miners Monday to allow a train laden with enriched uranium to pass
their blockade to avoid endangering the environment.
	   The train, carrying the uranium to a nuclear power plant in the
Tomsk region of Siberia, had been stranded for several days and
posed a threat to the environment, Kemerovo governor Aman Tuleyev
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Miners have blocked the Trans-Siberian railway for the past 11
days to protest the non-payment of wages. They are demanding the
resignation of President Boris Yeltsin, an overhaul of the economy
and the immediate payment of salaries that have gone unpaid for up
to six months.
	   Tuleyev said if the miners end their protest, even for a few
days, ``a government commission will fly to Kuzbass an hour after
the blockade has been lifted,'' Interfax reported.
	   But, he said, as long as the blockade remains in place, the
government will not negotiate with the miners.
	   The stalemate has cost the region millions of rubles and has
forced some factories to shut down because of a lack of fuel and
equipment.

Lagos calm after last week's chaos, police line streets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Life began to return to normal in Lagos on
Monday with schools and office buildings reopening after days of
rioting and chaos last week.
	   Violence in the wake of the death of Nigeria's most prominent
political prisoner rocked Lagos and the southern cities of Ibadan
and Abeokuta. At least 55 people were killed and more than 400 were
arrested.
	   Riot police continued to patrol highly visible positions in
Lagos on Monday in order to discourage new bouts of violence.
	   Moshood Abiola, Nigeria's top political prisoner and the
presumed winner of canceled 1993 presidential elections, died of an
apparent heart attack last week.
	   His death while still in custody unleashed angry protests and
underscored Nigeria's fractious ethnic divisions.
	   Abiola, a southern businessman from the Yoruba ethnic group,
posed a serious challenge to Nigeria's ruling military junta, which
is dominated by northern Muslims from the Hausa and Fulani ethnic
groups.
	   Abiola was arrested in 1994 by the late dictator Gen. Sani
Abacha. With Abacha's death last month, the country's new military
junta was expected to release Abiola along with the country's other
political prisoners.
	   Abiola died while meeting with visiting U.S. officials just days
before he was reportedly to be release. He was buried Saturday in a
garden ceremony at his sprawling Lagos estate home.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Ian Wright, Arsenal's all-time leading goal
scorer, left the Premier League champions Monday to sign a two-year
contract with London rivals West Ham.
	   The 34-year-old England striker, who joined Arsenal from Crystal
Palace in 1991, broke Cliff Bastin's club record of 178 goals in
September 1997.
	   Wright was left off England's World Cup team because of injury.
He left Arsenal rather than accepting a substitute's role behind
Dennis Bergkamp and Nicolas Anelka.

US-sponsored Belarusian radio station to broadcast from Poland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's foreign minister praised a
U.S.-sponsored project to set up an independent Belarusian radio
station in Poland, but stressed on Monday that his government will
not be involved.
	   ``The Polish government is attached to the principle of freedom
of speech,'' said Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, a former
Solidarity activist.
	   He said that because his government was not involved, he did not
expect the radio station would hurt Poland's relations with its
neighbor.
	   The station set up by Belarusian journalists is due to start
broadcasting to Belarus in fall from the Polish town of Bialystok,
200 kilometers (125 miles) northeast from Warsaw, the Polish daily
Gazeta Wyborcza reported Monday.
	   The station will be sponsored mainly by the American government,
with some money also coming from the European Union. The radio will
use the facilities of the Polish public radio.
	   Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has been widely
criticized for its human rights record, for moves to stifle the
news media and failure to achieve economic reform.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Seeking to stem the spread of light weapons,
representatives from 21 countries met Monday to create a global
campaign to control the arms that fuel conflicts around the world.
	   ``The great human costs of the excessive accumulation and
uncontrolled proliferation of small arms are the major reason for
our common concern,'' Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Aslaug Haga
said Monday as she opened the meeting.
	   No one know how many light weapons there are in the world, but
some experts say at least half the trade in weapons is illegal. In
places like Chechnya, it is sometimes easier to buy a gun than a
loaf of bread.
	   Small arms refers to weapons that can be hand-carried and fired,
including pistols, machine guns, automatic rifles and shoulder-held
grenade and missile launchers.

Did polluted water in Israeli river kill Australian athletes?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Medical witnesses testified Monday that
there was no conclusive evidence that Australian athletes killed in
a bridge collapse at the Maccabiah Games one year ago died from
pollutants in the water.
	   The bridge buckled last July 14 as about 100 members the
Australian team crossed into the Ramat Gan stadium for the opening
ceremonies of the games, plunging the athletes into the Yarkon
River below. Four team members were killed and dozens injured.
	   Reports have suggested that the deaths of two of the victims,
who died several weeks after the bridge collapse, were caused by
pollutants in the river.
	   But Dr. Amiram Lev, head of the intensive care unit at Haemek
hospital in Afula where Elizabeth Sawicki died two weeks after the
collapse, testified in Tel Aviv Magistrates Court on Monday that
Sawicki's death could have been a result of her ``near-drowning.''
	   Lev said the initial danger to Sawicki, 47, came from the water
entering her lungs, and that he could not say what caused her other
symptoms.
	   Another witness, police investigator Dana Zonenfeld, testified
that she had tested samples of fluid from Sawicki's lungs and from
the Yarkon River.
	   Zonenfeld said she did not find any poisonous substances in
Sawicki's lung fluids. But she noted that a pesticide used to spray
the river the day before the bridge accident could have evaporated
before the sample was tested.
	   Zonenfeld said that in the lung fluid of another victim, Greg
Small, she found ``similarities'' with the Yarkon River samples,
but she did not elaborate.
	   A third witness, construction worker Gal Tzachor, said the
bridge was built using construction techniques usually used to
build event stages.
	   No engineer was present during the work, he said.
	   Two contractors, the engineer who designed the bridge, the
director of the games and the chairman of the Maccabiah organizing
committee are charged with negligent homicide and building without
proper permits.
	   Avraham Landstein, the defense lawyer for engineer Micha
Bar-Ilan said Monday that he would appeal to Israel's Supreme Court
to stop the trial because there are responsible parties who have
not been charged. His previous petition was rejected.
	   Landstein has said repeatedly that the state bears
responsibility in the collapse, as well as specific officials
including police, Ramat Gan and Yarkon River officials.
	   The families of the victims have demanded a parliamentary
investigation into the bridge collapse.
	   On Tuesday, the first anniversary of the disaster, several
groups planned to hold a protest at the bridge site, demanding that
the river be cleaned up.
	   Another court session was scheduled for Wednesday, after which
the trial was to recess for six weeks.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police reinforcements poured
into Kosovo by the busful on Monday, amid fighting southwest of
Pristina that killed two people and left others wounded or fleeing,
ethnic Albanians reported.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said Pecan and two other villages
45 kilometers (28 miles) southwest of Pristina were shelled. Beside
the two dead, identified by name, 12 others were wounded, said the
center, which is close to Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   The shelling, plus Serb sniping in nearby Suva Reka village, was
resulting in an exodus of ethnic Albanians from the region, said
the center.
	   More fighting was reported northwest of the provincial capital.
The Information Center said Serb forces and members of the Kosovo
Liberation Army were clashing near Stari Trg, 35 kilometers (20
miles) away from Pristina in a mining area rich in zinc and lead.
	   Reporting on another mining region, the government-run Serb
Media Center said that Serb forces on Monday retook the last
strategic sites around the Belacevac coal mine, just 10 kilometers
(6 miles) west of Pristina. There was no resistance, with ethnic
Albanian fighters melting away at the sight of Serb police, said
the center.
	   Fighting around the Belacevac region erupted early this month
after Kosovo guerrillas took the area, provoking a Serb
counter-assault for the mine, which provides much of the electrical
energy for the province.
	   New Serb forces arrived to the province amid the fighting.
Ethnic Albanian sources, who asked for anonymity, said 14 buses
carrying police were seen arriving in Pec, a city close to the
border with Albania.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed.
	   The newest outbreak left 12 people reported dead over three
days.
	   France and Britain have said they would introduce a resolution
in the U.N. Security Council threatening new measures against the
warring sides if they do not halt the fighting. Moscow opposes
using NATO military force in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
militants are fighting for independence from Serbia.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, on Monday, German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said he had ``new ideas'' for resolving the Kosovo crisis
that he wants to discuss with European Union foreign ministers. But
he offered no details.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-1 in Kosovo, are seeking
independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Hundreds of people have been killed since February when Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on Albanian
separatists who had been attacking Serb police and military
facilities.
	   Both sides reported casualties on the weekend. According to Serb
sources, two Serb policemen were killed when Albanian militants
attacked checkpoints along the province's main roads. And the
Kosovo Liberation Army said seven fighters were killed in weekend
clashes.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said Sunday the KLA had handed
over three Yugoslav army deserters to an international humanitarian
group. The report, which could not be independently confirmed, did
not say which group was involved.
	   The deserters, handed over late Saturday, were all from
Montenegro, the smaller republic of Yugoslavia, the center said. It
said the militant KLA still holds more deserters.

Chechen police free hostage and arrest three kidnappers

report of kidnapped soldier released. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen police manning a roadblock arrested three
suspected kidnappers and freed their businesswoman hostage, a news
agency said Monday.
	   The arrests were part of a broader law-and-order crackdown that
saw 79 people detained late Sunday and early Monday for violating a
state-of-emergency curfew in the breakaway southern province.
Police confiscated 17 submachine guns and two grenade launchers,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   At a roadblock in the capital, Grozny, police on Sunday night
arrested three men wanted for abducting a local businesswoman. The
woman was freed and the suspected kidnappers were jailed, the news
agency said, quoting police officials.
	   Most of the 79 people detained were later released after being
questioned about why that had broken the 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew.
	   Also Monday, kidnappers released one of six Russian soldiers
seized in neighboring Dagestan and believed held in Chechnya,
ITAR-Tass said, citing military authorities in Dagestan.
	   The report said the circumstances of the release were not
immediately clear. The soldiers were seized by masked gunmen on May
11.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, who imposed a state of
emergency June 23, has ordered a restructuring of the separatist
republic's law enforcement system, a spokesman said Monday.
	   Chechnya remains a center of violent crime and frequent
kidnappings despite the end of its independence war against Russia
two years ago.
	   The state of emergency, which expires Thursday, has led to a
reduction in crime and probably will not be extended, presidential
spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev told the Interfax news agency.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Hours after workers cleaned up the all-night
victory party, hundreds of thousands of delirious fans converged on
the Champs-Elysees to greet the triumphant French soccer team in
person.
	   People hung from trees and lampposts. Others climbed onto the
roofs of restaurants to try to get a glimpse of the team as it
carved its way up the Champs-Elysees atop an open double-decker
bus.
	   ``Zizou for president. Zizou for president,'' chanted the crowd,
using the nickname of Zinedine Zidane, the midfield star who scored
two goals in Sunday's victory over Brazil.
	   ``I've been up all night,'' said Elisabeth Wallon, 22. ``It was
magnificent. I've never seen a celebration like it.''
	   The players took turns holding the golden trophy over their
heads. They kissed and hugged each other, waving to the crowd.
Coach Aime Jacquet grinned and raised his arms in triumph.
	   Fans waving French flags were joined by those raising the
Algerian national colors in honor of Zidane, the son of Algerian
immigrants.
	   After a drenching downpour Monday morning, the sun peaked out
from the clouds, giving the joyous celebrations a warm glow.
	   French TV provided live coverage of the parade, which along with
the post-victory party on the Champs-Elysees represents the biggest
celebration in Paris since the Liberation in 1944.
	   ``We are undoubtedly the best in the world,'' said another fan,
Carl Guard. ``People will now respect us. All the French players
are heroes.''
	   The festivities were likely to continue well into Tuesday, when
France celebrates the anniversary of the French Revolution on
Bastille Day.

Russia, IMF reach agreement on bailout package, official says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 6 grafs to note that new loans this year and next
will total dlrs 17.1 billion. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Seeking to stabilize its tattered financial
markets, Russia has agreed to a new loan package worth dlrs 17.1
billion from the International Monetary Fund and other lenders,
officials announced Monday.
	   The tentative deal is in line with Russia's request for dlrs 15
billion to see it through the latest financial crisis. Millions of
Russians have been pushed into poverty by the country's shrinking
economy during the 1990s, and the infusion of cash is designed to
ward off another major downturn.
	   ``We are convinced that these resources will allow us to
significantly strengthen the anti-crisis efforts of the government
and will help to stabilize and strengthen the Russian economy,''
Russia's lead negotiator Anatoly Chubais told journalists Monday.
	   The agreement, which is spread over this year and next, calls
for the IMF to provide dlrs 11.6 billion, for the World Bank to
chip in dlrs 4 billion and Japan to give dlrs 1.5 billion _ for a
total of 17.1 billion, Chubais said.
	   Russia already has existing loan deals with all three that will
provide an additional 5.5 billion dollars this year and next.
	   That means that the combined financial aid from existing loans,
plus the package agreed upon Monday, totals dlrs 22.6 billion,
Chubais said.
	   The IMF's board must formally approve the agreement, and a
meeting is scheduled next Monday in Washington, Chubais said.
	   The latest crisis comes at a time when many Russian workers are
receiving their salaries months late and labor unrest is on the
rise. Also, the Russian ruble has been under threat of a
devaluation, a development that would push up prices and inflict
further economic hardship on all Russians.
	   The loan should provide President Boris Yeltsin's government
with some relief, if only temporarily.
	   ``Without (the loan), it's impossible to bring the economy out
of its tailspin,'' said Alexander Zhukov, head of the budget
affairs committee in parliament. But, he warned, ``if the
government doesn't take urgent, radical steps, it will soon run out
of this money and have to think again about where to borrow.''
	   The money could help restore confidence to the stock and bond
markets, which have taken heavy hits in recent months as foreign
investors have abandoned Russia. The stock market index was up by
almost 4 percent at midday Monday on word of the loan agreement.
	   ``This is good news, and the question is whether the excitement
about the loan will (outweigh) the other problems,'' said Dmitri
Kryukov, trader at Renaissance Capital brokerage in Moscow.
	   Economists have noted that the loan does nothing to address
perennial problems such as the government budget deficit and a
porous tax collection system.
	   ``Unless we see some fundamental change in Russia, I don't
expect to see much change in the market,'' Kryukov added.
	   There was no immediate word on what conditions the IMF would
impose on Russia in exchange for the loan.
	   The IMF has often been critical of Russia's inability to collect
taxes, which leaves the government chronically short of cash.
	   The Yeltsin administration recently proposed more than 20
measures to stabilize the economy, most aimed at reforming the
unwieldy tax system.
	   However, the Communists who lead parliament have balked at
measures that would raise taxes, and it's not clear whether they
will give their blessing to the entire program. Parliament plans a
special session Wednesday for further debate on the measures.
	   Russia's latest financial crisis struck in May, the result of
several factors: a sharp drop in the prices of Russia's oil
exports, a wave of labor protests, and general skittishness linked
to the Asian financial crisis.

Ethiopian premier seeks Kenyan mediation in conflict with Eritrea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS grafs 1-7 to update with Kenyan government statement,
adds statement by Eritrean government in grafs 17 and 18 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
spent more than three hours Monday with President Daniel arap Moi,
discussing the international attempt to mediate Ethiopia's
two-month border conflict with Eritrea.
	   In a statement issued after the meeting, Moi's office underlined
the seriousness with which Kenya views the conflict since Ethiopia
is Kenya's neighbor and also a member of the regional
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development.
	   IGAD was set up to help resolve problems among member states in
the Horn of Africa and East Africa.
	   ``After the meeting, President Moi said their discussions on the
conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea was not a new initiative,''
the statement said. ``However, he (Moi) said, the discussion would
lend weight to the ongoing initiatives by the OAU (Organization of
African Unity) and other parties.''
	   The OAU has been sponsoring the latest of a series of mediation
efforts which have been attempted since border clashes erupted
between the two neighboring Horn of Africa countries on May 6.
	   Tensions escalated in early June when each country bombed the
other and battles raged for a brief period on three fronts.
Hundreds were killed before fighting gave way to a stalemate on the
border where thousands of troops are massed on each side.
	   The countries had enjoyed apparently close relations since
Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, two years after
Eritrean rebels assisted Ethiopian rebels to overthrow a 17-year
military regime in 1991.
	   The countries are at loggerheads over disputed borders drawn up
by Italian colonizers in the early 20th century.
	   In June, Eritrea rejected a proposal drawn up by the United
States and Rwanda to end the fighting. Further attempts by African
heads of state from Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe and Djibouti have also
made little headway.
	   The presidents of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo also recently travelled to Addis Ababa and Asmara, the
Ethiopian and Eritrean capitals.
	   Meanwhile, both governments continue to accuse each other of
war-mongering.
	   On Sunday, Ethiopia deported 1,000 members of Eritrea's ruling
party who had been residing in Ethiopia, accusing them of spying or
raising funds for the Eritrean war effort.
	   Government spokeswoman Selome Taddesse said the deportees left
Addis Ababa by bus but did not say where they were headed.
	   Many of those deported are well-known businessmen and shop
owners in Ethiopia. Selome said last week that all those rounded up
would be allowed to appoint agents to manage their businesses or
properties.
	   On Monday the Eritrean government said 1,400 Eritreans had been
detained in Addis Ababa, and another 420 were expelled from the
northern Tigray region.
	   Protesting the deportations, the Eritrean statement said many of
the expelled were not members of Eritrea's ruling party as Ethiopia
had claimed, and others were only family members of those expelled
earlier.
	   Each country accuses the other of abusing its citizens.
	   The Eritrean People's Front for Democracy and Justice, the
successor to the rebel movement that fought Ethiopia for 30 years
to obtain independence, had an extensive network in Ethiopia.
	   The government closed down the group's main office last month.
Its leaders were among an earlier group of 1,047 Eritreans sent
home.
	   Eritrea claims as many as 6,000 Eritreans have already been
deported from Ethiopia.

China lashes out at U.S. Senate for resolutions on Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China lashed out angrily Monday at U.S. Senate
resolutions that offered backing for Taiwan, saying such actions
could upset warming China-U.S. ties.
	   In attacking a Senate vote Friday that reiterated U.S.
commitments and policies on Taiwan, China indicated that relations
between Beijing and Washington could be jeopardized if President
Bill Clinton's government fails to rein Congress in.
	   ``We sincerely hope the U.S. Congress will proceed in the
fundamental interests of the two countries and their people and
will play a positive rather than a negative role in the bilateral
relationship,'' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang
was quoted by the state-run Xinhua News Agency as saying.
	   ``We also hope the U.S. government will adopt effective measures
to remove obstacles and prevent the Congress from adopting related
resolutions in order to ensure the bilateral relationship remains
undamaged,'' Tang said.
	   The Chinese response to the Senate resolutions on Taiwan
injected a sour note into U.S.-China ties little more than a week
after Clinton wrapped up a nine-day tour of China that Beijing
hailed as ``highly successful.''
	   Beijing's anger stems from its view of Taiwan as a renegade
province. Although the island has governed itself since a Chinese
civil war ended in 1949, Beijing says it remains part of China and
that one day it will be reunified _ by force if necessary _ with
the Chinese mainland.
	   ``The reunification of China is purely China's internal affair
and no foreign interference will be allowed,'' Tang said.
	   During his visit, in remarks that gratified Beijing, Clinton
publicly restated Washington's opposition to any efforts by Taiwan
to declare independence, or join bodies such as the United Nations.
	   That brought sharp criticism from Taiwanese leaders, who feared
Clinton's comments could undermine their efforts to win more world
recognition for Taiwan, and from congressional conservatives.
	   In response, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott co-introduced
Friday's resolution to ``repair the damage'' he said Clinton's
remarks had caused.
	   The resolution repeated a U.S. pledge to help Taiwan ``maintain
a sufficient self-defense capability'' and called on China to
renounce the use of force against the island.
	   Tang, the Chinese spokesman, said China ``resents and is
resolutely opposed'' to the Senate measure and another that Xinhua
said supported Taiwan's entry into the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund.
	   Such ``anti-China'' measures, Tang said, were ``doomed to
failure.''
	   ``Such attempts will simply obstruct continuing improvements and
the development of Sino-U.S. relations and thus run counter to
historic trends,'' he added.

 &UR; Svorada wins final Irish stage of Tour de France as Boardman falls
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with winner, results, no pickup
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CORK, Ireland (AP) _ Jan Svorada of the Czech Republic outraced
a pack of sprinters Monday to win the final Irish stage of the Tour
de France.
	   Australia's Robbie McEwan finished second and Italy's Mario
Cipollini was third.
	   The 189 riders stuck together and set a leisurely pace through
most of the 127.4-mile (205.5 km) second stage along Ireland's flat
southern coast. That set the scene for the sport's best sprinters
to battle it out for the finish line along Cork's straight
Carrigrohane Road.
	   But a crash 90 minutes from the finish knocked Chris Boardman
out of the competition, a bitter end for the speed specialist who
held the leader's yellow jersey through the first two days of the
Tour.
	   Boardman crashed after his front wheel accidentally clipped the
year wheel of his Gan teammate, Frederic Moncassin of France.
Boardman's helmet hit a stone fence by the roadside, cutting his
forehead and forcing doctors to send him to a Cork hospital for a
precautionary brain scan.
	   Two other Gan riders, Frenchmen Eddy Seigneur and Francois
Simon, broke away from the pack and pulled ahead by more than a
minute until the race reached the outskirts of Cork.
	   A second pileup 7 miles (12 kms) from the end knocked a big hole
in the peleton, as more than a dozen cyclists toppled over and
others veered onto the grassy banks to avoid the collision.
	   Another sprint began immediately after Monday's finish _ to Cork
Airport. The remaining 188 riders and their support staff all flew
to Brittany, the northwest Atlantic region of France where the
racing resumes Tuesday afternoon.
	   The Tour had started outside France 12 times previously in its
95-year history, but never before in Ireland, which produced two
star Tour riders in the 1980s but has none in this year's contest.
	   The residents of dozens of towns and villages turned out in
their tens of thousands to line the route, throwing parties,
community competitions and street carnivals in honor of what they
considered a once-in-a-lifetime event.
	   Monday's race began at Enniscorthy, a market town nearby the
ancestral home of the Kennedy political dynasty, and passed the
Waterford crystal works, both mainstays of the tourist trail.
	   A third of the way along the passing peloton received a
tumultuous welcome from locals at Carrick-on-Suir, the cycling-mad
hometown of Sean Kelly, who won the green jersey a record-setting
four times on the Tour in the 1980s.
	   And the green banks of Cork's River Lee were adorned with floral
messages of FAILTE AU TOUR DE FRANCE, ``failte'' the Gaelic for
``welcome.''

Witness describes Serb brutality in prison camp at U.N. genocide
</HEADLINE>
trial &QL; 
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Muslim Monday detailed
the brutality he endured at a Serb-run prison camp in 1992,
claiming he was severely beaten with batons and metal rods.
	   Taking the witness stand at the U.N. war crimes tribunal,
ex-prisoner Mevludin Sejmenovic said he spent nine horrific days at
the Omarska camp in northwest Bosnia's Prijedor region were he was
interrogated and beaten because of his religious beliefs.
	   His testimony came during the trial of Bosnian Serb official
Milan Kovacevic, 57, who is charged with genocide, war crimes and
crimes against humanity for alleged atrocities committed in
Prijedor in 1992.
	   Kovacevic's trial, the seventh at the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal, is the first to deal with genocide charges.
	   Prosecutors accuse Kovacevic of guiding a campaign of atrocities
against Bosnian Muslims and Croats, including the establishment of
three of the Bosnian war's most infamous prison camps: Omarska,
Keraterm and Trnopolje.
	   According to Kovacevic's indictment, hundreds of detainees were
tortured and killed in the camps .
	   Prosecutors hold Kovacevic responsible for the alleged crimes
because he served as the vice-president of the so-called Crisis
Staff, which coordinated and implemented the campaign of ``ethnic
cleansing'' against non-Serbs in the region.
	   Kovacevic, a former anesthesiologist, has pleaded innocent to
all 15 charges leveled at him. If convicted, he faces a maximum
life sentence. He was arrested by NATO forces last summer in
Prijedor.
	   Sejmenovic, the first camp survivor to testify at Kovacevic's
trial, said five men entered a room one by one and beat him with
their fists, boots, batons, metal sticks and plastic pipes.
	   ``I was hit with boots in the face, I was completely covered
with blood,'' he told the three-judge panel.
	   Sejmenovic said he was detained because he was an official of
the Party of Democratic Action, or SDA, which was identified as the
Muslim national party.
	   He added he was labeled as a Muslim fundamentalist because Serbs
found copies of a theology magazine called ``Islamic Thought'' in
his home.
	   Sejmenovic also described how Serb military and police forces
conducted violent attacks on non-Serb villages as part of their
plans to expel Muslims and Croats.
	   ``They didn't leave anything untouched, they burned
everything,'' he said.
	   Kovacevic is not the only suspect facing genocide charges before
the court, which has also indicted Bosnian Serb wartime leader
Radovan Karadzic and his military commander, Ratko Mladic, for
genocide and war crimes. Both are still at large.
	   The tribunal has indicted 60 people for alleged war crimes in
the former Yugoslavia. Twenty-seven suspects are in custody.

EU proposes tougher rules to fight money-laundering
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission put forward proposals Monday aimed at strengthening EU
laws on money laundering ahead of the launching of the single
currency next year.
	   Under the proposed amendments to the 1991 law, institutions such
as casinos, auditors, real estate and law offices will have to
report to the Commission any suspicious dealings when carrying out
transactions on behalf of their clients.
	   Under the 1991 legislation, only credit and financial
institutions are obliged to do so, the Commission said in a
statement.
	   The Commission also wants to see more cooperation between
financial intelligence units across the 15-nation bloc. In Austria,
Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Ireland and Finland, these
institutions cannot legally exchange information with their
counterparts from other EU countries.
	   ``These stronger safeguards will be all the more necessary with
the single currency,'' said the EU's Commissioner for the Internal
Market Mario Monti.
	   The euro will be launched as the common currency of 11 EU
nations on Jan. 1, 1999.
	   The Commission said it hopes to present its proposal by late
1998 or early 1999. The proposal must be approved by EU countries.

U.N. experts take samples of Iraqi warheads
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. arms experts have gathered fragments
of Iraqi missile warheads to bring to a European laboratory to test
whether the weapons were loaded with deadly VX gas, a U.N.
spokeswoman said Monday.
	   Janet Sullivan said the 15-member team led by Horst Reeps, the
top U.N. chemical weapons investigator, will also hold talks with
Iraqi scientists on the scope of Iraq's work with VX, a gas so
deadly a few drops can kill a person.
	   A U.S. laboratory last month determined that Iraq loaded VX on
warheads before the 1991 Gulf War. Iraq disputed the findings, and
the United Nations agreed to send the parts to laboratories in
France and Switzerland for testing.
	   The team expects to take additional samples before they leave
Iraq on Thursday.
	   Sullivan said Iraqi scientists intended to present to the U.N.
experts their own analysis of warhead samples recovered from
al-Nibai, a site north of Baghdad where Iraq in 1991 unilaterally
destroyed and buried its missiles.
	   Reeps' team includes three scientists from France and three from
Switzerland.
	   Iraq has admitted experimenting with VX but denies that it
loaded it on warheads or bombs. Richard Butler, the chief U.N.
weapons inspector, has said he has no doubt about the findings of
the U.S. laboratory.
	   Iraq's most influential newspaper Babil, in a front-page
editorial Monday, said the United States fabricated the finding to
prolong sanctions against Iraq.
	   ``The tests to be conducted in France and Switzerland ... will
prove that Iraq is telling the truth (about VX),'' said the paper,
owned by President Saddam Hussein's eldest son, Odai.
	   U.N. sanctions imposed against Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990
will not be lifted until U.N. arms monitors certify that Baghdad
has eliminated all its banned weapons.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Seeking to stem the spread of light weapons,
representatives from 21 countries met Monday to create a global
campaign to control the arms that fuel conflicts around the world.
	   ``The great human costs of the excessive accumulation and
uncontrolled proliferation of small arms are the major reason for
our common concern,'' Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Aslaug Haga
said Monday as she opened the meeting.
	   No one know how many light weapons there are in the world, but
some experts say at least half the trade in weapons is illegal. In
places like Chechnya, it is sometimes easier to buy a gun than a
loaf of bread.
	   Small arms refers to weapons that can be hand-carried and fired,
including pistols, machine guns, automatic rifles and shoulder-held
grenade and missile launchers.

Russian Foreign Ministry official charged in spy scandal

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A senior Russian diplomat accused of turning over
classified information to South Korea was officially charged with
high treason on Monday, a news agency reported.
	   Valentin Moiseyev, a deputy chief of the ministry's First Asian
Department, was arrested last week for allegedly turning over
secrets to South Korean diplomat Cho Sung-woo.
	   The South Korean was declared persona non grata and expelled.
South Korea retaliated by expelling a Russian diplomat.
	   Moiseyev was officially charged with ``high treason,'' the
ITAR-Tass news agency said, quoting officials in the Federal
Security Service.
	   Before his appointment, Moiseyev worked in North Korea as a
Russian newspaper correspondent and then a trade mission employee,
a Foreign Ministry spokesman said at the time of his arrest.

US Treasury Sec.: Africa investment will come with stability, sound
</HEADLINE>
policies &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Following on the heels of President
Clinton's trip to Africa earlier this year, U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin told African banking officials Monday that private
investment was the key to fostering growth across the continent.
	   After decades of ignoring the continent, investors have begun,
``to take a new look at African nations,'' Rubin told African
Development Bank officials. ``However, for this process to move
forward towards its full potential, there is much that the African
nations must do.''
	   Among other things, African countries must create policies to
create political and social stability, a sound legal framework and
openness to international trade and investment.
	   ``We can't and you in Africa can't turn away from these
difficult political challenges,'' he said.
	   Rubin's week-long trip to four African nations follows Clinton's
trip in March and April, when the president visited six countries,
making a strong push to boost economic development across the
continent.
	   Investment in sub-Saharan Africa remains pitifully low, Rubin
noted in his speech, attracting just 3 percent of total long-term
private capital investment to developing countries in 1997.
	   In addition, many countries are heavily dependent on donor aid
and loans.
	   He acknowledged that there was a ``perception gap' in how
African investment opportunities were seen by the rest of the
world, but said there had also been ``a wide array of real problems
_ many grounded in Africa's history _ and too little African focus,
prior to recent years, on creating an environment to attract
private investment.''
	   He said, though, that his trip to the continent would enable him
to return to the United States and ``help cure that perception
gap.''
	   After his speech, Rubin told reporters that the resignation of
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto would not affect the
United States policy on the dollar, and he encouraged Japan to push
policies stressing growth through domestic demand, instead of
exports.
	   ``It is absolutely imperative that Japan move efficiently and
expeditiously in dealing with economic issues,'' he said.
	   As to the dlrs 14.8 billion loan package from the International
Monetary Fund and other lenders to help stabilize Russia's
financial markets, he called the package ``substantial new money,''
combined with ``substantial new policy reform.''
	   Rubin, who leaves Ivory Coast on Monday for South Africa, is
also going to Namibia, Mozambique and Kenya.

Judges in Berlin disco bombing case accused of bias
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Prosecutors filed a motion Monday accusing the
judges of bias in the case of five people on trial for the 1986
disco bombing in Berlin that killed three people, including two
U.S. servicemen.
	   Justice Ministry spokesman Matthias Rebentisch said the trial
had been postponed until another court could rule on the motion.
The next trial date was to have been Tuesday.
	   The trial judges last week sharply criticized chief prosecutor
Detlev Mehlis for allegedly giving one defendant the false
impression that he would get a lighter sentence if he confessed and
turned state's evidence.
	   Prosecutors had said Musbah Abulghasem Eter, who worked at the
Libyan Embassy in then-communist East Berlin, would testify against
the other suspects and implicate Libya.
	   Instead, on the witness stand last December, he denied ever
confessing and said his statements to prosecutors in 1996 had been
poorly translated or misunderstood.
	   The United States has accused Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi of
ordering the bombing at the La Belle disco, killing two U.S.
servicemen and a Turkish woman and wounding 230 people.
Then-President Reagan retaliated with deadly airstrikes on two
Libyan cities.
	   Eter, 41, is on trial along with two other employees of Libya's
former embassy in East Berlin and two German women.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police reinforcements poured
into Kosovo by the busful on Monday, amid fighting southwest of
Pristina that killed two people and left others wounded or fleeing,
ethnic Albanians reported.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said Pecan and two other villages
45 kilometers (28 miles) southwest of Pristina were shelled. Beside
the two dead, identified by name, 12 others were wounded, said the
center, which is close to Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   The shelling, plus Serb sniping in nearby Suva Reka village, was
resulting in an exodus of ethnic Albanians from the region, said
the center.
	   More fighting was reported northwest of the provincial capital.
The Information Center said Serb forces and members of the Kosovo
Liberation Army were clashing near Stari Trg, 35 kilometers (20
miles) away from Pristina in a mining area rich in zinc and lead.
	   France and Britain have said they would introduce a resolution
in the U.N. Security Council threatening new measures against the
warring sides if they do not halt the fighting. Moscow opposes
using NATO military force in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
militants are fighting for independence from Serbia.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, on Monday, German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said he had ``new ideas'' for resolving the Kosovo crisis
that he wants to discuss with European Union foreign ministers. But
he offered no details.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-1 in Kosovo, are seeking
independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Hundreds of people have been killed since February when Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on Albanian

	   ROME (AP) _ Another guilty verdict, another claim of vendetta.
	   A Milan court on Monday convicted opposition leader Silvio
Berlusconi of illegal party financing, the third guilty verdict
absorbed by the media magnate since December. He was sentenced to
two years, four months in prison.
	   Berlusconi was convicted of funneling money in 1991 to Socialist
ex-Premier Bettino Craxi, who was found guilty of the same charge.
	   Immediately after the decision, Berlusconi repeated his protest
that the Milan prosecutors were waging a campaign against him.
	   ``The political enemy to annihilate, with incredible aim
sentence after sentence, is Silvio Berlusconi,'' his Fininvest
company said. ``And if it is necessary to reach the result by
wreaking havoc on procedure, law and the truth, it matters
little.''
	   Center-left politicians said the case was purely a judicial
matter, and had nothing to do with politics.
	   The effect on Berlusconi's leadership of the center-right
Freedom Alliance was unclear. After another conviction last week,
Berlusconi promised to go on as opposition standard-bearer.
	   His allies quickly rallied around him Monday, and supporters
planned a demonstration in front of Parliament.
	   ``Berlusconi knows he can count like never before on the strong
solidariety of all his allies,'' said Pierferdinando Casini, leader
of a small centrist party.
	   Last Wednesday, Berlusconi was convicted of bribing tax
inspectors and sentenced to two years and nine months in prison. In
December he was convicted in a case centering on a film company
deal and given a suspended 16-month sentence.
	   It is unlikely Berlusconi will go to jail. He is appealing, a
process that can take years in Italy, and such short terms for
white collar crimes are usually suspended.
	   The court also fined him 10 billion lire (dlrs 5.6 million), and
sentenced Craxi to a four-year term and 20 billion lire fine (dlrs
11.2 million).
	   Craxi lives in self-imposed exile in Tunisia, and was tried in
absentia. Convicted on corruption-related charges at least five
times, Craxi is one of the most prominent political figures brought
down by the wave of corruption investigations starting in 1992
known as ``Clean Hands.''
	   Craxi was a friend to Berlusconi during the go-go 1980s in
Milan, and reportedly gave him political backing as Berlusconi
built up his television empire into the only rival to the state
broadcasting system.
	   Prosecutors alleged that Berlusconi and his associates doctored
company books to cover up the 1991 payments. A trial on that charge
is scheduled for September. Two tax-related cases against him also
are pending.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Sports writers, political columnists, and even the
financial newspapers all had something to say Monday about what
victory in the World Cup means for France.
	   French media joined the nation in celebrating the the World Cup
upset with an orgy of coverage devoted to the stunning 3-0 win by
Les Bleus against Brazil.
	   ``For Eternity,'' blared the headline of the sports daily
L'Equipe, which has heaped criticism on French coach Aime Jacquet
for putting together what the newspaper considered a dull team.
	   ``It's ours,'' said the headline of the daily Le Parisien, with
a picture of an ecstatic Jacquet holding the coveted golden trophy
high over his head. ``A jubiliant France celebrates its first World
Cup,'' trumpeted the normally sober Le Monde.
	   Pride, euphoria, glory. Those were just some of the emotions
expressed in the pages of French newspapers. Radio and TV talk
shows turned to soccer, and the winning goals were replayed _ and
replayed again and again _ on the country's main television
stations.
	   European newspapers chimed in with praise and congratulations
for the French team.
	   ``France Super, Brazil Humiliated,'' said the Corriere della
Sera daily in Milan, the Italian city where Brazilian star Ronaldo
plays. ``France can proudly raise to the heavens the first World
Cup in its history,'' said La Stampa of Turin.
	   German papers had the French victory on their front pages. ``The
French are the Soccer Kings,'' was the headline in the mass-market
Bild newspaper. But the story was overshadowed in Bild and other
German newspapers, with the news of Michael Schumacher's third
straight victory Sunday at the British Grand Prix.
	   In soccer-mad Britain, newspapers indulged in Brazil-bashing, a
few digs at the less than brilliant French team, which,
nonetheless, won overall admiration.
	   ``France take the world by storm,'' said the Times newspaper.
``It was a night to revel in this French triumph and to turn to
another kind of footballing extravagance, to acclaim new
torch-bearers. They were magnificent,'' the Times said.
	   ``There were better teams here. But when they play like this,
there were no more well-rounded ones,'' the Daily Express wrote.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair sent a letter of
congratulations to Chirac and Jospin for the ``splendid win''
against Brazil.
	   Although more subdued, Dutch newspapers also paid tribute to the
French team. ``Vive la France. The French are the deserved champion
after trouncing Brazil,'' said De Telegraaf.
	   For some French commentators, victory went beyond sport. They
expressed hope the win will help combat racism in a country where
the right-wing National Front regularly gets 15 percent of the
vote.
	   Some of the greatest heroes of the French team, including
Sunday's two-time scorer, Zinedine Zidane, are the children of
immigrants, or were born in one of France's former colonies.
	   For Le Figaro, a conservative daily, the French victory was a
``lesson'' in ``unity'' for a nation that is now irreversibly
multiracial.
	   The Tribune de Geneve quoted Zaki Laidi, a French-based expert
on race relations, that the World Cup had put the National Front on
the ``defensive.''

London subway workers strike, but most trains run

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two-thirds of trains running, fresh quotes,

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A strike halted some services on the London subway
system Monday, but managers said about two-thirds of the trains
ran.
	   The Rail, Maritime and Transport union disagreed, saying the
24-hour strike that began Sunday evening had ``badly disrupted''
traffic.
	   London Underground acknowledged the two hardest-hit services,
the Central and Northern lines, were able to operate at 50 percent
of capacity. Some other lines had around 80 percent of the trains
running.
	   The RMT union had called workers off the job for 48 hours in
June with similar results. The union has tried but failed to secure
agreements on working conditions, job security and pensions that
will be available after the Underground is partially privatized.
	   Management says it has offered the best assurances possible and
that the strike had generated little enthusiasm among rank-and-file
subway workers.
	   ``We cannot understand why the RMT leadership has called its
workers out,'' said Denis Tunnicliffe, chief executive of London
Transport, which runs the Underground.
	   The union said the walkout received solid backing.
	   London Underground, which operates the 243-mile (390-kilometer)
system said all services were running although most at reduced
capacity. The strike was scheduled to end early Monday evening.
	   The main impact of the strike was felt during Monday morning's
rush hour, when 15 subway stations were closed. Many commuters
drove their cars to work, adding to the usual heavy traffic in the
capital.
	   Environmental campaigners supporting the subway strikers tried
to help disrupt subway services Monday morning. Three activists
from the group Reclaim The Streets clambered on to the roof of a
subway train at Bank station, but they were arrested.

Turkey prepares for fresh water shipment to northern Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey is to conduct a trial run for the
shipment of fresh water to the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state
later this week.
	   Turkey has signed a deal with the self-declared republic, which
is suffering from a severe water shortage, to ship in 7 million
cubic meters (245 million cubic feet) of drinkable water per year.
	   ``We will carry out a test shipment this week to ensure that
everything goes smoothly,'' Hasan Akyar, a senior official of the
state hydraulic works, said Monday.
	   ``We are conducting some chemical tests on the potable water at
the moment.''
	   The fresh water from Turkey's Soguksu River will be initially
carried to the Mediterranean island of Cyprus in a 10,000-cubic
meter (350,000-cubic feet) water bag, dragged by a ship, Akyar
said.
	   ``We hope to increase the number of water bags to three in a
year,'' Akyar said. ``Then we will reach the full capacity of 7
million cubic meters a year.''
	   An official inauguration ceremony for the operation is scheduled
for July 25 in northern Cyprus with the participation of Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel.
	   Akyar said the supply is expected to answer the need of more
than half of northern Cyprus' estimated 200,000 population.
	   ``Turkey will not seek a royalty fee from Turkish Cypriots but
they will be charged for the transportation costs,'' Akyar said.
	   The transportation between Turkey's Mediterranean coastal town
of Aydincik and northern Cyprus' Kumkoy town will be carried out by
a consortium of Turkey's Akdeniz Su Tasima Co. and Norway's NWT
company, Akyar said.
	   The distance between Aydincik and Kumkoy, near Morphou, is about
65 nautical miles.
	   The Turkish Cypriot state established in the northern third of
the island is only recognized by Turkey. Cyprus remains divided
since 1974 when Turkey sent in troops in the wake of a a
short-lived coup backed by Athens.

National Front reluctantly congratulates French team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ While the rest of the nation exploded in joy, the
anti-immigrant National Front offered subdued congratulations
Monday to the victorious _ and multiracial _ French soccer team.
	   France's team includes immigrants and the children of
immigrants, just the kind of the people the Front has long
advocated expelling from France.
	   ``The National Front is delighted this symbolic victory has
brought the French people hope and joy, and made it recover its
patriotic reflexes, its national anthem and its flag,'' the Front
said in a statement.
	   It singled out Zinedine Zidane, the son of Algerian immigrants
in Marseille, who was the star of Sunday's 3-0 victory over Brazil,
scoring two of its goals.
	   But in an interview with the daily Liberation, National Front
leader Jean-Marie Le Pen characterized the World Cup as a ``detail
in the history of the war that nations pursue on playing fields.''
	   ``Detail of history'' is how Le Pen has referred to the
Holocaust.
	   Liberation also quoted Le Pen as saying the National Front
``always has recognized that French citizens can be of different
races and religions as long as they had in common love of the
country and the will to serve it.''
	   However, the newspaper reminded its readers that two years ago,
Le Pen had said it was ``artificial to bring players in from abroad
and baptize them as the French team.''
	   The National Front regularly wins about 15 percent in French
elections with its anti-immigrant, anti-foreigner and racist
rhetoric.
	   Some French commentators expressed hope Monday that the
multiracial nature of the French soccer team would help bring the
nation together.
	   ``Deep integration requires that each person go beyond his
origins, his memories, his reluctance, his fears,'' the
conservative daily Le Figaro said. ``We have the proof that thanks
to the World Cup, this is possible.''

EU proposes tougher rules to fight money-laundering
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's executive
Commission put forward proposals Monday aimed at strengthening EU
laws on money laundering before next year's launch of the single
currency.
	   Under the proposed amendments to the 1991 law, institutions such
as casinos, auditors, real estate and law offices will have to
report to the Commission any suspicious dealings when carrying out
transactions on behalf of their clients.
	   Under the 1991 legislation, only credit and financial
institutions are obliged to do so, the Commission said in a
statement.
	   The Commission also wants to see more cooperation between
financial intelligence units across the 15-nation bloc. In Austria,
Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Ireland and Finland, these
institutions cannot legally exchange information with their
counterparts from other EU countries.
	   ``These stronger safeguards will be all the more necessary with
the single currency,'' said the EU's Commissioner for the Internal
Market Mario Monti.
	   The euro will be launched as the common currency of 11 EU
nations on Jan. 1, 1999.
	   The Commission said it hopes to present its proposal by late
1998 or early 1999. The proposal must be approved by EU countries.

Witness describes Serb brutality in prison camp at U.N. genocide
</HEADLINE>
trial &QL; 
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Muslim on Monday
detailed the brutality he endured at a Serb-run prison camp in
1992, claiming he was severely beaten with batons and metal rods.
	   Taking the witness stand at the U.N. war crimes tribunal,
ex-prisoner Mevludin Sejmenovic said he spent nine horrific days at
the Omarska camp in northwest Bosnia's Prijedor region were he was
interrogated and beaten because of his religious beliefs.
	   His testimony came during the trial of Bosnian Serb official
Milan Kovacevic, 57, who is charged with genocide, war crimes and
crimes against humanity for alleged atrocities committed in
Prijedor in 1992.
	   Kovacevic's trial, the seventh at the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal, is the first to deal with genocide charges.
	   Prosecutors accuse Kovacevic of guiding a campaign of atrocities
against Bosnian Muslims and Croats, including the establishment of
three of the Bosnian war's most infamous prison camps: Omarska,
Keraterm and Trnopolje.
	   According to Kovacevic's indictment, hundreds of detainees were
tortured and killed in the camps .
	   Prosecutors hold Kovacevic responsible for the alleged crimes
because he served as the vice-president of the so-called Crisis
Staff, which coordinated and implemented the campaign of ``ethnic
cleansing'' against non-Serbs in the region.
	   Kovacevic, a former anesthesiologist, has pleaded innocent to
all 15 charges leveled at him. If convicted, he faces a maximum
life sentence. He was arrested by NATO forces last summer in
Prijedor.
	   Sejmenovic, the first camp survivor to testify at Kovacevic's
trial, said five men entered a room one by one and beat him with
their fists, boots, batons, metal sticks and plastic pipes.
	   ``I was hit with boots in the face, I was completely covered
with blood,'' he told the three-judge panel.
	   Sejmenovic said he was detained because he was an official of
the Party of Democratic Action, or SDA, which was identified as the
Muslim national party.
	   He added he was labeled as a Muslim fundamentalist because Serbs
found copies of a theology magazine called ``Islamic Thought'' in
his home.
	   Sejmenovic also described how Serb military and police forces
conducted violent attacks on non-Serb villages as part of their
plans to expel Muslims and Croats.
	   ``They didn't leave anything untouched, they burned
everything,'' he said.
	   Kovacevic is not the only suspect facing genocide charges before
the court, which has also indicted Bosnian Serb wartime leader
Radovan Karadzic and his military commander, Ratko Mladic, for
genocide and war crimes. Both are still at large.
	   The tribunal has indicted 60 people for alleged war crimes in
the former Yugoslavia. Twenty-seven suspects are in custody.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A member of a prominent family of
shipowners was arrested Monday in connection with the shooting of a
business rival on a busy port street, police said.
	   Vangelis Ventouris, 39, was taken into custody by authorities
investigating the attack on Constantinos Agapitos, 40, who was
wounded in the legs and shoulder when two gunmen on a motorcycle
shot him five times early Monday.
	   Ventouris has been accused of driving the motorcycle. The
passenger was identified as a bodyguard of Ventouris, police said.
Authorities did not release the other suspect's name or indicate
who is accused of firing the shots.
	   Ventouris denied any involvement in the attack and said he was
at his home with friends when it occurred, media reported.
	   Agapitos was shot as he waited at a traffic light in his car in
Greece's main port, Piraeus, about 10 kilometers (six miles) south
of Athens. Doctors said his condition was not life threatening.
	   He told police he recognized at least one of the assailants.
	   The Ventouris family, which operates a fleet of ferries, has
faced financial difficulties, Greek media reported.
	   Agapitos, who applied for a gun license two days before the
attack, told police he began receiving threatening telephone calls
after his recent purchase of the ferry Panagia Tinou II, which had
been seized by the National Bank from Ventouris Sea Lines, run by
Vangelis Ventouris.
	   Agapitos reportedly bought the ferry for 7.5 million drachmas
(dlrs 24,500).
	   The director of the National Bank's Piraeus branch, Antonis
Halaris, has accused Ventouris and an unidentified man of
threatening him before the ferry auction, police said. Halaris'
lawsuit is pending.
	   In March, a Piraeus court sentenced Ventouris to 21 years in
prison after he was convicted of owing 594.4 million drachmas
(about dlrs 1.9 million) in social security contributions for
employees on five ships. Banks have since seized all five vessels.
	   The shipowner was not imprisoned following an appeal.
	   Agapitos, whose family owns the Agapitos Lines passenger
ferries, is considered part of the new generation of Greek
shipowners. Agapitos is in charge of the Agapitos Express Ferries
division, which has seven vessels.
	   Andreas Panagos, president of the shipping agents' association,
was quoted by Greek media as saying it ``was natural'' that an
up-and-coming shipowner such as Agapitos ``would create some
enemies.''

Major US-Romanian business deal in doubt after finance minister
</HEADLINE>
refuses to sign loan guarantees &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Two days before Romanian President
Emil Constantinescu arrives in Washington, a major U.S.-Romanian
business deal is in doubt because of the refusal of the country's
finance minister to approve government guarantees on the financing.
	   Two weeks ago, Prime Minister Radu Vasile decided to guarantee a
dlrs 1.45 billion loan to enable the Romanian army to buy 96 Bell
AH1RO Dracula helicopters.
	   In return, the manufacturer, Bell Helicopters Textron, will buy
a 70 percent stake in the IAR Brasov SA aircraft factory for dlrs
50 million.
	   A government company, Romtehnica, is to issue bonds over nine
years to finance the loan.
	   On Monday, however, the spokeswoman for the finance ministry,
Sabina Ilies, said Finance Minister Daniel Daianu opposes the deal
and will not sign the necessary government guarantees on the loan.
	   In an interview with the newspaper Adevarul, Daianu said ``I do
not trust this project and, as finance minister, I won't sign the
government guarantees. I have no doubt about it.''
	   The prime minister's spokesman, Rasvan Popescu, said Vasile
learned of the finance chief's decision through press reports.
	   ``So far, we have a government decision which has not been
changed and goes for all the members of the cabinet,'' Popescu
said. He refused to speculate what might happen if the finance
minister refused to change his mind.
	   Romanian political analysts believe the deal was aimed at
scoring points with Washington. Constantinescu leaves Tuesday for a
week-long visit to the United States, where he is expected to push
Romania's desire to make the next cut of former Soviet bloc
countries to be admitted to NATO.
	   Romania failed to be invited to join the alliance with the first
wave _ the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland _ primarily because
of economic problems.
	   Daianu said he opposed the deal because the army budget - 7
trillion lei (dlrs 800 million) in 1998 - would have to be
increased by 20 percent annually over the nine-year duration to
cover the contract.
	   The deal has been widely criticized in Romania, which is still
struggling with serious economic problems nine years after the
revolution that toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
	   The International Monetary Fund representative in Romania, John
Hill, has warned the project would increase budget expenses and
thus further burden the economy.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (Dow Jones News) _ In a move to bolster its
catering-service operations, Britain's Glynwed International PLC
has agreed to purchase Williams Refrigeration Ltd. for 44.3 million
pounds, or dlrs 72.3 million.
	   Glynwed said Monday it is pursuing a plan to concentrate on its
kitchen-stove, catering-industry and pipe-systems businesses.
	   Glynwed, an engineering and manufacturing group, already has a
presence in the sector through its Falcon cooking-equipment unit.
	   Williams is a leading British food-service refrigeration
concern, with annual sales of 24.8 million pounds, or dlrs 40.5
million, last year.

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Hamid Oubadriss of France won the hilly San
Francisco Marathon, but his time was way off the course record and
his own best.
	   ``It was a hard race,'' he said of Sunday's 26.2-mile (42.16
kilometers) trek through the streets of San Francisco. ``Twenty-six
miles with hills makes it a difficult course. I hate to race on
hills.''
	   Oubadriss was timed in 2 hours, 23 minutes, 54 seconds, far off
the course record of 2:17:34, set four years ago by Kenyan Patrick
Muturi. His best marathon time is 2:14.
	   Kenya's Salina Chirchir won the women's division. Her time of
2:45:36 was five minutes slower than the record set by Russian
Tatiana Titova in 1993.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament probably will not send an
official delegation to this week's burial service of Russia's last
czar in St. Petersburg, the speaker of the lower house said Monday.
	   Czar Nicholas II abdicated in 1917, a year before he was
executed with his family, and therefore he should simply be buried
where he was killed in the central city of Yekaterinburg, Gennady
Seleznyov, a Communist and speaker of the State Duma, told the
Interfax news agency.
	   Nicholas II ``was no longer an emperor but a private citizen and
it is unclear why a private person should be buried with these
honors,'' Seleznyov said.
	   The Duma will make its decision Tuesday, but Communists account
for the largest bloc, and most are believed to share Seleznyov's
sentiments.
	   The government said Monday that Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
will not attend the funeral. It had said previously that the
government would be represented by Deputy Prime Minister Boris
Nemtsov.
	   Nicholas, his family and several servants were executed by the
Bolsheviks in 1918. Their bones were found buried in a pit near
Yekaterinburg in 1991, and will be interred in a St. Petersburg
cathedral where many of Russia's czars are buried.
	   The burial and a memorial service will take place Friday, the
80th anniversary of their deaths.
	   There have been a number of disputes surrounding the burial, and
it is now scheduled to be a relatively modest, low-key affair. Many
top officials, including President Boris Yeltsin do not plan to
attend.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Seeking to stabilize its tattered financial
markets, Russia has agreed to a new loan package worth dlrs 17.1
billion from the International Monetary Fund and other lenders,
officials announced Monday.
	   The tentative deal is in line with Russia's request for dlrs 15
billion to see it through the latest financial crisis. Millions of
Russians have been pushed into poverty by the country's shrinking
economy during the 1990s, and the infusion of cash is designed to
ward off another major downturn.
	   ``We are convinced that these resources will allow us to
significantly strengthen the anti-crisis efforts of the government
and will help to stabilize and strengthen the Russian economy,''
Russia's lead negotiator Anatoly Chubais told journalists Monday.
	   The agreement, which is spread over this year and next, calls
for the IMF to provide dlrs 11.6 billion, for the World Bank to
chip in dlrs 4 billion and Japan to give dlrs 1.5 billion _ for a
total of 17.1 billion, Chubais said.
	   Russia already has existing loan deals with all three that will
provide an additional 5.5 billion dollars this year and next.
	   That means that the combined financial aid from existing loans,
plus the package agreed upon Monday, totals dlrs 22.6 billion,
Chubais said.
	   The IMF's board must formally approve the agreement, and a
meeting is scheduled next Monday in Washington, Chubais said.
	   The latest crisis comes at a time when many Russian workers are
receiving their salaries months late and labor unrest is on the
rise. Also, the Russian ruble has been under threat of a
devaluation, a development that would push up prices and inflict
further economic hardship on all Russians.
	   The loan should provide President Boris Yeltsin's government
with some relief, if only temporarily.
	   ``Without (the loan), it's impossible to bring the economy out
of its tailspin,'' said Alexander Zhukov, head of the budget
affairs committee in parliament. But, he warned, ``if the
government doesn't take urgent, radical steps, it will soon run out
of this money and have to think again about where to borrow.''
	   The money could help restore confidence to the stock and bond
markets, which have taken heavy hits in recent months as foreign
investors have abandoned Russia. The stock market index was up by
9.2 percent by the close of trade Monday, buoyed by word of the
deal.
	   ``This is good news, and the question is whether the excitement
about the loan will (outweigh) the other problems,'' said Dmitri
Kryukov, trader at Renaissance Capital brokerage in Moscow.
	   Economists have noted that the loan does nothing to address
perennial problems such as the government budget deficit and a
porous tax collection system.
	   ``Unless we see some fundamental change in Russia, I don't
expect to see much change in the market,'' Kryukov added.
	   There was no immediate word on what conditions the IMF would
impose on Russia in exchange for the loan.
	   The IMF has often been critical of Russia's inability to collect
taxes, which leaves the government chronically short of cash.
	   The Yeltsin administration recently proposed more than 20
measures to stabilize the economy, most aimed at reforming the
unwieldy tax system.
	   However, the Communists who lead parliament have balked at
measures that would raise taxes, and it's not clear whether they
will give their blessing to the entire program. Parliament plans a
special session Wednesday for further debate on the measures.
	   Russia's latest financial crisis struck in May, the result of
several factors: a sharp drop in the prices of Russia's oil
exports, a wave of labor protests, and general skittishness linked
to the Asian financial crisis.

NYSE chief praises London-Frankfurt stock alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The New York Stock Exchange chairman praised the
planned alliance between Europe's top two markets, London and
Frankfurt, but he wouldn't say on Monday when the Big Board might
seek a similar deal.
	   ``I expect this is just the dawning moment,'' Richard Grasso
told Dow Jones Newswires before addressing an audience of business
leaders. ``The likelihood of some trans-oceanic link grows
exponentially each day.''
	   But Grasso wouldn't be drawn on whether the NYSE might seek an
alliance, either overseas or with the Chicago Board Options
Exchange. The CBOE is the New York market's biggest customer, and
Grasso said it makes sense for the two exchanges to gain better
access to one another.
	   ``Whether that suggests there should be a consolidation or joint
ownership, at this point I can tell you there are no discussions
along those lines,'' Grasso said.
	   The London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Boerse in Frankfurt
have long been serious rivals, and they stunned investors last week
by announcing plans to form an alliance that they hope will lead to
a Europewide exchange trading blue-chip shares.
	   ``In the final analysis that's good for everyone in capital
markets around the world,'' Grasso said.
	   But he acknowleged alliances of more than one market can be
difficult to accomplish, and he predicted it would take ``a long
time'' for a single global stock market to emerge.

El-Bashir: Sudan must end rebel threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir visited
a southern town besieged by rebels and told the army that his
government has ``decided to clean all areas from the rebels,'' a
newspaper reported Monday.
	   El-Bashir said an end to the rebellion was vital to the
country's economic progress.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army controls most of the south
and has encircled the town of Juba, where el-Bashir addressed the
soldiers.
	   ``We want the young men who are carrying guns, be they on our
side or on the other side, to come and build Sudan,'' the Akhbar
al-Youm daily quoted el-Bashir as saying.
	   To achieve that goal ``we need capital and to have such capital,
we have to put an end to this war,'' he said.
	   He added that ``we have decided to clean all areas from the
rebels down to the southern borders.''
	   The civil war had devastated parts of Sudan. More than a million
people are in danger of starving in the south, relief agencies have
said.
	   Juba, a government stronghold in the south, is 1,200 kilometers
(770 miles), south of the capital, Khartoum.
	   The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 for autonomy for the
predominantly Christian, African and animist south from the Muslim
and Arab north.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A member of a prominent family of
shipowners was arrested Monday in connection with the shooting of a
business rival on a busy port street, police said.
	   Vangelis Ventouris, 39, was taken into custody by authorities
investigating the attack on Constantinos Agapitos, 40, who was
wounded in the legs and shoulder when two gunmen on a motorcycle
shot him five times early Monday.
	   Ventouris has been charged with attempted murder and illegal
possession and use of a weapon, police said. The man other man on
the motorcycle was identified as a bodyguard of Ventouris.
Authorities did not release the other suspect's name or indicate
who is accused of firing the shots.
	   Ventouris denied any involvement in the attack and said he was
at his home with friends when it occurred, media reported.
	   But police who searched his home found a motorcycle and a .38
caliber revolver allegedly used in the attack.

NYSE chief praises London-Frankfurt stock alliance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Also moved on general news lines &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The New York Stock Exchange chairman praised the
planned alliance between Europe's top two markets, London and
Frankfurt, but he wouldn't say on Monday when the Big Board might
seek a similar deal.
	   ``I expect this is just the dawning moment,'' Richard Grasso
told Dow Jones Newswires before addressing an audience of business
leaders. ``The likelihood of some trans-oceanic link grows
exponentially each day.''
	   But Grasso wouldn't be drawn on whether the NYSE might seek an
alliance, either overseas or with the Chicago Board Options
Exchange. The CBOE is the New York market's biggest customer, and
Grasso said it makes sense for the two exchanges to gain better
access to one another.
	   ``Whether that suggests there should be a consolidation or joint
ownership, at this point I can tell you there are no discussions
along those lines,'' Grasso said.
	   The London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Boerse in Frankfurt
have long been serious rivals, and they stunned investors last week
by announcing plans to form an alliance that they hope will lead to
a Europewide exchange trading blue-chip shares.
	   ``In the final analysis that's good for everyone in capital
markets around the world,'' Grasso said.
	   But he acknowleged alliances of more than one market can be
difficult to accomplish, and he predicted it would take ``a long
time'' for a single global stock market to emerge.

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels armed with guns and machetes
threw petrol bombs and hacked to death 34 people who were watching
the final game of the World Cup on television at a roadside lodge,
witnesses said Monday.
	   Soldiers later helped residents of Tare, 35 kilometers (20
miles), on the main road north of Kigali, to clear out the charred
remains of victims who were slaughtered when a group of rebels
attacked the lodge at 8 p.m. local time (1800 GMT) Sunday.
	   Carbonized bodies _ some shot and other hacked up _ were buried
immediately in a hastily dug mass grave. One of the victims was a
child who lay on a blood-stained mattress with his throat slit.
	   Bartender Jean de Dieu Mwumvaneza told passersby he escaped
death by hiding in a latrine when a group of about 40 rebels burst
in and opened fire.
	   ``They ordered everyone to stay put, and then opened fire.
People were shouting,'' he said.
	   Officials at the scene said only six government soldiers were
present during the attack. It wasn't clear what happened to them.
	   The victims included travelers and locals who gathered at the
Pensez-y Hotel to watch the final match between France and Brazil.
	   No official comment was immediately available, and state-run TV
and radio carried no news of the massacre.
	   Earlier, officials said the rebels shot dead Johnson Ruranjwa,
an official in Kigombe, about 90 kilometers (55 miles) northwest of
Kigali, and his two children, also on Sunday.
	   On Monday, soldiers and drivers traveling on the road to Kigali
reported fighting between the army and rebels around Kigombe and
nearby Nyaratovu, but no details were available.
	   Last week, army spokesman Maj. Emmanuel Ndahiro said government
troops killed more than 50 rebels on Rwanda's northwest border with
the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
	   The rebels had been hiding in the forests or had crossed from
neighboring Congo.
	   Thousands of people have been killed in rebel attacks since the
return from exile in November 1996 of more than 1 million Hutu
refugees.
	   Former Hutu soldiers and militiamen lived among bona fide
refugees when they fled Rwanda in mid-1994, fearing reprisals for
the slaughter of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically
moderate Hutus.
	   The Hutu-organized genocide was stopped in July 1994 when
Tutsi-led rebels took power.
	   But attacks against the Tutsi survivors, local authorities, tea
factories and Hutus suspected of collaborating with the authorities
continue.
	   After the attacks spread from the northwest, a traditional Hutu
strongold, to central and western Rwanda, the army used troops,
tanks and helicopters to restore order.
	   The government has recently claimed success in trying to
convince the predominantly Hutu population to cooperate with the
authorities in arresting those suspected of attacks.

Newspaper: Ethiopia, IMF agree on conditions for dlrs 125 million
</HEADLINE>
loan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopia and the International
Monetary Fund have agreed on conditions for a dlrs 125 million
structural adjustment loan, a newspaper reported.
	   The private weekly Reporter said Sunday that an agreement had
finally been reached after the loan was suspended more than 10
months ago when negotiations broke down over some key reform
measures the IMF wanted implemented before it would agree to
finance the government's structural adjustment program.
	   The newspaper said the IMF dropped a key demand that the
state-owned Commercial Bank of Ethiopia be split into three parts
to foster competition between the CBE and four private banks.
	   The CBE reportedly handles about 95 percent of the banking
business in Ethiopia.
	   The newspaper did not mention the fate of other reforms put
forth by the IMF at a consultative meeting with Ethiopia last
October.
	   Among these were:
	   _ opening up the banking and insurance sectors to foreign
investment;
	   _ further reductions in income taxes and customs duties to bring
them into line with those of other countries;
	   _ hastening and making more transparent the privatization of
state-owned companies.
	   The agreement is expected to smooth negotiations on the
reduction of Ethiopia's debt to the Paris Club of Creditors, which
now includes the Russian Federation.
	   Ethiopia reportedly owes Russia about dlrs 4 billion, mainly for
the purchased of military equipment during the former military
regime of Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam.
	   Ethiopia and Russia have disagreed over the dollar-to-ruble rate
at which the debt should be paid.

World Cup: Nike denies influencing Brazil's lineup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Nike on Monday denied putting pressure on Ronaldo or
his coach to have the Brazilian star play in the World Cup final.
	   ``With regard to rumors circulating about presumed pressures
Nike put on the Brazilian national soccer team so that Ronaldo
would play, Nike wants to emphasize that the report of such
involvement is absolutely false,'' a statement said.
	   The statement was released by the Italian branch of Nike in
response to a directive from company headquarters in the United
States, Nike Italy spokesman Massimo Giunco said.
	   Confusion surrounded Ronaldo's status for Sunday night's final
against France.
	   The two-time FIFA player of the year was not among the 11
starters initially picked by Brazil coach Mario Zagallo. But his
name was reinstated to the starting team just before the match.
Ronaldo was ineffective during the game as Brazil tumbled to a
humiliating 3-0 defeat.
	   What is unclear is what happened between the initial lineup
decision and the start of the game.
	   FIFA, the sport's governing body, said Ronaldo had gone to the
hospital for X-rays on his left ankle, and doctors cleared him to
play just before the game. Team doctor Lidio Toledo said Ronaldo
felt dizzy after lunch, while press officer Nelson Borges said the
player had vomited.
	   There were reports of locker room squabbles as to whether
Ronaldo should be on the field.
	   ``What is true is that last night's game was the most important
moment of Ronaldo's career,'' the Nike Italy statement said. ``To
play the final of a World Cup is the dream of any player, Ronaldo
included.
	   ``Ronaldo and Zagallo decided together to crown this dream which
the Brazilian player _ probably _ deserved to live. In all of this,
Nike did not interfere in any way. And besides, why should it
have?''
	   The 21-year-old striker, who plays his club soccer for Italy's
Inter Milan, was one of the focal points of Nike's World Cup
advertising campaign.
	   The sports shoe company has a 10-year sponsorship deal with the
Brazilian team for a reported dlrs 200 million, and in May signed
an 11-year deal with Inter Milan worth at least dlrs 125 million.
	   Brazil has derisively been called Team Nike, while FIFA has
decried the influence sponsors hold on the sport.

Businessman, philanthropist and tax exile Octav Botnar dies at 84
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILLARS, Switzerland (AP) _ Former Nissan UK chief Octav Botnar,
a war hero, philanthropist and millionaire businessman whose last
years were marked by scandal, has died, his lawyer and officials in
his adopted home town confirmed Monday. He was 84.
	   Having secured exclusive rights to distribute Nissan cars in
Britain, Botnar's Nissan UK empire came crashing down in 1991.
	   First Nissan withdrew his franchise. Then his headquarters in
Worthing, on England's south coast, were raided by inspectors from
the Inland Revenue, Britain's tax-collecting agency.
	   Wanted on tax fraud charges, Botnar was forced to fight his
legal battle with the Revenue from exile in Switzerland. The
charges were dropped last year because Botnar was considered too
ill to stand trial.
	   By then, his business was in ruins and two colleagues had served
jail sentences. His business had been forced to pay out a 59
million pounds (dlrs 96.5 million) settlement towards a 239 million
pounds (dlrs 391 million) corporation tax claim. To the end, he
claimed he was innocent.
	   Botnar died Saturday, his lawyer Mark Spragg said. He lived in
the village of Chesieres near the town of Villars in Western
Switzerland for six years until his death, a town official said.
	   Botnar was born in what is now Western Ukraine on October 21,
1913. A prisoner of war and former French Resistance fighter during
World War II, he went to Romania afterwards but quickly became
disillusioned with communism.
	   Arrested by the regime as an opponent in the early 1960s, he
spent seven years in prison before his release under a general
amnesty in 1964.
	   He and wife Marcela went to England where Botnar entered the car
import trade. He formed Nissan UK in 1970, an official biography
said.
	   He built an empire estimated at 2 billion pounds (dlrs 3.27
billion) but ruin was to come in 1991.
	   The Inland Revenue focused on allegations that Botnar together
with two senior directors _ Frank Shannon and Michael Hunt _
inflated the charges for shipping Nissan cars to Britain and
siphoned off the money via a Swiss bank account.
	   Botnar's only child Camelia, 21, died in a car crash in Britain
in 1968. He donated 13 million pounds (dlrs 21 million) to London's
Great Ormond Street Hospital in her memory.
	   Britain's Conservative Party chairman Lord Parkinson once
described Botnar as one of the country's greatest philanthropists.
	   In February, Botnar sued the Inland Revenue for damages and
malicious prosecution. The case is continuing.
	   Botnar suffered ill-health in later life and his stomach was
removed in 1993 after an operation for cancer. Spragg was uncertain
of the exact cause of death.
	   Botnar was buried Monday in Paris, Spragg said. He is survived
by his wife Marcela.

U.S. drug czar parises Sweden's drugs policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey,
beginning a European fact-finding tour, on Monday praised Sweden's
drug policies, saying they make far more sense than liberalized
policies such that in the Netherlands.
	   McCaffrey last week sparked Dutch ire by saying the country's
policy of letting its citizens use marijuana and other soft drugs
for therapeutic and recreational purposes was ``an unmitigated
disaster.''
	   The trip comes as the U.S. government launches a dlrs 1 billion,
five-year ad campaign aimed at steering young people away from
trying drugs.
	   ``We are sure that the most important inoculation for a society
is to convince your own young people to reject the abuse of drugs
... that includes alcohol and cigarettes. And I think Sweden by the
evidence that's available has done a better job at that than almost
any society in Europe and certainly better than the United
States,'' McCaffrey told a news conference.
	   Sweden, which discourages alcohol and tobacco use through high
taxes, and which keeps a tight watch on other drug use, has created
a ``national consensus'' against drugs, he said.
	   Statistics compiled from various sources by McCaffrey's Office
of National Drug Control Policy show that about 3 percent of
Swedish teen-agers report having used cannabis, compared with 9.1
percent in the United States and 30.2 percent in the Netherlands.
	   McCaffrey, however, cautioned countries with low drug-use rates
that they may come under increasing pressure as U.S. drug use
declines and sellers look for new markets.
	   ``The United States is probably in the end phases of an
epidemic; it's possible that Europe is in the beginning phases of
an epidemic,'' he said.
	   Despite his criticism of Dutch drug policy, McCaffrey will
travel this week to the Netherlands ``to learn from them and listen
to their own viewpoint.
	   ``But I also do understand, and I share their concern, that the
Netherlands has become the source of much of the amphetamines
manufactured in Europe, it has become a source country for much of
the Ecstasy manufactured and distributed throughout Europe,'' he
said.
	   The Netherlands ``does have a drug abuse problem in general that
is enormous and growing, not getting better ... Their prison
population has doubled, their murder rate is much higher than it
used to be,'' he said.

Britain seeks to block EU duties on cotton imports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Britain's foreign minister said Monday
he will seek to block proposed European Union anti-dumping duties
on cotton imports from China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and
Turkey.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the proposed duties posed a
risk to tens of thousands of European textile jobs that outweighed
any benefits to be gained in protecting Europe's cotton industry
from low-cost imports.
	   ``We will continue to oppose it, and I don't think they'll get
it through,'' Cook told reporters after a meeting of EU foreign
ministers.
	   The issue split the EU ministers. France, Italy, Spain and
Portugal supported the duties, while seven other nations backed
Britain in opposing measures which they warned would push up prices
of raw material used by Europe's textile finishing sector.
	   ``Interests of the (EU) producer industry have to be weighed
against the interests of the major user industries across Europe,''
said a statement released by Britain, Austria, Denmark, Finland
Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden.
	   The European Commission introduced provisional, six-month duties
on unbleached cotton cloth from the six exporting countries in
April. The EU executive has powers to impose such temporary duties,
but needs backing from most member nations for a proposal to
introduce definitive five-year duties.
	   Britain's Minister for Europe Doug Henderson told the meeting
7,000 British jobs would be immediately threatened. British
officials said the longer-term impact of the duties could
jeopardize up to 200,000 jobs.
	   ``The Commission's decision ... to impose provisional duties,
disregarding the views of a majority of EU countries, was most
regrettable,'' Henderson said.
	   An attempt by the Commission to impose similar definitive duties
last year was voted down by EU ministers.
	   The provisional duties average 15 percent. They range from 14.7
percent on imports from Turkey to 32.5 percent on imports from
Pakistan.
	   They were introduced after allegations from Eurocoton, which
represents European cotton and textile industries, that the six
countries sold their cotton in Europe at unfairly low prices.

<TEXT>
	   CORK, Ireland (AP) _ Chris Boardman, who held the leader's
yellow jersey for the first two days of the Tour de France, was
hospitalized Monday after crashing out of the second stage.
	   The accident occurred about 90 miles (150 kms) into the
127.4-mile (205.5-km) race outside the town of Youghal.
	   The 29-year-old British rider suffered a deep cut above one eye,
complained to paramedics about pain in a cheekbone and a wrist, and
was carried by stretcher into an ambulance.
	   He was taken to Cork University Hospital for a precautionary
brain scan. A spokesman there said he would stay there overnight,
but couldn't confirm whether Boardman had suffered any broken bones
in his face or arm.
	   Tour officials planned to publish a medical report on Boardman's
condition later Monday.

Amnesty International: Rwanda must reinstate U.N. rights mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Amnesty International called on Rwanda
Monday to reinstate the U.N. human rights mission it suspended in
May because of a disagreement over the agency's operations in the
country.
	   A delegation representing the U.N. Human Rights Field Operations
in Rwanda arrived in Kigali Sunday for five days of talks with the
government.
	   ``The UN Human Rights Field Operation is one of the very few
international organizations left monitoring and publicly reporting
the human rights situation in Rwanda,'' said London-based Amnesty
International.
	   ``It would be disastrous if the U.N. High Commissioner for Human
Rights now agrees to remove or dilute this essential part of the
operation's mandate.''
	   The Rwandan government said in May it suspended the mission
because of lack of coordination.
	   The government said the mandate of the mission, which was set up
following the 1994 genocide, was due for review. Rwanda wants the
mission to halt monitoring human rights abuses and devote its
efforts to educating people about human rights.
	   The Amnesty statement said the Rwandan government has set a
deadline of July 27 for reaching agreement on the mission's
mandate, otherwise it will close down the operation.
	   ``The human rights situation in Rwanda is critical,'' the
Amnesty statement said. ``We receive almost daily reports about
killings and `disappearances,' and the UNHRFOR is indispensable for
investigating and documenting these cases on the ground.''
	   Rwanda's present government took control in July 1994 after
Tutsi-led rebels ousted the extremist Hutu government that had
sponsored the genocide.
	   The slaughter left more than half a million Tutsis and moderate
Hutus dead.
	   Many of the former Hutu government soldiers and militias fled
among bona-fide Hutu refugees, fearing reprisals, and returned only
in Nov. 1996.
	   Amnesty and the U.N. human rights agency have reported that
thousands of people have since been killed in attacks by Hutu
rebels and counterattacks by the predominantly Tutsi military.

Ten nations join EU in sanctions on Belarus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with EU condemnation, quotes

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union condemned what it
said was Belarus' violation of the international convention on
diplomatic relations and imposed travel restrictions on Belarus
officials Monday in a dispute over ambassadorial residences in
Minsk.
	   Ten non-European Union nations joined the EU in the action.
	   The EU decided to retaliate against orders from the Belarusian
government that several nations vacate their ambassadors'
residences in a diplomatic compound, saying the measures
``constitute an infringement of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic
relations.''
	   The EU action prohibits admission of Belarus officials into any
of the 15 EU member states, from President Alexander Lukashenko,
his cabinet ministers and their deputies to a range of lesser
officials including the chairmen of the State Patent Committee and
the State Committee for Hydrometeorology.
	   ``We continue to be at loggerheads with President Lukashenko and
his administration,'' said British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
	   Joining the EU were Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic,
Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Iceland and Norway,
who said in a joint statement they ``will ensure that their
national policies conform to that common position.''
	   Diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Greece, Italy, and Japan left Belarus to consult with their
governments over the dispute. The Bulgarian and Polish ambassadors
also were recalled home.
	   ``As a signal of the seriousness with which it takes the
situation, (the EU) has adopted a common position imposing
non-admission in the member states of the European Union of all
members of the government as well as senior officials of the
Republic of Belarus,'' the EU said.
	   Poland, while declaring its solidarity with the EU and
condemning Belarus, declined to join in the action. Citing its
position as chairman of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, Poland said it ``feels it is responsible
before the international community for maintaining a dialogue with
the people of Belarus and for ensuring the conditions for further
operation of the OSCE mission in Minsk.''
	   Belarus has said it needs to repair the plumbing and sewage
system in the compound where the ambassadorial residences are
located. The ambassadors say that under the Vienna Convention,
Belarus has no right to force them out for any reason.

Italian judge drops case against US Marines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS, UPDATES with more reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By VICTOR L. SIMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRENTO, Italy (AP) _ To the dismay of victims' families here, an
Italian judge Monday dropped the case against the crew members of a
Marine jet that severed a ski gondola cable in the Alps, killing 20
people.
	   Judge Carlo Ancona ruled that Italian courts lacked jurisdiction
under the NATO treaty.
	   Trento Prosecutor Francantonio Granero had pushed for
manslaughter indictments in Italy against the four-man crew, even
though the Rome government had acquiesced to American prosecution
in the case.
	   Granero said he would decide on an appeal after reading the full
decision, which was expected within a few days.
	   Alberto Mioni, a lawyer for the families of two Italian victims,
said he was ``extremely disappointed'' by the decision and
questioned whether a military court in the United States would
deliver verdicts that did justice for the victims.
	   ``My hopes for justice have been set back,'' said Klaus Stampfl,
29, whose mother died in the Feb. 3 accident.
	   In the United States, lawyers and families of the crew members
expressed relief.
	   ``We are glad to have that potential burden lifted,'' said Dave
Beck of Knoxville, Tenn., civilian defense lawyer for Capt. Joseph
Schweitzer, the plane's navigator. ``Now we have some monumental
problems to take care of trying to get a fair trial'' in the United
States.
	   On Friday, a Marine general ordered Capt. Richard J. Ashby, the
pilot of jet, and Schweitzer tried on manslaughter charges in a
U.S. military court.
	   Ashby and Schweitzer, both 30, are accused by U.S. military
prosecutors of flying too low through a mountain pass in their
EA-6B jet in the Feb. 3 accident. They could get up to life in
prison if convicted in a military court.
	   Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commander of Marine Corps Forces Atlantic,
dismissed charges against the two officers in the back seat of the
jet, Capts. Chandler P. Seagraves and William L. Raney II.
	   The incident sparked a crisis in U.S.-Italian relations and
demands by some for a closing of U.S. bases in Italy.
	   The United States insisted it had sole jurisdiction in the case
because of a NATO treaty. Washington maintains the EA-6B Prowler
was flying under the auspices of NATO when the incident occurred.
	   Granero argued that the plane violated the NATO treaty's
mandated flight patterns, and therefore the flight should be
considered a U.S. mission _ which would give Italy jurisdiction.
Granero also challenged the constitutionality of the NATO treaty.
	   Lawyers said the judge limited arguments to the question of
jurisdiction in the closed 90-minute hearing Monday.
	   Ancona also dropped the case against three top U.S. military
officials at the Aviano base in northern Italy, where the jet was
stationed.
	   Evidence showed the plane severed the ski cable at 370 feet (111
meters), well below the minimum allowed altitude of 1,000 feet (300
meters).

Svorada wins final Irish stage of Tour de France as Boardman falls

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Zabel wins yellow jersey, Boardman hospitalized,
comment from Svorada and Steels' green jersey win
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CORK, Ireland (AP) _ Jan Svorada of the Czech Republic won a
sprint finish Monday in the final Irish stage of the Tour de
France, while Germany's Erik Zabel took over the yellow jersey as
the overall leader.
	   Britain's Chris Boardman, who held the yellow jersey for the
first two days, crashed out of the competition after a heavy fall
and was hospitalized.
	   Australia's Robbie McEwan finished second in Monday's stage and
Italy's Mario Cipollini was third. By finishing 17th, Zabel won the
yellow jersey for the first time in his career.
	   The 189 riders stuck together and set a leisurely pace through
most of the 127.4-mile (205.5 km) stage along Ireland's flat
southern coast. That set up a sprint finish along Cork's straight
Carrigrohane Road.
	   ``I had a good position on the finish line and I pushed it,''
said Svorada, who last won a Tour stage for his Mapei-Bricobi team
in 1994.
	   His Belgian teammate, Tom Steels, won the first stage in Dublin
on Sunday, finished fifth Monday and won the green jersey, denoting
the Tour's most consistent point-scorer.
	   ``So this is another good win for our team,'' Svorada said.
``Tomorrow I hope to help Tom win the yellow jersey too.''
	   Boardman crashed after his front wheel accidentally clipped the
year wheel of his Gan teammate, Frederic Moncassin of France.
Boardman's helmet hit a stone fence by the roadside, cutting his
forehead and forcing doctors to send him to a Cork hospital for a
precautionary brain scan.
	   University Cork Hospital said Boardman would remain hospitalized
overnight, but declined to specify his injuries.
	   A second pileup 7 miles (12 kms) from the end knocked a big hole
in the peleton, as more than a dozen cyclists toppled over and
others veered onto the grassy banks to avoid the collision.
	   Another sprint began immediately after Monday's finish _ to Cork
Airport. The remaining 188 riders and their support staff all flew
to Brittany, the northwest Atlantic region of France where the
racing resumes Tuesday afternoon.
	   The Tour had started outside France 12 times previously in its
95-year history, but never before in Ireland, which produced two
star Tour riders in the 1980s but has none in this year's contest.
	   The residents of dozens of towns and villages turned out in
their tens of thousands to line the route, throwing parties,
community competitions and street carnivals in honor of what they
considered a once-in-a-lifetime event.
	   Monday's race began at Enniscorthy, a market town nearby the
ancestral home of the Kennedy political dynasty, and passed the
Waterford crystal works, both mainstays of the tourist trail.
	   A third of the way along the passing peloton received a
tumultuous welcome from locals at Carrick-on-Suir, the cycling-mad
hometown of Sean Kelly, who won the green jersey a record-setting
four times on the Tour in the 1980s.
	   And the green banks of Cork's River Lee were adorned with floral
messages of FAILTE AU TOUR DE FRANCE, ``failte'' the Gaelic for
``welcome.''

EU foreign ministers issue statement on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with fresh details, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos BRU101-105
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union called for an
immediate cessation of hostilities in Kosovo Monday and a
resumption of negotiations with direct international involvement,
endorsing the principle of the use of force should any of the
parties block the process.
	   Foreign ministers said the 15-nation EU supported the adoption
of a U.N. Security Council resolution putting the United Nations'
weight behind international efforts and ``endorsed the principle of
further action under the U.N. charter to bring about compliance by
those who block the process.''
	   ``It is the understand of the (EU) Council that such action
would be under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter,'' which can
authorize the use of miltary force, the ministers said in a
statement on Kosovo.
	   The ministers, gathered for the first time under the new
Austrian presidency of the EU, were faced with what Austrian
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel called the Union's ``most
pressing external policy topic.''
	   ``The situation on the ground is getting worse, it's
explosive,'' said French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
	   Yugoslav security forces have been attempting to put down a
rebellion by ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo,
where they make up 90 percent of the population. Some of the
Albanians want greater autonomy for the region, others, including
the Kosovo Liberation Army, seek independence.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who was in Moscow over the
weekend for talks with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
has hinted the solution may lie in a conference such as the one at
Dayton, Ohio, that ended the fighting in Bosnia in 1995.
	   ``Last night I had a telephone conversation with (U.S. Secretary
of State) Madeleine Albright and I have brought some new ideas,''
Kinkel said. He was not specific.
	   ``The important thing to us is ... to move toward a negotiated
settlement geared to autonomy,'' said Schuessel. ``The difficulty
in talking about autonomy is everybody understands the term
differently.''
	   He added: ``The more concrete, the more practical the proposals
you have on the table, the less fear there is.''
	   An EU statement reiterated that the primary responsibility for
the crisis lies with the Yugoslav government of President Slobodan
Milosevic. At the same time, it demanded that ``outside assistance
and support to armed Kosovo Albanian groups should cease
immediately.''
	   ``We have to think anew about several things,'' Kinkel said.
``It's quite clear that what the EU has done so far has not brought
the success we all wanted.''
	   The EU approved the decision by the six-nation Contact Group on
Kosovo - the United States, Russia, Germany, France, Italy and
Britain - to recommend ``elements for the future status of Kosovo''
for the parties to use in their talks.
	   The EU ``emphasized that international involvement in the
dialogue remains an essential element of credible negotiations.''
	   ``What is new is that the European Union is concerning itself
more with the status of Kosovo and will be looking at possible
models for autonomy,'' the Austrian foreign minister said.
	   He added that in Kinkel's talks with Primakov, ``Mr. Kinkel did
detect some movement on the part of the Russians, some indication
the Russians might accept some autonomy within Yugoslavia.''
	   Schuessel said the 15-nation EU had to continue to apply
pressure in order to achieve a dialogue between the forces in the
province.
	   ``Pressure on Belgrade to fulfill the international obligations
has to be maintained,'' he said. ``On the other hand, pressure also
has to be applied to the inhabitants of Kosovo, as a growing
radicalization can be detected. Those Albanian leaders and
politicians that strive for peace have to be supported.''
	   The 16-nation NATO defense alliance is working on plans for an
eventual military intervention if diplomatic efforts fail to end
the fighting.
	   Planning involves a preventive deployment of troops along the
borders of Kosovo in neighboring Albania and Macedonia; A graduated
air campaign within Yugoslavia; and a deployment of ground troops
into Yugoslavia.
	   The emphasis in recent days, however, has swung back to
diplomatic efforts.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A bomb exploded Monday in a courthouse
rest room, causing damage but no injuries in the empty building,
police said.
	   Authorities evacuated the two-story building following a warning
call to an Athens newspaper. The device _ a homemade time bomb _
exploded shortly after 7 p.m. (1600 GMT), about 35 minutes after
the call.
	   The blast caused damage to the second floor of the building,
which houses civil and criminal courtrooms in the capital's main
judicial complex.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast _
the latest in a string of bombings around Athens.
	   Small leftist groups have been linked to most of the previous
bomb attacks, which rarely cause injuries.

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ An Irish peacekeeper and a Lebanese
civilian were wounded Monday when mortar shells fired from an
Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon crashed into a village,
U.N. officials said.
	   Also Monday, Israeli warplanes fired four air-to-surface
missiles at guerrilla hideouts in the hills and valleys of Iqlim
al-Tuffah, a guerrilla stronghold that faces the Israeli-occupied
border enclave, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from the area, but there was no
immediate word on casualties from the air raid, the second in south
Lebanon in a week.
	   Sgt. Patrick Leahy and the Lebanese civilian were wounded when
two mortar shells struck the village of Haddatha, on the edge of
the Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon, U.N. officials said.
	   Leahy was slightly wounded by shrapnel when the shell landed
near his vehicle, the officials added, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Troops of the nine-country, 4,500-member U.N. force in Lebanon
often have been caught in the fighting between Israeli forces and
guerrillas. Two hundred and twenty soldiers have died in attacks
and accidents since the force was deployed in 1978.
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army confirmed the afternoon air raid,
saying all planes returned safely to base.
	   Iqlim al-Tuffah, a frequent target of Israeli warplanes, is used
by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group as a base to launch
attacks against Israeli troops and their allied militiamen in the
occupied zone.
	   Last Tuesday, Israeli warplanes attacked suspected guerrilla
positions in Shiite Muslim villages facing the occupied zone
following firefights between Israeli troops and Hezbollah
guerrillas. There were no casualties in that raid.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 members of the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia from the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern towns
from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

ITF backs off on proposal to drop let rule
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A controversial proposal to abolish the let rule
in tennis has been put on hold after failing to win the players'
backing.
	   The International Tennis Federation said Monday that the
proposal had been withdrawn pending further research and
consultation over the next 12 months.
	   The rule change was debated at the ITF's annual general meeting
in Killarney, Ireland.
	   The proposal, designed to speed up play, would mean no replay of
serves that hit the net before landing in an opponent's service
box. The ball would be in play.
	   U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter and former No. 1 Andre Agassi
were among players who had spoken out against the change.
	   ``If you play (lets), I think you're just throwing in a whole
other element,'' Agassi said during Wimbledon. ``It just seems so
random, almost somewhat lucky. ... It would be a horrific change in
the game.''
	   Rafter had raised the possibility of boycotting the Australian
Open if the let rule was changed.
	   ITF spokesman Alun James said the federation consulted with the
men's and women's tours, Davis Cup captains, television networks,
manufacturers and sponsors.
	   ``We had a mixed response,'' he said. ``There was some concern
in the meeting that we needed perhaps some more weight behind the
abolition of the net. ... Although there was merit in the
discussions, it was felt we should do some more research and
analysis.''
	   James said the ATP Tour, which runs the men's game, had
expressed its opposition to the proposal but had not indicated what
it would do if the change was approved.
	   The WTA Tour, which governs women's tennis, was split over the
proposal but had said it would abide by the new rule if adopted,
James said.
	   James said there was no firm commitment either way by the Grand
Slam Committee, which represents the four majors _ Wimbledon and
the U.S., French and Australian Opens.
	   ``Within the meeting, there was the whole spectrum, ranging from
people who felt that tennis making any change would be a very
progressive step, to those who don't want the rules to change at
all,'' he said.
	   At the same time, the ITF voted to introduce a no-ad scoring
system at lower-tier events as a two-year ``optional experiment.''
	   Under the system, if a game goes to deuce, the winner of the
point wins the game, meaning that no game lasts more than seven
points.
	   The rule is intended to shorten matches and inject an element of
excitement, similar to a tiebreak, into individual games.
	   The no-ad system will be introduced next year in zonal group
Davis Cup competition and in Fed Cup qualifying events.
	   If the system proves successful, it could be adopted for general
use at major competitions.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Humbled by voter ire over Japan's sputtering
economy, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Monday he would step
down, opening a scramble for a successor at a time quick action is
needed to pull the country out of recession.
	   The resignation came after Hashimoto's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party was dealt a humiliating defeat in Sunday's elections for the
upper house of Parliament, losing 17 of its seats.
	   ``I'm responsible for all that happened, and my ability was not
sufficient,'' Hashimoto said tersely in a nationally televised
speech, his eyes red and face weary with the fatigue of two weeks
of campaigning.
	   The announcement _ ending Hashimoto's 2 1/2 years in office _
triggered jockeying in LDP ranks for a successor. The search could
be complicated by calls by the newly emboldened opposition for
elections in the lower house.
	   The political scrimmage comes as Japan is grappling with its
worst recession since World War II. Some worried that the jockeying
would get in the way of tending to the economy.
	   The economy is in bad need of a quick fix. Unemployment is at a
record high of 4.1 percent. Bankruptcies are soaring. Japan's
financial system is wobbling under massive bad loans.
	   ``The result of this election is that policy has become
confused,'' said Jiro Nemoto, chairman of the Japan Federation of
Employers Associations. ``A major problem is we face a delay in
implementation of policies that we need.''
	   Hashimoto will serve until a successor is chosen. Top candidates
were LDP powerbrokers Keizo Obuchi, Japan's foreign minister, and
former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama _ neither seen as
an economic specialist.
	   The party hopes to nominate one on July 21. Parliament is not
expected to reconvene to approve the nominee until after July 26.
	   The uncertainty over Japan's political turmoil was reflected in
the markets Monday.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average slid some 280
points at one point in the morning but recovered as investors
decided the government probably would stick by its reform plans. It
closed with a gain of 270 points, or 1.68 percent.
	   The dollar surged against the yen in early Asian trading, but
soon ran out of steam as traders rushed to take profits. In late
afternoon, the dollar bought 142.42 yen, up 1.09 yen from late
Friday in Tokyo.
	   Despite the turmoil, Hashimoto's departure could prove a boon to
the economy by boosting the chances of the new government moving to
lower taxes _ which many economists feel is needed to perk up
Japan's sluggish consumer demand.
	   The government waffled on the issue before elections. But with
the LDP punished by voters for its vague stance and the pro-tax cut
opposition's hand strengthened, the party may have no choice but to
follow through.
	   ``I think one of the things that the market is expecting ... is
with Hashimoto gone, there may be scope for greater income tax
cuts,'' said Peter Morgan, chief economist for HSBC Securities
Japan Ltd.
	   Concern remained, however, especially over how Japan's new
political landscape would affect long-term plans to overhaul the
nation's debt-laden financial system.
	   The conservative, pro-business Liberal Democrats will continue
to rule because they have firm control over the more powerful lower
house, which can pass the national budget and choose the prime
minister without the approval of the upper house.
	   But in Sunday's election, they won only 44 seats, far short of
the 69 seats they needed to regain a majority in the upper chamber,
which they lost in 1989. Only half the chamber's 252 seats were
decided Sunday. The LDP's total share is now down to 102.
	   The weakened party will now need the cooperation of other
parties to pass key legislation. That was not expected to be easy,
with opposition parties on Monday already clamoring for the
dissolution of the lower house and general elections.
	   Morgan said the new political players on the block are the wild
card in how Japan's financial reform plans will be carried out.
	   ``It's really now up to the opposition to dictate its terms,''
he said. ``We have no idea what that might entail.''
	   Emerging strongly in the elections were the Democrats _ a
liberal, relatively new party headed by the popular former health
minister, Naoto Kan, who promised a tax cut early in the campaign.
	   They won 27 seats, a gain of nine, and now hold 47 in the entire
upper house.
	   On the streets of Japan, the hope was for something different.
	   ``We need somebody new to finally change things,'' said Akemi
Adachi, 28.

In New York's Times Square, assault on porn threatens a family

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ For his grandfather, naughty pinups drew the
customers in the 1950s. His father held out through the hard-core
porn revolution of the 1970s that turned New York's Times Square
into a chaotic swirl of prurience and purple neon.
	   Lou Lipkin is long dead. George Lipkin has retired to Long
Island. So it falls to a third generation of Lipkins to keep the
family business prospering _ a business as synonymous with Times
Square as the word ``theater'' is with Broadway.
	   Now, at a time when the most vocal sentiment from New York's
mayor down paints him as an agent of filth, Scott Lipkin wants
people to know he's a law-abiding merchant trying, like his father
and grandfather, to make a living selling sexual imagery in the
place some call the world's crossroad.
	   ``I love New York,'' says Lipkin, 29, a compact man with a
stoical face and a black ponytail that reaches down his back. ``I
just don't love what they're doing to us. We've paid taxes for
three generations.''
	   Lipkin has watched Disney buy up Times Square property, and now
sees Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani promoting a law to drive sex shops
out of residential areas.
	   ``We're all here because of sex,'' Lipkin says. ``We're
interested in it. It's a beautiful thing. We should have places
where people can come to understand sexuality.''
	   In Times Square, sex has hardly been subtle; the district is
known across the world as the place where the gargoyles shine in
voluptuous neon, where names like ``Peep World'' and ``Playpen''
protrude from among newsstands, bodegas and electronics shops.
	   But as Giuliani pushes his effort to revitalize New York, Times
Square's very visibility has made it a centerpiece of reform. High
rents are driving out small businesses.
	   ``I see these things being torn down, and it's generations of my
history,'' Li[pkin says.
	   His grandfather, Lou Lipkin, fled Nazi Germany in the 1930s and
opened a bookstore just off Times Square. He soon discovered that
sex sells.
	   ``I have people who have been coming to my business for three
generations. They'll say, ``I remember your grandfather,''' Scott
Lipkin says today.
	   Today, the porn consumer profile has changed, primarily with the
rise of video. Women and couples have joined the regulars.
	   Lipkin says the city law that bars sex shops _ whether strip
joints or video stores _ from many areas of the city is just too
much.
	   ``My family's always abided by the law,'' he says. ``But it
makes me sick ... Look at the Internet. There's a lot of people who
are accepting of this. They just don't want to say it.''
	   The new law says that if the sexual content of the inventory is
above 40 percent, the store cannot be within 500 feet (150 meters)
of a residential neighborhood. So The Palace is having a sale. All
goods are half-price. ``Everything must go-go,'' says a
hand-lettered sign.
	   He'll reduce his stock, yes. But Scott Lipkin isn't giving up.
The law is under review in federal court, and the American Civil
Liberties Union, a prominent defense attorney and adult-video
studios are helping wage the battle.
	   ``Why do people come to New York City? Because you're going to
get material you're not going to get anywhere else,'' Lipkin says.
	   ``I like that they're trying to get more tourists and clean up
the neighborhood,'' he says. ``But we're not dirt. We don't need to
be cleaned up. I like what they're doing. I'd just like our
business to be a part of it.''

Ian Wright leaves Arsenal for West Ham

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, reported transfer fee &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Ian Wright, Arsenal's all-time leading goal
scorer, left the Premier League champions Monday to sign a two-year
contract with London rivals West Ham.
	   The 34-year-old England striker, who joined Arsenal from Crystal
Palace in 1991, broke Cliff Bastin's club record of 178 goals in
September 1997.
	   Wright was left off England's World Cup team because of injury.
He left Arsenal rather than accepting a substitute's role behind
Dennis Bergkamp and Nicolas Anelka.
	   The tranfer fee for Wright was reported to be less than 500,000
pounds (dlrs 800,000). At West Ham, managed by Harry Redknapp,
Wright will rejoin former Arsenal player John Hartson.
	   ``There are people here who will create a lot of chances and I
am the man who can finish them,'' Wright said. ``It will be
exciting to play with the likes of John Hartson, Eyal Berkovic,
Trevor Sinclair, Frank Lampard, Rio Ferdinand and Steve Lomas.''
	   Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger paid tribute to Wright, calling
him ``a legend at Highbury.''
	   ``We are sorry to lose a player with his ability and enthusiasm
for the game,'' the manager said. ``Wrighty is a unique character
who will be sadly missed by all associated with Arsenal.
	   ```His contribution to the recent success to the club is
exceptional, and a place in the history books as our all-time top
corer is an accolade he undoubtedly deserves.''

Press office says UN role in Chiapas conceivable, but not offered
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan hasn't
offered to help resolve the Chiapas conflict but could consider
such a role if the Mexican government asked for it, a U.N.
spokesman said Monday.
	   In a statement, the spokesman said Annan's remarks at a Friday
briefing may have been misinterpreted. The statement sought to
emphasize that Annan was reviewing documents from the government
about Chiapas but that he had not offered to take any role in
resolving the conflict.
	   ``Such a role could only be contemplated if certain conditions
were to be fulfilled, including a request from the Mexican
government,'' the statement said.
	   Annan, who left for the region Friday night, arrives in Mexico
July 21 at the end of a five-nation Latin American trip.

Qatari official in Emirates for talks on disputed islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Qatar's foreign minister
arrived in Abu Dhabi Monday to discuss a territorial dispute with
Emirates officials mediating between Qatar and Bahrain, a diplomat
said.
	   Foreign Minister Sheik Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani is expected to
meet with Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan and other officials
during his one day visit, said the Qatari diplomat, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Qatar and Bahrain have been feuding since the mid-1980s over the
Hawar islands in the Gulf, water boundaries, and the Zubara land
strip in Qatar where Bahrain's royal family lived 200 years ago.
	   Last month, Bahraini Housing Minister Sheik Khalid bin Abdullah
Al Khalifa unveiled plans to develop and link the Hawar islands to
the mainland with a 22.5-kilometer (14-mile) bridge.
	   Qatar said the Bahraini moves were a violation of a 1987
territorial accord brokered by Saudi Arabia.
	   Bahrain, which already has constructed a hotel on the tourist
resort island and launched a hovercraft service last year, says the
project does not constitute a violation of any agreements.
	   Rather, it accuses Qatar of trying to divert attention from
Bahraini accusations that the emirate submitted forged documents on
the dispute to the International Court of Justice, which began
mediating in February 1995.
	   The World Court, based in the Hague, Netherlands, has given
Qatar until Sept. 30 to prove the authenticity of its documents.

	   CORK, Ireland (AP) _ Chris Boardman, who held the leader's
yellow jersey for the first two days of the Tour de France, was
hospitalized Monday after crashing out of the second stage.
	   The accident occurred about 90 miles (150 kms) into the
127.4-mile (205.5-km) race outside the town of Youghal.
	   The 29-year-old British rider suffered a deep cut above one eye,
complained to paramedics about pain in a cheekbone and a wrist, and
was carried by stretcher into an ambulance.
	   He was taken to Cork University Hospital for a precautionary
brain scan.
	   Tour doctor David Curtis said Boardman had a fractured left
wrist, as well as cuts and bruises to his face. His arm was put in
a cast and he was being kept in hospital overnight.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Two bombs exploded Monday in court
buildings in Athens' main judicial compound, causing damage but no
injuries, police said.
	   The blasts were the latest in a string of bombings around Athens
linked to small leftist groups. But there was no immediate claim of
responsibility in the courthouse explosions.
	   The first device _ a homemade time bomb _ exploded in a
second-story rest room in a building housing civil and criminal
courtrooms.
	   Authorities evacuated the two-story building following a warning
call to local media about 35 minutes before the explosion shortly
after 7 p.m. (1600 GMT).
	   The second time bomb exploded less than a hour later in a
neighboring courthouse. There was no warning, police said.
	   A rash of bombings and arson attacks have plagued Athens since
last year targeting offices and cars belonging to politicians,
diplomats and journalists.
	   Small leftists groups have claimed responsibility for most of
the attacks. But the deadly terrorist group November 17 said it
carried out a rocket attack against a Citibank branch in April.

	   PARIS (AP) _ After a night of partying and a morning to sleep it
off, hundreds of thousands again took to the Champs-Elysees Monday,
this time to acclaim in person ``Les Bleus'' _ the beloved heroes
of France's World Cup win.
	   The players inched along the grand avenue in an open-topped bus,
dressed in their World Cup jerseys and displaying the coveted
golden trophy. A crush of adoring fans engulfed the bus, their arms
outstretched.
	   ``I've been up all night,'' said Elisabeth Wallon, 22. ``It was
magnificent. I've never seen a celebration like it.''
	   The avenue was so packed that the bus couldn't complete its
route up to the Arc de Triomphe, and had to escape off a side
street,
	   Just as they were on Sunday, the subways were again filled with
cheering, chanting people, young and old, their faces still painted
the red, white and blue of the French flag.
	   France's stunning 3-0 victory over Brazil sent the country into
a paroxysm of patriotic celebration not seen since the World War II
Liberation, and it was expected to last through Tuesday _ Bastille
Day.
	   ``The day of glory has arrived,'' France's national anthem goes,
and the French were singing it everywhere.
	   The merrymaking was marred, however, by an accident on the
Champs-Elysees in the early morning hours.
	   As more than a million people gathered on the avenue, a driver,
frightened by the aggressive crowd, panicked and careened out of
control, plowing into a crowd of revelers. Eighty people were
injured, 11 seriously. Another 70 later showed up at hospitals with
minor injuries.
	   The celebratory mood quickly turned into horror as dozens of
ambulances and 200 rescue workers converged on the scene. No one
was critically injured, however, officials said.
	   The driver, a 44-year-old schoolteacher who is undergoing
psychiatric treatment, fled in panic, said police prefect Philippe
Massoni. She turned herself later Monday with the help of her son,
and was in custody.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Two bombs exploded Monday in court
buildings in Athens' main judicial compound, causing damage but no
injuries, police said.
	   The blasts were the latest in a string of bombings around Athens
linked to small leftist groups. But there was no immediate claim of
responsibility in the courthouse explosions.
	   The first device _ a homemade time bomb _ exploded in a
second-story rest room in a building housing civil and criminal
courtrooms.
	   Authorities evacuated the two-story building following a warning
call to local media about 35 minutes before the explosion shortly
after 7 p.m. (1600 GMT).
	   The second time bomb exploded less than a hour later in a
neighboring courthouse. There was no warning, police said.
	   A rash of bombings and arson attacks have plagued Athens since
last year targeting offices and cars belonging to politicians,
diplomats and journalists.
	   Small leftists groups have claimed responsibility for most of
the attacks. But the deadly terrorist group November 17 said it
carried out a rocket attack against a Citibank branch in April.

Svorada wins final Irish stage of Tour de France as Boardman falls

	   CORK, Ireland (AP) _ Jan Svorada of the Czech Republic won a
sprint finish Monday in the final Irish stage of the Tour de
France, while Germany's Erik Zabel took over the yellow jersey as
the overall leader.
	   Britain's Chris Boardman, who held the yellow jersey for the
first two days, crashed out of the competition after a heavy fall
and was hospitalized with a broken left wrist and facial bruises.
	   Australia's Robbie McEwan finished second in Monday's stage and
Italy's Mario Cipollini was third. By finishing 17th, Zabel won the
yellow jersey for the first time in his career.
	   The 189 riders stuck together and set a leisurely pace through
most of the 127.4-mile (205.5 km) stage along Ireland's flat
southern coast. That set up a sprint finish along Cork's straight
Carrigrohane Road.
	   ``I had a good position on the finish line and I pushed it,''
said Svorada, who last won a Tour stage for his Mapei-Bricobi team
in 1994.
	   His Belgian teammate, Tom Steels, won the first stage in Dublin
on Sunday, finished fifth Monday and won the green jersey, denoting
the Tour's most consistent point-scorer.
	   ``So this is another good win for our team,'' Svorada said.
``Tomorrow I hope to help Tom win the yellow jersey too.''
	   Boardman crashed after his front wheel accidentally clipped the
year wheel of his Gan teammate, Frederic Moncassin of France.
Boardman's helmet hit a stone fence by the roadside, cutting his
forehead and forcing doctors to send him to a Cork hospital for a
precautionary brain scan.
	   University Cork Hospital said Boardman would remain hospitalized
overnight.

	   PARIS (AP) _ After a night of partying and a morning to sleep it
off, hundreds of thousands again took to the Champs-Elysees Monday,
this time to acclaim in person ``Les Bleus'' _ the beloved heroes
of France's World Cup win.
	   The players inched along the grand avenue in an open-topped bus,
dressed in their World Cup jerseys and displaying the coveted
golden trophy. A crush of adoring fans engulfed the bus, their arms
outstretched.
	   ``I've been up all night,'' said Elisabeth Wallon, 22. ``It was
magnificent. I've never seen a celebration like it.''
	   The avenue was so packed that the bus couldn't complete its
route up to the Arc de Triomphe, and had to escape off a side
street,
	   Just as they were on Sunday, the subways were again filled with
cheering, chanting people, young and old, their faces still painted
the red, white and blue of the French flag.
	   France's stunning 3-0 victory over Brazil sent the country into
a paroxysm of patriotic celebration not seen since the World War II
Liberation, and it was expected to last through Tuesday _ Bastille
Day.
	   ``The day of glory has arrived,'' France's national anthem goes,
and the French were singing it everywhere.
	   The merrymaking was marred, however, by an accident on the
Champs-Elysees in the early morning hours.
	   As more than a million people gathered on the avenue, a driver,
frightened by the aggressive crowd, panicked and careened out of
control, plowing into a crowd of revelers. Eighty people were
injured, 11 seriously. Another 70 later showed up at hospitals with
minor injuries.
	   The celebratory mood quickly turned into horror as dozens of
ambulances and 200 rescue workers converged on the scene. No one
was critically injured, however, officials said.
	   The driver, a 44-year-old schoolteacher who is undergoing
psychiatric treatment, fled in panic, said police prefect Philippe
Massoni. She turned herself later Monday with the help of her son,
and was in custody.

Legislators criticize DNA tests for new immigrants to Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VITA BEKKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ When Vladimir Gordokal came to join his
pregnant wife in Israel last year, the Interior Ministry asked him
to take a DNA test to prove his Jewish heritage.
	   Gordokal testified Monday a parliamentary hearing that he could
not afford to take the test, which costs about dlrs 600, in order
to get Israeli citizenship.
	   ``The money is the problem,'' Gordokal told The Associated
Press. ``Also I will have to pay to bring my father, who is still
in the Ukraine, to Israel to take the test, and I cannot afford
it.''
	   Several legislators said the practice of administering DNA tests
was humiliating and an invasion of privacy. ``This is a targeted
policy to limit the number of non-Jews in Israel,'' said Marina
Solodkin, a lawmaker from Israel's immigrants' party.
	   Batya Karmon, an Interior Ministry official, called that charge
``baseless,'' and said the tests are administered only in cases
where a person does not have documents to support his citizenship
claim. Under the Law of Return, Israel grants automatic citizenship
and government benefits to immigrants who can show they have at
least one Jewish grandparent.
	   Karmon said the ministry is presented with ``all kinds of fake
documents'' by would-be immigrants.
	   The DNA tests are supposed to show whether the immigrant and a
Jewish parent or grandparent listed on the birth certificates are
indeed related.
	   Community activists said dozens of immigrants were asked to take
DNA tests last year, but Karmon said only four or five were, and
that only two actually took the test.
	   The Knesset's committee for immigration and absorption
recommended Monday that the Interior Ministry pay for the DNA
tests, and that the decisions on who should take the tests be made
by a judge, not ministry officials.
	   Legislator Yuri Stern said the real issue was the Interior
Ministry's high-handed treatment of new immigrants. ``They make a
lot of trouble for families,'' he said.
	   Solodkin said she had received more than 100 complaints from
immigrants about their treatment by the ministry.
	   If the ministry is really concerned about immigrants presenting
fake credentials, she asked, ``Why don't they test people before
they come?''
	   In the last decade, nearly 800,000 immigrants came to Israel
from the former Soviet Union. With the economic boom of the 1990s,
Israel has become an attractive place to live, and government
officials have expressed concern about reports of widespread fraud
of immigration documents.

Albanian pacifist leader seeks to win control over Kosovo rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES with Rugova convening self-styled
Kosovo parliament, edits throughout. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Amid fighting southwest of Pristina
that killed two people and left others wounded or fleeing, Kosovo's
pacifist ethnic Albanian leader Monday planned to rein in
guerrillas fighting for the Serbian province's independence.
	   In an attempt to put the underground Kosovo Liberation Army
under the control of Ibrahim Rugova, the main board of his
Democratic League of Kosovo announced that the first constituent
session of the self-styled Kosovo parliament would convene within a
week.
	   The parliament was elected in unofficial elections last March,
but has never met. It is dominated by Rugova's party, which holds
108 out of 120 seats, but has been boycotted by most other Albanian
parties citing lack of democratic conditions and criticizing
Rugova's policies.
	   Chances for the KLA to submit to Rugova's rule appear slim.
	   In Brussels, the European Union called for an immediate
cessation of hostilities in Kosovo and a resumption of negotiations
with direct international involvement, endorsing the principle of
the use of force should any of the parties block the process.
	   Foreign ministers said the 15-nation EU supported the adoption
of a U.N. Security Council resolution putting the United Nations'
weight behind international efforts and ``endorsed the principle of
further action under the U.N. charter to bring about compliance by
those who block the process.''
	   Meanwhile, the Kosovo Information Center said Pecan and two
other villages 45 kilometers (28 miles) southwest of Pristina were
shelled. Beside two dead, identified by name, 13 others were
wounded, said the center, which is close to Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian leaders.
	   The shelling and sniping by the Serbs was resulting in an exodus
of ethnic Albanians from the region, it said.
	   More fighting was reported northwest of the provincial capital.
The Information Center said Serb forces and members of the Kosovo
Liberation Army were clashing near Stari Trg, 35 kilometers (20
miles) away from Pristina in a mining area rich in zinc and lead.
	   The Kosovo Information Center also said that four Albanians were
seriously wounded Sunday in fighting close to the border with
Albania, near Djakovica.
	   Rugova is apparently hoping that the KLA will agree to be
formally put under the self-styled parliament's and, therefore,
under his personal control, following the rebels' refusal to be
controlled by any of the Albanian political parties and Rugova
himself.
	   But analysts believe the KLA are unlikely to recognize the
parliament's _ or Rugova's _ authority.
	   In a weekend statement, the KLA denounced what they called
``shameful bickering'' of the political parties, indicating they
would not accept the authority of any of them.
	   Other influential ethnic Albanian parties proposed earlier this
month formation of an ethnic Albanian National Council which would
include representatives from all parties and present a unified
Albanian body to encompass the KLA. But Rugova apparently rejected
the proposal.
	   On the ground, the government-run Serb Media Center said that
Serb forces on Monday retook the last strategic sites around the
Belacevac coal mine, just 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of Pristina.
There was no resistance, with ethnic Albanian fighters melting away
at the sight of Serb police, said the center.
	   Fighting around the Belacevac region erupted early this month
after Kosovo guerrillas took the area, provoking a Serb
counter-assault for the mine, which provides much of the electrical
energy for the province.
	   New Serb forces arrived to the province amid the fighting.
Ethnic Albanian sources, who asked for anonymity, said 14 buses
carrying police were seen arriving in Pec, a city close to the
border with Albania.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed.
	   The newest outbreak left 12 people reported dead over three
days.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-1 in Kosovo, are seeking
independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Hundreds of people have been killed since February when Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on Albanian
separatists who had been attacking Serb police and military
facilities.

	   PARIS (AP) _ There was just enough time for some sleep and a
major cleanup before France's World Cup victory party kicked off
anew Monday.
	   Hundreds of thousands of flag-waving, screaming fans jammed the
Champs-Elysees yet again, this time to acclaim in person the heroes
of France's 3-0 win over Brazil.
	   ``What a day to be French! Champions of the world, at last,''
said 28-year-old Christian Bourdieu after the French squad passed
by on an open-topped, double-decker bus.
	   Tony Chambard, who risked life and limb by climbing up a tree to
get a glimpse of the players, said it was high time France won
recognition for its talented players.
	   ``Nobody said we could win the World Cup,'' he said. ``Nobody
respected us. Where are all those critics now?''
	   Others hung from lampposts and stood on top of restaurants and
newspaper kiosks as the bus carved its way through the crowds.
	   ``Zizou for president. Zizou for president,'' chanted the crowd,
using the nickname of Zinedine Zidane, the midfield star who scored
two goals in Sunday's victory over Brazil.
	   Fans waving French flags, their cheeks painted red, white and
blue, were joined by those raising the Algerian national colors _
white, green and red _ in honor of Zidane, the son of Algerian
immigrants.
	   Players and fans joined in the chant of the day, a giddy
reference to the game's score: ``It's one, it's two, it's

Russia, IMF reach agreement on bailout package

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia got what it wanted Monday from
international lenders, who agreed to a two-year financial bailout
valued at dlrs 22.6 billion, including 17.1 billion in new loans.
	   The announcement of the loan package culminated weeks of
speculation and negotiation that followed the collapse of Russian
financial markets this spring. The money is to come from three
sources: the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the
Japanese government.
	   The money could begin to flow into the Russian economy as early
as next week, after the IMF board of directors meets in Washington
on Monday to consider the deal.
	   However, the loans are apparently contingent on passage of an
austere economic stabilization plan in the Russian parliament. With
the lower house of parliament dominated by communists who strongly
oppose the government's economic program, passage is far from
guaranteed.
	   The deal was considered necessary to stave off the devaluation
of the ruble, restore the confidence of foreign investors and allow
the government to begin to pay its many debts, including billions
of rubles (dollars) owed to unpaid workers.
	   It was announced jointly by Anatoly Chubais, the government's
chief negotiator, and top officials of the IMF and World Bank.
	   ``We're convinced that this isn't a program to patch holes or
put out fires,'' Chubais told reporters. ``We are convinced that
these resources will allow us to significantly strengthen the
anti-crisis efforts of the government and will help to stabilize
and strengthen the Russian economy.''
	   Chubais, the architect of Russia's privatization program, had
been seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion in new loans.
	   The agreement he struck calls for dlrs 12.6 billion in new loans
this year, followed by dlrs 4.5 billion in new loans next year.
Added to loans that were previously negotiated, the total comes to
dlrs 14.8 billion in 1998 and dlrs 22.6 billion over two years.
	   The IMF's chief negotiator, John Odling-Smee, said the deal will
mean that ``confidence will return to the financial markets and the
pressures on the ruble will not continue.''
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Mike McCurry called the
agreement ``a major step forward.''
	   The IMF said the first installment of dlrs 5.6 billion could be
made available immediately after its board meeting next week.
	   The Russian stock market index leapt 9.2 percent Monday in
response to the news. The market had been flat recently as traders
waited to see what kind of loan package the government would snare.
	   ``This is good news, and the question is whether the excitement
about the loan will (outweigh) the other problems,'' said Dmitri
Kryukov, trader at Renaissance Capital brokerage in Moscow.
	   ``Unless we see some fundamental change in Russia, I don't
expect to see much change in the market,'' he added.
	   Economists have noted that a loan by itself wouldn't solve
perennial problems such as the budget deficit and a porous tax
collection system. However, in agreeing to the loan, Russia
promised to push through a reform program that would lower the
deficit and improve tax collection.
	   It specifically agreed to cut the budget deficit sharply over
the next two years, from 6.8 percent of the country's gross
domestic product to 2.8 percent of GDP, the IMF said.
	   Russia also announced that it would stop issuing short-term
treasury bills, which have been issued lately at astronomical
interest rates, and offer holders the opportunity to convert them
to medium- or long-term bonds denominated in dollars, not rubles.
	   Odling-Smee did not directly say that the new loans are
contingent on approval of the government's entire economic program
in the Duma, the lower house of parliament, but implied as much.
	   ``We will make a judgment about the position of the Executive
Board in the light of whatever decision the Duma makes,'' he said.
	   The Duma is scheduled to take up the issue later this week.
	   One new element in the loan package was the participation of
Japan, which had been rumored in recent days. Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko was in Tokyo on Monday, where Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto affirmed a deal for a dlrs 800 million loan from
the Export-Import Bank of Japan.
	   That is dlrs 200 million higher than the amount announced by the
IMF for 1998. The discrepancy could not be immediately explained.

Ecuador holds breath as it waits for vote results

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Saddened more by the loss of Brazil in the
World Cup soccer final than by their country's political antics,
Ecuadoreans on Monday waited for the official results of a disputed
presidential vote.
	   An exit poll gave Harvard graduate Jamil Mahuad, the centrist
mayor of Quito, a 2.6 percentage point lead over populist banana
tycoon Alvaro Noboa in Sunday's runoff vote, but both candidates
have already claimed victory.
	   Mahuad's lead is within the poll's margin of error, creating a
virtual tie. In the past the poll, sponsored by seven television
stations, has been accurate. Official results are not expected till
Wednesday.
	   The streets of Guayaquil and Quito were quiet Monday, and the
two candidates avoided reporters. They were the two top vote
getters of a first round of voting on May 31.
	   The president of Ecuador's Supreme Electoral Tribunal, Patricio
Vivanco, called for people to ignore Noboa's charges of vote fraud.
	   ``People should stay calm and wait for the official results to
be released,'' said Vivanco in a radio interview.
	   Many Ecuadoreans said they were disgusted at their country's
political circus. They have voted in six elections and referendums
in the past two years.
	   ``The panorama is not encouraging. We are caught in a deep
political, economic and moral crisis, and the vote did not give one
candidate a clear mandate,'' said political analyst and former
congressman Antonio Rodriguez.
	   ``People had expected Mahuad to win by a large margin. Even
given Mahuad's likely victory, Noboa has won this round,'' he said.
	   Mahuad had 51.3 percent support to 48.7 percent for Noboa in
Sunday's voting, according to the exit poll.
	   But Noboa dismissed these results, and amid charges of election
fraud he said his private poll gave him a three percentage point
lead.
	   With a Bible in one hand and an Ecuadorean flag in the other, he
thanked Ecuadoreans for his ``spectacular triumph'' and called on
his supporters to go to vote-counting stations to make sure he was
not robbed of his win.
	   The winner will replace interim President Fabian Alarcon, ending
17 months of transitional government that began when Congress
removed former President Abdala Bucaram from power for ``mental
incapacity'' in February 1997 amid massive street protests.
	   Multiple claims to the presidency are not new in this Andean
nation of 12 million people. For two days in the chaos that
followed Bucaram's ouster, three people simultaneously claimed to
be president. Congress named Alarcon as president, ending the
embarrassing incident.
	   Many Ecuadoreans, weary of politics, stayed home to watch Brazil
play France in Sunday's World Cup soccer final. Voting stations
even had televisions showing the game to attract voters.
	   More than 30 percent of registered voters did not cast a ballot,
a record high in Ecuador where voting is obligatory, and
non-compliance can lead to a fine.
	   ``These results confirm the discontent among the large majority
with our political structures and our democracy itself,'' said an
editorial in the national newspaper Hoy.
	   Mahuad, who has a master's degree in public administration from
Harvard University in the United States, won the support of voters
impressed with his efficient administration during his six-year
stint as Quito's mayor.
	   He campaigned offering ``serious, just'' government that could
restore Ecuador's tattered democracy and its economy, battered by
El Nino-driven floods and falling prices of its main export, oil.
	   Noboa, who ran the Central Bank during Bucaram's six-month
government, called himself the candidate of the poor despite his
wealth. He offered to create one million jobs and dish out the
``beating of the century'' to Ecuador's political elite.

	   PARIS (AP) _ There was just enough time for some sleep and a
major cleanup before France's World Cup victory party kicked off
anew Monday.
	   Hundreds of thousands of flag-waving, screaming fans jammed the
Champs-Elysees yet again, this time to acclaim in person the heroes
of France's 3-0 win over Brazil.
	   ``What a day to be French! Champions of the world, at last,''
said 28-year-old Christian Bourdieu after the French squad passed
by on an open-topped, double-decker bus.
	   Tony Chambard, who risked life and limb by climbing up a tree to
get a glimpse of the players, said it was high time France won
recognition for its talented players.
	   ``Nobody said we could win the World Cup,'' he said. ``Nobody
respected us. Where are all those critics now?''
	   Others hung from lampposts and stood on top of restaurants and
newspaper kiosks as the bus carved its way through the crowds.
	   ``Zizou for president. Zizou for president,'' chanted the crowd,
using the nickname of Zinedine Zidane, the midfield star who scored
two goals in Sunday's victory over Brazil.
	   Fans waving French flags, their cheeks painted red, white and
blue, were joined by those raising the Algerian national colors _
white, green and red _ in honor of Zidane, the son of Algerian
immigrants.
	   Players and fans joined in the chant of the day, a giddy
reference to the game's score: ``It's one, it's two, it's
three-zero.''
	   Office workers threw red-white-and-blue confetti from office
windows, and others waved from balconies adorned with French flags.
	   ``I've been up all night,'' said Elisabeth Wallon, 22. ``It was
magnificent. I've never seen a celebration like it.''
	   The avenue was so packed that the bus couldn't complete its
route up to the Arc de Triomphe, and had to escape off a side
street.
	   The players took turns holding the golden trophy over their
heads. They kissed and hugged each other, waving to the crowd.
Coach Aime Jacquet grinned and raised his arms in triumph.
	   The victory was particularly sweet for Jacquet, the target of
widespread criticism before the tournament by those who said he'd
put together an unspectacular, unambitious team.
	   ``You have to admire him,'' said Pauline Correa, who said she
has become a soccer fan in the five weeks since the tournament
began. ``Jacquet proved everybody wrong.''
	   After a drenching downpour Monday morning, the sun peaked out
from the clouds, giving the joyous celebrations a warm glow.
	   There was no sign of the chaos just hours earlier, when
post-match celebrations turned sour as a panicked driver drove her
car into a crowd of revelers, injuring 80 people, 11 of them
seriously. None were critically hurt, however.
	   The woman, a 44-year-old teacher, turned herself in to police
Monday. Police said she'd been undergoing psychiatric treatment for
four years, and had panicked in the face of the aggressive crowd.
	   French TV provided live coverage of Monday's parade, which along
with the post-victory party on the Champs-Elysees was the biggest

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Opponents of a church burial for
Russia's last czar are threatening priests who are to conduct the
memorial service, a Russian Orthodox official said Monday.
	   ``There have been threats, and we are still receiving them,''
said Andrei Chizov, a spokesman for the local diocese.
	   Chizov said the priests were unconcerned. ``They do not have any
kind of view about the threats because they are governed by the
higher ranks of the church, who are doing what they have been told
to do by the Synod,'' Chizov said, without giving specifics or the
numbers of the threats.
	   Despite repeated DNA tests that have shown the remains of Czar
Nicholas II to be authentic, there are still many who remain
doubtful and are deeply opposed to a religious ceremony and burial.
	   Chizov said seven Russian Orthodox priests and five church
deacons, led by Archpriest Boris Glebov, will conduct Friday's
memorial service and burial at the Peter and Paul Cathedral.
	   The ceremonies were first planned with pomp and full regalia,
but there has been growing controversy over the czar's remains in
recent months and the ceremony has been reduced to a modest affair
largely ignored by church and state.
	   Patriarch Alexy II said he would not attend because he had
doubts about the bones' authenticity. President Boris Yeltsin,
respecting the patriarch's position, has also said he will not
attend. Neither will Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko.
	   It was announced previously that the government would be
represented by Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov.
	   Representatives of 26 countries, mostly ambassadors, will attend
the memorial service, but the United States does not plan to send a
delegation.
	   The speaker of the State Duma, parliament's lower house, said
Monday that the legislature probably will not send an official
delegation to the burial.
	   Nicholas II abdicated in 1917, a year before he was executed
with his family, and therefore he should be buried where he was
killed in the central city of Yekaterinburg, Gennady Seleznyov, a
Communist, told the Interfax news agency.
	   The czar ``was no longer an emperor but a private citizen and it
is unclear why a private person should be buried with these
honors,'' Seleznyov said.
	   The Duma will make its decision Tuesday, but Communists account
for the largest bloc, and most are believed to share Seleznyov's
sentiments.
	   Nicholas, his family and several servants were executed by the
Bolsheviks in 1918. Their bones were found buried in a pit near
Yekaterinburg in 1991, and will be interred in the same cathedral
where many of Russia's czars are buried.
	   The burial and a memorial service will take on the 80th
anniversary of their deaths.

Annan says identification process increased
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The pace of counting voters for a
referendum on the political status of the disputed Western Sahara
has increased, and could be completed by next month, although a
dispute regarding three tribes has yet to be solved.
	   U.N. personnel preparing for the referendum reported a
substantial increase in the number of identified voters during June
and July, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a report to the
Security Council published Monday.
	   The Western Sahara is a disputed area of North Africa claimed by
Morocco and the Polisario, a rebel group seeking independence for
the indigenous people. Voters will choose between Western Sahara
independence and integration with Morocco.
	   The U.N. force has been trying to identify the voters because of
disagreements about who is eligible to take part. The two sides
have failed to resolve differences over identification of voters
among three Saharan tribes, Annan said.
	   As of July 6, 135,667 people had been identified, Annan said.
Except for the three disputed tribes, the process could be
completed by August, he said.
	   He recommended the U.N. mandate be extended until Sept. 21.
	   An agreement announced by former U.S. Secretary of State James
A. Baker III in September paved the way for the referendum.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Another guilty verdict, another claim of vendetta.
	   A Milan court on Monday convicted opposition leader Silvio
Berlusconi of illegal party financing, the third guilty verdict
absorbed by the media magnate since December. He was sentenced to
two years, four months in prison.
	   Berlusconi was convicted of funneling money in 1991 to Socialist
ex-Premier Bettino Craxi, who was found guilty of the same charge.
	   Immediately after the decision, Berlusconi repeated his protest
that the Milan prosecutors were waging a campaign against him.
	   The conviction was part of a ``precise political plan to
eliminate the head of the opposition,'' Berlusconi told Rete 4, one
of the three television stations he controls. He blamed the
``communist left.''
	   ``After the second conviction, the third has arrived, and others
will arrive,'' he said.
	   Center-left politicians said the case was purely a judicial
matter, and had nothing to do with politics.
	   ``Enough already!'' said Fabio Mussi, party whip of the
Democratic Left party in the Chamber of Deputies. The party is the
leading force in Parliament and the government.
	   Inciting public opinion against the courts was ``harmful to
democracy,'' he said.
	   The effect on Berlusconi's leadership of the center-right
Freedom Alliance was unclear. After another conviction last week,
Berlusconi promised to go on as opposition standard-bearer.
	   His allies quickly rallied around him Monday, and several
hundred supporters demonstrated in front of Parliament.

Conference seeks ways to control flood of light weapons

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The small arms used in wars often keep
killing long after the war has ended, falling into the hands of
terrorists, criminals and even renegade soldiers _ a cycle that 21
countries are trying to break at a meeting in Oslo.
	   At a two-day closed-door conference that began Monday, experts
and diplomats hoped to start a global drive to control the spread
of illegal light weapons such as machine guns, pistols and
grenade-launchers.
	   The task is daunting: some experts say half the world's small
arms have been traded illegally.
	   ``The uncontrolled use of these weapons causes untold human
suffering in many parts of the world,'' said Norway's deputy
foreign minister, Aslaug Haga, told delegates. She urged them to
draft a strategy for controlling the proliferation of light
weapons.
	   The United Nations estimates that 90 percent of those killed or
wounded by light military weapons are civilians, 80 percent of them
children, whether in war or peacetime. Others estimate that 90
percent of those killed in modern warfare are victims of small
arms.
	   Norway was buoyed by success in drafting the ban on another
weapon that keeps killing in peace time _ the anti-personnel mine _
last year and has now taken on small arms that kill even more
people.
	   ``We should have no illusions that our efforts will be easy,''
said Haga. ``New, lofty declarations will not help. We must be
practical in our efforts.''
	   Although delegates could not take binding action, they were
expected to adopt a joint statement Tuesday calling for tighter gun
laws, better record-keeping on weapons sales, and the destruction
of surplus weapons.
	   In April, Norway hosted a conference on the problem of small
arms in volatile West Africa. The 13 West African nations and 20
arms producing countries drafted a proposed moratorium on the
small-arms trade in West Africa.
	   The United Nations said at the April meeting that 2 million
light weapons are known to still circulate in Central America, 7
million in West Africa, and 10 million in Afghanistan.
	   Often the weapons are unaccounted for, ending up on the black
market after a war or sold to help pay off a country's war debt.
	   The countries at the talks were the United States, Canada,
Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, Brazil, Mexico, Columbia, Indonesia, Japan, the
Philippines, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mozambique, South Africa and
Zimbabwe.

Experts warn of potential radioactive danger in Urals lake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A deposit of radioactive salts in a Ural Mountains
lake is an ecological time bomb that threatens to contaminate wide
areas of western Siberia and the Arctic Ocean, a nuclear expert
said Monday.
	   Yuri Vishnevsky, head of the Russia's Nuclear Supervision
Service, said nuclear waste dumped by the Mayak nuclear power plant
into ponds in the region resulted in the formation of a radioactive
deposit in Lake Karachai.
	   Mayak, created in the late 1940s to make plutonium for the first
Soviet atomic bombs, dumped tons of raw radioactive waste into
local rivers in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
	   The huge plant, also known as Chelyabinsk-65, was the Soviet
Union's largest defense complex. It stopped plutonium production in
1992, but it continues to reprocess spent fuel and is engaged in
the dismantling of nuclear weapons.
	   Vishnevsky told a news conference the Mayak plant had dumped
radioactive waste into local bodies of waters for years, which
resulted in the formation of a ``lens of radioactive salts'' in the
lake, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The formation is moving toward four Siberian rivers at a speed
of 80 meters (yards) a year, Vishnevsky said.
	   If the deposit is sucked into the water systems of the Rivers
Techa, Tobol, Irtysh and Ob, all of western Siberia and the Arctic
Ocean could become polluted within 10 years, he said.
	   Vishnevsky also said he was worried by the nuclear threat from
decommissioned nuclear submarines in the North Fleet and the Far
East, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, adding that his agency
urgently needed funds to handle the problems.

Luzhkov again determined to keep nature from raining on his parade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new grafs 2-3 with rain stopping as opening
ceremony begins. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With the opening ceremonies of the World Youth
Games threatened by a wet forecast, Mayor Yuri Luzhkov will once
again tinker with the weather to ensure that no one _ not even
nature _ rains on his parade.
	   The Russian Weather Service sent up six cloud-seeding planes to
prevent looming rain clouds from pouring on the games' opening
ceremonies at the giant Luzhniki stadium, said Weather Service
spokesman Anatoly Yakovlev.
	   The gambit apparently worked. As the ceremony got underway at 8
p.m. (1600 gmt), patches of blue poked through the clouds and a
day-long steady rainfall ended.
	   The planes used two methods on the clouds _ one to make them
rain before getting to Moscow, and another to keep them from
dumping their water until after they pass over the city.
	   It is not the first time Luzhkov has tried to control the skies.
Last summer during Moscow's 850th birthday celebration, the mayor
ordered similar action, but the technique was only partly
successful; a light drizzle dampened closing ceremonies at the
event.
	   Luzhkov launched the Youth Games with a media blitz and plenty
of fanfare, and wants them to go off without a hitch. With
President Boris Yeltsin, International Olympic Committee head Juan
Antonio Samaranch, and thousands of athletes from around the world
planning to attend the opening ceremonies, Monday's festivities are
particularly important.
	   The games are part of a Luzhkov plan to show that Moscow can
handle big sporting events. He has said that if the games go
successfully he will make a bid for Moscow to host the 2012
Olympics.

EU foreign ministers issue statement on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with fresh details, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos BRU101-105
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union called Monday for an
immediate cessation of hostilities in Kosovo and a resumption of
talks with international involvement.
	   EU foreign ministers said force should used be if any of the
warring parties block the peace process.
	   Foreign ministers said the 15-nation EU supported the adoption
of a U.N. Security Council resolution putting the United Nations'
weight behind international efforts and ``endorsed the principle of
further action under the U.N. charter to bring about compliance by
those who block the process.''
	   ``It is the understanding of the (EU) Council that such action
would be under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter,'' which can
authorize the use of military force, the ministers said in a
statement on Kosovo.
	   The ministers, gathered for the first time under the new
Austrian presidency of the EU, were faced with what Austrian
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel called the Union's ``most
pressing external policy topic.''
	   ``The situation on the ground is getting worse. It's
explosive,'' said French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
	   Yugoslav security forces have been attempting to quell a
rebellion by ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo,
where they make up 90 percent of the population. Some of the
Albanians want greater autonomy for the region while others,
including the Kosovo Liberation Army, want independence.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who was in Moscow over the
weekend for talks with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
has hinted the solution may lie in a conference such as the one at
Dayton, Ohio, that ended the fighting in Bosnia in 1995.
	   ``Last night I had a telephone conversation with (U.S. Secretary
of State) Madeleine Albright and I have brought some new ideas,''
Kinkel said. He was not specific.
	   ``The important thing to us is ... to move toward a negotiated
settlement geared to autonomy,'' said Schuessel. ``The difficulty
in talking about autonomy is everybody understands the term
differently.''
	   He added: ``The more concrete, the more practical the proposals
you have on the table, the less fear there is.''
	   An EU statement reiterated that the primary responsibility for
the crisis lies with the Yugoslav government of President Slobodan
Milosevic. At the same time, it demanded that ``outside assistance
and support to armed Kosovo Albanian groups should cease
immediately.''
	   The EU approved the decision by the six-nation Contact Group on
Kosovo - the United States, Russia, Germany, France, Italy and
Britain - to recommend ``elements for the future status of Kosovo''
for the parties to use in their talks.
	   ``What is new is that the European Union is concerning itself
more with the status of Kosovo and will be looking at possible
models for autonomy,'' the Austrian foreign minister said.
	   He added that in Kinkel's talks with Primakov, ``Mr. Kinkel did
detect some movement on the part of the Russians, some indication
the Russians might accept some autonomy within Yugoslavia.''
	   The 16-nation NATO defense alliance is working on plans for an
eventual military intervention if diplomatic efforts fail to end
the fighting.

Police seize 126 kilos of pure cocaine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Police have seized 126 kilos (277
pounds) of pure cocaine with an estimated value of dlrs 14 million,
Belgrade media reported Monday.
	   Four people, who organized the cocaine shipment from Peru into
Yugoslavia and planned to smuggle it to Netherlands, have been
arrested, Beta news agency quoted police as saying. One of those
arrested has dual Slovene-Dutch citizenship and the rest are
Yugoslav citizens.
	   The drugs were shipped to Yugoslavia from Peru by plane and
packed into rolls of industrial yarn. Most of it was found in a car
in the town of Koceljevo, some 60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest
of the capital Belgrade.
	   The owner of a Yugoslav company, which organized the shipment,
and several other suspects are on the run, police said.

Amnesty International: Rwanda must reinstate U.N. rights mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Amnesty International urged Rwanda on
Monday to reinstate the U.N. human rights mission it suspended in
May because of a disagreement over the agency's operations in the
country.
	   A delegation representing the U.N. Human Rights Field Operations
in Rwanda arrived in Kigali Sunday for five days of talks with the
government.
	   ``The UN Human Rights Field Operation is one of the very few
international organizations left monitoring and publicly reporting
the human rights situation in Rwanda,'' said London-based Amnesty
International.
	   ``It would be disastrous if the U.N. High Commissioner for Human
Rights now agrees to remove or dilute this essential part of the
operation's mandate.''
	   The Rwandan government said in May it suspended the mission
because of lack of coordination.
	   The government said the mandate of the mission, which was set up
following the 1994 genocide, was due for review. Rwanda wants the
mission to halt monitoring human rights abuses and devote its
efforts to educating people about human rights.
	   The Amnesty statement said the Rwandan government has set a
deadline of July 27 for reaching agreement on the mission's
mandate, otherwise it will close down the operation.
	   ``The human rights situation in Rwanda is critical,'' the
Amnesty statement said. ``We receive almost daily reports about
killings and `disappearances,' and the UNHRFOR is indispensable for
investigating and documenting these cases on the ground.''
	   Rwanda's present government took control in July 1994 after
Tutsi-led rebels ousted the extremist Hutu government that had
sponsored the genocide.
	   The slaughter left more than half a million Tutsis and moderate
Hutus dead.
	   Many of the former Hutu government soldiers and militias fled
among bona-fide Hutu refugees, fearing reprisals, and returned only
in Nov. 1996.
	   Amnesty and the U.N. human rights agency have reported that
thousands of people have since been killed in attacks by Hutu
rebels and counterattacks by the predominantly Tutsi military.

Svorada and Zabel ecstatic, Boardman in agony as Tour departs
</HEADLINE>
Ireland
 &UR; Eds: AMs; recasts, new quotes, details &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CORK, Ireland (AP) _ Jan Svorada and Erik Zabel stood atop the
victor's podium, while Chris Boardman lay in a hospital bed.
	   The Tour de France concluded its first-ever swing through
Ireland with a cruel changing of the guard Monday.
	   Svorada, of the Czech Republic, earned his first Tour stage
victory in four years with a split-second win in a mass sprint
finish to the 127.4-mile (205.5 km) race along Ireland's south
coast.
	   Germany's star sprinter Zabel _ who previously has come close to
the overall leader's yellow jersey _ finally donned it thanks to
his 17th place finish Monday and point-earning placings in the
weekend's prologue and first stage in Dublin.
	   ``It feels excellent, just fantastic to finally wear the yellow
jersey,'' said Zabel, 28, of Deutsche Telekom, who first rode the
Tour in 1994. ``But I still must fulfill my goal of winning a
stage.''
	   Britain's Boardman, who held the yellow jersey the first two
days, was rushed to Cork University Hospital after crashing 35
miles (55 kms) from the finish line.
	   The accident _ caused when Boardman's front tire clipped the
back tire of his French Gan teammate, Frederic Moncassin _ left the
29-year-old with a fractured left wrist and a gash on his forehead.
	   Boardman lay still beside a cobblestone wall until paramedics
lifted him by stretcher into an ambulance. He was spending the
night in the hospital.
	   ``I am sorry that Chris crashed, but I am not sorry to take the
jersey from him,'' Zabel said. ``I would have won it today even if
he had not crashed.''
	   A second, much bigger pileup a half-hour before the finish line
sent a dozen cyclists tumbling and dozens more veering along the
grassy shoulders of the roadway.
	   That mishap injured another Gan rider, Francois Simon of France,
who received four stitches in his heel after finishing the race in
184th place. Also, the Dutch rider Erik Dekker withdrew from stage
two after deciding his badly bruised leg from a fall Sunday made
competing in the 22-day Tour impossible.
	   As Boardman remained behind in Ireland, the remaining 186
competitors flew immediately to France's northwestern province of
Brittany, where the Tour continues Tuesday.
	   Three specially commissioned ferries shipped the bulk of the
Tour's roadshow _ more than 1,000 vehicles and 3,500 staff and
media members _ overnight to the Breton port of Roscoff, where
stage three will take riders 104.8 miles (169 kms) to the south
coast town of Lorient.
	   The 85th Tour de France finishes Aug. 2 in Paris.
	   The big winner in the Tour's three days in Ireland was
Mapei-Bricobi, the No. 2-ranked Italian team that has both Svorada
and Belgium's Tom Steels in its stable.
	   Steels won Sunday's first stage by a hair with a pack of
sprinters behind him, a feat mirrored in Svorada's win. Steels also
placed fifth Monday, which allowed him to claim the green jersey in
recognition of the Tour's most consistent performer.
	   ``This is another great win for our team,'' Svorada said.
``Tomorrow I hope to help Tom win the yellow jersey.''
	   Steels _ who was disqualified from the 1997 Tour for throwing a
water bottle at Moncassin _ is just 7 seconds behind Zabel at No. 2
in the yellow-jersey stakes.
	   Moncassin is ranked third overall, Spain's Abraham Olano fourth,
France's Laurent Jalabert fifth, and the United States' Bobby
Julich sixth.
	   Jan Ullrich, last year's Tour champion, finished 45th Monday and
stands in eighth place overall.
	   The big loser, at least in image, was the No. 1-ranked French
Festina team, which last week had a member of staff arrested on the
French-Belgian border in possession of more than 400 vials of
steroids and EPO, a drug that boosts the blood's ability to absorb
oxygen.
	   Festina director Bruno Roussel launched a spirited defense of
his club's integrity. He said his team hadn't known why one of its
masseurs, Willy Voet, had missed the boat to Ireland until the
media informed him of Voet's arrest.
	   While Festina had three cyclists in the top 10 of Saturday's
prologue, it since has put in low-key numbers. Its top performer
Monday was 47th-place Christophe Moreau, who is competing while
contesting a positive test for steroids.

	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Microsoft Corp. is getting into the
real estate business.
	   The world's biggest maker of personal computer software on
Monday launched an Internet-based real estate service to help
prospective home buyers find houses, mortgages, real-estate agents
and other essentials.
	   The World Wide Web site, currently in preview version, is free.
It enables users to search for homes by criteria such as price or
number of bedrooms.
	   HomeAdvisor is not be the first real-estate Web page on the
Internet. Many real estate firms and sales people list homes on the
World Wide Web, as do some newspapers and individual homeowners.
Many sites let viewers take ``virtual'' tours of homes, calculate
monthly payments and get mortgage information along with simply
finding a listing.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The small arms used in wars often keep
killing long after the war has ended, falling into the hands of
terrorists, criminals and even renegade soldiers _ a cycle that 21
countries are trying to break at a meeting in Oslo.
	   At a two-day closed-door conference that began Monday, experts
and diplomats hoped to start a global drive to control the spread
of illegal light weapons such as machine guns, pistols and
grenade-launchers.
	   The task is daunting: some experts say half the world's small
arms have been traded illegally.
	   ``The uncontrolled use of these weapons causes untold human
suffering in many parts of the world,'' said Norway's deputy
foreign minister, Aslaug Haga, told delegates. She urged them to
draft a strategy for controlling the proliferation of light
weapons.
	   The United Nations estimates that 90 percent of those killed or
wounded by light military weapons are civilians, 80 percent of them
children, whether in war or peacetime. Others estimate that 90
percent of those killed in modern warfare are victims of small
arms.
	   Norway was buoyed by its success last year in drafting the ban
on another weapon that keeps killing in peace time _ the
anti-personnel mine. It now wants to control small arms, which kill
even more people.
	   ``We should have no illusions that our efforts will be easy,''
said Haga. ``New, lofty declarations will not help. We must be
practical in our efforts.''
	   Although delegates could not take binding action, they were
expected to adopt a joint statement Tuesday calling for tighter gun
laws, better record-keeping on weapons sales, and the destruction
of surplus weapons.
	   In April, Norway hosted a conference on the problem of small
arms in volatile West Africa. The 13 West African nations and 20
arms-producing countries drafted a proposed moratorium on the
small-arms trade in West Africa.
	   The United Nations said at the April meeting that 2 million
light weapons are known to circulate in Central America, 7 million
in West Africa, and 10 million in Afghanistan.
	   Often the weapons are unaccounted for, ending up on the black
market after a war or sold to help pay off a country's war debt.
	   The countries at the talks were the United States, Canada,
Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, Brazil, Mexico, Columbia, Indonesia, Japan, the
Philippines, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mozambique, South Africa and
Zimbabwe.

	   CORK, Ireland (AP) _ A quick look at Monday's second stage of
the 85th Tour de France.
	   STAGE: 127.4 miles (205.5 kms) east to west along Ireland's
southern coast, going from Enniscorthy via the Tipperary town of
Carrick-on-Suir to a sprint finish in Ireland's second-largest
city, Cork.
	   WINNER: Czech Republic national champ Jan Svorada, who last won
a Tour stage in 1994.
	   YELLOW JERSEY: Germany's Erik Zabel of Telekom, who despite a
strong six-year pro career had never managed the achievement
before.
	   HOW THE OTHERS FARED: Speed specialist Chris Boardman, who wore
the yellow jersey for the first two days, crashed 35 miles (55 kms)
from the finish, ending up in hospital with a broken wrists and
gashed forehead.
	   Last year's Tour champ, Germany's Jan Ullrich, finished 45th and
sits in eighth place overall for Telekom. Belgium's Tom Sheels,
winner of Sunday's stage one in Dublin, finished fifth Monday to
take the green jersey and go No. 2 behind Zabel overall.
	   TOUR TIDBIT: The race passed through Carrick-on-Suir in a
tribute to its hometown hero Sean Kelly, who won the Tour's green
jersey a record-setting four times in the 1980s.
	   QUOTE OF THE DAY: ``I am sorry that Chris crashed, but I am not
sorry to take the jersey from him. I would have won it today even
if he had not crashed.'' Zabel on his replacement of Boardman as
leader.
	   THE NEXT STAGE: Tuesday's stage three of 104.8 miles (169 kms)
returns the Tour to French soil. It runs from the north to the
south coasts of windy Brittany, starting at the port of Roscoff and
concluding in Lorient.
	   The remaining riders flew from Cork to Brittany immediately
after Monday's race, while their equipment, vehicles and more than
3,000 followers sailed by three special overnight ferries.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) - A total of seven people were killed
overnight in three separate incidents across Albania, an interior

	   In the first incident, four young men were found shot dead near
Tirana's main boulevard, following a gang attack, said Aryan
Bigger, a spokesman for the interior ministry. Police reported no
further details.

of Tirana, unidentified masked men killed two passengers in a car
who refused to hand over their money on demand.
	   Police were investigating both incidents and no further details
were available.
	   In the year since Albania collapsed into chaos, violence
continues to wrack the country as thousands of weapons remain in
the hands of citizens.

Latin America comes to grips with Brazil's World Cup loss and
</HEADLINE>
praises France

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Shaking off the bitter aftertaste of
their country's 3-0 loss to France in the World Cup finals, many
Brazilians readily admitted Monday that France deserved to win.
	   ``Brazil played poorly. We deserved to lose and France deserved
to win. It's as simple as that,'' said Maria Imaculada Moretti, an
independent video producer. ``We can accept losing, but its hard to
accept such a humiliating defeat.''
	   Her feelings were echoed by other fans and sports commentators
throughout South America.
	   Brazil ``succumbed to France's absolute superiority,'' said
sports commentator Fernando Calazans of O Globo newspaper.
	   France's victory was ``just and impeccable,'' according to Juca
Kfouri of the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. Brazil played an
``apathetic game, apparently oblivious it was disputing the final
of a World Cup.''
	   ``The game was a tribute to the player who knew how to handle
the ball with intelligence and elegance, and that player is
Zinedine Zidane,'' said commentator Alberto Helena, also of the
Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper.
	   Zidaine scored the first two goals in France's rout of Brazil.
	   ``Brazil left all its talent, ability and creativity in the
locker room'' wrote Jose Trajano of the sports daily Afinal.
	   In Argentina, Brazil's loss was banner headline news.
	   ``Brazil Weeps'' and ``Rio is an ocean of tears,'' said the
Buenos Aires daily Cronica.
	   ``France played the game of its lifetime and captured the Cup,''
read the sports headline in the Buenos Aires daily La Nacion, under
an even bolder headline reading: ``History is Made.''
	   ``Planning and tactical discipline won over individuality and
improvisation,'' said former Peruvian soccer great Teofilo Cubillas
in a column published in the Lima newspaper El Sol.
	   ``At no moment during the game did Brazil deserve even a tie,''
Cubillas said. ``Their play was very disappointing. In all my
soccer life I have never seen a Brazil team like this one: without
personality, sense of purpose or motivation.''
	   The coach of Chile's national squad, Nelson Acosta said ``Brazil
was a big deception.''
	   ``France played better and took advantage of its opponent's
weakness,'' Acosta told Chile's Las Ultimas Noticias newspaper.
	   Some Brazilian fans blamed outsiders for Brazil's loss.
	   ``It was all too easy,'' said Rogerio Jelmayer, an 18-year-old
high school student. ``If you ask me, the Brazilian team was
pressured into losing,'' he added.
	   ``Something abnormal happened,'' said Edson Mauro of CBN Radio.
``And the truth will eventually come out.''
	   He mentioned speculation that Brazil's star forward Ronaldo was
forced to play by Nike, his sponsor, despite the fact that he was
``obviously unfit to play.''
	   Nike denied pressuring Ronaldo or his coach to have the
Brazilian star play in the World Cup final.
	   ``Nike wants to emphasize that the report of such involvement is
absolutely false,'' the sports shoe company said Monday in response
to ``rumors circulating.''
	   Confusion still surrounds Ronaldo's ability to play in the
final.
	   FIFA said Ronaldo had gone to the hospital for X-rays on his
left ankle, and doctors cleared him to play just before the game.
Team doctor Lidio Toledo said Ronaldo felt dizzy after lunch, while
press officer Nelson Borges said the player had vomited.
	   ``Ronaldo could barely walk, much less play,'' wrote sports
commentator Renato Mauricio Prado in Monday's O Globo newspaper.
``Brazil lost because of a gross medical error and I hope someone
will have the courage to come forward and tell the entire truth.''

NationsBank earnings jump 53 percent, First Chicago up 8 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ NationsBank Corp. reported a 53 percent increase
in second-quarter earnings Monday, citing loan growth and improved
investment banking and brokerage revenue.
	   Meanwhile, First Chicago NBD Corp. reported its second-quarter
profits rose 8 percent as income from bank fees offset declines in
loan income.
	   Both big banking companies, which are each involved in separate
merger pacts, beat Wall Street expectations for earnings in the
April-June period.
 &UR; NationsBank Corp.
	   The huge Charlotte, North Carolina-based banking concern, which
is merging with BankAmerica Corp. earned dlrs 1.41 billion, or dlrs
1.43 per diluted share, for the three months ending June 30,
compared with dlrs 919 million, or 97 cents a share, a year ago.
	   The latest earnings included a pre-tax gain of dlrs 430 million
related to the sale of 67 banking offices arising from its merger
with Florida-based Barnett Banks.
	   Operating earnings for the quarter totaled dlrs 1.13 billion, or
dlrs 1.18 per share. That beat the dlrs 1.14 a share average
anticipated by analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. But in
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, NationsBank
shares were off 44 cents at dlrs 86.75.
	   ``NationsBank's core operating performance trends continue to be
quite positive,'' said Chief Executive Hugh McColl Jr. ``We are
particularly pleased with the growth in our fee-based businesses.''
	   For the first half, net income rose to dlrs 1.90 billion, or
dlrs 1.99 per share, up from dlrs 1.77 billion, or dlrs 1.87 per
share a year earlier.
	   NationsBank and San Francisco-based BankAmerica announced in
April a dlrs 62 billion merger pact that will create a
coast-to-coast U.S. banking company with dlrs 570 billion in
assets. The merger is set to be completed later this year.
	   McColl is to head the new company that will use the BankAmerica
name.
 &UR; First Chicago NBD Corp.
	   Chicago-based First Chicago earned dlrs 408 million, or dlrs
1.38 a diluted share, in the quarter compared with dlrs 378
million, or dlrs 1.20 a share, a year earlier.
	   The earnings beat Wall Street expectations of dlrs 1.34 a share,
according to a survey of analysts by First Call Corp. First
Chicago's stock was down 31 cents at dlrs 94.62 1/2 a share in
afternoon trading on the NYSE.
	   The bank holding company with operations mainly in Illinois,
Indiana and Michigan agreed in April to be purchased by Banc One
Corp. for dlrs 27 billion pending approval by regulators and
shareholders.
	   Net interest income fell 5.6 percent to dlrs 898 million while
noninterest income rose 31 percent to dlrs 842 million as credit
card fee revenue rose 13 percent. Income received from service
charges and commissions rose 25 percent to dlrs 283 million.
	   The bank reported its provision for credit losses rose, mainly
on charge-offs related to losses in Asia, rose to dlrs 2.06 million
from dlrs 180 million a year earlier.
	   For the first half of the year, First Chicago reported net
income of dlrs 791 million, or dlrs 2.68 a diluted share, compared
to dlrs 758 million, or dlrs 2.37 a diluted share, a year earlier.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Two bombs exploded Monday in court
buildings in Athens' main judicial compound, causing damage but no
injuries, police said.
	   The blasts were the latest in a string of bombings around
Athens. There was no immediate claim of responsibility in the
courthouse explosions, but the others were linked to small leftist
groups.
	   The first device _ a time bomb _ exploded in a second-story rest
room in a building housing civil and criminal courtrooms.
	   Authorities evacuated the two-story building following a warning
call to local media about 35 minutes before the explosion, which
occurred in the early evening.
	   The second time bomb exploded less than a hour later in a
neighboring courthouse. There was no warning of the second bombing,
police said.
	   Since last year, offices and cars belonging to politicians,
diplomats and journalists have been hit by bombings and arson
attacks. Small leftists groups claimed responsibility for most of
the attacks. The deadly terrorist group November 17 said it carried
out a rocket attack against a Citibank branch in April.

Ten nations join EU in sanctions on Belarus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with EU condemnation, quotes

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union condemned what it
said was Belarus' violation of the international convention on
diplomatic relations and imposed travel restrictions on Belarus
officials Monday in a dispute over ambassadorial residences in
Minsk.
	   Ten non-European Union nations joined the EU in the action.
	   The EU decided to retaliate against orders from the Belarusian
government that several nations vacate their ambassadors'
residences in a diplomatic compound, saying the measures
``constitute an infringement of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic
relations.''
	   The EU action prohibits admission of Belarus officials into any
of the 15 EU member states, from President Alexander Lukashenko,
his cabinet ministers and their deputies to a range of lesser
officials including the chairmen of the State Patent Committee and
the State Committee for Hydrometeorology.
	   ``We continue to be at loggerheads with President Lukashenko and
his administration,'' said British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
	   Joining the EU were Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic,
Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Iceland and Norway,
who said in a joint statement they ``will ensure that their
national policies conform to that common position.''
	   Diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Greece, Italy, and Japan left Belarus to consult with their
governments over the dispute. The Bulgarian and Polish ambassadors
also were recalled home.
	   ``As a signal of the seriousness with which it takes the
situation, (the EU) has adopted a common position imposing
non-admission in the member states of the European Union of all
members of the government as well as senior officials of the
Republic of Belarus,'' the EU said.
	   Poland, while declaring its solidarity with the EU and
condemning Belarus, declined to join in the action. Citing its
position as chairman of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, Poland said it ``feels it is responsible
before the international community for maintaining a dialogue with
the people of Belarus and for ensuring the conditions for further
operation of the OSCE mission in Minsk.''
	   Belarus has said it needs to repair the plumbing and sewage
system in the compound where the ambassadorial residences are
located. The ambassadors say that under the Vienna Convention,
Belarus has no right to force them out for any reason.

	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ The National Hockey League's Pittsburgh
Penguins have signed center Alexei Kolkunov, who has played for a
Russian team for the last four years.
	   Terms were not released Monday.
	   The 6-foot-2, (187.96 centimeters), 190-pound (86.18-kilo)
Kolkunov has 24 goals and 23 points and 93 minutes in 114 games for
Krylja Sovetov, the Soviet Wings. He was chosen by the Penguins in

tournament, had his best season for the Wings in 1996-97, scoring
nine points and getting 16 assists in 44 games.
	   Kolkunov is a friend of Penguins right winger Alexei Morozov,
who with his brother Valentin also played for Krylja Sovetov.

Tamil parties seek inquiry into claim of mass graves
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Tamil political parties are urging the
government to investigate soldiers' claims that they buried
hundreds of Tamil prisoners killed by security forces in northern
Sri Lanka.
	   ``This is a very serious issue and we want the government to
investigate,'' said Murukesu Sivasithamparam, president of the
Tamil United Liberation Front.
	   Earlier this month, four Sri Lankan soldiers and a police
officer were sentenced to death for the rape and murder of a Tamil
woman, two relatives and a neighbor. In court, the defendants
claimed they could lead officials to the graves of hundreds of
Tamil civilians who were killed by security forces.
	   The case has been closely followed in Sri Lanka as a test of the
government's commitment to punish attacks against Tamils.
	   ``We didn't kill anyone. We only buried bodies. We can show you
where 300 to 400 bodies have been buried,'' Cpl. Dewage Somaratne
told the court July 3. His co-defendants echoed his claim.
	   ``We really want the government to go deep down into the issue
and tell us the truth,'' said S. Sivathasan, a Tamil lawmaker from
the Eelam People's Democratic Party.
	   No comment was immediately available from the government.
	   The government admits as many as 500 Tamil civilians have
disappeared in the northern Jaffna Peninsula, the Tamil heartland,
since the military drove out rebels and took control in May 1996.
	   Tamil rebels have been fighting for an independent homeland for
15 years. Tamils make up 18 percent of this island nation's 18.5
million people. More than 54,000 people have died in the conflict.

their big holiday Monday, chastened and divided by the deaths of
three boys in the violence swirling around their defiance of a
government order to avoid one Catholic neighborhood.
	   Two men were arrested Monday morning for questioning about the
firebombing that killed the Quinn brothers: Richard, 11, Mark, 10,
and Jason, 9, in their home in a Protestant area of Ballymoney, 40
miles (60 kms) northwest of Belfast. Their Catholic mother, Chrissy
Quinn, and her Protestant partner escaped safely.

A day of compromise and self-doubt for Orange Order marchers

 &UR; EDS: AMs; updates with speeches, car bomb defused, scuffle at
Orange gathering. &QL;

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant Orangemen shied from
confrontation Monday in marches across Northern Ireland, weighed
down by their own bitter divisions and subdued by the shock of
three children killed the night before.
	   At one big Orange gathering, scuffles broke out between those
who insisted that a blocked march must go through a Catholic
neighborhood, and those who wanted the protest called off.
	   ``Certainly even (among) those who were watching, there was a
deep sadness,'' said Jim Rodgers, a Belfast Orangeman. ``You
probably didn't see many smiling Orangemen.''
	   Catholics who had protested against a few marches also pulled
back. At one flashpoint in Belfast, they stood at the side of the
road, holding black flags, while Orangemen walked by to the muffled
beat of a single drum.
	   At hundreds of marches, Orangemen paused for silence in respect
for the three young Quinn brothers killed by a firebomb in
Ballymoney, 40 miles (60 kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   It was the worst of 130 attacks on homes in a week of violence
by Protestant hard-liners protesting because an Orange parade in
Portadown was stopped from passing through a Catholic neighborhood.
Hundreds of police and British soldiers have maintained the
blockade and Prime Minister Tony Blair has insisted that the law
will be enforced.
	   Several hundred Orangemen from the Portadown area marched around
the pasture near the Anglican church at Drumcree, where the march
was stopped. On Sunday, the Portadown lodges rejected calls from
political and religious leaders to call off their protest, though
they did move to scale down the size of the crowds which grew to
more than 20,000 last week.
	   ``We don't expect 1,400 men (the local membership) to stay here,
but the protest will continue until we can walk our traditional
route,'' said Gareth Watson, the chief steward at Drumcree. He said
any efforts would be ``peaceful and dignified.''
	   At Pomeroy, members of the hard-line Spirit of Drumcree movement
shouted ``traitor'' at the Rev. William Bingham, chaplain of the
County Armagh Orange lodges, who had called for an end to the
protests on Sunday.
	   Scuffles broke out in front of the platform. Spirit of Drumcree
leader Joel Patton denounced Bingham as the man who ``stabbed the
men in Portadown, stabbed them in the back when they were at their
most need.''
	   Denis Watson, Orange grandmaster in County Armagh, called on the
order to ``pledge ourselves to resolving this parades issue for
once and for all,'' to be ``constructive and resourceful'' without
compromising their principles. ``And for the world outside, our
principles are not negotiable,'' Watson said.
	   At the biggest Orange gathering, in Belfast, Orange Order
Grandmaster Robert Saulters warned of dangerous divisions among
pro-British unionists _ who split about evenly in last month's
referendum for and against an agreement to create a Northern
Ireland government in which Catholics and Protestants will share
power.
	   The newly elected first minister of the Assembly, David Trimble,
is an Orangeman, and so are several lawmakers from Trimble's party
who oppose the agreement.
	   ``Splintered unionism is no match for tightly knit (Catholic)
nationalism,'' Saulters said.
	   At Newry, near the border with the Irish Republic, army
specialists defused a car bomb left behind the courthouse. No one
claimed responsibility.
	   In Belfast, a contentious Orange march through the Lower Ormeau
neighborhood was delayed by a bomb threat. When the march went
ahead, Catholic protesters stood beside the road waving black flags
improvised from garbage-bin liners.
	   David Norris, a senator in the Irish Republic and a Protestant,
was among the spectators along the Ormeau Road. He compared the the
Orangemen to people put in a room with three doors closed and one
open.
	   ``They go one right after another into the three bricked-up
doors, and they stand in the middle of the room because they are
afraid to go through the one that's open,'' Norris said.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Two bombs exploded Monday in court
buildings in Athens' main judicial compound, causing damage but no
injuries, police said.
	   A group calling itself Revolutionary Struggle claimed
responsibility in a call to local media. It was the latest in a
string of bombings linked to small radical factions protesting a
range of issues including privatization of state industries and
labor reforms.
	   The first device _ a homemade time bomb _ exploded in a
second-story rest room in a building housing civil and criminal
courtrooms.
	   Authorities evacuated the two-story building following a warning
call to local media about 35 minutes before the explosion, which
occurred shortly after 7 p.m. (1600 GMT).
	   The second time bomb exploded less than a hour later in a
neighboring courthouse. There was no warning, police said.
	   A rash of bombings and arson attacks have plagued Athens since
last year targeting offices and cars belonging to politicians,
diplomats and journalists.
	   Small leftists groups have claimed responsibility for most of
the attacks. But the deadly terrorist group November 17 said it
carried out a rocket attack against a Citibank branch in April.
	   In the claim of responsibility, Revolutionary Struggle also said
it planted a bomb at the courthouse complex in January 1997. The
device failed to explode.

Luzhkov again tinkers with weather to keep rain off his parade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with ceremonies ended, Yeltsin, Samaranch in
attendance. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With the opening ceremonies of the World Youth
Games threatened by a wet forecast, Mayor Yuri Luzhkov once again
tinkered with the weather to ensure that no one _ not even nature _
rained on his parade.
	   The Russian Weather Service sent up six cloud-seeding planes to
prevent looming rain clouds from pouring on the games' opening
ceremonies at the giant Luzhniki stadium, said Weather Service
spokesman Anatoly Yakovlev.
	   The gambit apparently worked. As the ceremony got underway at 8
p.m. (1600 gmt), patches of blue poked through the clouds and a
day-long steady rainfall ended.
	   The planes used two methods on the clouds _ one to make them
rain before getting to Moscow, and another to keep them from
dumping their water until after they pass over the city.
	   It was not the first time Luzhkov has tried to control the
skies. Last summer during Moscow's 850th birthday celebration, the
mayor ordered similar action, but the technique was only partly
successful; a light drizzle dampened closing ceremonies at the
event.
	   Luzhkov launched the Youth Games with a media blitz and plenty
of fanfare, and wants them to go off without a hitch. With
President Boris Yeltsin, International Olympic Committee head Juan
Antonio Samaranch and thousands of athletes from around the world
in attendance, Monday's festivities were particularly important.
	   The games are part of a Luzhkov plan to show that Moscow can
handle big sporting events. He has said that if the games go
successfully he will make a bid for Moscow to host the 2012
Olympics.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Two bombs exploded Monday in court
buildings in Athens' main judicial compound, causing damage but no
injuries, police said.
	   A group calling itself Revolutionary Struggle claimed
responsibility in a call to local media. It was the latest in a
string of bombings linked to small radical factions protesting a
range of issues including privatization of state industries and
labor reforms.
	   The first device, a homemade time bomb, exploded in a
second-story rest room in a two-story building housing civil and
criminal courtrooms. Authorities evacuated the building following a
warning call to local media about 35 minutes before the explosion,
which occurred shortly after 7 p.m. (1600 GMT).
	   The second bomb exploded less than a hour later in a neighboring
courthouse. There was no warning, police said.
	   A rash of bombings and arson attacks have plagued Athens since
last year targeting offices and cars belonging to politicians,
diplomats and journalists.
	   Small leftists groups have claimed responsibility for most of
the attacks. But the deadly terrorist group November 17 said it
carried out a rocket attack against a Citibank branch in April.
	   The Revolutionary Struggle also said it planted a bomb at the
courthouse complex in January 1997. The device failed to explode.

A day of compromise and self-doubt for Orange Order marchers

 &UR; EDS: Graf 6 restores dropped reference to arrests. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant Orangemen shied from
confrontation Monday in marches across Northern Ireland, weighed
down by their own bitter divisions and subdued by the shock of
three children killed the night before.
	   At one big Orange gathering, scuffles broke out between those
who insisted that a blocked march must go through a Catholic
neighborhood, and those who wanted the protest called off.
	   ``Certainly even (among) those who were watching, there was a
deep sadness,'' said Jim Rodgers, a Belfast Orangeman. ``You
probably didn't see many smiling Orangemen.''
	   Catholics who had protested against a few marches also pulled
back. At one flashpoint in Belfast, they stood at the side of the
road, holding black flags, while Orangemen walked by to the muffled
beat of a single drum.
	   At hundreds of marches, Orangemen paused for silence in respect
for the three young Quinn brothers killed by a firebomb in
Ballymoney, 40 miles (60 kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   Police were questioning two men arrested Monday in connection
with attack.

Fit of Sudden convulsions affected Ronaldo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Ronaldo suffered a 30 to 40
seconds fit of convulsions just hours before the game with France
Sunday, the Brazilian team's doctor Lidio Toledo told Brazilian
reporters in Paris Monday.
	   ``I took him to the hospital and asked for a thorough test, like
electro-sonography and electro-cardiogram'', Toledo said. He had an
``emotional stress,'' Toledo said.
	   The 21-year old player whose poor performance was among the
reasons for his team loss 3-0 to France was shown on a TV Globo
News report saying that after the fit he went to sleep and ``woke
up with pains all over my body.''
	   ``It was something real bad that I had never before felt in my
whole life. I really felt bad. I had a headache, my stomach
pained'', the player said earlier in an interview with the Rio de
Janeiro newspaper O Globo.
	   But he said that after a while he felt normal again and thought
he could play.
	   Coach Zagallo confirmed that Ronaldo came in the stadium before
the game kicked off and asked to play.
	   Soccer King Pele said in a television talk show late Sunday that
it Ronaldo should have not played. ``What surprised me most is that
he went on to play even in the second half''.

Pak's goal: friends before funds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSTY MILLER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYLVANIA, Ohio (AP) _ A winner of two majors and coming off a
record performance, LPGA rookie Se Ri Pak aspires to have the
demeanor _ not the bank accounts _ of the greatest women golfers.
	   At a time when superstars strike mega endorsement deals and
construct barriers between themselves and the public, Pak simply
wants to make friends.
	   ``The people here are really, really nice and that makes me play
better,'' the 20-year-old South Korean said after running away with
Sunday's Jamie Farr Kroger Classic by nine strokes. ``I am not an
American, but they feel really, really close. They feel like
friends. They make big loud.''
	   For Pak, in the early stages of learning English, a ``big loud''
is the roar of the gallery after a birdie. It is a sound she heard
again and again at Highland Meadows Golf Club.
	   Her 261 total was the fewest strokes ever taken in a 72-hole
LPGA event. She became the third player to finish 23-under on the
tour. She also became the third player to follow a victory in the
U.S. Women's Open with a win in her next tournament.
	   Pak captured the Open in a 20-hole playoff just four days before
shooting a 61 in Friday's second round of the Farr _ the lowest
score ever in an LPGA event. She followed with a 63 for the lowest
back-to-back scores in tour history.
	   In the LPGA's 48 years and hundreds of tournaments, only three
players have ever had as many as 10 birdies in a round. Pak did it
twice in two days.
	   But it isn't records that interest her. She said she wants to
succeed over the long haul, but also wants to be seen as a
substantial and thoughtful person.
	   ``I want to be Nancy Lopez, Betsy King,'' she said, referring to
two Hall of Famers known as much for their fan-friendly attitude as
their many victories.
	   ``They are the best players, but really nice to people. If they
play good or not, they are nice to people. Like friends. They can
do many things to help people.''
	   As she spoke after Sunday's trophy presentation, Pak cuddled her
10-week-old beagle puppy named Happy. The dog, bought in Orlando,
Florida, cost dlrs 300.
	   Pak can afford it. Even though she has only three top-10
finishes on the tour this year, all three are wins and she now
leads the money list with dlrs 645,170 in earnings.
	   Huge galleries followed her during the final three rounds of the
Farr, including dozens of Koreans who might not have otherwise been
there.
	   Her sudden arrival has been likened to the advent of Tiger Woods
on the PGA Tour, whose rapid success brought millions of new and
younger fans to the sport.
	   One sign at Highland Meadows, in both English and Korean, said,
``Tiger Out. Pak In.''
	   But Pak said she isn't ready to face the immense expectations
Woods encountered.
	   ``A top player plays good and _ whoom! _ people think they
always play very high,'' she said. ``Many media make me feel I must
do my best golf. Many newspapers print my picture. I can feel it,
but I don't want to think like that. I am only 20 years old. I
don't want to stop now. I have long, long time.
	   ``I'm just really happy for my life.''

Victims' families remember bombing attack on fourth anniversary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Families of those who died in a
1994 bomb attack on a Jewish community center gathered with several
hundred people at the site Monday, the fourth anniversary of the
blast that took 86 lives.
	   Some carried signs with pictures of victims. Others criticized
the government's failed efforts to solve the attack that destroyed
the Jewish Mutual Association building in downtown Buenos Aires.
	   ``Our families have the right to know the truth,'' said rally
leader Laura Ginsberg, who whose husband died in the blast. ``But
President (Carlos) Menem considers us to be a part of some
political opposition.''
	   Ginsberg heads a victims' organization, Active Memory, that
meets every Monday in a square facing the Buenos Aires courts
building to demand justice.
	   No arrests have been made in the case, although four police
officers and a civilian have been indicted for supplying the van
that investigators believe a suicide bomber used to destroy the
seven-story building.
	   Argentina, along with Israel and the United States, suspect
Iranian involvement in the bombing. An earlier bombing in 1992 also
was directed at the country's Jewish community.
	   Diplomatic relations between Argentina and Iran were recently
downgraded after several Iranians believed to be involved in the
bombing were detained, including a businessman and his wife.

Nicklaus says he plans to retire in 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHESTER, England (AP) _ Jack Nicklaus says he plans to retire
after playing all four majors in the year 2000.
	   Nicklaus, winner of 18 majors, announced last week that his
ailing left hip would prevent him from playing in this week's
British Open at Royal Birkdale _ ending his streak of consecutive
majors at 154.
	   This will be the first British Open he has missed since 1962.
	   ``I'm not retiring and I'll still play in the Open Championships
to come and I could play next year at Carnoustie, although the
chances are I probably won't,'' the 58-year-old Nicklaus said
Monday.
	   Nicklaus reiterated he hopes to play in the British Open in 2000
at St. Andrews.
	   ``It's my full intention to play all four majors in the year
2000,'' he said. ``Then that will be the end of my playing golf
period. We've all got to stop some time, and I don't think it's any
big deal.''
	   ``I'm fairly much in touch with what's realistic and if I say
I'm going to stay out there and keep competing then that would be
rather silly,'' he said. ``I'll still play some senior golf, but
I'm not going to compete against the kids.''
	   Nicklaus was in Chester to unveil a course he designed with his
son, Steve, at Carden Park. He marked the opening of the
7,010-yard, par-72 course by playing a round with Ian Woosnam.

	   BALLYMONEY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Everyone in the Carnarny
Estates knew Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn.
	   At first light, they'd be out on their bikes or bedeviling Mrs.
Walker once again with their rambunctious dog, though nobody
thought she was really mad when she yelled at them.
	   Monday, their abandoned bikes leaned on the low wooden fence
outside their firebombed house. And Mrs. Walker, choking back tears
and rage in equal measure, stooped to add a tiny basket of yellow
posies and three wee stuffed animals to the small mound of bouquets
laid in their memory.
	   After the young brothers were killed Sunday in a sectarian
attack that shocked a province all too accustomed to untimely
dying, some called them a tragic symbol of Northern Ireland.
	   But to many others, they were just three little individuals,
robbed of the chance to grow up and decide who they would be.
	   Neighbors recalled gap-toothed Richard, 11, gleefully gathering
scraps of wood for a holiday bonfire Saturday night, hours before
his death. Impish Mark, 10, pedaled his bike everywhere. And Jason
had just turned 9 last week. To celebrate, he camped out in a tent
with five buddies and they scared each other all night with ghost
stories.
	   ``These children _ Who knows what they would have been the rest
of their lives?'' said Ballymoney's Catholic parish priest, the
Rev. Peter Forde, who must preside over their funeral Mass at the
Church of Our Lady and St. Patrick on Tuesday morning.
	   Forde described the Quinn boys as ``sandwiched in the great
divide'' _ living on a 90-percent Protestant housing estate in a
75-percent hard-line Protestant town, being raised Protestant by a
Catholic mother who thought it would make life easier for them.
	   Police, who arrested two men Monday in connection with the
attack, believe the Ballymoney firebombers were motivated by the
fact that Chrissie Quinn, 29, lived with a Protestant boyfriend.
	   Her oldest son, 13-year-old Lee, spent Saturday night with his
grandmother. He is now an only child. ``I wonder, could they have
jumped out if they woke up earlier?'' he was quoted as saying of
his brothers and best playmates.
	   After years of bloody struggle, Northern Ireland has finally
turned toward peace. But it is a fragile, fledging peace, and it
has been tested since July 5 by a violent standoff outside
Portadown between Protestant marchers and the armed authorities
blocking them from parading down a largely Catholic road.
	   The Protestant firebombings, shootings and hijackings that
rippled across the province all week in support of the Orange
Order's attempt to march had largely passed by Ballymoney, about 40
miles (60 kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   But it took what happened about 4:30 a.m. Sunday (2330 GMT
Saturday) at 41 Carnarny Drive to make a difference: A single
firebombing rendered even the most battle-scarred politicians and
policemen hollow-eyed, and prompted a sizable number of the
protesters encamped outside Portadown to heed their pastors' calls
and go quietly home.
	   Forde said the boys' mother has retreated into shock, but that
she was insistent about one thing: Her sons must receive a Catholic
funeral and burial.
	   ``She's physically incapable of doing anything more than nodding
her head and shaking it, it's all so new to her,'' he said. ``But
she was adamant that it all be Catholic. On that point, she had no
hesitation.''
	   Forty-five minutes before the service, three little white
coffins with gold handles will be carried from the home of the
boys' grand-uncle in Rasharkin for the slow, 7-mile (11-km) trip
through the impossibly lush, green hills of County Antrim.
	   Forde is bracing himself for the first ``unnatural'' sight of
the three small coffins arrayed before the great white marble
altar, and hoping his words can somehow make a difference _ to the
boys' family, and to the watching world.
	   ``It is not the place to be political,'' he said. ``But three
children who had just begun life were lent to us, and we as a
society failed in our responsibility.''
	   The boys will then make a final trip back to Rasharkin, where
the Quinns have their roots, for burial in the Catholic ground of
the local parish church.
	   Mrs. Walker, a grandmotherly figure who did not want to be fully
identified, did not plan to attend the funeral Mass or the burial.
	   Though it is painful for her that the last time she saw the
boys, ``I yelled at them again about their black dog getting into
everything,'' it is their irrepressible spirits that she will hold
onto.
	   ``They were so full of life,'' she said, sagging into her
daughter for support as the enormity of the loss sank in yet again.
``They will be remembered.''
	   The tears dried up, though, when she was asked if anything good
could ever come from the brothers' deaths, if perhaps their loss
might help keep the peace and promote tolerance.
	   ``This will change nothing,'' she said, her voice flattening to
a monotone. ``There are always people against peace. There will
always be people against peace. But they should ask themselves if
the price we've paid is worth it _ three little boys.''
	   A note tacked on one of the bouquets outside the Quinns' house
echoed her words: ``Three boys died because people wanted to walk
down a road for 15 minutes.''
	   Richard Quinn. Mark Quinn. Jason Quinn.

Albanian pacifist leader seeks to win control over Kosovo rebels

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Amid fighting southwest of the
provincial capital Pristina that killed two people and left others
wounded or fleeing, an ethnic Albanian leader sought Monday to rein
in guerrillas fighting for the Serbian province's independence.
	   In an attempt to put the underground Kosovo Liberation Army
under the control of moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova, the main board
of his Democratic League of Kosovo announced that the first
constituent session of the self-styled Kosovo parliament would
convene within a week.
	   The parliament, elected in unofficial elections last March, has
never met. It is dominated by Rugova's party, which holds 108 out
of 120 seats, but has been boycotted by most other Albanian parties
citing lack of democratic conditions and criticizing Rugova's
policies.
	   However, analysts believe the KLA are unlikely to recognize the
parliament's or Rugova's authority. In a weekend statement, the KLA
denounced what they called ``shameful bickering'' of the political
parties, indicating they would not accept the authority of any of
them.
	   In Brussels, the European Union called again for an immediate
cease-fire and a resumption of negotiations with direct
international involvement, endorsing the principle of the use of
force should any of the parties block the process.
	   Foreign ministers said the 15-nation EU supported the adoption
of a U.N. Security Council resolution putting the United Nations'
weight behind international efforts and ``endorsed the principle of
further action under the U.N. charter to bring about compliance by
those who block the process.''
	   Meanwhile, the Kosovo Information Center said Pecan and two
other villages 45 kilometers (28 miles) southwest of Pristina were
shelled. Two were killed and 13 others were wounded, said the
center, which is close to Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   The shelling and sniping by the Serbs drove ethnic Albanians
from the region, it said.
	   More fighting was reported northwest of Pristina. The
Information Center said Serb forces and members of the Kosovo
Liberation Army clashed near Stari Trg, 35 kilometers (20 miles)
from Pristina in a mining area rich in zinc and lead.
	   The Kosovo Information Center also said four Albanians were
seriously wounded Sunday in fighting close to the border with
neighboring Albania, near Djakovica.
	   Earlier this month, other influential ethnic Albanian parties
proposed formation of an ethnic Albanian National Council, which
would include representatives from all parties and present a
unified Albanian body to encompass the KLA. But Rugova apparently
rejected the proposal.
	   On the ground, the government-run Serb Media Center said Serb
forces on Monday retook the last strategic sites around the
Belacevac coal mine, just 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of Pristina.
There was no resistance, with ethnic Albanian fighters melting away
at the sight of Serb police, said the center.
	   Fighting around the Belacevac region erupted early this month
after Kosovo guerrillas took the area, provoking a Serb
counter-assault for the mine, which provides much of the electrical
energy for the province.
	   New Serb forces arrived to the province amid the fighting.
Ethnic Albanian sources, who asked for anonymity, said 14 buses
carrying police were seen arriving in Pec, a city close to the
border with Albania.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed.
	   The newest outbreak left 12 people reported dead over three
days.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo, are
seeking independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia. Hundreds of people have been killed since February when
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
Albanian separatists who had been attacking Serb police and
military facilities.

Russia, IMF reach agreement on bailout package

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia got what it wanted Monday from
international lenders, who agreed to a two-year financial bailout
valued at dlrs 22.6 billion, including 17.1 billion in new loans.
	   The announcement of the loan package culminated weeks of
speculation and negotiation that followed the collapse of Russian
financial markets this spring. The money is to come from three
sources: the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the
Japanese government.
	   The money could begin to flow into the Russian economy as early
as next week, after the IMF board of directors meets in Washington
on Monday to consider the deal.
	   However, the loans are apparently contingent on passage of an
austere economic stabilization plan in the Russian parliament. With
the lower house of parliament dominated by communists who strongly
oppose the government's economic program, passage is far from
guaranteed.
	   The deal was considered necessary to stave off the devaluation
of the ruble, restore the confidence of foreign investors and allow
the government to begin to pay its many debts, including billions
of rubles (dollars) owed to unpaid workers.
	   It was announced jointly by Anatoly Chubais, the government's
chief negotiator, and top officials of the IMF and World Bank.
	   ``We're convinced that this isn't a program to patch holes or
put out fires,'' Chubais told reporters. ``We are convinced that
these resources will allow us to significantly strengthen the
anti-crisis efforts of the government and will help to stabilize
and strengthen the Russian economy.''
	   Chubais, the architect of Russia's privatization program, had
been seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion in new loans.
	   The agreement he struck calls for dlrs 12.6 billion in new loans
this year, followed by dlrs 4.5 billion in new loans next year.
Added to loans that were previously negotiated, the total comes to
dlrs 14.8 billion in 1998 and dlrs 22.6 billion over two years.
	   The IMF's chief negotiator, John Odling-Smee, said the deal will
mean that ``confidence will return to the financial markets and the
pressures on the ruble will not continue.''
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Mike McCurry called the
agreement ``a major step forward.''
	   The IMF said the first installment of dlrs 5.6 billion could be
made available immediately after its board meeting next week.
	   The Russian stock market index leapt 9.2 percent Monday in
response to the news. The market had been flat recently as traders
waited to see what kind of loan package the government would snare.
	   Jerome Booth, head of emerging markets research at ANZ
Investment Bank in London, said the package is likely enough to
stabilize Russian markets, and send them even higher.
	   ``It's an issue of confidence _ you are trying to get the
private sector to refinance and invest in Russia,'' he said. ``The
fact that the IMF has said it will provide money is the important
thing. The amount is almost secondary.''
	   Economists have noted that a loan by itself wouldn't solve
perennial problems such as the budget deficit and a porous tax
collection system. However, in agreeing to the loan, Russia
promised to push through a reform program that would lower the
deficit and improve tax collection.
	   It specifically agreed to cut the budget deficit sharply over
the next two years, from 6.8 percent of the country's gross
domestic product to 2.8 percent of GDP, the IMF said.
	   Russia also announced that it would stop issuing short-term
treasury bills, which have been issued lately at astronomical
interest rates, and offer holders the opportunity to convert them
to medium- or long-term bonds denominated in dollars, not rubles.
	   Odling-Smee did not directly say that the new loans are
contingent on approval of the government's entire economic program
in the Duma, the lower house of parliament, but implied as much.
	   ``We will make a judgment about the position of the Executive
Board in the light of whatever decision the Duma makes,'' he said.
	   The Duma is scheduled to take up the issue later this week.
	   One new element in the loan package was the participation of
Japan, which had been rumored in recent days. Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko was in Tokyo on Monday, where Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto affirmed a deal for a dlrs 800 million loan from
the Export-Import Bank of Japan.
	   That is dlrs 200 million higher than the amount announced by the
IMF for 1998. The discrepancy could not be immediately explained.

Asia frets over Japanese political turmoil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reax from Malaysia, Hong Kong, minor editing. No

 &UR; With BC-Japan-Election &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Asian countries depending on Japan to help mend
their shattered economies fretted Monday that the country's
political turmoil could prolong the region's woes.
	   The crumbling of Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's
government Monday came amid more bad economic news from Japan's
neighbors: Malaysia said for the first time that its economy will
shrink this year, and a top economist predicted the same for Hong
Kong.
	   Other nations said that stability in Japan, the region's No. 1
economy, is key to recovery.
	   ``A strong government in Japan that can provide effective
leadership is a crucial factor in the efforts to restore economic
stability and growth in Asia,'' the Thai Foreign Ministry said.
	   The ministry said measures to stimulate the Japanese economy,
restructure its financial sector and stabilize the yen were all
vital to the region's economic health.
	   Hashimoto's resignation, triggered by the defeat of his Liberal
Democratic Party in parliamentary elections Sunday, received close
attention in the South Korean media.
	   ``In the short term, Japan's political instability will have a
negative impact on Asia's economic recovery,'' the Hankyoreh, a
national daily, said in an editorial.
	   ``But in the long term, his resignation may have a positive
impact, because the next government is certain to push bold
economic programs,'' the paper said.
	   China's leaders reacted mildly to the moves in Japan, focusing
instead on the two countries' warming relations.
	   ``We ... hope Japan's political situation will remain stable,''
the Foreign Ministry said.
	   Indonesian leaders also stressed the need to maintain close
relations with Japan despite the impending departure of Hashimoto,
who had been in office for more than two years.
	   Speaking to reporters after meeting with President B.J. Habibie,
State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said ties between the two countries
were solid.
	   ``The relationship has been built over a long time and a change
of government either for Indonesia or Japan won't affect ... the
countries' relationship,'' said Akbar, who was elected chairman of
the ruling Golkar party this past weekend.
	   Australian Treasurer Peter Costello urged the incoming Japanese
government to stay the course of reform set by Hashimoto.
	   ``It is important that the Japanese government continues to work
on sorting out the financial system,'' he said. ``This is very
important to Japan's prospects and Japan's prospects are very
important to Asia's prospects.''
	   In Hong Kong, a top economist warned the island's economy will
shrink by 2 percent this year, and unemployment could increase.
	   Economic growth in 1999 will be flat as well, with the economy
growing less than 1 percent, said Ian Perkins, chief economist for
Hong Kong's General Chamber of Commerce.
	   Malaysian Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Monday his
country's gross domestic product would shrink by 1 percent to 2
percent in 1998.
	   Until the announcement, the government had predicted growth of
between 2 percent and 3 percent for 1998.
	   In Washington, the White House issued a statement emphasizing
its enduring close ties with Tokyo.
	   ``We look forward to working with the new Japanese government
and, in the meantime, we will continue close consultation and
cooperation with the Japanese government,'' the statement said.

Nicklaus plans to retire in 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHESTER, England (AP) _ Jack Nicklaus, winner of 18 major
tournaments, plans to retire from the PGA Tour after playing all
four majors in the year 2000.
	   ``Then that will be the end of my playing golf, period,'' the
58-yedar-old said Monday. ``We've all got to stop some time, and I
don't think it's any big deal.
	   ``I'm fairly much in touch with what's realistic and if I say
I'm going to stay out there and keep competing then that would be
rather silly. I'll still play some senior golf, but I'm not going
to compete against the kids.''
	   Nicklaus said last week that his ailing left hip would prevent
him from playing in this week's British Open at Royal Birkdale _
ending his streak of consecutive majors at 154. This will be the
first British Open he has missed since 1962.
	   ``I'm not retiring and I'll still play in the Open Championships
to come and I could play next year at Carnoustie, although the
chances are I probably won't,'' Nicklaus said.
	   Nicklaus reiterated he hopes to play in the British Open in 2000
at St. Andrews.
	   Nicklaus was in Chester to unveil a course he designed with his
son, Steve, at Carden Park. He marked the opening of the 7,010-yard
(6,408 meters), par-72 course by playing a round with Ian Woosnam.

Lagos calm after last week's chaos; military shuffled
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with shuffling in military, ethnic

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Life began to return to normal in Lagos on
Monday with schools and office buildings reopening after days of
rioting and chaos last week.
	   Violence in the wake of the death of Moshood Abiola, Nigeria's
most prominent political prisoner rocked Lagos and the southern
cities of Ibadan and Abeokuta. At least 55 people were killed and
more than 400 were arrested.
	   Riot police continued to patrol highly visible positions in
Lagos on Monday in order to discourage new bouts of violence.
	   Abiola, Nigeria's top political prisoner and the presumed winner
of canceled 1993 presidential elections, died of an apparent heart
attack last week.
	   His death while still in custody unleashed angry protests and
underscored Nigeria's fractious ethnic divisions.
	   The government, meanwhile, announced the shuffling of a number
of top military ecomanders. In the most prominent appointment, Rear
Adm. Jubril Ayinla, a former health minister, has been named the
chief of the navy.
	   Among other changes, Maj. Gen. Victor Malu, who headed the
Nigerian-led West African peacekeeping group ECOMOG until last
year, has been named to head the Lagos army garrison. Maj. Hamza
al-Mustapha, who headed the late leader Gen. Sani Abacha's personal
corps of bodyguards and wielded immense power as an adviser, was
made an intelligence officer in the southeastern city of Enugu. He
was ousted from his job two weeks ago.
	   Notably, a number officers promoted in recent days have been
Yorubas, the ethnic group that dominates Nigeria's southwest and is
most prominent in the country's pro-democracy movement. The
military and junta have long been dominated by northern Hausas and
Fulanis, and some of the violence that followed the death of Abiola
last week involved fighting between Yorubas and Hausas.
	   But some Ibos _ Nigeria's other main ethnic group, which
dominates the southeast of the country _ are feeling left out of
the equation.
	   Leaders of the Ibo umbrella group Ohaneze emerged from a one-day
meeting Sunday in Eunugu, angry at the dearth of Ibos appointed to
top military positions in the changes taken since the death of the
Abacha.
	   ``We completely deplore a situation where no Ibo is found worthy
of the services of the armed forces or serve as chief of general
staff, chief of defense staff or even national security advsier,''
the group said in a statement, saying they feared being
marginalized.
	   Ethnic strife is nothing new to Nigeria.
	   At least a million people are believed to have died in the
brutal civil war lead by Ibo military officials who tried to
establish the Republic of Biafra, an independent state, in the late
1960s.
	   Abiola was arrested in 1994 by the late dictator Gen. Sani
Abacha. With Abacha's death last month, the country's new military
junta was expected to release Abiola along with the country's other
political prisoners.
	   Abiola died while meeting with visiting U.S. officials just days
before he was reportedly to be release. He was buried Saturday in a
garden ceremony at his sprawling Lagos estate home.

Security Council approves Sierra Leone observer mission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Concerned that civilian rule in Sierra
Leone has deteriorated with revenge attacks by members of the
former military junta, the Security Council on Monday authorized a
U.N. military observer mission for the West African nation.
	   The 15-member council voted unanimously to establish the
70-member team, which will work with Nigerian-led West African
peacekeepers to help demobilize remnants of the former ruling junta
and support the restored elected government of President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah.
	   The resolution condemns the continued violence by the former
junta, calls on them to disarm and expresses the council's serious
concern about reports of the flow of arms across the border in
violation of U.N. resolutions.
	   The Nigerian-led peacekeepers ousted the military junta of Lt.
Col. Johnny Paul Koroma in February and restored the elected
government of Kabbah, who had been toppled in a coup last year by
Koroma.
	   In the past several months, hundreds of villagers have been
killed and more than 1,000 mutilated by former junta troops hiding
out in the countryside, the Red Cross reported last month.
	   ``The ray of hope that we all felt when President Kabbah and his
government returned to Freetown in March was quickly overshadowed
by the terrible atrocities committed by fleeing junta and rebel
forces,'' said America's U.N. ambassador, Bill Richardson.
	   The United States will pledge dlrs 55 million in humanitarian
aid for refugees in Sierra Leone and neighboring countries, he
said.
	   The U.N. team will have an initial six-month mandate, through
Jan. 13, and will be accompanied by a medical unit and other
military observers.
	   France's U.N. ambassador, Alain Dejammet noted that the team
must work with the Nigerian peacekeepers, who have the primary
mission in the country.
	   ``Even after being deposed, these former junta members have
refused to lay down their arms and are committing unspeakable
atrocities in the north and east of the country,'' said Kenya's
U.N. ambassador, Njuguna Mahugu. ``These revenge killings, with no
military or strategic value, have got to stop.''
	   The Security Council in June lifted an arms embargo on Sierra
Leone, the last remaining sanction from a series of penalties
imposed in October.
	   But the council ordered all U.N. member states to ensure that
weapons shipments to Sierra Leone pass exclusively through areas
under the control of the civilian government and its Nigerian
allies.
	   ``The neighboring states have responsibility for implementing
that embargo,'' Richardson said.
	   Member states have also been asked to prevent senior junta
figures and their families from entering their territory.

UN team recommends weapons collection program for Albania
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A U.N. team has recommended a weapons
collection program for Albania to gather the tens of thousands of
guns and ammunition rounds that fell into civilian hands during the
unrest that rocked the country last year.
	   A report Monday on the collection program said the Albanian
government viewed the conflict in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians
are fighting for independence from Serbia, ``as an additional
reason to retrieve weapons from the civilian population.''
	   Many of those weapons have since found their way to the
separatists, and the team leader acknowledged such a program would
be less than welcome in porous Albanian border areas.
	   Undersecretary-General Jayantha Dhanapala and a U.N. delegation
traveled to Albania on June 11-14 at the invitation of the Albanian
government to evaluate prospects for a collection program.
	   Similar programs have been launched in Angola, Cambodia,
Guatemala, Mali and Somalia, among other countries. Albania,
however, represented a unique situation because the guns were
largely in the hands of civilians, not combatants, Dhanapala said
at a briefing Friday.
	   An estimated 650,000 guns were looted from army and police
depots during riots last year that swept the country after the
collapse of widely popular pyramid investment schemes. Included in
the looting: 1.5 billion bullets and artillery shells and 20,000
tons of explosives _ detonator capsules, anti personnel and
anti-tank mines.
	   In their report, the team recommended that a pilot collection
program be launched in the south central district of Gramsh, which
Dhanapala said accounts for an estimated 8-10 percent of the stolen
goods.
	   If successful and if funding was available, the project would be
expanded on a national scale. Incentives for turning in guns and
ammunition would be in the form of job training and other
development-related benefits, such as road building.
	   The team recommended against a cash buy-back, which has worked
in other countries, because it would lead to high inflation and
would send ``the wrong message to those who may consider
unauthorized weapon possession as a lucrative activity,'' the
report said.
	   The evaluation team, which was funded by Italy, recommended
Albania pass a law that would delineate legal and illicit ownership
of guns and start a campaign to publicize the benefits of turning
over the weapons.
	   Though an estimated 30 percent of the looted goods have
`leaked'' out of Albania into Kosovo, Macedonia and elsewhere, the
collection program will focus on collecting weapons that still
remain in Albania, Dhanapala said.
	   In Gramsh, 100 kilometers (65 miles) south of Tirana, villagers
``notwithstanding the Kosovo situation stood ready to collect
weapons in that community and have them surrendered voluntary to
the weapon collection authorities,'' Dhanapala said.
	   ``Clearly closer to the Kosovo border, that possibility may be
reduced,'' he said. The evaluation team didn't go to northeastern
Albania, which borders Kosovo.
	   The looted weapons, of Albanian, Chinese, Italian, Russian and
Yugoslav origin, included ordinary rifles, pistols, revolvers,
mortars and hand grenades, automatic rifles, machine guns and
anti-tank grenade launchers.
	   The Albanian government requested a collection program in letter
to Secretary-General Kofi Annan dated Feb. 27 _ just as the Serb
crackdown on ethnic Albanians was getting started in Kosovo.
Hundreds have been killed since.

Russian trawlers leave Norway's waters, illegal fishing charges
</HEADLINE>
dropped &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A fleet of 30 Russian trawlers left
Norwegian waters Monday in a diplomatic compromise that included
the immediate release of one ship seized on charges of illegal
fishing.
	   The Russian fleet was fishing in an economic zone Norway claims
around the Svalbard archipelago, about 640 kilometers (500 miles)
north of the mainland. Svalbard is Norwegian territory under a 1920
treaty, and last month Norway closed the waters around the islands
to all trawlers due to fears of overfishing.
	   On Sunday, the Norwegian coast guard seized the trawler
Novokuibyshevsk, registered in the Russian city of Murmansk, for
fishing in the area and had been towing the ship to the mainland.
	   Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ingvard Haven said Norway
and Russia reached a compromised after hectic diplomatic activities
in which the Novokuibyshevsk was released without charges and the
other trawlers left the protected fisheries zone.

Although Pitts scored two rushing touchdowns in Green Bay's 35-10

Netanyahu accused of interfering in strategic sales to Iran trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An opposition legislator accused Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday of interfering in the trial of a
businessman convicted of selling chemical and biological weapons
components to Iran.
	   Netanyahu's office and a courts spokesman denied the accusation.
	   Nissim Zvili's accusations echoed charges made earlier by the
defense attorney for Nahum Manbar, who was convicted of treason in
a closed-doors trial last month of selling weapons materials to
Iran for dlrs 16 million.
	   ``From information I have received from authoritative sources
very close to the trial of Nahum Manbar, the prime minister _ on
his own initiative _ held conversations with Judge Stroessnov that
had to do with the trial and with the accused, and in these
conversations the prime minister showed active involvement in the
judicial process,'' legislator Nissim Zvili said Monday in a
question submitted through the Knesset.
	   ``Did the content of the conversations deal with the substance
of the trial, with the connection between the offenses and the
severity of punishment required, and Israel's bilateral
relations?'' Zvili asked.
	   Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying that ``The prime
minister says he did not have any contact with Judge Stroessnov _
not even once _ since the beginning of the Manbar affair, neither
before the trial nor during the trial nor after the trial.''
	   Judge Amnon Stroessnov headed the three-judge panel in the
Manbar case.
	   After Manbar's conviction, Netanyahu said he had personally
ordered his arrest and hoped he would receive a long sentence. ``I
hope he will pay a heavy price for the terrible thing he has
done,'' Netanyahu said then.
	   At the time, Manbar's defense attorney, Amnon Zichroni, also
accused Netanyahu of interfering in the judicial process and said
the prime minister had taken ``advantage of his position in order
to violate the law.''
	   Zvili implied that Netanyahu was motivated by pressure from a
foreign country in intervening in the case.
	   Israeli newspapers reported last year that U.S. officials had
asked Netanyahu to stop Manbar's activities and that the CIA
provided information to Israel on Manbar's links with Iran.
	   Manbar was barred from the United States in 1994, after the U.S.
State Department said he and two of his companies violated a U.S.
trade embargo against Iran.
	   Israel and Iran have been in a technical state of war since the
Islamic revolution there in 1979. Israel has warned that Iran is
close to completing a missile with capabilities of striking the
Jewish state and is advancing its nuclear program, while Iranian
leaders have regularly called for Israel's destruction.
	   Zvili, a prominent member of the opposition Labor party, said
that if Netanyahu did in fact interfere in the case, he will have
to resign.
	   Members of Netanyahu's Likud party accused the opposition of
trying to discredit the prime minister, even if it meant
overturning Manbar's conviction.
	   Israel's Supreme Court is to hear two petitions related to the
case on Tuesday. The court has issued a gag order barring
disclosure of information to the first petition. The second,
submitted by journalists, asks the court to lift the gag order.
	   Manbar's sentencing hearing is scheduled for Wednesday in Tel
Aviv District Court. He faces a possible life sentence.

Gary Nicklaus fails to qualify; Larry Mize just makes it
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ There will be no member of the Niclaus
family playing in this week's British Open.
	   Jack Nicklaus announced last week that he was withdrawing from
the championship at Royal Birkdale because of an ailing hip, ending
his streak of consecutive majors at 154.
	   That left his son Gary as the only Nicklaus hoping to play. But
he missed his chance Monday when he lost a playoff in one of the
qualifying competitions.
	   Nicklaus lost on the third extra hole at the Hillside course
when Scotland's Ross Drummond chipped in from 25 yards for a birdie
three.
	   Nicklaus had been poised to clinch one of the 54 qualifying
berths but bogeyed the last three holes for a 78 and 7-over total
of 151.
	   Former Masters champion Larry Mize qualified, making birdies on
the last two holes at Hesketh to finish at 4-over 146.
	   ``It was tough there,'' Mize said. ``It could not have got any
worse. I'm just happy to qualify.''
	   Other qualifiers included Rodger Davis, joint runner-up to Nick
Faldo at the British Open in Muirfield in 1987; former European
Ryder Cup player Gordon Brand Jr.; and 17-year-old English amateur
Justin Rose.
	   Howard Twitty withrew after his first round score of 81 at the
West Lancashire course, and Mark O'Grady failed to qualify after
rounds of 80 and 78.

Spiritual leader of Sephardic Orthodox Jewry dies in Jerusalem

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Rabbi Benzion Abba Shaul, a leader of Israel's
Sephardic Orthodox community, died Monday in Jerusalem. He was 74.
	   Tens of thousands of black-coated mourners attended his funeral
Tuesday, causing a huge traffic jam at the entrance to Jerusalem.
	   Many of the mourners were Ashkenazi Jews of European origin,
although the rabbi was Sephardic _ a descendant of the Jews
expelled from Spain in 1492, many of whom settled in Arab
countries.
	   He was born in Jerusalem in 1924.
	   Israel's Ashkenazi chief rabbi, Israel Meir Lau, said Rabbi
Shaul's scholarship recalled the golden age of medieval Spanish
Jewry.
	   ``He was a walking encyclopedia of Torah learning, God-fearing
and very modest'' Rabbi Lau said.
	   Rabbi Shaul headed the prestigious Porat-Yosef religious
seminary in
	   Jerusalem.
	   He suffered a stroke two years ago. The cause of death was not
announced.

Tech golf star hints he may turn pro soon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Matt Kuchar's days as an amateur may be nearing
an end. The more the Georgia Tech golfer talks about turning pro,
the more it sounds like he'll do so soon.
	   ``The time is right for me to really chase that dream,'' he told
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution while preparing for this week's
British Open.
	   The 20-year-old Kuchar, a native of Lake Mary, Florida, is the
U.S. Amateur champion. He tied for 21st at this year's Masters and
14th at the U.S. Open _ performances that prequalify him for those
events next year.
	   To retain his amateur status, Kuchar turned down dlrs 40,000 in
Masters prize money. But it may be getting harder and harder for
him to walk away.
	   ``It's a chance to set myself financially for a long period of
time,'' Kuchar said in the interview, published Monday.
``Hopefully, it works out well enough where I will be set, that
this is the prime time for me to go and turn pro, and that sponsors
want me.''
	   It's doubtful that Kuchar's marketability could go much higher
than it is now, said Vinnie Giles of Pros Inc., one of the agents
trying to land him.
	   ``Barring something phenomenal like winning the British Open,
he's pretty close to his apex right now,'' Giles said.
	   Kuchar said he's still reeling from the attention from autograph
seekers and agents.
	   ``I'm not really into it yet, dealing with agents,'' he said.
``It's flattering, but it's almost too much. Everybody has the same
promises they're making. It's been a battle as far as who wants to
do this and who wants to do that. It's been a lot to handle.''
	   Still, there may be reasons for him not to take the leap. He can
be inconsistent, for instance. The week after his spectacular
finish at the Masters, Kuchar finished fifth in the ACC tournament.
	   He said he's not sure he wants to leave Georgia Tech, where he's
a junior management major.
	   ``There's so many positives for getting my degree and so many
positives for turning pro, it just seems like one doesn't outweigh
the other right now,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ There will be no member of the Niclaus
family playing in this week's British Open.
	   Jack Nicklaus announced last week that he was withdrawing from
the championship at Royal Birkdale because of an ailing hip, ending
his streak of consecutive majors at 154.
	   That left his son Gary as the only Nicklaus hoping to play. But
he missed his chance Monday when he lost a playoff in one of the
qualifying competitions.
	   Nicklaus lost on the third extra hole at the Hillside course
when Scotland's Ross Drummond chipped in from 25 yards for a birdie
three.
	   Nicklaus had been poised to clinch one of the 54 qualifying
berths but bogeyed the last three holes for a 78 and 7-over total
of 151.
	   Former Masters champion Larry Mize qualified, making birdies on
the last two holes at Hesketh to finish at 4-over 146.
	   ``It was tough there,'' Mize said. ``It could not have got any
worse. I'm just happy to qualify.''
	   Other qualifiers included Rodger Davis, joint runner-up to Nick
Faldo at the British Open in Muirfield in 1987; former European
Ryder Cup player Gordon Brand Jr.; and 17-year-old English amateur
Justin Rose.
	   Howard Twitty withrew after his first round score of 81 at the
West Lancashire course, and Mac O'Grady failed to qualify after
rounds of 80 and 78.

Ten nations join EU in sanctions on Belarus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. statement. EDITS to conform. No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union on Monday condemned
efforts by the Belarusian government to evict officials in several
nations' diplomatic residences in Minsk and imposed travel
restrictions on Belarusian officials.
	   Ten non-European Union nations joined the EU in the action.
	   Also Monday in Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin said the United States planned to take similar action. He
said an announcement was expected shortly.
	   The EU response followed orders from the Belarusian government
that several nations vacate their ambassadors' residences in a
diplomatic compound. The EU said the orders ``constitute an
infringement of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations.''
	   Belarus has said it needs to repair the plumbing and sewage
system in the compound where the ambassadorial residences are
located. The ambassadors say that under the Vienna Convention,
Belarus has no right to force them out for any reason.
	   The EU action prohibits admission of Belarus officials into any
of the 15 EU member states, from President Alexander Lukashenko,
his Cabinet ministers and their deputies to a range of lesser
officials, including the chairmen of the State Patent Committee and
the State Committee for Hydrometeorology.
	   ``We continue to be at loggerheads with President Lukashenko and
his administration,'' said British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
	   Joining the EU were Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic,
Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Iceland and Norway,
who said in a joint statement that they ``will ensure that their
national policies conform to that common position.''
	   Diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Greece, Italy, and Japan left Belarus to consult with their
governments over the dispute. The Bulgarian and Polish ambassadors
also were recalled home.
	   ``As a signal of the seriousness with which it takes the
situation, (the EU) has adopted a common position imposing
non-admission in the member states of the European Union of all
members of the government as well as senior officials of the
Republic of Belarus,'' the EU said.
	   Poland, while declaring its solidarity with the EU and
condemning Belarus, declined to join in the action. Citing its
position as chairman of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, Poland said it ``feels it is responsible
before the international community for maintaining a dialogue with
the people of Belarus and for ensuring the conditions for further
operation of the OSCE mission in Minsk.''

Weather forecasts unsettle grain, soybean futures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Corn futures rose Monday at the Chicago Board of
Trade, reacting to forecasts for the return of hot weather to the
Midwest. Soybean futures were tugged in different directions by
conflicting forecasts.
	   Midwestern corn is entering the key pollination period, while
soybeans begin their flowering period in August. Both crops need
ample soil moisture and moderate temperatures to perform best.
	   Some private forecasts at midsession called for more rain in the
Midwest, undermining soybean futures. The November bean contract
lost about a dime a bushel after the midday forecasts, but regained
most of the loss.
	   Wheat futures for delivery in September were unchanged at dlrs
2.74 1-4 a bushel; September corn was 3 cents higher at dlrs 2.39
1-2 a bushel; September oats were 3-4 cent higher at dlrs 1.23 3-4
a bushel; and August soybeans were 3 1-2 cents higher at dlrs 6.37
3-4 a bushel.

Argentine attorney: former Junta officers may be charged for
</HEADLINE>
kidnappings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ An Argentine attorney said Monday that he
was studying whether former military junta officers could be
charged in the systematic abduction children of dissidents during
Argentina's ``dirty war.''
	   Eduardo Freiler, who is accompanying Argentine federal Judge
Adolfo Bagnasco on his European tour to interview women imprisoned
under the regime, said 35 people have been charged in the case.
	   Bagnasco's investigation aims to determine whether military
leaders and other officials during Argentina's 1976-83 dictatorship
organized abductions during the crackdown on leftists and political
dissidents.
	   Freiler said the suspect list could be enlarged to include
former President Jorge Videla, who seized power in a 1976 coup, and
former Adm. Emilio Eduardo Massera, the state-run news agency EFE
reported.
	   At Argentina's embassy in Madrid, Bagnasco recently interviewed
three former inmates of Buenos Aires' infamous Naval Mechanics
School. Originally built to teach mechanical skills to navy
personnel, the school was converted into a clandestine jail,
torture and killing center during the dictatorship. Two other women
were questioned last week in Bern, Switzerland.
	   According to EFE, the former inmates told Bagnasco that women
who had to give birth were chained to tables in the presence of
torturers, then their babies were taken away.
	   The Argentine government claims 9,000 people disappeared in the
dirty war, but some human rights groups put the figure at 30,000.
	   In 1990, Argentine President Carlos Menem pardoned high-ranking
officers imprisoned for human rights abuse in the dirty war,
including Videla and Massera.
	   Last month, Videla was arrested in Argentina on suspicion of
ordering the kidnapping of children born to parents killed during
the dictatorship. He was charged with falsifying identification
documents. It was unknown if he was charged with kidnapping.
	   Videla remains in custody. His arrest is under an investigation
by federal Judge Roberto Marquevich.
	   Videla also is wanted for questioning by National Spanish Court
Judge Baltasar Garzon, who has been investigating since 1996 the
disappearance of 600 Spaniards during Argentina's ``dirty war.''

Netanyahu accused of interfering in strategic sales to Iran trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES accusations, 3rd and 11th grafs, ADDS denial, 15th

 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An opposition legislator accused Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday of interfering in the trial of a
businessman convicted of selling chemical and biological weapons
components to Iran.
	   Netanyahu's office and a courts spokesman denied the accusation.
	   Nissim Zvili's accusations echoed charges made earlier by the
defense attorney for Nahum Manbar, who was convicted of treason in
a closed-doors trial last month of selling weapons materials to
Iran for dlrs 16 million.
	   The accusation seemed to suggest that Netanyahu - under pressure
from the United States - may have urged the judge to ensure
Manbar's conviction.
	   ``From information I have received from authoritative sources
very close to the trial of Nahum Manbar, the prime minister _ on
his own initiative _ held conversations with Judge Stroessnov that
had to do with the trial and with the accused, and in these
conversations the prime minister showed active involvement in the
judicial process,'' legislator Nissim Zvili said Monday in a
question submitted through the Knesset.
	   ``Did the content of the conversations deal with the substance
of the trial, with the connection between the offenses and the
severity of punishment required, and Israel's bilateral
relations?'' Zvili asked.
	   Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying that ``The prime
minister says he did not have any contact with Judge Stroessnov _
not even once _ since the beginning of the Manbar affair, neither
before the trial nor during the trial nor after the trial.''
	   Judge Amnon Stroessnov heads the three-judge panel in the Manbar
case.
	   After Manbar's conviction, Netanyahu said he had personally
ordered his arrest and hoped he would receive a long sentence. ``I
hope he will pay a heavy price for the terrible thing he has
done,'' Netanyahu said then.
	   At the time, Manbar's defense attorney, Amnon Zichroni, also
accused Netanyahu of interfering in the judicial process and said
the prime minister had taken ``advantage of his position in order
to violate the law.''
	   Zvili implied that Netanyahu was motivated by pressure from a
foreign country in intervening in the case. He refused to say which
foreign country. but Israeli newspapers reported last year that
U.S. officials had asked Netanyahu to stop Manbar's activities and
that the CIA provided information to Israel on Manbar's links with
Iran.
	   Manbar was barred from the United States in 1994, after the U.S.
State Department said he and two of his companies violated a U.S.
trade embargo against Iran.
	   Israel and Iran have been in a technical state of war since the
Islamic revolution there in 1979. Israel has warned that Iran is
close to completing a missile with capabilities of striking the
Jewish state and is advancing its nuclear program, while Iranian
leaders have regularly called for Israel's destruction.
	   Zvili, a prominent member of the opposition Labor party, said
that if Netanyahu did in fact interfere in the case, he will have
to resign.
	   The spokesman for the courts, Moshe Gorali, also said Zvili's
accusation was groundless and that Judge Stroessnov had not
discussed the case with the prime minister
	   Members of Netanyahu's Likud party accused the opposition of
trying to discredit the prime minister, even if it meant
overturning Manbar's conviction.
	   Israel's Supreme Court is to hear two petitions related to the
case on Tuesday. The court has issued a gag order barring
disclosure of information to the first petition. The second,
submitted by journalists, asks the court to lift the gag order.
	   Manbar's sentencing hearing is scheduled for Wednesday in Tel
Aviv District Court. He faces a possible life sentence.

Ecuador holds breath as it waits for vote results

reference to official results expected Wednesday. EDITS throughout

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Deprived of an undisputed victor in
presidential elections, Ecuadoreans waited anxiously Monday for
official results of a contest pitting a U.S.-educated politician
against a banana tycoon.
	   Both candidates in Sunday's race claimed victory and an exit
poll showed the race was too close to call. Official results were
not expected until Wednesday in the race between Harvard graduate
Jamil Mahuad, the centrist mayor of Quito, and businessman Alvaro
Noboa.
	   ``The panorama is not encouraging. We are caught in a deep
political, economic and moral crisis, and the vote did not give one
candidate a clear mandate,'' political analyst Antonio Rodriguez
said.
	   Mahuad had 51.3 percent support to 48.7 percent for Noboa in
Sunday's voting, according to an exit poll sponsored by seven
television stations. Mahuad's lead was within the margin of error,
however, making the race a statistical dead heat.
	   Noboa claimed victory and charged the vote was tainted by fraud.
	   Many Ecuadoreans have expressed disgust with politics, and had
hoped these elections would end their country's instability. The
vote was marked by apathy, however, because Ecuadoreans have voted
six times in the past two years _ only to still find the political
system in disarray.
	   Weary of politics, many stayed home to watch Brazil lose to
France in Sunday's World Cup soccer final. More than 30 percent of
registered voters did not cast a ballot, a record high in Ecuador
where voting is obligatory, and non-compliance can lead to a fine.
	   ``These results confirm the discontent among the large majority
with our political structures and our democracy itself,'' said an
editorial in the national newspaper Hoy.
	   Remembering street violence in past elections, army troops and
police surrounded the office of the elections board in Guayaquil,
Noboa's home town.
	   Noboa had called on his supporters to enter vote counting
stations to make sure officials did not rob him of the victory he
claims.
	   A brief stone-throwing battle erupted between supporters of the
two candidates outside the elections office, but it was quickly
dispersed with no one arrests or injuries. The streets of Ecuador's
major streets were largely quiet Monday, as neither candidate made
public appearances.
	   The winner will replace interim President Fabian Alarcon, ending
months of transitional government that began when Congress removed
eccentric former President Abdala Bucaram from power for ``mental
incapacity'' in February 1997 amid massive street protests.
	   Multiple claims to the presidency are not new in this Andean
nation of 12 million people. In the 48 hours of chaos that followed
Bucaram's ouster, three people simultaneously claimed to be
president. Congress named Alarcon to the job.
	   Mahuad won the support of voters impressed with his efficient
administration during his six-year stint as Quito's mayor. Noboa,
who ran the Central Bank during Bucaram's government, called
himself the candidate of the poor despite his wealth.

Schering resumes production of contraceptives after placebo mix-up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The Brazilian subsidiary of German
pharmaceutical giant Schering AG resumed producing birth control
pills on Monday for the first time since test placebos in company
packaging were stolen and sold as contraceptives.
	   Brazil banned production of Schering's Microvlar contraceptives
three weeks ago after at least 13 women who took placebos became
pregnant. The company said the placebos were intended solely to
test out new packaging equipment.
	   The fake pills, made of lactose and sugar, were supposed to have
been incinerated after the tests, but were stolen and sold
illegally. Some 650,000 packages, containing 21 pills each, were
manufactured. It is unclear how many packages were stolen and
distributed.
	   The company said the Health Ministry authorized the resumption
of production, but not the sale of the contraceptives which was
banned on June 25.
	   The company said it did not know why Microvlar sales were still
forbidden and the Health Ministry was not available for immediate
comment.
	   Schering also said the government had lifted its ban on the
distribution of 24 of 36 other medicines it produces, including
those used to treat leukemia, multiple sclerosis and prostate
cancer.
	   Rodolpho Valentini, a company spokesman said the government
lifted its July 3 distribution suspension because several products
were ``becoming scarce on the market.''
	   Distribution of the other 12 products remains in force because
no shortages have been detected.
	   Valentini said the company would appeal the 2.9 million real
(dlrs 2.5 million) fine the government ordered it to pay for taking
more than a month to notify health authorities that the phony
contraceptives had been stolen. The government also said the
packages of fake pills were not identified as such.

Syria agrees to open pipeline for Iraqi oil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria has agreed to reopen an oil
pipeline for Iraqi petroleum that it closed 16 years ago, Iraq's
oil minister said Monday.
	   The pipeline, which links Iraq's Kirkuk oil fields to the
Mediterranean terminals of Banias in Syria and Tripoli in Lebanon
will be operational ``within a few months,'' Amer Mohammed Rashid
said late Monday.
	   Any resumption of pumping through the pipeline would, however,
require U.N. approval.
	   Rashid said technical studies to repair the pipeline have
already started.
	   The pipeline has an estimated capacity of 650,000 barrels a day.
	   Rashid said the pipeline would first pump 300,000 barrels a day
on an experimental basis.
	   Syria closed the pipeline in 1982 in support of Iran during the
1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.
	   Rashid also said that Iraq and Syria are studying the
possibility of building a new pipeline with a capacity of 1.4
million barrels a day and a joint oil refinery in Banias.
	   The U.N. Security Council decided in February to allow Iraq to
boost the value of oil sales under the oil-for-food deal from dlrs
2 billion within six months to dlrs 5.2 billion.
	   The United Nations imposed sweeping economic sanctions against
Iraq following Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The oil-for-food
deal is an exemption to those sanctions.
	   Rashid also urged the resumption of full Iraqi-Syrian relations
which he said are ``more important than pumping oil.''

Netanyahu accused of interfering in strategic sales to Iran trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An opposition legislator accused Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday of interfering in the trial of a
businessman convicted of selling chemical and biological weapons
components to Iran.
	   Netanyahu's office and a courts spokesman denied the accusation.
	   Nissim Zvili's accusations echoed accusations made earlier by
the defense attorney for Nahum Manbar, who was convicted of treason
in a closed-door trial last month of selling weapons materials to
Iran for dlrs 16 million.
	   The accusation seemed to suggest that Netanyahu _ under pressure

	   ``From information I have received from authoritative sources

	   Earlier, Manbar's defense attorney Amnon Zichroni also accused

Pak's goal: friends before funds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSTY MILLER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYLVANIA, Ohio (AP) _ A winner of two majors and coming off a
record performance, LPGA rookie Se Ri Pak aspires to have the
demeanor _ not the bank accounts _ of the greatest women golfers.
	   At a time when superstars strike mega endorsement deals and
construct barriers between themselves and the public, Pak simply
wants to make friends.
	   ``The people here are really, really nice and that makes me play
better,'' the 20-year-old South Korean said after running away with
Sunday's Jamie Farr Kroger Classic by nine strokes. ``I am not an
American, but they feel really, really close. They feel like
friends. They make big loud.''
	   For Pak, in the early stages of learning English, a ``big loud''
is the roar of the gallery after a birdie. It is a sound she heard
again and again at Highland Meadows Golf Club.
	   Her 261 total was the fewest strokes ever taken in a 72-hole
LPGA event. She became the third player to finish 23-under on the
tour. She also became the third player to follow a victory in the
U.S. Women's Open with a win in her next tournament.
	   Pak captured the Open in a 20-hole playoff just four days before
shooting a 61 in Friday's second round of the Farr _ the lowest
score ever in an LPGA event. She followed with a 63 for the lowest
back-to-back scores in tour history.
	   In the LPGA's 48 years and hundreds of tournaments, only three
players have ever had as many as 10 birdies in a round. Pak did it
twice in two days.
	   But it isn't records that interest her. She said she wants to
succeed over the long haul, but also wants to be seen as a
substantial and thoughtful person.
	   ``I want to be Nancy Lopez, Betsy King,'' she said, referring to
two Hall of Famers known as much for their fan-friendly attitude as
their many victories.
	   ``They are the best players, but really nice to people. If they
play good or not, they are nice to people. Like friends. They can
do many things to help people.''
	   As she spoke after Sunday's trophy presentation, Pak cuddled her
10-week-old beagle puppy named Happy. The dog, bought in Orlando,
Fla., cost dlrs 300.
	   Pak can afford it. Even though she has only three top-10
finishes on the tour this year, all three are wins and she now
leads the money list with dlrs 645,170 in earnings.
	   Huge galleries followed her during the final three rounds of the
Farr, including dozens of Koreans who might not have otherwise been
there.
	   Her sudden arrival has been likened to the advent of Tiger Woods
on the PGA Tour, whose rapid success brought millions of new and
younger fans to the sport.
	   One sign at Highland Meadows, in both English and Korean, said,
``Tiger Out. Pak In.''
	   But Pak said she isn't ready to face the immense expectations
Woods encountered.
	   ``A top player plays good and _ whoom! _ people think they
always play very high,'' she said. ``Many media make me feel I must
do my best golf. Many newspapers print my picture. I can feel it,

Nicklaus plans to retire in 2000

<TEXT>
	   CHESTER, England (AP) _ Jack Nicklaus, winner of 18 major
tournaments, plans to retire from the PGA Tour after playing all
four majors in the year 2000.
	   ``Then that will be the end of my playing golf, period,'' the
58-year-old great said Monday. ``We've all got to stop some time,
and I don't think it's any big deal.
	   ``I'm fairly much in touch with what's realistic and if I say
I'm going to stay out there and keep competing, then that would be
rather silly. I'll still play some senior golf, but I'm not going
to compete against the kids.''
	   Nicklaus said last week that his ailing left hip would prevent
him from playing in this week's British Open at Royal Birkdale,
ending his streak of consecutive majors at 154. This will be the
first British Open he has missed since 1962.
	   ``I don't want to go out there and have people see just a part
of Jack Nicklaus,'' he said. ``I have tried to give them the best I
could give them.
	   ``I know I can't give them the Jack Nicklaus of 35, but I'd like
to give them the best I can give them of the Jack Nicklaus of 58. I
think the Jack Nicklaus of 58 could probably still play decently.
	   ``I'm not retiring and I'll still play in the Open championships
to come and I could play next year at Carnoustie, although the
chances are I probably won't,'' Nicklaus said.
	   He said he hopes to play in the British Open in 2000 at St.
Andrews.
	   Nicklaus was in Chester to unveil a course he designed with his
son, Steve, at Carden Park. He marked the opening of the 7,010-yard
(6,379-meter), par-72 course by playing a round with Ian Woosnam.
	   Nicklaus explained his decision as a matter of timing, saying,
``I thought it was the right time to get it done.''
	   He finished sixth, 12 strokes behind in the Senior Players
Championship won by Gil Morgan on Sunday. Before the tournament, he
said he planned to play in the U.S. Senior Open on July 23-26 in
Los Angeles and probably won't play any more this year after that.
	   Nicklaus said he planned to end the streak of majors in April at
his 40th consecutive Masters, where got within two strokes of the
lead with a Sunday charge before finishing tied for sixth.
	   He then accepted a special exemption to play in his 42nd
consecutive U.S. Open, where he tied for 43rd.
	   Nicklaus is one of only four players to win the career Grand
Slam, but only he has won all four majors more than once:
	   _a record six Masters, 23 years between the first and the last.
	   _four U.S. Opens, sharing the record with Ben Hogan, Bobby Jones
and Willie Anderson.
	   _three British Opens, along with a record seven runner-up
finishes.
	   _five PGA championships; only Walter Hagen, who played in the
match-play era, won that many.

Cowboys sign No. 1 pick Ellis; cut Sherman Williams
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENNE H. FREEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   IRVING, Texas (AP) _ The Dallas Cowboys signed their top draft
pick, gave tight end Eric Bjornson a two-year contract, and cut
running back Sherman Williams on Monday in transactions before the
start of training camp.
	   Defensive end Greg Ellis of North Carolina, the No. 8 pick in
the National Football League draft, signed a six-year, dlrs 11.5
million contract that included a dlrs 5.4 million signing bonus.
	   Ellis is already slotted as a starter after veteran Tony Tolbert
was cut because of bad knees.
	   ``It was important to get Greg into camp the very first day,''
said owner Jerry Jones. ``He needs time to get entrenched.''
	   Ellis ordered his agent, Butch Williams, to get the contract
done by the time camp starts on Wednesday in Wichita Falls.
	   ``Greg took away all my leverage,'' Williams said. ``But we're
happy with the contract.''
	   Ellis said, ``I'll be working with the first unit right away and
I needed to be there when camp opened. I'm a rookie in a new system
I know nothing about in a new league.''
	   Bjornson signed a two-year deal for dlrs 1.2 million which
included a bonus of dlrs 368,000. He will count dlrs 400,000
against the Cowboys salary cap this year.
	   Williams, a second-round draft pick in 1995 out of Alabama,
became expendable when the Cowboys signed free agent Chris Warren,
who played with Seattle. Williams rushed 121 times for 468 yards
and scored two touchdowns last year.
	   ``We are happy with where we are at running back with Emmitt
(Smith) and Chris Warren,'' Jones said.
	   The Cowboys also released free agent cornerback Ron Bailey of
Georgia.
	   Still without contracts were second-round tackle Flozell Adams
and fifth-round linebacker Darren Hambrick.
	   Dallas failed to invite to camp return specialist Herschel
Walker and special teams star Bill Bates, who has played for the
Cowboys for 15 years.

Mexican stocks, peso end higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican stocks closed higher Monday as
investors reacted positively to the resignation of Japan's prime
minister and to Russia's aid agreement with the International
Monetary Fund.
	   The key IPC index closed up 1.3 percent, or 58.50 points, at
4,625.38 points. At the end of 1997, the IPC stood at 5,229.35.
	   A volume of 47.4 million shares was traded, worth 1.05 billion
pesos, compared to Friday's volume of 47.8 million shares, worth
929.1 million pesos.
	   Under a financial aid agreement reached over the weekend, Russia
is expected to receive dlrs 14.8 billion in aid in 1998 and dlrs
22.6 billion overall in 1998-1999.
	   And on Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
resigned after the ruling party suffered a major setback in
Sunday's elections.
	   The peso also closed stronger in the wake of the stock market's
performance.
	   On 48-hour spot markets, banking leader Banamex quoted the peso
closing at a midrate of 8.893 to the dollar, stronger from both its
open of 8.904 and its close of 8.927 Friday.
	   In futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the
September contract ended at 9.1533 after closing Friday at 9.1975.
The December contract moved to 9.5420 from 9.5992; March 1999 moved
to 9.9305 from 10; June 1999 moved to 10.3413 from 10.4167 and
September 1999 moved to 10.7875 from 10.929.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged
representatives attending a Rome conference to reach consensus on
creating a strong and independent permanent international criminal
court, a U.N. spokesman said Monday.
	   Annan called for nations to harmonize their national positions
``in favor of the interest of common objectives.''
	   Negotiators from over 150 countries have been attending a
conference in Rome since June 15 to try to create the court that
would try war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The
conference is set to end Friday.
	   A draft treaty presented last Friday would grant the prosecutor
sweeping authority, a measure vigorously opposed by the United
States.
	   Annan sent a letter to about 10 governments Saturday urging they
reach consensus on the treaty by Friday, said U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard. He wouldn't identify the countries.

NationsBank earnings jump 53 percent, First Chicago up 8 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock prices &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NationsBank Corp. reported a 53 percent increase in
second-quarter earnings Monday, citing loan growth and improved
investment banking and brokerage revenue.
	   Meanwhile, First Chicago NBD Corp. reported its second-quarter
profits rose 8 percent as income from bank fees offset declines in
loan income.
	   Both big banking companies, which are each involved in separate
merger pacts, beat Wall Street expectations for earnings in the
April-June period.
 &UR; NationsBank Corp.
	   The huge Charlotte, North Carolina-based banking concern which
is merging with BankAmerica Corp. earned dlrs 1.41 billion, or dlrs
1.43 per diluted share, for the three months ending June 30,
compared with dlrs 919 million, or 97 cents a share, a year ago.
	   The latest earnings included a pre-tax gain of dlrs 430 million
related to the sale of 67 banking offices arising from its merger
with Florida-based Barnett Banks.
	   Operating earnings for the quarter totaled dlrs 1.13 billion, or
dlrs 1.18 per share. That beat the dlrs 1.14 a share average
anticipated by analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. But
NationsBank shares fell 18 3/4 cents to close at dlrs 87 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
	   ``NationsBank's core operating performance trends continue to be
quite positive,'' said Chief Executive Hugh McColl Jr. ``We are
particularly pleased with the growth in our fee-based businesses.''
	   For the first half, net income rose to dlrs 1.90 billion, or
dlrs 1.99 per share, up from dlrs 1.77 billion, or dlrs 1.87 per
share a year earlier.
	   NationsBank and San Francisco-based BankAmerica announced in
April a dlrs 62 billion merger pact that will create a
coast-to-coast banking company with dlrs 570 billion in assets. The
merger is set to be completed later this year.
	   McColl is to head the new company that will use the BankAmerica
name.
 &UR; First Chicago NBD Corp.
	   Chicago-based First Chicago earned dlrs 408 million, or dlrs
1.38 a diluted share, in the quarter compared with dlrs 378
million, or dlrs 1.20 a share, a year earlier.
	   The earnings beat Wall Street expectations of dlrs 1.34 a share,
according to a survey of analysts by First Call Corp. First
Chicago's stock rose 18 3/4 cents to close at dlrs 95.12 1/2 on the
NYSE.
	   The bank holding company with operations mainly in Illinois,
Indiana and Michigan agreed in April to be purchased by Banc One
Corp. for dlrs 27 billion pending approval by regulators and
shareholders.
	   Net interest income fell 5.6 percent to dlrs 898 million while
noninterest income rose 31 percent to dlrs 842 million as credit
card fee revenue rose 13 percent. Income received from service
charges and commissions rose 25 percent to dlrs 283 million.
	   The bank reported its provision for credit losses rose, mainly
on charge-offs related to losses in Asia, rose to dlrs 2.06 million
from dlrs 180 million a year earlier.
	   For the first half of the year, First Chicago reported net
income of dlrs 791 million, or dlrs 2.68 a diluted share, compared
to dlrs 758 million, or dlrs 2.37 a diluted share, a year earlier.

A day of compromise and self-doubt for Orange Order marchers

 &UR; EDS: Trimble visits boys' mother, graf 6, fixes second reference to
Trimble to comply. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant Orangemen shied from
confrontation Monday in marches across Northern Ireland, weighed
down by their own bitter divisions and subdued by the shock of
three children killed the night before.
	   At one big Orange gathering, scuffles broke out between those
who insisted that a blocked march must go through a Catholic
neighborhood, and those who wanted the protest called off.
	   ``Certainly even (among) those who were watching, there was a
deep sadness,'' said Jim Rodgers, a Belfast Orangeman. ``You
probably didn't see many smiling Orangemen.''
	   Catholics who had protested against a few marches also pulled
back. At one flashpoint in Belfast, they stood at the side of the
road, holding black flags, while Orangemen walked by to the muffled
beat of a single drum.
	   At hundreds of marches, Orangemen paused for silence in respect
for the three young Quinn brothers killed early Sunday by a
firebomb in Ballymoney, 40 miles (60 kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   David Trimble, newly elected first minister of the
cross-community British Assembly, visited Chrissie Quinn, mother of
the dead boys, and her only surviving son, Lee, to express his
condolences and asure them that everything possible was being done
to find the killers.
	   Police were questioning two men arrested Monday in connection
with attack.
	   The firebombing was the worst of 130 attacks on homes in a week
of violence by Protestant hard-liners protesting because an Orange
parade in Portadown was stopped from passing through a Catholic
neighborhood. Hundreds of police and British soldiers have
maintained the blockade and Prime Minister Tony Blair has insisted
that the law will be enforced.
	   Several hundred Orangemen from the Portadown area marched around
the pasture near the Anglican church at Drumcree, where the march
was stopped. On Sunday, the Portadown lodges rejected calls from
political and religious leaders to call off their protest, though
they did move to scale down the size of the crowds which grew to
more than 20,000 last week.
	   ``We don't expect 1,400 men (the local membership) to stay here,
but the protest will continue until we can walk our traditional
route,'' said Gareth Watson, the chief steward at Drumcree. He said
any efforts would be ``peaceful and dignified.''
	   At Pomeroy, members of the hard-line Spirit of Drumcree movement
shouted ``traitor'' at the Rev. William Bingham, chaplain of the
County Armagh Orange lodges, who had called for an end to the
protests on Sunday.
	   Scuffles broke out in front of the platform. Spirit of Drumcree
leader Joel Patton denounced Bingham as the man who ``stabbed the
men in Portadown, stabbed them in the back when they were at their
most need.''
	   Denis Watson, Orange grandmaster in County Armagh, called on the
order to ``pledge ourselves to resolving this parades issue for
once and for all,'' to be ``constructive and resourceful'' without
compromising their principles. ``And for the world outside, our
principles are not negotiable,'' Watson said.
	   At the biggest Orange gathering, in Belfast, Orange Order
Grandmaster Robert Saulters warned of dangerous divisions among
pro-British unionists _ who split about evenly in last month's
referendum for and against an agreement to create a Northern
Ireland government in which Catholics and Protestants will share
power.
	   First minister Trimble, is an Orangeman, and so are several
lawmakers from Trimble's party who oppose the agreement.

Brazil ratifies nuclear arms ban treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso signed treaties Monday banning nuclear tests and
proliferation of nuclear weapons.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, in a campaign to halt nuclear
proliferation, praised the move. and called on the U.S. Senate to
``expeditiously'' approve the same treaty.
	   ``We do not want nuclear bombs,'' Cardoso said during a ceremony
attended by the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is on an
official visit in Brazil. ``Brazil will not spare efforts so that
the world be freed of nuclear weapons.''
	   The ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty came weeks after a series of
nuclear tests conducted by nieghboring rivals India and Pakistan.
Brazil is among the few countries with technlogical capacity to
built atomic bombs.
	   Clinton, in remarks released by the White House, said Cardoso's
decision renewed momentum for international efforts to halt the
spread of nuclear weapons and promote disarmament around the world.
	   ``At a time when actions by India and Pakistan threaten a
nuclear competition in South Asia, Brazil has chosen a different
course to invest in its people, not in a costly arms race'', he
said.
	   Annan called the Brazilian move ``a gift for future generations
that should be followed by other nations''.
	   The treaty has been signed by 149 nations.

Canadian dollar sets yet another record low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (CP) _ The sagging Canadian dollar slid to a new record
low Monday, closing at 67.60 U.S. cents.
	   Analysts warned that so long as turmoil continues in Asia,
driving nervous money traders towards the stability of the American
greenback, the Canadian dollar will continue to fall. 
	   The Canadian dolar sank as far as 67.49 cents US _ an new
intraday trading low _ early Monday morning, dragged down in
overseas trading by the weakening yen, further beset by the
weekend's disastrous election setback for the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party.
	   Expect the volatility to continue, warned Jeff Cheah, an
economist with Standard and Poor's MMS in Toronto.
	   ``I don't see any change in the immediate future, even if (the
dollar) improves, I just see very modest improvement,'' said Cheah.
``But I don't see it breaking out of this very bearish range.''
	   The Canadian dollar has been on a steady downward slide in
recent weeks. Despite a solid economic recovery in Canada, it has
suffered in comparison with the extremely strong U.S. dollar.
	   The Canadian currency has also been wounded by the falling
demand and price for this country's natural resources, especially
because of the financial crisis sweeping across much of Asia.

	   Some of the major reforms sought, promised or begun to reverse
Japan's economic failures, which brought down the government of
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto:
	   BANKING _ With Japanese banks burdened with dlrs 546 billion in
bad loans, even healthy companies have trouble coaxing them to lend
for investment that could lead to more production, jobs and
earnings. The banks' ills also hurt Japan's efforts to pull out of
a recession by choking confidence in the economy.
	   The government intends to set up a ``bridge bank'' that will
close troubled lenders while providing loans to companies dependent
on bank financing.
	   Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party, which still controls the
more powerful lower house of Parliament, hopes to have the needed
laws enacted by September.
	   ___
	   TAXES _ Daunted by the recession and worries of bankruptcies and
job losses, Japanese consumers have tightened their purse strings
just when economists say more spending is needed to lift the
economy.
	   In hopes that a permanent tax cut will encourage people to buy
more, Hashimoto recently promised this would be done next year. His
party has yet to decide specific amounts and details, but officials
said Monday the plan will proceed without him. Opposition parties
also favor tax cuts.
	   ___
	   STIMULUS MEASURES _ Japan still hopes that a dlrs 115 billion
spending and temporary tax cut package adopted early this year will
help lift the economy. It includes added spending on public
projects such as construction, information and welfare, and an
average saving to taxpayers of dlrs 225 this year and next.
	   ___
	   OPENING MARKETS: Japan has begun what it calls a ``big bang''
opening of its financial markets to new companies hoping to get a
piece of the nation's dlrs 9 trillion pool of individual savings.
Foreign brokerages have been expanding rapidly. The measures are
aimed at making Japanese financial institutions more efficient,
competitive and on a par with those in New York and London by 2001.
	   ___
	   DEREGULATION: The United States insists that unnecessary
regulations restrain Japan's economic growth, raise the cost of
doing business and lower the standard of living. Japan's trading
partners also say the nation's barriers to foreign products keep
prices artificially high.
	   Japan has promised in general terms to buy more abroad and not
rely so heavily on foreign sales to lift its economy. Such demands
are the subject of a continuing series of negotiations. The
bureaucrats who enforce the regulations often resist change.

World Cup: Brazil mourns World Cup loss and asks, what happened to
</HEADLINE>
Ronaldo?
 &UR; Eds: Stands as writethru to Sports-Soccer-World Cup-Brazil's Agony;
UPDATES with background &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL ASTOR
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A day after their worst World Cup
loss, one question was on the lips of all Brazilians Monday: What
happened to Ronaldo?
	   And the more explanations offered for what happened to their
star forward, two-time FIFA player of the year, the more questions
arose.
	   ``It's clear that something happened that we don't know about.
And even if they told me what it was, it would be unethical for me
to say it here,'' Romario, the 1994 World Cup star cut from this
year's team at the last minute, told Globo News.
	   ``What happened to Brazil?'' might have been a better question
after the No. 1 ranked team suffered a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of
underdog France.
	   ``What happened yesterday was something we weren't expecting,''
Romario said. ``Everyone was prepared to celebrate our fifth World
Cup victory. But unfortunately this didn't happen and that's part
of soccer also.''
	   Brazilians had gone into the final with so much of a feeling
they had already won that overconfident seemed like understatement.
The country prepared parades for the victory celebrations. The
match seemed like a mere formality.
	   But on Sunday, the bad omens seemed to pour down even faster
than French goals.
	   Cold and rain thinned the crowd expected 1-million-strong on
Copacabana beach to only a few hundred people. They stood before a
large screen television set up by the mayor's office in
anticipation of party that was supposed to run all night.
	   Instead, the disbelieving crowd stayed after the game, their
eyes glued to the screen waiting for some kind of explanation.
	   Young girls wearing yellow and green face paint hugged each
other with tears in their eyes.
	   Some in the crowd claimed not to be bothered by the loss, but
their expressions said otherwise. Some tried to samba and celebrate
anyway, but it was apparent their hearts were not in it.
	   The next morning a banner headline on Rio de Janeiro sports
daily Jornal dos Esportes said it best: ``The worst day of our
lives.''
	   ``We were robbed, that's what they're saying in my
neighborhood,'' Zulmira Barbosa de Sousa, 37, said. ``How else
could France have won?''
	   Searching for an answer, everyone seemed to look to Ronaldo, the
star striker who had been mysteriously sidelined shortly before the
game only to reappear as starter minutes later.
	   There were rumors team sponsor Nike had pressured Zagallo to
keep Ronaldo in the game despite health problems. Nike denied the
rumors, but there was still no clear explanation of why he wasn't
on the first list of starters.
	   A statement by FIFA, the sports governing body, said that
Ronaldo had gone to the hospital for X-rays on his left ankle and
doctors had cleared him to play just before the game.
	   But on Monday, team doctor Lidio Toledo contradicted FIFA
telling Globo News Ronaldo had suffered a 30 to 40 second fit of
convulsions at around 3 p.m. and was submitted to a battery of
neurological tests and an electrocardiogram before he was cleared
to play.
	   ``I woke up then and my whole body was in pain. But with time
the pain got better and I relaxed a bit,'' Ronaldo told Globo
television. ``It was a tremendous scare. We lost the World Cup but
I won another cup - my life.''
	   Ronaldo didn't blame his failing health for the loss, though.
	   ``I don't want to find any excuses for the defeat. They played
well. The two goals from corners were clearly our mistakes, but
they played better than us,'' he said.
	   Still, many here wondered why he was kept on the field even when
he didn't appear to be up to par.
	   ``What surprised me most is that he went on to play even in the
second half,'' said soccer-legend Pele, a guest commentator on
Globo.

Fit of convulsions affected Ronaldo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Ronaldo suffered a 30 to 40
seconds fit of convulsions just hours before the game with France
on Sunday, the Brazilian team's doctor Lidio Toledo told Brazilian
reporters in Paris Monday.
	   ``I took him to the hospital and asked for a thorough test, like
electro-sonography and electro-cardiogram'', Toledo said. He had an
``emotional stress,'' Toledo said.
	   The 21-year old player whose poor performance was among the
reasons for his team loss 3-0 to France was shown on a TV Globo
News report saying that after the fit he went to sleep and ``woke
up with pains all over my body.''
	   ``It was something real bad that I had never before felt in my
whole life. I really felt bad. I had a headache, my stomach
pained'', the player said earlier in an interview with the Rio de
Janeiro newspaper O Globo.
	   But he said that after a while he felt normal again and thought
he could play.
	   Coach Zagallo confirmed that Ronaldo came in the stadium before
the game kicked off and asked to play.
	   Pele said in a television talk show late Sunday that it Ronaldo
should have not played. ``What surprised me most is that he went on
to play even in the second half.''

Former junior lightweight champ getting back into ring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Former IBF junior lightweight
champion Arturo Gatti, whose face-first style earns him almost as
many fans as it does stitches, said a recent loss won't make him
change his style.
	   Gatti, 26, of Jersey City, will take on Ivan Robinson in a
10-round non-title lightweight fight Aug. 22 at Convention Hall.
Also on the card is unbeaten middleweight Fernando Vargas, who will
face Jose Rivera in a 10-round bout.
	   Gatti, who always takes a beating but rarely loses, hasn't
fought since Jan. 18, when Angel Manfredy stopped him in the eighth
round of their scheduled 12-rounder.
	   In that fight, he rallied from a third-round knockdown and was
leading on two judges' cards when the fight was stopped because of
a cut over his eye.
	   Gatti (29-2) said Monday he had no regrets. He'll fight the same
way against Robinson, 27, who is 25-2 with 10 knockouts.
	   ``I'm not going to change it now. I feel comfortable with it.
They tell me to box more, to move my head more. But I'm in trouble
a lot of the time, so I have to fight to win. I can't do that,''
Gatti said.

Frenchman wins San Francisco Marathon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Hamid Oubadriss of France won the hilly San
Francisco Marathon, but his time was way off the course record and
his own best.
	   ``It was a hard race,'' he said of the 26.2-mile (41.9-km) trek
through the streets of San Francisco. ``Twenty-six miles with hills
makes it a difficult course. I hate to race on hills.''
	   Oubadriss was timed in 2 hours, 23 minutes, 54 seconds, far off
the course record of 2:17:34, set four years ago by Kenyan Patrick
Muturi. His best marathon time is 2:14.
	   Kenya's Salina Chirchir won the women's division. Her time of
2:45:36 was five minutes slower than the record set by Russian
Tatiana Titova in 1993.

Treasurer: Japanese developments don't bode well for New Zealand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The political instability in
Japan with the resignation of prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto does
not bode well for New Zealand, Treasurer Winston Peters said
Tuesday.
	   Hashimoto announced his resignation Monday after accepting
personal responsibility for the Liberal Democratic Party's crushing
defeat in Japan's upper house election.
	   Markets have reacted negatively to the election result because
of uncertainty about whether economic reforms promised by Hashimoto
in Japan would go ahead under a new leader.
	   Peters was negative about the impact on New Zealand.
	   ``It doesn't bode well for us because I think there were some
that were hoping that, without probably any sound evidence for it,
that things would improve at this election,'' he said on National
Radio.
	   ``It means that they are going to have to live through many more
months where the Japanese and other Asian economies will not be
performing in terms of trading partners for this country in the way
that we would have hoped that they would have in a recovery mode.''
	   Peters said the developments in Japan underscored the need for
the deferred spending announced recently by the New Zealand
government.
	   The government is to cut another U.S. dlrs 150 million (300
million NZ dollars) off the U.S. dlrs 2.5 billion (5 billion NZ
dollars) three-year spending program, on top of the U.S. dlrs 150
million (300 million NZ dollars) already sliced off in the May
budget.
	   Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said New Zealand had to hope the
new prime minister in Japan will understand the importance of its
reforms to countries like New Zealand which were heavily influenced
by what was happening to the yen.
	   She said the tax, banking and economic reforms promised in Japan
were all part of the LPD's program and ``it's very important for
New Zealand and for the Asian Pacific economies that that occur.''

Japan expresses support for IMF bailout plan for Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with signing of dlrs 800 million loan to Russia in 2nd
graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told visiting
Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko that Japan supports an
International Monetary Fund bailout for Russia's ailing economy.
	   Earlier Monday, the two countries signed an agreement for a dlrs
800 million loan to Russia from the Export-Import Bank of Japan,
part of a dlrs 1.5 billion untied loan that Japan had promised.
	   Hashimoto said he told Kiriyenko that Japan ``supported the
IMF's efforts to help stabilize the Russian economy.''
	   The IMF tentatively agreed Monday to offer Russia a huge bailout
package to shore up its faltering financial markets and provide a
desperately needed infusion of cash.
	   Details were not immediately released, but Russia had been
seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion.
	   Kiriyenko arrived in Tokyo on Monday to discuss economic
cooperation with Japan as a way of bolstering growth.
	   But the timing of the visit could not be worse as Japanese Prime
Ryutaro Hashimoto announced his resignation shortly before their
meeting.
	   Hashimoto resigned to take responsibility for a major electoral
defeat for his governing Liberal Democratic Party in Sunday's
elections for Parliament's upper house.
	   Kiriyenko told reporters that Russia's ties with Japan would not
be affected by Hashimoto's resignation.
	   ``I am disappointed that Prime Minister Hashimoto is stepping
down. I salute him on his efforts to further Russian-Japan
relations,'' Kiriyenko said.
	   Hashimoto and Kiriyenko also agreed Monday to set up a joint
investment facility to help the Russian economy, Hashimoto said.
Kiriyenko was the first Russian premier to visit Japan.
	   Hashimoto, with strong personal ties to Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, had been a key driving force behind the increasingly
friendly atmosphere between the two countries, which have never
signed a peace treaty ending World War II.
	   Japanese Foreign Ministry officials were afraid that Hashimoto's
resignation could send a chill through relations between the two
countries.
	   ``I do not wish Japanese-Russian relations, which are finally
beginning to improve, to move backward,'' Hashimoto said at the
news conference earlier in the day where he announced he was
stepping down.
	   ``Such a thing should not happen. Regardless of my resignation,
we must push forward relations between Japan and Russia,'' he said.
	   Kiriyenko also met Monday with Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi,
considered a possible successor to Hashimoto.
	   On Tuesday, Kiriyenko was to deliver a speech to a Japanese
business group before leaving for China.

US manages presidential statement on Israel, not resolution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States appeared Monday to have
scored a diplomatic victory by heading off a Security Council
resolution that would have condemned Israel for trying to expand
Jerusalem's boundaries.
	   The 15-member council was expected to convene later Monday to
adopt a draft presidential statement that calls Israel's June 21
decision ``a serious and damaging development.''
	   A U.S. official said the statement was the best option the
United States had.
	   An Arab-sponsored resolution would have condemned Israel for the
move and demanded it be rescinded. The measure was softened to a
presidential statement after repeated U.S. objections and intense,
high-level negotiations between Washington and Arab capitals, said
the U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Such a statement doesn't carry the weight of international law
that a resolution does and is adopted by consensus.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson has said the United States
regretted Israel's decision to extend Jerusalem's boundaries to
include several towns and expand some municipal services from
Jerusalem to West Bank settlements. However, a U.N. resolution
condemning the move would inflame passions and hinder U.S.
diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled Middle East peace process,
he has said.
	   Washington could have vetoed a resolution, but doing so is
considered a diplomatic setback because it would have implied that
Washington couldn't negotiate a compromise.
	   The draft statement said it supported U.S. efforts at breaking
the deadlock.
	   It noted that both the Palestinians and Israel agreed in
previous peace accords that permanent status negotiations would
cover the issue of Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the
capital of a future state.
	   ``The council therefore calls upon the parties to avoid actions
which might prejudice the outcome of these negotiations,'' the
draft said.
	   Israeli's U.N. ambassador, Dore Gold, said the council should
never have taken up the issue, which he has called a municipal one
that had no place before the council.
	   ``From 1948 to 1967, the U.N. Security Council never met once to
consider the destruction of 58 synagogues in the Old City of
Jerusalem, the expulsion of its Jewish inhabitants and the denial
of Jewish access to the Western Wall,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
	   He said the statement actually ``contravenes the Oslo peace
agreements, which provide that Jerusalem remains under exclusive
Israeli jurisdiction while being an issue for permanent status
negotiations.''
	   Israel maintains that as a municipal decision, the June 21 move
is preserving and protecting the city _ not altering it _ and is
acting in accordance with the Oslo agreements.
	   Israeli diplomats, speaking on condition that they not be
identified, said Israel recognized that the Palestinians didn't
reach their original goal by passing a resolution. They emphasized
that what was important was for both sides to get on with permanent
status negotiations.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's resignation has
set off a scramble for a successor, delaying the quick action
needed to pull the world's second-largest economy out of a
recession. Top candidates include Keizo Obuchi, Japan's foreign
minister, and former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama. But
neither is an economic specialist, and uncertainty over Japan's
political turmoil was reflected in the markets, which fluctuated
dramatically Monday. Hashimoto decided to step down after his
ruling Liberal Democratic Party was humiliated in Sunday's
parliamentary elections. The party won just 44 of the 126 seats
contested in the upper house of Parliament, losing 17 seats in all.
(JAPAN-ELECTION)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant Orangemen shied away
from confrontation in marches across Northern Ireland, weighed down
by their own bitter divisions and subdued by the bombing deaths of
three young Catholic boys. At one big Orange gathering Monday,
scuffles broke out between those who insisted that a march must go
through a Catholic neighborhood, and those who wanted the protest
called off. ``Certainly even (among) those who were watching, there
was a deep sadness,'' said Jim Rodgers, a Belfast Orangeman. ``You
probably didn't see many smiling Orangemen.'' Catholic protesters
also pulled back. The boys were to be buried on Tuesday. (NORTHERN
IRELAND)
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Deprived of an undisputed victor in
presidential elections, Ecuadoreans waited anxiously Monday for
official results of a contest pitting a U.S.-educated politician
against a banana tycoon. Both candidates in Sunday's race claimed
victory and an exit poll showed the race was too close to call.
Official results were not expected until Wednesday in the race
between Harvard graduate Jamil Mahuad, the centrist mayor of Quito;
and businessman Alvaro Noboa. Mahuad had 51.3 percent support,
compared to 48.7 percent for Noboa in Sunday's voting, according to
an exit poll sponsored by seven television stations. The margin of
error was plus or minus 1.6 percentage points. Noboa claimed
victory and charged the vote was tainted by fraud.
(ECUADOR-ELECTION)
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels armed with guns and machetes
threw petrol bombs and hacked to death 34 people who were watching
the final game of the World Cup on television at a roadside lodge,
witnesses said Monday. Soldiers later helped residents of Tare, 35
kilometers (20 miles), on the main road north of Kigali, to clear
out the charred remains of victims who were slaughtered when a
group of rebels attacked the lodge at 8 p.m. local time (1800 GMT)
Sunday. Carbonized bodies _ some shot and other hacked up _ were
buried immediately in a hastily dug mass grave. One of the victims
was a child who lay on a blood-stained mattress with his throat
slit. No motive was immediately clear, but attempts to destabilize
the government have been behind similar attacks. (RWANDA-VIOLENCE)
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Life began returning to normal in the
commercial hub of Lagos, where schools and office buildings
reopened Monday after days of rioting and chaos last week following
the death of Nigeria's most prominent political prisoner. At least
55 people were killed and more than 400 were arrested when violence
overtook Lagos and the southern cities of Ibadan and Abeokuta
following the death of Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of
canceled 1993 presidential elections. In Lagos, riot police patrols
continued Monday to discourage new bouts of violence. Abiola died
of an apparent heart attack while he was still in custody. He died
while meeting with visiting U.S. officials just days before he was
reportedly to be release. His death unleashed angry protests and
underscored Nigeria's fractious ethnic divisions. (NIGERIA)

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK _ Technology shares posted more record-setting gains
Monday, but most stocks fell amid fears that Japanese recovery
efforts may be derailed by a government shakeup following Sunday's
elections. The Dow Jones industrial average finished about 9 points
lower at 9,096 after meandering through the lackluster session.
Most broad-market indicators also posted slim losses, but the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose to a record high for
the fourth straight session despite late Friday's profit warning by
Applied Materials. Most Asian markets slumped Monday after Sunday's
anemic showing by Japan's Liberal Democratic Party and the ensuing
resignation of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. But Japanese
stocks rebounded from an early slide, rising 1.7 percent amid hopes
the new LDP government will proceed with economic reforms
considered pivotal to recovery efforts throughout Southeast Asia.
(US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   MOSCOW _ Russia got what it wanted Monday from international
lenders, who agreed to a two-year financial bailout valued at dlrs
22.6 billion, including 17.1 billion in new loans. The deal is
considered necessary to stave off the devaluation of the ruble,
restore the confidence of foreign investors and let the government
begin paying its many debts, including billions of rubles (dollars)
owed to unpaid workers. The money is to come from three sources:
the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Japanese
government. The money could begin to flow into the Russian economy
as early as next week, after the IMF board of directors meets in
Washington on Monday to consider the deal. However, the loans are
apparently contingent on passage of an austere economic
stabilization plan in the Russian parliament. With the lower house
of parliament dominated by communists who strongly oppose the
government's economic program, passage is far from guaranteed.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   TOKYO _ Asian countries depending on Japan to help mend their
shattered economies fretted Monday that the country's political
turmoil could prolong the region's woes. The crumbling of Japanese
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's government Monday came amid more
bad economic news from Japan's neighbors: Malaysia said for the
first time that its economy will shrink this year, and a top
economist predicted the same for Hong Kong. Other nations said that
stability in Japan, the region's No. 1 economy, is key to recovery.
The U.S. government also hopes a newly formed government in Tokyo
will take quick action on economic reforms, President Bill
Clinton's spokesman said Monday. (JAPAN-ELECTIONS-REACTION)
	   NEW YORK _ The millennium dawned early and without serious
incident in the back offices of Wall Street, as major exchanges and
securities firms flipped ahead the calendars in a computer test
Monday that looked for Year 2000 trading problems. In the first of
two weeks of tests, 29 securities firms and 12 exchanges performed
mock trades in an effort to determine how Wall Street's vast
computerized trading system will handle the transition to year
2000. ``All indications are that Day One went very well,'' said
John Panchery, Year 2000 project manager at the Securities Industry
Association, which sponsored the test. The efforts were aimed at
ferreting out from members' communications systems signs of the
``millennium bug,'' which could cause computers that are set to
read only the last two digits of the year to malfunction or fail
when the calendar changes to 2000. All of the initial tests were
limited to uncomplicated transactions involving relatively small
volumes of stock, bonds and options contracts. (US-MILLENNIUM BUG)
	   WASHINGTON _ General Motors is recalling nearly 1 million cars
after 130 people were injured by air bags bursting open without any
crash. And the U.S. government is investigating reports of similar
problems in other makers' cars. General Motors' move came after it
got several hundred complaints about the air bags inflating
inadvertently in late model Chevrolet Cavaliers, Pontiac Sunfires
and Cadillacs. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration is investigating reports concerning Chrysler
minivans and cars, Subarus, Mazdas and Volvos. It is just the
latest air bag headache for the auto industry, drivers and safety
officials. (US-AIR BAGS)
	   WASHINGTON _ Arguing that the North American Free Trade
Agreement is actually a treaty, steelworkers and an allied group
asked a U.S. judge Monday to rule NAFTA unconstitutional because it
wasn't approved by a two-thirds vote of the Senate. The United
Steelworkers of America and the Made in the USA Foundation filed
suit in Birmingham, Alabama, in the latest attempt to shelve NAFTA.
The Clinton administration got NAFTA approved as a trade agreement
by majorities in both the Senate and House in 1993. The union and
other NAFTA foes argue that various provisions of NAFTA _ including
elimination of tariffs and the creation of an arbitration panel _
make it a treaty as defined by the U.S. Constitution. (US-NAFTA

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Nancy Sinatra was home watching the
``Seinfeld'' finale the night her father died.
	   Frank Sinatra's daughter told ``Entertainment Tonight'' that she
had planned to visit him May 14, ``except that `Seinfeld' reruns
started prior to the `Seinfeld' finale _ isn't this tacky _ and I
got so involved watching that damn show that I never got over to my
dad's.''
	   ``That was the night that he went to the hospital and didn't
come out,'' Ms. Sinatra said in an interview airing this week.
	   She said she wasn't notified of Sinatra's trip to the hospital
until after he died.
	   ``At first I was unhappy about that,'' she said. ``But then, as
time went on, I realized it didn't really matter because we had so
many wonderful moments together in the past year _ that it didn't
make any difference that I didn't actually get to say, `Goodbye
daddy, I love you.'''
	   Ms. Sinatra said she last saw her father on May 10. He died at
82.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Ralph Fiennes is using goose liver and
Hungarian love songs to get himself in the mood for ``The Taste of
Sunshine.''
	   The English actor will play all three leads in the movie about a
Jewish family's struggle to maintain its identity over three
generations. He will play a pragmatic lawyer, his Olympic-athlete
son and his political grandson.
	   ``It was one of the best scripts I have ever read in my life,''
Fiennes said Monday.
	   Acclaimed Hungarian director Istvan Szabo is directing and also
wrote the script. The movie is due out in the spring.
	   Fiennes is limbering up by listening to local love songs, eating
goose liver and other Hungarian specialties and taking walks around
Budapest.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) _ John Ford's hometown has honored him with
a bronze statue 25 years after his death.
	   The 10-foot (3-meter) statue was unveiled Sunday in a ceremony
attended by Navy Secretary John Dalton, who told how the director
was wounded while filming at the Battle of Midway during World War
II.
	   The statue, by New York artist George Kelly, shows Ford sitting
in his director's chair, holding a pipe and wearing a wide-brim
hat. The statue sits near a vacant lot where a saloon run by Ford's
father once stood.
	   ``To think that the son of Irish immigrants could rise to be one
of the most celebrated American directors in one generation,'' said
Linda Noe Laine, a Louisiana philanthropist who donated the statue.
	   Ford often directed John Wayne and won six Oscars, including one
for ``The Quiet Man.'' He died in 1973.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ In honor of Ingmar Bergman's 80th
birthday, the Swedish Film Institute will spend dlrs 37,000 to make
new copies of several of his older films.
	   Among the films to be re-released are ``The Seventh Seal,''
``The Silence'' and ``Scenes from a Marriage.'' Bergman's last film
was 1982's ``Fanny and Alexander.''
	   His birthday is Tuesday.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Spike Lee's plan to make a movie about serial
killer Son of Sam has gotten a thumbs-down from the father of one
of the victims.
	   Michael Lauria is urging the filmmaker to drop the ``Summer of
Sam'' project. Lauria's daughter Donna was the notorious New York
serial killer's first victim in 1976.
	   ``I can't believe that anyone would make a movie about the Son
of Sam,'' Lauria told the New York Daily News. ``He admitted to
killing my daughter.''
	   David Berkowitz, who called himself Son of Sam, killed six
people in random shootings from the summer of 1976 to July 1977.
Seven others were wounded in the attacks that terrorized New York
City. Berkowitz is serving six consecutive 25 years-to-life terms
in state prison.
	   Lee is scheduled to film scenes in a Bronx neighborhood not far
from where Lauria's daughter was shot, among other New York
locales.
	   Lee, whose films include ``Do The Right Thing,'' ``Malcolm X''
and ``He Got Game,'' did not attend the casting call. Al Valentine,
location manager for the film, said the filming would go on as
planned, although Lee was sensitive to the protesters' concerns and
has ordered his crews to stay away from actual murder sites.
	   Valentine said the film wasn't focused on Berkowitz, instead
dealing with a group of youths who severely beat a man they
mistakenly thought was the killer.
	   ``They think it's the Berkowitz story; it's not,'' Valentine
said.
	   The nickname ``Son of Sam'' came from a note Berkowitz left one
of the shooting scenes, which read in part, ``I am a monster. I am
the Son of Sam.'' Police finally captured him by tracing a parking
ticket issued near the scene of one of the murders.

Dramatic three days in Ireland for Tour de France roadshow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CORK, Ireland (AP) _ It took two years of planning, but the Tour
of France's first sojourn through Ireland had plenty of drama in
just three days.
	   Erik Zabel of Germany, the doyen of sprinters who has never won
a Tour stage, donned the leader's yellow jersey for the first time
Monday night in Cork after managing three high-placed finishes on
Ireland's often wet but gentle-sloped terrain.
	   Chris Boardman of Britain achieved his goal of winning the
yellow jersey on opening day with a dominant prologue performance
through Dublin. But then he surrendered it to Zabel after crashing
35 miles (55 kms) from Monday's finish line after bumping into a
Gan teammate.
	   While the remaining 186 cyclists flew to Brittany to continue
the contest Tuesday on French soil, Boardman remained in Cork
University Hospital with a fractured wrist, a gashed forehead, and
another nightmare conclusion to a Tour campaign to contemplate.
	   The 1992 Olympics pursuit gold medalist won the yellow jersey on
his 1994 Tour debut and held it for two days _ a model of
consistency he's never managed since.
	   In 1995 he smashed his ankle in the opening prologue and
withdrew. In 1996 he struggled his way past more wounds to finish
in 37th place. And in 1997, after winning yellow once again on
prologue day, he retired with a twisted spinal column 12 days
later.
	   Boardman, 29, was expected to be discharged from hospital
Tuesday morning.
	   For defending Tour champion Jan Ullrich of Germany, his Irish
performances confirmed that the 24-year-old had worked off all the
extra pounds (kilos) he'd put on in the off-season.
	   Ullrich never pushed himself to full throttle during any of the
races, but accrued points in workmanlike fashion to stand in eighth
place overall, just 9 seconds back from his Telekom teammate Zabel.
	   For the No. 1-ranked French team Festina, Ireland provided
temporary sanctuary from a scandal certain to dog it back home.
	   As Festina's riders powered their way to three of the top 10
spots in Saturday's prologue, its director Bruno Roussel found
himself live on French television having to explain why one of his
staff had been arrested on the French-Belgian border in possession
of performance-enhancing drugs.
	   While Lance Armstrong's continuing recuperation from cancer kept
him from competing in this year's Tour, Bobby Julich of the French
Cofidis team launched his campaign to become the next American to
challenge the Europeans.
	   Julich, 27, of Glenwood Springs, Colorado, finished fourth in
the prologue, 45th in the first stage and 44th Monday, putting him
in fourth place overall. He finished a surprising 17th in the 1997
Tour.
	   But the biggest tests for this 85th Tour, as always, will come
when the riders hit the Pyrenees and Alps mountain ranges in
successive weeks. The race concludes Aug. 2 with the traditional
sprint down Paris's Champs Elysee.

Ethnic Albanian pacifist leader wants to rein in rebel fighters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs.
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate ethnic
Albanian leader, faces an uphill effort to gain control of
underground rebels fighting for independence in the separatist
Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   The leadership of Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo, the main
ethnic Albanian party, announced Monday that the first constituent
session of the self-styled Kosovo parliament would convene within a
week.
	   Although the Serbian government has not approved the parliament,
it has largely tolerated the panel. The parliament, elected last
March in an unofficial ballot, is dominated by Rugova's party but
has been boycotted by most other Albanian parties.
	   The militant Kosovo Liberation Army, reportedly in control of
about 40 percent of Kosovo, has refused to be controlled by any of
the Albanian political parties. Analysts believe the KLA fighters
are unlikely to recognize the authority of either parliament or
Rugova.
	   Earlier this month, other influential ethnic Albanian parties
proposed formation of an ethnic Albanian National Council, which
would include representatives from all parties and present a
unified Albanian body to encompass the KLA. But Rugova apparently
rejected the proposal.
	   Also Monday, the government-run Serb Media Center said Serb
forces retook the last strategic sites around the Belacevac coal
mine, 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of the provincial capital
Pristina. There was no resistance from ethnic Albanian fighters who
left at the sight of Serb police, the center said.
	   The newest outbreak left 12 people reported dead over three days
in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   Meantime, ethnic Albanian sources, who asked for anonymity, said
14 busloads of police were seen arriving in Pec, a city close to
the border with neighboring Albania.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said Monday that Pecan and two
other villages 45 kilometers (28 miles) southwest of Pristina were
shelled. Two were killed and 13 others wounded, said the center,
which is close to Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   The shelling and sniping by the Serbs forced ethnic Albanians
from the region, it said.
	   Serbia is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Hundreds of
people have been killed since February when Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on Albanian separatists who
had been attacking Serb police and military facilities.
	   In Brussels, the European Union called for an immediate
ceade-fire and a resumption of negotiations with direct
international involvement, endorsing the principle of the use of
force should any of the parties block the process.
	   Foreign ministers said the 15-nation EU supported adopting a
U.N. Security Council resolution putting the United Nations' weight
behind international efforts and ``endorsed the principle of
further action under the U.N. charter to bring about compliance by
those who block the process.''

Jones, Greene following different scripts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The careers of Marion Jones and Maurice Greene took
off simultaneously a year ago but have followed different scripts
lately.
	   Both burst onto the scene last summer with 100 meters titles at
the U.S. Championships, followed by gold medals at the World
Championships in Athens, Greece.
	   While Jones has continued to shine, Greene struggled heading
into Tuesday night's Golden Gala meet. He faced training partner
Ato Boldon, the world champ at 200 meters, and veteran Frankie
Fredericks in the dash at Olympic Stadium.
	   More than two dozen world or Olympic champions were slated to
compete in the second leg of the Golden League, a six-meet series
offering a dlrs 1 million jackpot to anyone who wins at each venue.
	   ``It's been a long year. I need to take a little break,''
acknowledged Greene, who lost to Fredericks at Oslo, Norway,
Thursday in what the American termed ``a rusty race.''
	   Nonetheless, he claims his mind-set is the same as always. ``I
go for a world record every time I step on the track,'' Greene said
Monday. ``I have to run my race, give my all, and I will here.''
	   He pulled out of nationals last month with stomach and leg
cramps, abdicating his throne. By contrast, Jones became the first
woman in 50 years to take three national titles, capturing the 100,
200 and long jump.
	   ``I train to be No. 1. Second place isn't good enough,'' the
world's top-ranked women's sprinter said. ``If I'm at my best, I
can't be beat.''
	   She'll run the 100 and long jump in Rome.
	   ``All the technical problems (in the long jump) are not over,''
she said, noting that she picked up the event five years ago. ``I
still have some to iron out. I can't dedicate as much time as
others who just long jump.''
	   The former point guard, who helped North Carolina to an NCAA
basketball title, reiterated her desire to take a crack at five
gold medals at the 2000 Olympics _ in the 100, 200, long jump, 400
relay and 1,600 relay.
	   And her goals don't stop there.
	   ``Before my career is over, I'd like to touch on the 100, 200
and long jump records,'' Jones said, knowingly referring to a dash
mark that was once considered untouchable.
	   She faced all three medalists from Athens in the long jump
Tuesday: Lyudmila Galkina, Niki Xanthou and Fiona May.
	   Other top names competing included Michael Johnson, who's coming
off his second loss of the decade in the 400; world and Olympic
10,000 winner Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia, looking to lower his
record in the 5,000, and six-time world pole vault champ Sergei
Bubka.

Harvard grad claims victory in disputed Ecuador vote

conference &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ The Harvard-educated mayor of Quito has
repeated his claim that he won Ecuador's disputed presidential
runoff despite an inconclusive exit poll and the lack of official
results.
	   Official results are not expected until Wednesday. Jamil
Mahuad's rival, populist banana tycoon Alvaro Noboa, also claims to
have won Sunday's vote and has asked his followers to go to
vote-counting stations to prevent a Mahuad-organized fraud.
	   ``I am the president of the nation, of all of Ecuador,'' Mahuad
said at a news conference Monday.
	   Mahuad had 51.3 percent support and Noboa 48.7 percent support
in the runoff, according to an exit poll sponsored by seven
television stations. Mahuad's lead was within the margin of error,
making it a statistical dead heat.
	   Mahuad, 48, and Noboa, 47, were the top vote getters in the
first round of voting on May 31.
	   Ecuadoreans on Monday anxiously waited for the official results,
but many were discouraged by the turn of events, feeling that an
opportunity to bring stability to their politically chaotic nation
was slipping away.
	   ``The panorama is not encouraging. We are caught in a deep
political, economic and moral crisis, and the vote did not give one
candidate a clear mandate,'' said political analyst Antonio
Rodriguez.
	   Ecuadoreans have voted six times in the past two years _ only to
find their political leadership still in disarray.
	   Weary of politics, many stayed home to watch Brazil lose to
France in Sunday's World Cup soccer final. More than 30 percent of
registered voters did not cast a ballot, a record high in Ecuador
where voting is obligatory, and non-compliance can lead to a fine.
	   ``These results confirm the discontent among the large majority
with our political structures and our democracy itself,'' said an
editorial in the national newspaper Hoy.
	   Remembering street violence in past elections, army troops and
police surrounded the office of the elections board in Guayaquil,
Noboa's home town.
	   A brief stone-throwing battle erupted between supporters of the
two candidates outside the elections office, but it was quickly
dispersed with no arrests or injuries. The streets of Ecuador's
cities were largely quiet.
	   The winner will replace interim President Fabian Alarcon, ending
17 months of transitional government that began when Congress
removed eccentric former President Abdala Bucaram from power for
``mental incapacity'' in February 1997 amid massive street
protests.
	   Multiple claims to the presidency are not new in this Andean
nation of 12 million people. In the 48 hours of chaos that followed
Bucaram's ouster, three people simultaneously claimed to be
president. Congress named Alarcon to the job.
	   Mahuad, who has a master's degree in public administration from
Harvard University, won the support of voters impressed with his
efficient administration during his six-year stint as Quito's
mayor.
	   Noboa, who ran the Central Bank during Bucaram's six-month
government, called himself the candidate of the poor despite his
wealth.
	   The winner will take over a country with its 19-year-old
democracy in tatters and its economy battered by El Nino-driven
floods and falling prices of its main export, oil.
	   ``Governing Ecuador in the era that lies ahead is going to be a
very complicated task,'' Mahuad said at Monday's news conference.

Special funeral planned for Northern Ireland's three lost boys

	   BALLYMONEY, Northern Ireland _ A Catholic priest faced the
delicate task of laying to rest three young brothers, raised as
Protestants and killed by a sectarian firebomb in politically
charged Northern Ireland.
	   ``It is not the place to be political,'' the Rev. Peter Forde
said Monday. ``But three children who had just begun life were lent
to us, and we as a society failed in our responsibility.''
	   Forde said nothing could prepare him for the ``unnatural'' sight
of a trio of little coffins in the special funeral Mass on Tuesday,
but he hoped his carefully chosen words would make a difference to
the family of Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn, and to the watching
world.
	   The Mass was scheduled for 11 a.m. (1000 GMT) at the Church or
Our Lady and St. Patrick, with burial planned in the nearby town of
Rasharkin, where the Quinn family has its roots.
	   Irene Quinn, the boys' grandmother, said her daughter wanted
them buried in Rasharkin so she never again would have to set foot
in Ballymoney. Chrissie Quinn's oldest son, 13-year-old Lee, spent
Saturday night with his grandmother and so escaped the attack.
	   Tensions spilling over from a blocked Protestant march outside a
rural church near Portadown were blamed for the early Sunday
morning firebombing of the Quinn house. Police said they believed
the family was targeted because Chrissie Quinn lived there with her
Protestant boyfriend.
	   Two men were being questioned, police said.
	   Ms. Quinn is Catholic, but was raising the boys as Protestants
because she thought it would make life easier for them in
Ballymoney, a hard-line Protestant stronghold about 40 miles (60
kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   Forde said the boys' mother retreated into shock but she
insisted that her sons must receive a Catholic funeral and burial.
	   ``She's physically incapable of doing anything more than nodding
her head and shaking it, it's all so new to her,'' he said. ``But
she was adamant that it all be Catholic. On that point, she had no
hesitation.''
	   Members of the Protestant Orange Order shied away from
confrontation Monday in marches across Northern Ireland, weighed
down by their own bitter divisions and subdued by the shock of the
deaths of the boys, who were 11, 10 and 9.
	   At hundreds of marches, Orangemen paused for silence in respect
for the siblings.
	   Members of the Orange Order in Portadown are insisting on their
right to march through a Catholic neighborhood even though a
government-appointed parades commission twice denied their
application.
	   Hundreds of police and British soldiers have maintained the
blockade since July 5, and Prime Minister Tony Blair has insisted
the law will be enforced.
	   On Sunday, after the Quinn boys' deaths, the Portadown Orange
lodges rejected calls from political and religious leaders to call
off their protest, though they did move to scale down the size of
the crowds, which grew to more than 20,000 last week.

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
praised Brazil's ``culture of peace'' Monday but warned that
economic and social progress were also necessary.
	   ``Peace on a global level, too, will depend not only on the
management of armed conflict but on the achievement of social and
economic progress for peoples everywhere,'' Annan said.
	   Annan made his remarks following a ceremony where Brazilian
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso signed the newly ratified
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
	   At a time when nuclear competition is brewing in South Asia,
Annan praised Brazil and other Latin American nations as ``beacons
of maturity for abstaining from vying for membership of the nuclear
club.''
	   But Annan also flagged the ``painful inequalities,'' in this the
country with the world's widest gap between rich and poor and
compared conditions in the country's northeast with ``the poorer
parts of Africa.''
	   Annan arrived in Brasilia after spending the weekend in Rio de
Janeiro and the northeastern city of Salvador. He travels Tuesday
to Sao Paulo before heading to Uruguay, Argentina, Guatemala and
Mexico.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Popocatepetl volcano southeast of Mexico
City emitted a stream of ash for 17 minutes Monday, but emergency
authorities said there was no risk to nearby communities.
	   At 9:33 a.m. (10:33 a.m. EDT), the volcano experienced a
moderate ``exhalation'' accompanied by the steady release of ash
until 9:50 a.m. (10:50 a.m. EDT), the National Civil Protection
System reported.
	   A yellow alert signaling caution remained in effect for the
18,000-foot (5,500-meter) Popocatepetl, an Aztec Indian name
meaning ``Smoking Mountain.'' Authorities advised people to avoid
going within 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) of the crater.
	   Since Sunday morning, Popocatepetl had made six emissions, the
government news agency Notimex reported.
	   Popocatepetl is 30 miles (50 kilometers) southeast of Mexico
City. About 300,000 people live on the mountain's slope and another
15 million live within 50 miles (80 kilometers).
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TLAPA, Mexico (AP) _ A community group demanded Monday that
state and federal police thoroughly investigate the killing of a
farm workers' leader for the possible involvement of paramilitary
groups or the Mexican military.
	   Eusebio Vazquez Juarez, 27, was shot to death Friday night in
Tepetixtla, a village 30 miles (45 kms) northwest of Acapulco, in
western Guerrero state. Head of the Campesina Organization of the
Southern Sierra, Vazquez was the 33rd member of the group to be
killed in the last three years.
	   Santiago de Jesus Lara, leader of the Union of Organizations of
the Southern Sierra, said Vazquez received death threats from state
police and paramilitary groups supportive of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
	   Guerrero state is home to the Popular Revolutionary Army, a
rebel group which rose up in June 1996 on the first anniversary of
a massacre of 17 farm workers by state policemen.
	   Vazquez and other members of his group had denounced the
presence of paramilitary groups in Guerrero and alleged actions by
military troops against farm workers.
	   Lara's organization is a regional umbrella group based in Tlapa,
100 miles (160 kms) northeast of Acapulco.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Authorities recently confiscated nearly
7 tons of pure cocaine, the largest seizure in Colombian history.
	   Anti-narcotics police in Cartagena, a caribbean port city about
405 miles (650 kms) north of Bogota, reported the seizure Saturday
and that the cocaine has been ready for export through Mexico to
the United States.
	   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and Mexican authorities helped
with information, said Colombia's top anti-narcotics official, Gen.
Rosso Jose Serrano.
	   Police said the cocaine, worth an estimated dlrs 100 million,
was hidden in metal containers marked as carrying high-quality
nylon.
	   Monthly shipments using the method have gone undetected for two
years, police said.
	   Colombia produces 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the United
States and is the world's largest source of the drug.

Restructuring European-style: More joint ventures than mergers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LE BOURGET, France (AP) _ The world's biggest land weaponry
show, held outside Paris in June, was a snapshot of Europe's
defense industry: a dizzying array of companies looking for
alliances in the post-Cold War era.
	   But American-style merger mania, in which 40 defense companies
have merged into four since 1993, has yet to hit Europe. Industry
observers at the Eurosatory arms show said, essentially, don't hold
your breath.
	   Instead, the trend is a mix of mergers, privatization and
downsizing, along with ad hoc alliances between European companies,
sometimes with American firms offering needed technology or
markets.
	   ``The trend is toward more consolidation, but not with the aim
of a single consortium,'' said Ian Kemp of the influential Jane's
Defense Weekly.
	   Holding up European mergers have been national security
concerns, and the tens of thousands of jobs that stand to be lost.
	   The Western European Union, Europe's fledgling defense arm, has
formed the 13-nation Western European Armaments Group in an effort
to boost the European industry. But progress has been limited.
	   France is pragmatically, though belatedly, ceding to the
post-Cold War downsizing tide. On June 18, Socialist Defense
Minister Alain Richard confirmed union fears that Giat, which makes
the Leclerc tank among other weaponry, will slim down.
	   Richard said Giat, which claims 15 percent of Europe's land
weapons industry, could trim up to 4,000 of its 10,500 jobs and
close several plants.
	   In his speech at Eurosatory, Richard ticked down a list of
successful European companies, starting with the Franco-German
Eurocopter, made outside Marseille. But he added that ``profound
restructuring, French and European, appears necessary.''
	   On June 22, the French government gave up its controlling share
of the large defense electronics company Thomson-CSF to a
consortium led by the telecommunications and engineering company
Alcatel Alsthom.
	   And in March, Airbus officials from France, Spain, Germany and
Britain agreed in principle to create a single European aerospace
and defense company, aimed at better competing with Lockheed Martin
and Boeing.
	   There was evidence of some mergers at Eurosatory. Among them was
Matra-British Aerospace-Dynamics, created in 1996 by France's
Lagardere and British Aerospace.
	   After that merger, ``everybody was hoping other things would
follow, but they haven't happened yet,'' said Paul Beaver of
Jane's.
	   British Aerospace announced in April that it was acquiring a 35
percent stake in Sweden's Saab military aircraft company.
	   But the merger effort has been so limited that there are no
global figures available on the trend.
	   Europe's multi-role armored vehicle program, MRAV, which plans
to build 600 of them, so far involves Britain, France and Germany.
But German lawmakers are balking at the multibillion-dollar
program.
	   If successful, it could be a model project. It is coordinated by
OCCAR, a Bonn-based European organization created last year between
Europe's arms industry leaders: Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
	   Encouraging but sobering words came recently from none other
than the U.S. ambassador to France, Felix Rohatyn. In a lecture in
May to France's defense institute, he supported restructuring, in
part to maintain European public support for defense spending.
	   But it will be painful, Rohatyn said. He referred to a Pentagon
dinner in 1993 of defense industry executives whose ranks were to
be thinned drastically.
	   ``I am told this dinner is known around the Pentagon as the
`Last Supper,''' he said.

Russia deal with international lenders is no sure thing

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Even after reaching a deal with international
lenders, Russia's expectation of dlrs 17.1 billion in new loans was
by no means a sure thing.
	   The money could begin to flow into the Russian economy as early
as next week, but apparently only if parliament approves the
government's economic stabilization plan
	   The loans are to come from three sources: the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Japanese government. When
combined with already-negotiated loans, the bailout package totals
dlrs 22.6 billion.
	   The IMF board of directors is scheduled to meet in Washington
next Monday to consider the deal. The State Duma plans a special
session on Wednesday to further debate the measures.
	   The lower house is dominated by the Communist Party, which
opposes the program to cut the deficit and improve tax collection.
	   ``We will make a judgment about the position of the Executive
Board in the light of whatever decision the Duma makes,'' the IMF's
chief negotiator, John Odling-Smee, said.
	   Anatoly Chubais, the government's chief negotiator, and top
officials of the IMF and World Bank, jointly announced the new
loans Monday. They are part of a two-year financial bailout to
rescue the country's precarious economy.
	   The announcement of the loan package culminated weeks of
speculation and negotiation that followed the collapse of Russian
financial markets this spring.
	   ``These resources will allow us to significantly strengthen the
anti-crisis efforts of the government and will help to stabilize
and strengthen the Russian economy,'' Chubais told reporters.
	   The United States hailed the accord. ``We view it as a major
step forward with Russia's reform efforts,'' White House press
secretary Mike McCurry said.
	   Odling-Smee, said the deal will mean that ``confidence will
return to the financial markets and the pressures on the ruble will
not continue.''
	   Millions of Russians have been pushed into poverty by the
country's shrinking economy during the 1990s, and the infusion of
cash is designed to ward off another big downturn.
	   The government hopes the loans will prevent a devaluation of the
ruble, restore foreign investors' confidence, and allow the state
to begin paying off its many debts, including billions of dollars
owed to unpaid workers.
	   Chubais, the architect of Russia's privatization program, had
been seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion in new loans. The
agreement he struck calls for dlrs 12.6 billion in new loans this
year, followed by dlrs 4.5 billion next year.
	   The IMF said dlrs 5.6 billion could be made available
immediately after its board meeting next week.
	   The Russian stock market index leapt 9.2 percent Monday in
response to the news. The market had been flat recently as traders
waited to see what kind of loan package President Boris Yeltsin's
government would snare.
	   Jerome Booth, head of emerging markets research at ANZ
Investment Bank in London, said the package is likely enough to
stabilize Russian markets, and send them even higher.
	   ``It's an issue of confidence: You are trying to get the private
sector to refinance and invest in Russia,'' he said. ``The fact
that the IMF has said it will provide money is the important thing.
The amount is almost secondary.''
	   Economists have noted that a loan by itself won't solve
perennial problems such as the budget deficit and a porous tax
collection system.
	   In negotiating the loan, the government agreed to cut the budget
deficit from 6.8 percent of the country's gross domestic product to
2.8 percent, the IMF said.
	   Russia also announced it would stop issuing short-term treasury
bills, which have been issued lately at astronomical interest
rates.
	   One new element in the loan package was the participation of
Japan, which had been rumored lately.

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ South African President Nelson Mandela
will travel to this capital city next week in a visit aimed at
broadening relations between the two countries, the Brazilian
foreign ministry announced.
	   Mandela and President Fernando Henrique Cardoso will sign a
series of cooperation agreements.
	   ``There are 13 agreements in negotiation with South Africa, and
other documents could be signed as well, including one regarding
prisoner exchange and another on technical cooperation,'' Jose
Fiusa Neto of the Foreign Ministry's Africa Department said Monday
without being more specific.

Thrill-seekers driving boom in roller coaster construction

	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ Don Helbig loves it when, heart pounding and
stomach churning, he hurtles through space at up to 100 mph (160
kph) and plunges hundreds of feet (meters) toward the ground.
	   The 35-year-old loves it so much, he says he has ridden the
Racer at Paramount's Kings Island near Cincinnati more than 10,000
times. Enthusiasm like his, along with new technology, is fueling a
boom that some call the second Golden Age of roller coasters.
	   This season, 34 new coasters are scheduled to open around the
United States and 33 others at parks worldwide _ the highest number
introduced in any single year since the late 1920s.
	   ``For anyone who loves roller coasters, this is just a wonderful
time to be alive,'' said Paul Ruben, North American editor of the
Park World amusement trade magazine.
	   During the 1920s, the number of coasters grew to about 2,000,
but dwindled in the Depression and World War II. With the new
construction, there will be 350 roller coasters in North America
and about 700 worldwide.
	   ``A lot of people looking for a thrill want the kinds of
sensations associated with skydiving and bungee jumping, but they
don't want to go to those extremes,'' said Janice Lifke, a
spokeswoman for the Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio.
``This way they can feel secure while still testing the edge.''
	   Coasters are the signature ride for most parks, and usually pay
for themselves within a year, she said.
	   They don't come cheap. In the past, coasters have run between
dlrs 1 million to dlrs 13 million, but new technology has driven
some as high as dlrs 15 million.
	   ``It's like there's a roller coaster arms race under way,''
Ruben said. ``Everyone is trying to come up with coasters that are
bigger, faster and wilder than the next.''
	   New developments known as linear induction motor technology,
also known as LIM, has some predicting a revolution in roller
coasters.
	   Rather than the traditional method of towing cars up an incline
and relying on gravity to build speed and momentum, the new
technology uses motors to catapult a coaster like a slingshot, said
Jim Seay, one of several former aerospace engineers in the
industry.
	   ``Amusement parks are seeking rides that can attract people and
compete with the new technological thrills provided by movies and
virtual entertainment centers,'' said Seay, president of Premier
Rides Inc. of Millersville, Maryland, which built four of the new
coasters with LIM technology.
	   Premier Ride's new Mr. Freeze coasters _ one at Six Flags St.
Louis and the other at Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington _ use LIM
technology to launch riders through a 190-foot (60-meter) tunnel,
reaching speeds of 70 mph (110 kph) in just under four seconds.
	   They go into a totally vertical climb while twisting to a
180-degree inversion. Riders then plummet into a wraparound turn
before soaring 235 feet (71 meters) straight up. They are then sent
through the 1,450 feet (440 meters) of steel track in reverse.
	   Whew.
	   While the new technology spurs changes, some favor traditional
wooden coasters. Seven of the new coasters are built of wood, not
steel, including the dlrs 4 million Twisted Sisters at Kentucky
Kingdom in Louisville.
	   And though some say the boom can't last, orders for new roller
coasters are backlogged two or three years, said Dennis Speigel,
president of International Theme Park Services Inc., a Cincinnati
consulting firm.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Finland native who narrowly missed winning a seat
in Japan's Parliament says he hasn't given up his dream of becoming
a national legislator.
	   ``I feel I'm not defeated,'' Marutei Tsurunen told The
Associated Press on Tuesday. ``It was a good fight.''
	   Tsurunen, a Japanese citizen for 19 years, ran for a seat in
Kanagawa prefecture, or state, southwest of Tokyo, finishing
fourth. But only the top three finishers in his district are sent
to Parliament.
	   The 58-year-old Tsurunen, an independent city assemblyman in
Kanagawa since 1992, came in a mere 7,000 votes behind the
third-place finisher in Sunday's election. Tsurunen garnered
slightly over 500,000 votes.
	   Despite the loss, that was better than the first time he ran in
1995 when Tsurunen fell short by 30,000 votes.
	   In largely conformist Japan, the former Lutheran missionary
chose to emphasize his difference by campaigning on an unusual
issue: his genes.
	   He emphasized his blue eyes and evoked the symbolism of his
native Finland by urging voters to ``import a lawmaker direct from
the land of Santa Claus.''
	   Had he won, the northern Karelia native, would have become the
first Westerner to gain national office in Japan.
	   Tsurunen's original name was Martti Turnen, but took a
Japanese-sounding name as a requirement to become a citizen.
	   He promised a gentler, welfare-oriented society and cleaner
government, arguing that offering financial security in old age
would do wonders for Japan's struggling economy and boost consumer
spending.
	   Since the next upper house election isn't scheduled until 2001,
Tsurunen said he is considering running for the more powerful lower
house if the chamber is dissolved this year.
	   That could happen as some opposition parties are demanding just
that amid the political turmoil following the resignation of Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Monday.
	   ``I haven't given up yet,'' he said.

Council calls on Congo, Rwanda to prosecute, ready to take other
</HEADLINE>
measures &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Council to meet at 0245 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council called on Congo and
Rwanda to prosecute human rights violations stemming from alleged
massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees during Laurent Kabila's sweep
across Congo in 1996-97.
	   A draft presidential statement, expected to be taken up later
Monday, makes no mention of suggestions by U.N. human rights
investigators that an international tribunal prosecute the crimes
if Congo and Rwanda are unable or unwilling to do so.
	   But the council, apparently aware of this possibility, said it
was ready to consider ``additional steps to ensure that the
perpetrators of the massacres, other atrocities and violations of
international humanitarian law are brought to justice.''
	   It requested both countries report back to the U.N. chief by
Oct. 15 on progress made toward investigating and prosecuting those
responsible.
	   The tribunal recommendation was made in a report by the U.N.
human rights team which was pulled from Congo in April because of
what the United Nations said was a complete lack of cooperation
from the government.
	   The team was sent in August to investigate massacres of Rwandan
Hutu refugees allegedly carried out by Kabila's forces during their
victorious march across the African nation of Zaire. In May 1997,
Kabila took power of Zaire and renamed it Congo.
	   The Rwandan Hutu refugees fled across the border to Zaire to
escape punishment for the 1994 Hutu-sponsored massacre of an
estimated half-million Tutsis.
	   Though admittedly incomplete because of the aborted mission, the
U.N. report gave evidence of Rwandan involvement in the massacres
of hundreds of unarmed civilians by troops loyal to Kabila. It also
documented Congolese government attempts to cover up the massacres
by removing bodies from a mass grave at Mbandaka.
	   The investigators suggested the international tribunal
prosecuting the Rwandan genocide to be expanded to try what it said
were serious violations of human rights and breaches of
humanitarian law that may constitute genocide.
	   Such a move could only be made if the local judicial systems
were judged inadequate or unwilling to handle the work.
	   Congo strongly rejected the findings of the report, raising
questions about whether local courts had the ability or the
political will to prosecute the crimes.
	   Congo said it was, however, willing to try any of its citizens.
It requested aid from the international community to reform and
rebuild its judicial system.
	   The statement calls on member states to provide the necessary
equipment and other assistance to help develop local judicial
systems.
	   China had been unenthusiastic about adopting a statement, and
had objected to any reference to the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, diplomatic sources said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The current draft makes no such reference.

Dollar lower, Tokyo stocks advance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar traded lower against the Japanese
yen early Tuesday as investors awaited the appointment of Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's successor. Tokyo stock prices rose
moderately.
	   In early trading, the dollar bought 141.32 yen, down 1.10 yen
from late Monday and also below its late New York level of 141.42
overnight.
	   The yen was supported on expectations that the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party's election loss Sunday and Hashimoto's subsequent
resignation could force the party to take more drastic measures to
shore up Japan's flagging economy, traders said.
	   But dollar-yen trading is likely to stay within a narrow range
until Hashimoto's successor is named, they said.
	   Hashimoto announced his resignation Monday to take
responsibility for his party's major defeat in the election for the
Parliament's upper house.
	   The yen intially plummeted on news early Monday that he wwas
likely to quit, but stabilized later in the day.
	   Although the party failed to win a majority of seats in the
upper house, it will stay in power since it maintains a majority in
the more powerful lower house.
	   The Liberal Democrats are expected to name their new president
July 21. One of the possible successors being mentioned is Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi. Others include Seiroku Kajiyama, a former
chief cabinet secretary, and Junichiro Koizumi, a former health
minister.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, prices were little changed in early
trading as players took to the sidelines amid uncertainty over who
will succeed Hashimoto.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average rose 46.15 points,
or 0.28 percent, to 16,406.54 after the first hour of morning
trading. On Monday, the index had gained 270.33 points, or 1.68
percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 4.06 points, or 0.32 percent, to 1,260.20. The
TOPIX gained 14.94 points, or 1.20 percent, the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.445 percent from Monday's finish of 1.415
percent, driving its price down to 110.11 yen from 110.33 yen.

Nicklaus plans to retire in 2000

	   CHESTER, England (AP) _ Jack Nicklaus gave his fans two years'
notice, saying he's leaving the PGA Tour in 2000 after playing all
four major tournaments.
	   ``Then that will be the end of my playing golf, period,'' the
58-year-old Nicklaus said Monday. ``We've all got to stop some
time, and I don't think it's any big deal.''
	   It may not be to him, but it is to most golf fans, who still
pack the galleries whenever Nicklaus competes.
	   ``I'm fairly much in touch with what's realistic and if I say
I'm going to stay out there and keep competing, then that would be
rather silly,'' he said during a visit to a new course he designed
at Carden Park with his son, Steve. ``I'll still play some senior
golf, but I'm not going to compete against the kids.''
	   Nicklaus, a winner of 18 majors, ended his streak of playing in
154 consecutive majors last week when he pulled out of the British
Open with an ailing left hip. It's the first British Open he'll
miss since 1962.
	   ``I don't want to go out there and have people see just a part
of Jack Nicklaus,'' he said. ``I have tried to give them the best I
could give them.
	   ``I know I can't give them the Jack Nicklaus of 35, but I'd like
to give them the best I can give them of the Jack Nicklaus of 58. I
think the Jack Nicklaus of 58 could probably still play decently.''
	   Nicklaus said he plans to play in ``Open championships to
come,'' but probably not next year at Carnoustie. The British Open
in 2000 is at St. Andrews.
	   On Sunday, Nicklaus finished sixth in the Seniors Players
Championship, 12 shots behind winner Gil Morgan. Before the
tournament, Nicklaus said he'll play the U.S Senior Open on July
23-26 and that will probably be his final event of the year.
	   Nicklaus said he planned to end the streak of majors in April at
his 40th consecutive Masters, where he got within two strokes of
the lead with a Sunday charge before finishing tied for sixth.
	   He then accepted a special exemption to play in his 42nd
consecutive U.S. Open, where he tied for 43rd.
	   Nicklaus is one of only four players to win the career Grand
Slam, and the only player to win all four majors more than once.
	   He won a record six Masters, 23 years between the first and the
last; four U.S. Opens, sharing the record with Ben Hogan, Bobby
Jones and Willie Anderson; three British Opens, along with a record
seven runner-up finishes; and five PGA championships _ only Walter
Hagen, who played in the match-play era, won that many.

Capture of huge white pointer shark to provide vital clues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ A white pointer shark accidentally
killed in waters off South Australia _ the largest ever caught in
the state _ could provide vital clues to the sharks' life cycle.
	   The white pointer was a female, probably more than 20 years old,
measuring 18 feet (5.5 meters) in length and weighing about
one-and-a-half tons, South Australian chief scientist John Keesing
said.
	   It drowned after becoming entangled in a angler's longline close
to Port Pirie in Spencer Gulf, and was found by a professional
fisherman pulling up the line Monday morning.
	   The great white was declared an endangered species last year,
but the death of this shark will not lead to any prosecution, as it
was an accidental capture.
	   The white pointer will be frozen until a group of shark experts
from around Australia can meet in Adelaide in several months for a
dissection and examination, Keesing said.
	   The catch was important because scientists knew very little
about the life of the white pointer, in particular its reproductive
cycle.
	   ``The reason sharks are protected is because it's uncertain how
many of them there are,'' Keesing said.
	   Besides its feeding habits, Keesing said scientists would also
study its bones to try to determine the shark's age and its flesh
to check for levels of mercury or other metals.
	   The largest great white shark ever recorded was over 20 feet
(6.2 meters) long and weighed 2 1/2 tons. According to the Guinness
Book of Records, it was harpooned and landed in the harbor of San
Miguel, Azores in June 1978.

Japan's new leader will inherit U.S. pressure on economic reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to update with Japan markets rebounding &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN CRUTSINGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Economics Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Japan's new leader will face all the problems
that made Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto the latest victim of
Asia's financial crisis _ as well as the same nagging message from
the United States.
	   In the view of the Clinton administration, Japan must act more
quickly and decisively to revive its huge economy or run the risk
that Japan's worst recession in 50 years will ignite a second, more
dangerous phase of Asia's economic troubles.
	   If Japan, the world's second largest economy, can't soon find a
way to revive growth, the worry is that Asia's troubles will
unsettle investors elsewhere, something already occurring in
Russia, and perhaps trigger a worldwide recession that would drag
down even the high-flying U.S. economy.
	   ``It is very important to the United States that the new
government, whatever its composition, move quickly to implement
concrete fiscal and banking measures to achieve strong domestic
demand-led growth in Japan and to restore confidence in Japan's
financial system,'' presidential spokesman Mike McCurry told
reporters at the White House.
	   Hashimoto, who parlayed victory in a 1995 high-stakes auto trade
fight with the United States into the prime minister's job in 1996,
announced on Monday that he would step down after his party
suffered a stunning setback in parliamentary elections.
	   Japanese voters clearly unhappy with Hashimoto's flip-flops on
economic policy stripped his ruling Liberal Democratic Party of 17
seats in Japan's upper house. After polls last week showed LDP
popularity was plunging, Hashimoto finally signaled he would be
willing to consider permanent tax cuts to boost consumer demand.
	   Financial markets generally viewed the LDP defeat as a favorable
development bolstering the hand of reformers. Stock prices
rebounded in Tokyo as investors decided that Japan would continue
economic reforms even after the government shakeup.
	   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who has sparred with a
succession of Japanese finance ministers in recent years over
Japan's troubles, said it was ``absolutely imperative that Japan
move efficiently and expeditiously in dealing with economic
issues.''
	   On the first stop of a weeklong Africa trip, Rubin told
reporters in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, on Monday that the change in
leadership in Japan would not affect U.S. dollar policy.
	   The administration last month spent dlrs 2 billion in a surprise
move to sell dollars and buy Japanese yen to bolster the Japanese
currency. Investors believe the administration is prepared to
launch further surprise attacks on the market if weakness in the
Japanese yen once again threatens to destabilize other Asian
currencies or force China to abandon its pledge to keep its
currency stable.
	   While the administration was careful to steer clear of any
speculation on the next prime minister, Wall Street economists
indicated they favored the dark horse candidacy of Seiroku
Kajiyama, who has pushed for a more aggressive response to Japan's
economic troubles, over the more cautious Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi.
	   Whoever is chosen, the administration let it be known that
President Clinton would like to meet with him as soon as possible,
rescheduling the now-canceled Washington visit Hashimoto was to
make next week.
	   While that visit would have been the first formal state visit by
a Japanese prime minister in 11 years, Clinton had been expected to
use his talks to press Hashimoto for more concrete commitments to
reforming the Japanese economy, including removal of barriers to
U.S. exports.
	   The U.S.-Japan trade deficit, which last year climbed to dlrs 56
billion, has been widening this year and the overall U.S. deficit
is setting monthly records as sales of American manufactured goods
and farm products to Asia plummet.
	   Even with the repudiation of Hashimoto's party at the polls,
many U.S. economists believe the ``Total Plan'' his government
produced in recent weeks to deal with the economy's biggest
problem, dlrs 530 billion in bad bank loans, is a credible effort
to resolve Japan's banking crisis.
	   But the crucial question, analysts said, will be how quickly
Hashimoto's successor and Japan's notoriously cautious bureaucracy
move to deal with a banking crisis that dwarfs America's savings
and loan crisis of the 1980s, which took six years and dlrs 125
billion in taxpayer money to resolve.

Howard: Economic reform must continue in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The world expects Japan's new prime
minister to continue the economic reform started by outgoing leader
Ryutaro Hashimoto, Prime Minister John Howard said Tuesday.
	   ``There must continue to be economic reform because Japan's
economy is so important to the world, and most particularly to our
region, and Mr. Hashimoto introduced many significant reforms,''
Howard told reporters.
	   ``I'm quite certain that there will continue to be an
expectation of continued economic reform in Japan and the world
will look to Mr. Hashimoto's successor to continue that process.''
	   Hashimoto resigned Monday in the wake of his ruling Liberal
Democratic Party's defeat in weekend elections for Japan's upper
house, attributed to anger over the ailing economy.
	   Howard said he would miss Hashimoto, whom he had worked with to
further improve relations between the two nations.
	   ``And at this crucial time, I will naturally be keen to work
very closely with his successor,'' he said.

Woman's pursuit of judgeship sparks debate in Egypt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo CAI101 of July 12 &QL; 
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Since she was a child in Cairo, Fatima
Lashin dreamed of wearing the black robes of a judge and sitting on
the bench that gave her the right to deliver justice.
	   But after more than a decade of attempts and setbacks, the
lawyer has failed to join the ranks of Egypt's judiciary. The
reason is not that she is professionally unfit; even her detractors
admit that she is qualified.
	   Rather, it is because she is a woman.
	   Lashin's case has sparked a vociferous debate in newspapers,
television and the courts in Egypt over women's rights and Islamic
law, which many scholars say bars women from serving as judges.
Some in Egypt have urged that the traditions be modified, and
perhaps rethought, to improve the lot of female professionals, as
many other Arab and Muslim countries have done.
	   For her part, Lashin sees the reform as long overdue.
	   ``I belong to a civilization where my greatest grandmothers used
to be queens and priests 5,000 years ago. But I can't be a judge
now. What an irony!'' Lashin said in an interview.
	   Her battle for the job began in 1988, two years after she
graduated from Cairo's Law College with honors. At the time, she
thought her dream was finally within reach.
	   But Lashin's application was turned down along with those of 17
male lawyers. While the men were told that they were not qualified
because of their mediocre resumes, she was told she had been
rejected because she was a woman.
	   Undaunted, she took her case to the State Council, arguing that
Egypt's constitution gives equal rights to men and women.
	   After two years of deliberations, the Council, which functions
as a government affairs court, upheld the Ministry of Justice
decision in 1990, again claiming that Islam does not permit women
to be judges.
	   Since then, she has taken her case to a succession of courts.
This year, it finally went before the country's highest court,
although no date has been set for a decision.
	   ``I came to the conclusion that if I cannot defend my own rights
as a lawyer, I will not be able to defend my clients. So I decided
to take up the challenge,'' the 34-year-old lawyer said.
	   For years, both secular and religious activists have disputed
the constitution and Egyptian law. Egypt's legal system is an often
ambiguous jumble of Islamic tradition, French law and British
regulations open to wildly different interpretations.
	   Feminists and human rights activists have argued that the
constitution, although based on Islamic law, guarantees the right
of women to hold all government posts.
	   Lashin's supporters point out that women have served in the
Egyptian Cabinet and parliament. The de facto ban on women judges,
they say, is outdated and discriminatory.
	   ``We just want the constitution to be implemented and prevent
some people from interpreting the law the way it satisfies their
ideological perceptions,'' said Mahmoud Qindil, an activist with
the Egyptian Organization of Human Rights.
	   The opposition has come from conservatives in both religious and
judicial institutions. Their typical argument is that women are
better suited to bear children and tend to the family _ duties they
say make it difficult for women to do the job properly.
	   ``The natural place for woman is the house, in the shadow behind
a man,'' Mohammed Magdi Murgan, a prominent judge in Cairo, wrote
in Egypt's prestigious Al-Ahram daily newspaper.
	   ``A woman is a woman till doomsday, and she will never be like a
man,'' another judge, Abdel Razek Ahmed Mustafa, deputy chairman of
the nation's Appeals Court, wrote in Al-Ahram.
	   Many of Lashin's opponents base their legal arguments on the
Koran, the Muslim holy book. It stipulates that two women are equal
to one man if they are called as witnesses in a court.
	   So, by analogy, they say, a woman cannot be a judge as long as
she cannot be a witness by herself.	   But last month, Lashin got an unexpected vote of support from
Minister of Religious Affairs Hamdi Zaqzouk, a German-educated
philosophy professor. He said that nothing in Islam prevents Lashin
or others of her gender from being judges.
	   ``She can be if she is fit for the job,'' Zaqzouk told Al-Wafd,
a liberal opposition newspaper.
	   Zaqzouk and others point to secular Tunisia, Iraq and Syria, all
Muslim countries in which women serve as judges. Even Iran, long
the standard-bearer of Islamic rule, has made tentative steps
toward allowing women to serve as judges in some court cases. In
December, four women were named judges in Iran's family courts.
	   If they allow it, Lashin asked, why can't Egypt?
	   ``I believe Islam is one Islam,'' she said. ``We cannot have one
interpretation there and a different one here.''

Japanese fishing boat freed by Russian boarder guards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese fishing boat captured by Russian border
guards near disputed islands last week has returned home, Japan's
coast guard said Tuesday.
	   The 9.7-ton ship and its captain, Sakae Sawano, 36, returned to
port in Nemuro on Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido on
Monday evening, said Yuta Enomoto of the Maritime Safety Agency,
Japan's coast guard.
	   Sawano and his No. 65 Eiko Maru were captured near Suishoto
Island while operating in dense fog on Friday, Enomoto said.
	   Suisho Island is one of a group of four disputed islands east of
Hokkaido seized by Soviet forces at the end of World War II. Both
Japan and Russia claim historical ownership of the islands, which
Tokyo calls the ``Northern Territories.''
	   There have been occasional shootings at Japanese fishing boats
and arrests of crewmen by Russian patrols in the area.
	   A total of five Japanese fishing boats have been captured by
Russian border guards this year. Of those, three, with a total of
18 crewmen, were still being held, the agency said.
	   The stalemate over the islands has prevented the two sides from
signing a peace treaty technically ending World War II.
	   Sawano and his crew returned home just hours after Russian Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko arrived in Japan for talks with Japanese
political and business leaders.

Gap widens between Maori and non-Maori over decade, agency says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The economic gap between the
indigenous Maori and others in New Zealand has widened in the past
decade, especially in employment and health, a government agency
reported Tuesday.
	   The position of Maori, traditionally the least-advantaged, have
slipped further since economic restructuring began in the
mid-1980s, Te Puni Kokiri (the Ministry of Maori Development) said
in a report on the status of Maori.
	   The ``Closing Gaps'' report found:
	   _Economic restructuring had caused more unemployment among Maori
than among non-Maori since the mid-1980s.
	   _Over the 1997-98 period, Maori unemployment began to increase
again, and the disparity between Maori and non-Maori is widening;
	   _In spite of gains by some Maori in some areas of economic
activity, such as self-employment and household income, the
economic position of Maori relative to non-Maori had deteriorated
further over the decade.
	   ``During this time, rental housing became less affordable and
gaps between Maori and non-Maori self-employment, household income
and home ownership widened.''
	   In health, the gaps between Maori and non-Maori rates for sudden
infant death syndrome, teen-age pregnancy, youth suicide, diabetes,
stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and mental health had all widened.
	   Also, the decline in Maori infant mortality and improvements in
life expectancy continued in the 1990s.
	   The report makes no recommendations for addressing the problems
of Maori, who make up 15 percent of New Zealand's 3.6 million
people.
	   The report also has dire predictions for the future.
	   ``Overall the evidence presented in this report does not provide
assurance that the economic and social gaps between Maori and
non-Maori are closing.
	   ``Of greater concern is that the statistics do not provide any
signals that there is an impending change in the situation,'' it
said.
	   Treasurer Winston Peters said it was to the government's credit
that it was not seeking to hide the problems.
	   ``Things are being done but it is no use as a government hiding
from reality.
	   ``There are a number of critical investments we must make in the
national interest so that we have far more ... Maori contribution
in our national economic and social framework,'' he said.
	   The government was already acting, with free medical care for
children and injections of extra funding into pre-schools.
	   ``It won't emerge just yet but you are going to see a
significant turn-around, 10, 14 years from now, you are going to
see the results from that,'' Peters said.
	   Opposition Labor Party Maori affairs spokesman Dover Samuels
said it was time for action from the government.
	   ``Maori want action, not just rhetoric,'' he said.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The architect of Australia's
world-famous Sydney Opera House has received the ``key to the
city'' from the Sydney City Council.
	   Sydney Lord Mayor Frank Sartor presented the key to Danish
designer Joern Utzon on Saturday in a small village on the Spanish
island of Majorca, a short distance from his home.
	   Only Utzon's wife Lis was present during the ceremony, the
highest honor Sydney City Council can bestow.
	   Utzon, 80, said he was genuinely honored.
	   ``My years with Sydney Opera House were the most wonderful of my
architectural life,'' he wrote in a short thank-you note, released
Tuesday.
	   Utzon has never seen his most famous work. He left Australia in
the mid 1960s following a dispute with the New South Wales
government during construction of the Opera House over changes to
his plans.

California town abuzz over arrival of Philippines-based Jollibee

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug &QL;

	   DALY CITY, California (AP) _ The first U.S. venture of the
Philippines-based Jollibee restaurant chain was an unqualified
success to judge from the carloads of the hungry, homesick and
merely curious arriving for lunch in this San Francisco suburb.
	   At the grand opening in June, the 2-hour wait at the drive-in to
place orders for a 10-minute meal strained the concept of ``fast
food.''
	   Inside, workers clad in yellow and black ``bee'' uniforms were
dishing out JolliMeals _ and plates of JolliSpaghetti, Jolli-Hot
Dogs and Chickenjoys _ at a rate of five per minute.
	   Why the fuss?
	   ``The food's good, but it's really not about the food,'' said
17-year-old Janice Dario as she fiddled with a pile of cooling
french fries. ``I think it's the name.''
	   Indeed, an untrained palate finds the food unremarkable. A
JolliMeal Champburger offers hints of garlic and soy flavor, but
could easily be slipped, unnoticed, between two buns of a Big Mac.
The crispy Chickenjoy dish might have been baked by the famed
Kentucky colonel.
	   Connoisseurs beg to differ.
	   ``In the chicken, the secret's in the skin _ you've got to
really taste the skin,'' said 12-year-old Carlo Ang, who was doing
just that.
	   Ang, forced to dine with his friends on a curb because the
75-seat restaurant was full, continued: ``And the spaghetti is
better than you get in the United States. It's got Filipino flavor.
It's cheesier. And it's sweeter. A sweet, tomatoey taste. I can't
really describe it _ I guess a lot of Filipinos just like it.''
	   A couple of dishes are unusual by American standards, including
the Aloha Burger, which includes a slab of pineapple, and a pie
that blends peaches with mangoes grown in the Philippines.
	   Jollibee marketing director Jay Visco said all the recipes are
indeed unique, but offered few other clues. ``Most of that's
secret,'' he said.
	   Founded in 1978 in Manila as an ice cream parlor, Jollibee built
a 290-restaurant empire in the Philippines, easily outselling
McDonald's while capturing half of that country's overall fast-food
market.
	   In recent years, the company has opened restaurants in 12
countries, including China, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia.
	   Its first U.S. venture met with such vigorous response in Daly
City _ where one-third of the 110,000 residents are of Filipino
descent _ that the company is considering opening in several other
California cities, including Vallejo and San Jose, both with
substantial Filipino populations.
	   Eventually, the chain plans to expand to other states.
	   ``That fits with our strategy, which is to begin building with
the Filipino community, and expand from there,'' Visco said.
``Already, we're getting a good mix of other ethnic groups.''
	   Manny Alvior, 48, moved to Daly City in the mid-1980s after
growing up in the Philippines, where he managed to avoid a single
Jollibee meal. But he was among the first to try the U.S. version.
	   ``My kids kept saying, 'I want to go to Jollibee. Take us to
Jollibee.' So we came. The food's just OK, but we'll be back _ the
kids like it,'' he said.
	   While the restaurant's success to date has been a word-of-mouth
phenomenon, Manny and Helen Saunders came for practical concerns:
They were looking for food after their car broke down nearby.
	   Both were lured in by the gargantuan inflated bumblebee perched
atop the restaurant, its thumbs stretched upward and its red cap
vaguely resembling a pair of arches.
	   ``It needs more tomatoes, lettuce, things like that,'' said Mrs.
Saunders, after gobbling down her first Champburger with fries.
	   ``Yeah _ but the patty's not as fatty as you get at the other
chains,'' said her husband. more satisfied with his fare. ``Not bad
for junk food.''

U.S. manages compromise statement on Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statement adopted, also calls on Israel not to
proceed with decision &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States managed to head off a
Security Council resolution that would have condemned Israel for
trying to expand Jerusalem's boundaries.
	   The 15-member council instead approved a compromise presidential
statement that calls Israel's June 21 decision ``a serious and
damaging development.'' It also calls on Israel not to proceed with
the expansion of Jerusalem's boundaries.
	   Heading into the late-night council meeting, U.S. Ambassador
Bill Richardson called the statement the ``appropriate response to
the current circumstances.''
	   ``The United States would have vetoed a resolution condemning
Israel, or blocked any action designed to nullify what had
happened,'' Richardson said.
	   An Arab-sponsored resolution would have condemned Israel for the
move and demanded it be rescinded. The measure was softened to a
presidential statement after repeated U.S. objections and intense,
high-level negotiations between Washington and Arab capitals, said
the U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Such a statement doesn't carry the weight of international law
that a resolution does and is adopted by consensus.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson has said the United States
regretted Israel's decision to extend Jerusalem's boundaries to
include several towns and expand some municipal services from
Jerusalem to West Bank settlements. However, a U.N. resolution
condemning the move would inflame passions and hinder U.S.
diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled Middle East peace process,
he has said.
	   Washington could have vetoed a resolution, but doing so is
considered a diplomatic setback because it would have implied that
Washington couldn't negotiate a compromise.
	   The draft statement said it supported U.S. efforts at breaking
the deadlock.
	   It noted that both the Palestinians and Israel agreed in
previous peace accords that permanent status negotiations would
cover the issue of Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the
capital of a future state.
	   ``The council therefore calls upon the parties to avoid actions
which might prejudice the outcome of these negotiations,'' the
draft said.
	   Israeli's U.N. ambassador, Dore Gold, said the council should
never have taken up the issue, which he has called a municipal one
that had no place before the council.
	   ``From 1948 to 1967, the U.N. Security Council never met once to
consider the destruction of 58 synagogues in the Old City of
Jerusalem, the expulsion of its Jewish inhabitants and the denial
of Jewish access to the Western Wall,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
	   He said the statement actually ``contravenes the Oslo peace
agreements, which provide that Jerusalem remains under exclusive
Israeli jurisdiction while being an issue for permanent status
negotiations.''
	   Israel maintains that as a municipal decision, the June 21 move
is preserving and protecting the city _ not altering it _ and is
acting in accordance with the Oslo agreements.
	   Israeli diplomats, speaking on condition that they not be
identified, said Israel recognized that the Palestinians didn't
reach their original goal by passing a resolution. They emphasized
that what was important was for both sides to get on with permanent
status negotiations.

Council calls on Congo, Rwanda to prosecute, ready to take other
</HEADLINE>
measures &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statement endorsed. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council called on Congo and
Rwanda to prosecute their citizens for human rights violations
stemming from alleged massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees during
Laurent Kabila's sweep across Congo in 1996-97.
	   A presidential statement endorsed late Monday by the 15-member
council made no mention of suggestions by U.N. human rights
investigators that an international tribunal prosecute the crimes
if Congo and Rwanda are unable or unwilling to do so.
	   But the council, apparently aware of this possibility, said it
was ready to consider ``additional steps to ensure that the
perpetrators of the massacres, other atrocities and violations of
international humanitarian law are brought to justice.''
	   It requested both countries report back to the U.N. chief by
Oct. 15 on progress made toward investigating and prosecuting those
responsible.
	   The tribunal recommendation was made in a report by the U.N.
human rights team which was pulled from Congo in April because of
what the United Nations said was a complete lack of cooperation
from the government.
	   The team was sent in August to investigate massacres of Rwandan
Hutu refugees allegedly carried out by Kabila's rebel forces during
their victorious march across the African nation of Zaire. In May
1997, Kabila took power in Zaire and renamed it Congo.
	   The Rwandan Hutu refugees had fled across the border to Zaire to
escape punishment for the 1994 Hutu-sponsored massacre of an
estimated half-million Tutsis. Rwanda's Tutsi-led government
supported Kabila in his successful campaign to oust Mobutu Sese
Seko.
	   Though admittedly incomplete because of the aborted mission, the
U.N. report gave evidence of Rwandan involvement in the massacres
of hundreds of unarmed civilians by troops loyal to Kabila. It also
documented Congolese government attempts to cover up the massacres
by removing bodies from a mass grave at Mbandaka.
	   The investigators suggested the international tribunal
prosecuting the Rwandan genocide be expanded to try what it said
were serious violations of human rights and breaches of
humanitarian law that may constitute genocide.
	   Such a move could only be made if the local judicial systems
were judged inadequate or unwilling to handle the work.
	   Congo strongly rejected the findings of the report, raising
questions about whether local courts had the ability or the
political will to prosecute the crimes.
	   Congo said it was, however, willing to try any of its citizens.
It requested aid from the international community to reform and
rebuild its judicial system.
	   The statement calls on member states to provide the necessary
equipment and other assistance to help develop local judicial
systems.
	   China had been unenthusiastic about adopting a statement, and
had objected to any reference to the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, diplomatic sources said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The current draft makes no such reference.

Dollar slips in Tokyo, Japanese stocks mixed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES thruout with midday trading figures; other details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen in early
trading Tuesday on speculation some central banks in Asia sold U.S.
Treasury bonds. Japanese stock prices were mixed.
	   The dollar bought 141.20 yen in Tokyo, down 1.22 yen from late
Monday and also below its late New York rate of 141.42 overnight.
	   Traders cited unconfirmed speculation in the currency market
that several unidentified Asian central banks sold U.S. Treasuries
overnight as one reason for the dollar's drop against the yen.
	   Sales of Treasuries hurts the dollar because it can decrease
demand for the U.S. currency.
	   Also supporting the Japanese currency were expectations the big
loss suffered by Japan's ruling party in elections held Sunday
could force the government to take more drastic economic stimulus
measures, traders said.
	   The Liberal Democrat's defeat was viewed as a vote of
no-confidence in the party's efforts to revive the Japanese
economy, which has entered its worst recession since World War II.
	   But dollar-yen trading is likely to stay within a narrow range
until a successor is named for outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, who announced his intention to resign Monday, they said.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party was expected to name a new
head on July 21.
	   Despite the setback in the upper house polls, the party remains
firmly in control of the government because it has a majority in
the more powerful lower house.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, share prices remained
little changed in early trading Tuesday as investors took to the
sidelines amid uncertainty over who will succeed Hashimoto.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average fell 14.69 points,
or 0.09 percent, to 16,345.70 as of midday. On Monday, the index
had gained 270.33 points, or 1.68 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 1.78 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,258.22. The
TOPIX closed up 14.94 points, or 1.20 percent, the previous day.
	   In fixed-income security trading, the yield on the benchmark No.
182 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.435 percent from
Monday's finish of 1.415 percent, driving its price down to 110.18
yen from 110.33 yen.

Manhunt continues as Seoul reviews its engagement policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean security forces expanded
a search for possible North Korean intruders Tuesday as Seoul began
looking for a stick to go along with the carrots it has been
offering its communist neighbor.
	   ``All measures are being taken to expand the dragnet and block
the likely escape routes on the east coast,'' said Col. Hwang
Dong-kyu, a spokesman for the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff.
	   In addition to tens of thousands of soldiers already
participating in the three-day-old search, government officials
said they were considering mobilizing tens of thousands of
reservists.
	   With a dusk-to-dawn curfew in force on the east coast, soldiers
and police laid ambushes or searched rugged mountains and deep
valleys. But they have found no traces of intruders so far.
	   The manhunt began after a diving suit-clad body was found washed
ashore near a major naval base at Donghae, 195 kilometers (117
miles) east of Seoul, Sunday.
	   Also found with or near the man's body were a submachine gun, a
hand grenade and an underwater propulsion device similar to ones
used by North Korean intruders in the past.
	   South Korean officials believe the dead man was one of three
North Korean agents and that the other two came ashore and may be
trying to return to the North by land.
	   It was the third North Korean infiltration reported along the
east coast, coming less than three weeks after a northern submarine
was found tangled in a fishing net on June 22.
	   Nine bodies were found in the Yugo-class sub, all shot to death
in what military investigators described as a murder-suicide
committed by senior officers to avoid capture.
	   On Sept. 18, 1996, a shark-class North Korean submarine was
found stranded in the same general area, touching off a 53-day
manhunt for the craft's 26 occupants.
	   The manhunt by 60,000 soldiers, reservists and police left 37
people dead _ 24 North Koreans and 13 South Koreans _ and sent
relations between North and South Korea plunging to their lowest
level in years.
	   A North Korean infiltrator from that submarine was captured and
another was believed to have returned to the North across the land
border.
	   The latest incursion put a strain on President Kim Dae-jung's
policy of trying to open up the North's reclusive society through
expanded civilian economic, cultural and personal exchanges
	   The policy already has been criticized as naive by his
conservative opposition.
	   After a meeting of Cabinet ministers late Monday night, national
security adviser Lim Dong-won said the government will stick to its
engagement policy but slow the pace of its economic assistance.
	   ``We have to take a firm stand,'' Lim told reporters.
	   He said specific South Korean countermeasures will be announced
after a full national security meeting to be held Wednesday,
presided over by President Kim.
	   Government officials said those countermeasures would include a
strong denunciation of North Korea and a report to the U.N.
Security Council detailing the latest spy incursion.
	   The Koreas remain technically at war with no peace treaty signed
at the end of their 1950-53 war.

Amid political vacuum, power blocs jockey to grab prime minister's
</HEADLINE>
post &QL; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Power blocs within Japan's ruling party scrambled
Tuesday to get a lead in the race to replace Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, who stepped down after voters dealt the party a major
defeat at the polls over the weekend.
	   Several possible contenders _ including Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi and former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama _ have
emerged. The ruling Liberal Democrats are expected to vote on
Hashimoto's successor as early as next Tuesday.
	   But the party's top contenders are better known for their savvy
at winning the party's endless factional wrangling than for their
prowess on economic policy _ and criticism was already growing that
neither would be best to steer Japan out of its deepest recession
in decades.
	   ``The kind of prime minister we need is someone who has
commitment and ability to face Japan's economic problems and tackle
reforms from a deep and broad viewpoint,'' the liberal Asahi, a
major newspaper, said in an editorial Tuesday.
	   ``The Liberal Democrats should know better than dwelling on
their tradition of pre-arranging their own party colleagues to hand
over the reigns.''
	   Japan's political precedent _ if followed _ would limit the
choice of new leader to a short list of politicians who have been
long faithful to the ruling party.
	   Among those widely speculated on as the leading candidates were
Obuchi, Kajiyama and Health and Welfare Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
	   In a survey of 55 top corporate executives published Tuesday by
the Nihon Keizai newspaper, only 16 named anyone they favored as a
replacement for Hashimoto.
	   Of that group, 13 tapped Kajiyama, who has had experience
drafting economic policy within the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party.
	   Hashimoto announced his resignation Monday after his
conservative ruling party faced a humiliating loss in Sunday's
elections. The Liberal Democrats won just 44 of the 126 seats
contested in the upper house of Parliament, losing 17 seats in all.
	   The LDP hopes to nominate a successor on July 21. Official
approval by Parliament is expected, at the earliest, around the end
of this month.
	   Hashimoto will serve until a successor is chosen _ but is little
more than a caretaker, and his sudden resignation is already
causing waves of confusion.
	   Hashimoto has canceled his official visits to the United States
and France, both scheduled for later this month.
	   And in what can only be considered the worst of timing, Russian
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko was to complete a two day stay in
Tokyo Tuesday that was completely overshadowed by the political
upheaval.
	   Obuchi, meanwhile, squelched a China visit that was to have
begun Wednesday.
	   ``I am aware that my name is mentioned as a possible successor,
but I'm here only to accomplish my duty as foreign minister,''
Obuchi said Tuesday.
	   ``I'm not thinking about any `ifs,''' he said.
	   Koizumi, supported by young reformist Liberal Democrats, said
the choice of the new leader should reflect the voters' message of
anger at the party's failure to ease Japan's economic problems.
	   ``It's no good just to change faces,'' he said.
	   With the Liberal Democrats still holding the majority in the
more powerful Lower House, they will continue to rule. The chamber
can pass the national budget and choose the prime minister without
upper house approval.

East Timor's governor calls for calm as thousands flee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian-appointed governor of
East Timor has reportedly called for calm as thousands of people
flee the troubled territory amid fears of a new outbreak of violent
protests.
	   The exodus comes ahead of a planned visit to Indonesia later
this week by Jamsheed Marker, the United Nations' special envoy for
the former Portuguese colony.
	   Fearing attack by indigenous Timorese, at least 20,000
non-Timorese Indonesian settlers have fled since late last month.
Some have driven across the land border into West Timor. Many have
returned by boat to homes on other islands.
	   Officials and some immigrants said they were scared by possible
mass protests during Marker's visit and the 22nd anniversary on
Friday of Indonesia's annexation of the half-island territory.
	   ``I am appealing to all people from other provinces...to wisely
assess the situation,'' Gov. Abilio Soares was quoted as saying by
the Jakarta Post on Tuesday.
	   ``I ask you to report to the authorities whoever is spreading
rumors or riots and demonstrations,'' he said.
	   Several protesters have been shot to death by Indonesian troops
recently during pro-independence demonstrations. There have also
been clashes between rival groups who either want East Timor to
break away from Indonesia or to remain part of it.
	   Because of security concerns, it was unclear Tuesday whether
Marker will visit East Timor or conduct meetings elsewhere in
Indonesia.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, and annexed it a year
later. The United Nations, Portugal and many other governments
refuse to recognize Indonesian sovereignty over the territory.
	   Over the past two decades, East Timor has endured a guerrilla
war and human rights abuses. Animosity between settlers from other
islands and indigenous Timorese is rife. Many Timorese complain
they remain poor as outsiders make money in the underdeveloped
territory.
	   Demonstrations on East Timor have intensified in recent weeks
following the resignation of ex-President Suharto in May.
	   His successor, B.J. Habibie, has promised more democracy and
offered to grant a measure of autonomy to East Timor in return for
international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty.
	   However, Habibie has rejected a demand from separatists to hold
a referendum on possible independence.
	   On Monday, the military warned East Timorese protesters not to
fly flags belonging to the Fretilin guerrilla group.

Chinese dissident freed, appeals for release of colleagues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese democracy campaigner who had been
detained with eight others for setting up a political party has
called for the release of colleagues still being held by
authorities in China, a human rights group said Tuesday.
	   Police escorted activist Cheng Fan from eastern Hangzhou city to
his home in Wenzhou, 250 kilometers (150 miles) to the south, and
then released him Monday night, the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement reported.
	   With Cheng's release, four of the nine organizers of the China
Democracy Party rounded up Friday remain in custody. Three of them
have been formally arrested.
	   The families of two of these dissidents, Wang Youcai and Zhu
Yufu, have sent clothes to the detention center in Hangzhou, as per
instructions from police _ a sign they could be held in custody for
a long time, the Information Center said.
	   The day U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in China last month,
Wang and others announced the that they were setting up a new party
_ the China Democracy Party _ to oppose the ruling Communist
Party's political monopoly.
	   Authorities immediately began detaining the organizers for brief
periods of time and refused to allow them to register the group, as
required by law. Friday's roundup came a week after Clinton ended
his China visit.
	   Upon his release Monday night, Cheng Fan and fellow democracy
campaigner Zhai Weimin sent a petition to Jiang Zemin calling for
the release of those still in custody, the Information Center said.
	   Their attempts to register the China Democracy Party ``did not
violate any law,'' the Information Center quoted the letter as
saying.

Report: Islamic party to host conference on Kashmir and Palestine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's opposition Islamic
party plans an international conference on Kashmir and Palestine, a
newspaper said Tuesday.
	   The two-day conference will begin in the northeastern town of
Kota Baru on July 24, Mustafa Ali, vice president of Parti Islam
SeMalaysia, or PAS, was quoted as saying by the New Straits Times
daily.
	   Kota Baru is in the Muslim-dominated state of Kelantan that PAS
controls.
	   ``Our objective is to expose the realities and developments of
the Muslim struggle in Kashmir and Palestine,'' said Mustafa.
	   Representatives from the Pakistan-based Islamic Movement for
Kashmir, the Palestinian radical group Hamas, and Indonesian
opposition leader Amien Rais, are among those likely to attend, the
daily said.
	   ``There has not been any international concern over the people's
plight'' in Kashmir, Mustafa told reporters on Monday.
	   Kashmir is divided between predominantly Hindu India and Islamic
Pakistan, with both sides claiming the Muslim-majority region as
its own. Two of the three wars between the South Asian nations have
been fought over Kashmir.
	   ``At least regarding Palestine, there is this so-called brokered
peace process spearheaded by the United States,'' Mustafa said.

World Cup TV ratings in America are close to nil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSH DUBOW &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The biggest upset in a World Cup final in nearly
five decades was of little help to ABC's television ratings.
	   The 40-market overnight rating for Sunday's final between Brazil
and France, produced a 6.9 rating/17 share, 46 percent lower than
the 12.8 overnight for the Brazil-Italy final in 1994.
	   When the final U.S. numbers are released Thursday, ABC should
show about a 50 percent drop in ratings for 12 games. The U.S.
rating for the final should be approximately equal to this year's
rating for the Indianapolis 500.
	   The plunge stems largely from the poor performance of the U.S.
team and the limited attention paid to an event in Europe.
	   ``We had realistic expectations for the World Cup, but we don't
only measure the success of the tournament by those numbers,'' said
ABC Sports spokesman Mark Mandel.
	   A rating point for ABC represents 980,000 households. A share is
the percentage of televisions tuned to a show.
	   Disney-owned ABC and ESPN were expected to show a modest profit
on the dlrs 22 million rights fees. The three networks, which have
signed a long-term deal to show Major League Soccer games, remain
committed to the sport.
	   ``Because the tournament is the world's biggest athletic
competition, it gives ABC and ESPN international cachet and
provides enormous amounts of quality programming for more than a
month,'' Mandel said.
	   Spanish-language Univision was not hurt by the factors that
afflicted its English-language rivals, drawing a 22.2/46 for the
final. The 1.715 million households tuned into the game were a
Univision World Cup record.
	   The tournament as a whole brought Univision an average of
850,000 households for the 56 live games, easily eclipsing ESPN
(670,000 households) and ESPN2 (114,000).
	   While ESPN's ratings fell 50 percent and ESPN2 dropped 38
percent, the ratings were considerably higher than the two
networks' regular programming, with games rating between 33 and 300
percent higher than usual programming.
	   ESPN's ratings were hurt by the six-hour time difference with
France, which put games in the morning and afternoon in the East
Coast, instead of afternoon and night.
	   That is a problem that will worsen in 2002, when the World Cup
is played in South Korea and Japan, forcing even earlier starting
times.
