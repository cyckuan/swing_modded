<TEXT>
<P>
Q: Are you ruling out an agreement on WTO during this trip? Are
you saying that you believe it's impossible?
</P>
<P>
A: When I just said "It's impossible" a moment ago, I was
referring to the reply of the U.S. side to my suggestion that we
make an announcement that we have reached agreement on a certain
number of the issues. It was the United States representative, not
us, who said "It's impossible".
</P>
<P>
Q: If you give us the details of what's agreed on, we'll be
happy to tell the business community what your proposals are.
</P>
<P>
A: Then Madame Barshefsky will become even tougher, won't she?
I think that this visit won't be very easy for me. As a Chinese
saying goes, "Neither side will be pleased". On one side, some
Americans are not particularly welcoming me, and on the other side,
some Chinese don't want me to go. So I think that I will have a
very difficult task.
</P>
<P>
Q: We have roughly 10 or 20 other questions we'd like to ask
you. We wonder whether that'll be all right.
</P>
<P>
A: I will have another interview with some Canadian reporters
shortly.
</P>
<P>
Q: You clearly view the American business community as
supportive of better US-China relations, at the same time it would
appear that foreign investment in China is actually declining. Is
that the case, and what are reasons for that, and what can be done
to reverse that?
</P>
<P>
A: In fact, foreign investment, including US investment in
China, has been increasing every year. Last year there was a
growth over the previous year. It's not true to say that foreign
investment in China is decreasing. That's not the case at all.  (

<TEXT>
<P>
Last year foreign direct investment in China was 45.9 billion U.
S. dollars, surpassing the 45 billion dollars of the previous year.
In January and February of this year, there was a slight decrease
in comparison with that of the same period last year, but it was
basically at the same level.
</P>
<P>
But one cannot read much into a period of only one or two
months. We expect that there will be an even more marked increase
this year in foreign investment in China, because the investment
environment in China is obviously much better than that in certain
Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
When we open up the sectors and industries I have just
mentioned, telecommunications in particular, foreign investment
will come into China in even larger amounts.
</P>
<P>
Q: I'd like to ask you a somewhat more philosophical question.
Is greater political pluralism an inevitable result of the
increasing economic liberalization that you're undertaking, or is
political pluralism actually a precondition for successful
economic liberalization? I wonder how you view the connection
between these two.
</P>
<P>
A: Politics and economics are interactive. It is true that
economics determines the direction of political movement, but
politics has an impact on economic matters. As regards how you and
I understand and interpret the definition of so-called economic
liberalization and political pluralism, this is another matter.

<TEXT>
<P>
Q: You've just referred to the goal of a constructive strategic
partnership towards which our two countries are going to build, a
goal which President Clinton and President Jiang set together. But
some people think that in fact it is still a long way from this
kind of relationship at this point. Are there some specific things
other than the WTO issue that the United States could do to make
this more likely to become what is called a strategic partnership?
</P>
<P>
A: On our part, we are determined and have made persistent
efforts to build towards a constructive strategic partnership as
President Jiang and President Clinton have promoted.
</P>
<P>
We have felt all along that China is not a potential rival of
the U.S., let alone an enemy of the U.S., but rather, is a
reliable friend of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Commitment to establishing this kind of a constructive
strategic partnership does not mean that we approve of every
foreign or domestic policy of the U.S. The converse is also true.
I believe that even the closest of U.S. allies won't necessarily
agree with all U.S. policies or policy actions.
</P>
<P>
Q: Given that the US is, at this point in history, the sole
superpower, what kind of grade would you give the U.S. in
exercising that unique sole superpower role?
</P>
<P>
A: It is appropriate to say that the U.S. is a superpower in
the world of today. However, a review of the human history shows
that it is not easy and not without risks to serve as a superpower.
History shows that no superpower remains a superpower forever.
Therefore, I feel that as a superpower, the U.S. should act
responsibly. In dealing with other countries, the United States
should pay attention to democracy, freedom and equality as it
advocates.

<P>
Q: Are you saying that we don't do that? That there's room for
improvement in the way the U.S. is handling itself?
</P>
<P>
A: No one can claim infallibility or perfection.
</P>
<P>
Q: On one issue there seems to be controversy between our two
governments at this point, the theater defense missile systems in
Asia. Why does China seem to feel threatened by defensive missile
systems for a country like Japan? Why is this seen as threatening
here?
</P>
<P>
A: We feel that building TMD contravenes the existing
international anti-missile treaties. Development of a TMD system
is not conducive to world peace. This is how we feel. What we are
opposed to is including Taiwan in this system. This constitutes
interference in China's sovereignty and internal affairs. This
also violates the three principles of the three Sino-U.S. Joint
Communiques and the Joint Statement by the two presidents.
</P>
<P>
Q: Okay, the concern is purely about Taiwan being covered by
such a defense system, and not about other countries?
</P>
<P>
A: I'm not sure you've heard clearly what I just said. I
divided my comments into two parts. The first comment was my view
of TMD, which is that it goes against international regulations of
missile agreements and treaties and is not conducive to world
peace. That was my first comment. My second comment was that China
is opposed to the inclusion of Taiwan in this system.
</P>
<P>
Q: I'd like to ask a few more questions that might help
Americans know you better as you arrive in the U.S. You are often
described as a pragmatist, a reformer, or a moderate -- I realize
all these labels can be overly simplistic, but how would you
succinctly describe yourself?
</P>
<P>
A: I can only say that I am an ordinary Chinese and at the same
time the Premier of China.

A: At a press conference last year, I answered a reporter's
question about this. At that time, I said that I didn't want to, I
was not willing to - and I didn't think it necessary to-once again
talk about this unhappy experience.
</P>
<P>
Q: I have taken note of that. We only thought we could try again.
Please give us a useful answer.
</P>
<P>
A: I could add one comment to this. Though that period of my
life was a painful experience for me, it was also a useful one. It
taught me more and allowed me a wider range of exposure to social
strata. Speaking about it today, I should say that the Chinese
Communist Party and Government have learned enough lessons from
the past.
</P>
<P>
Q: Would it be fair to say that the experience has made you
more tolerant of different points of view and made your views more
diversified?
</P>
<P>
A: Perhaps so.

Q: One of the main images Americans would have of China, and
perhaps one of the lasting images of the latter part of this
century is that photograph of a young man standing in front of a
tank in 1989. In retrospect, can I ask you what you think of that
man? Was he being brave? Was he being foolish? Was he misguided?
</P>
<P>
A: That photograph appears frequently on television in the U.S.
and in other countries. Lately it seems to appear less frequently.
There's another photograph that left a deep impression on me. It's
a photo of a young naked girl in Vietnam, running on a road in a
bombed area. That girl is still in the U.S. now. We all hope not
to see the recurrence of such things. But there's one thing
entirely different that everyone should think about: The man who
faced the tank, but the tank did not crush him. It avoided him.
Everyone should think over what this was really about.
</P>
<P>
Q: You have, I think, several times in the past, expressed some
degree of frustration at your ability to get accurate information,
or at least statistical information on the Chinese economy. How
big of a problem is this for you, particularly in trying to set up
economic policy?
</P>
<P>
A: This question comes from the fact that the Chinese economic
growth rate last year reached 7.8 percent, while many Southeast
Asian nations experienced a negative growth. Many people doubt the
accuracy of the figure. To be honest, as I said before, I admit
that this figure is somewhat inflated. But this kind of inflation
did not begin from last year, and the figure for last year was not
more inflated than in the past. Because we paid greater attention
to checking the accuracy of the figure, and we repeatedly enjoined
lower level governments not to provide false statistics. As we
have often stressed this, the statistics were far less inflated
than before.

<HEADLINE> (Urgent)European Central Bank Sinks Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

BONN, April 8 (Xinhua) --The European Central Bank lowered its
major lending rate from 3.0 to 2.5 per cent. The decision was
announced Thursday in Frankfurt following a ECB council meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ECB also sank its two other key rates, the rate on marginal
lending facility from 4.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent, and the rate
on deposit facility from 2.0 per cent to 1.5 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The reduction, far bigger than most analysts had expected
earlier Thursday before the meeting, was aimed at boosting the
weak economy of the 11 Eurolands, ECB President Wim Duisenberg
said.

<P>
The statistical system was initially learned from the USSR in
the 1950s. After reform and opening up to the outside world began
in 1979, we made some revisions in accord with U.S. and
international statistical practice. Now, we've had approximately
50 years of experience in statistical work.
</P>
<P>
I believe that it is improper and also unfair to say that all
the figures are inaccurate, or all of them are inflated. Perhaps
there are now millions of people doing statistical work in China.
</P>
<P>
I cannot say that the statistics are very accurate, but I think
it is fair to say that our industrial and business figures are
quite accurate. Some statistics from rural areas may not be as
accurate, because they cover too wide a range. However, these
statistics are collected every year and can be used for comparison
from year to year.

<HEADLINE> German Unemployment Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 8 (Xinhua)--German unemployment dropped in March to
about 4.289 million, or 11.1 percent, the Federal Labor Office
said Thursday in Nuremberg.
</P>
<P>
The figure was 176,400 lower than in February, when the jobless
rate was 11.6 percent, and was down 334,900 compared to March
1998, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Bernhard Jagoda, the president of the office, attributed the
reduction of joblessness in March to the usual seasonal factors.
He predicted a drop of about the same volume during April as in
March.
</P>
<P>
Jagoda noted an increase in job offerings in March, when a
total 402,000 job offers were 9 per cent higher than in March
1998.
</P>
<P>
However,in viewing of the country's current economic weakness,
a greater decline is not possible, Jagoda said.
</P>
<P>
The office report showed there remained a huge deference in the
jobless rates of western and eastern Germany, with the
unemployment in the east running at double that of the west.
</P>
<P>
In eastern Germany, the unemployment figure was 1.392 million,
or a rate of 18.4 per cent, while in the west the figures were
2.897 million and 9.3 per cent respectively, the office
reported.

Q: When I spoke to you in 1993, inflation was 25 percent,
economic growth had been over 10 percent for 12 or 13 years, and
you were given the job of making a soft landing. There was great
speculation that you wouldn't be able to do it. But you obviously
succeeded. Now the challenge seems to be how you keep the economy
grow at a satisfactory rate, 7 percent or 8 percent for example.
Is this challenge harder than that one or was that challenge
harder than this one?
</P>
<P>
A: I believe that the difficulty I faced in 1993 was inflation.
The difficulty I now face is deflation, the continual dropping of
prices.
</P>
<P>
Experience over the past few centuries has taught the Chinese
to fear inflation more than anything else. China almost has never
experienced a period of deflation before. The overwhelming
majority of the Chinese people are not aware of the dangers of
deflation. But a few of us see the danger.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, my task is now much easier than that of controlling
inflation, because the general public don't need to worry about
inflation. They are quite at ease.

<HEADLINE> UK Starts Debate on Stress at Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The British Health and Safety
Commission (HSC) is launching a 30-page discussion document on
whether stress at work should be regulated under health and safety
legislation.
</P>
<P>
The document says up to half a million people a year develop
stress at work. But it is a difficult condition to diagnose and
correct.
</P>
<P>
Frank Davies, Chairman of the HSC, said: "Stress is a difficult
issue not only for employers and employees to manage, but also for
us as a regulator."
</P>
<P>
"Because there are such wide-ranging opinions about stress, we
have decided we need the views of a wide audience before deciding
how to take this forward," he added.
</P>
<P>
The document will serve as a basis for a series of meetings on
stress on work which the HSC is holding across Britain in June and
July as it attempts to shape its policy on stress.
</P>
<P>
The document contains a draft approved code of practice on
stress at work. If there was support for this it would mean that
if employers failed to follow it they could be prosecuted in
court.
</P>
<P>
Researchers estimated stress cost British industry 7 billion
pounds a year (11 billion U.S. dollars) -- or two to three percent
of gross domestic product.

<P>
Q: What is the danger of deflation?
</P>
<P>
A: Now the people are saving greater part of their money in our
banks. The savings rate now is 40 percent or 50 percent, I'm not
very clear.
</P>
<P>
But the banks cannot loan the money out, because they can't
find appropriate projects to lend the money to.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the national economy faces risk of a slowdown of the
growth rate. The oversupply of products and the drop in prices
have made it difficult for enterprises in terms of operations.
</P>
<P>
So now we have begun to implement a pro-active fiscal policy,
building infrastructure projects and stimulating consumer demand,
to increase the purchasing power of the people and galvanize the
development of production.
</P>
<P>
I would like to make one more remark. Many foreigners,
including Americans, believe that, due to the adverse effects of
the Southeast Asian financial crisis and the floods, China's
reforms were not carried out according to the original plan, and
were slowed down greatly. This is a far cry from the truth.
</P>
<P>
In fact, great progress was made last year in the reforms
planned by the current Chinese government. They were carried out
in compliance with the original plan and even by surpassing it. I
don't have time to go into detail on this issue, and perhaps we'll
see each other again in the U.S.!

BRUSSELS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) has agreed to launch a humanitarian relief
action, entitled "Operation Allied Harbor", NATO political
spokesman Jamie Shea said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Shea told reporters that the North Atlantic Council, NATO's
decision-making body, discussed humanitarian situation in and
around Kosovo and the alliance is ready to start such a relief
action.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the verge of launching Operation Allied Harbor, our
operation to provide military support to the internation relief
effort in Albania. Today at shape there is an initial logistics
planning conference for this operation," he told a daily news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also told reporters that the operation involves
deployments of the 8th mobile force headquarters together with a
companying force which will probably be around 8,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to be able to deploy the 8th mobile force headquarters
to Albania by the end of next week with some lead companies," Shea
said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, NATO countries continue to be active in
Albania, particular in establishing a helicopter supply route
between Tirana and Kukes on the border," he said, adding that more
helicopters have been provided by allies this morning through that
effort.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Child Abuse Becomes Major Public Health Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Child abuse has become a major
public health problem worldwide with 40 million children aged 0-14
suffering from abuse and neglect and requiring health and social
care, said the World Health Organization (WHO) here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Abused children suffer a wide variety of physical, emotional
and developmental problems which can hamper their ability to live
healthy and productive lives," said Dr Bjorn Thylefors, Director
of WHO's Division on Disability, Injury Prevention and
Rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to health consequences, abused children have
difficulty in school, problems with substance abuse and problems
with the law," he said. "It is a public health issue of vital
importance for WHO, and it represents a challenge for the next
millennium."
</P>
<P>
A number of different international studies conducted in 19
countries have reported prevalence rates for sexual abuse ranging
from seven percent to 34 percent among girls and from three
percent to 29 percent among boys.
</P>
<P>
The burden of ill health caused by injury is staggering in
terms of cost and socio-economic development. One study from the
United States, for example, shows that the costs for two million
child abuse victims is 12.4 billion U.S. dollars for one year.
</P>
<P>
Programs undertaken in some countries have shown that it is
possible to reduce the prevalence of child abuse when parents are
provided training in parenting skills before and after birth in a
supportive environment by nursing personnel and/or community
health workers, according to WHO. These programs work best if they
are child-centered, family-focused and community-based.
</P>
<P>
Major initiatives which the experts recommended be undertaken
by the international community include:
</P>
<P>
-- The development of worldwide data collection on child abuse
and estimates of the public health impact and related costs;
</P>
<P>
-- Sharing of interventions and best practices which are
successful in the prevention of child abuse and neglect;
</P>
<P>
-- Continuing evaluation and research on child abuse
prevention;
</P>
<P>
-- Development of national programs for the prevention of child
abuse, as well as for programs that provide social support to
victims and families.

<HEADLINE> China, Pakistan Determined to Further Cement Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China and Pakistan expressed
their determination here Thursday to promote the vigorous and
all-round partnership of cooperation between the two countries to
a new height.
</P>
<P>
The time-tested Sino-Pakistani friendship and the friendly and
cooperative relations between the two neighbors will continue to
grow in strength in the 21st century, parliament leaders of China
and Pakistan agreed, as Li Peng, China's top legislator, began his
four-day official goodwill visit here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a banquet hosted in honor of the visiting Chinese
leader, Ellahi Bukhsh Soomro, speaker of Pakistan's National
Assembly, said the close friendship between Pakistan and China is
"a time-tested and all-weather relationship."
</P>
<P>
"The ties between our two countries are based on the immutable
principles of interstate relations, not on shallow expediency,"
Soomro said, adding that the Pakistan-China relations will
continue to grow in strength in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Pakistan would continue to extend its
"unconditional, full and constant support" to China on such issues
as Taiwan, Tibet and China's bid to enter the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The speaker noted that Pakistan and China share a commonality
of perceptions on issues of bilateral, regional and global
concern. The relations between Pakistan and China "provide a
guarantee for peace and security in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he is convinced that Li Peng's visit to Pakistan will
provide a further impetus to the exchanges between Pakistan's
National Assembly and China's National People's Congress, or
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Li, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the NPC, said China and Pakistan are close and
friendly neighbors. The friendship between the two peoples goes
back to ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations 48 years ago,
the two countries have scored fruitful achievements in their
cooperation in various fields, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his appreciation for Pakistan's support to China
in all international fora.
</P>
<P>
It is the firm and unshakable policy of the Chinese government
to promote and fortify the good neighborliness and mutually
beneficial cooperation, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China will always remain Pakistan's reliable friend no matter
what changes may take place in the international arena, the
Chinese leader stressed.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his satisfaction over the constantly expanding and
strengthened exchanges and cooperation between the NPC and
Pakistan's National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the recent developments in South Asia, Li highly
appreciated the constructive measures taken both by Pakistan and
India towards the settlement of all outstanding bilateral issues
including the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
It is China's consistent position that disputes between
countries, especially between two neighbors which belong to the
developing world, should be resolved through peaceful negotiations
and friendly consultation.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng expressed his belief that through his current visit the
existing friendly relations between China's National People's
Congress and Pakistan's National Assembly will surely be further
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here Thursday afternoon on a four-day official visit
at the invitation of Soomro. Pakistan is the fourth leg of Li's
current six-nation tour. He has already visited Greece, Turkey and
Syria and will also tour Bangladesh and Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Intra-clan Fighting Kills 4 in Somali Border Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Fighting in the border town of
Bulo Hawo Thursday killed four people and wounded several others,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The fighting begun after a terrifying ambush took place against
senior politicians within the Marehan clan at the Somali-Kenyan
border Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses in the town told Xinhua by radio that the
officials including Ali Nur Mohamed Hajji, former deputy chairman
of the Marehan clan political faction, the Somali National Front,
and Hassan Ugas, former district commissioner of Bur Dhubo of Gedo
region, were ambushed immediately after crossing the border from
Mandera of Kenya into Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The pick-up truck in which the officials were travelling in was
attacked by a well-armed and organized group of gunmen who opened
indiscriminate fire on the truck, said the eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
According to them, Ugas died on the spot while Hajji died of
his wounds a short while later whereas Qoryoley was rushed to
hospital for treatment and was in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
An exchange of fire between the two sides also claimed the
lives of two more gunmen and several others suffered gunshot
wounds.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the ambush and fighting is not known.
</P>
<P>
Some inner sources from the town indicate that elements loyal
to General Omar Hajji Masalleh, the chairman of the Somali
National Front faction are suspected to have been behind the
ambush following a serious political misunderstanding between him
and his former deputy chairman late Ali Nur Haji Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, late Ali Nur and some other members from the
front have announced changes being made to the faction and the
replacement of General Masalleh with Ali Nur himself , a move
considered as illegal and self-proclamation by General Masalleh
who is now in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
A businessman said the ambushed officials had gone to Mandera
town across the border to Kenya for the arrangement of food
supplies for the displaced people from the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
The businessman explained that the ambush is related to a
dispute over the administration of the food for the refugees
since each of the political rivals has nominated their own
committee for the administration of the food.
</P>
<P>
Two committees were established by General Massaleh and late
Ali Nur for the humanitarian affairs of the region.
</P>
<P>
The difference between the two men had also led to the killing
of over six men in Bur Dhubo and Garbaharrey since last month.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier's Interview with U.S. Publisher (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji had an
interview with Mr. Peter Khan, Publisher of The Wall Street
Journal, and Mrs. Khan on the evening of April 2. The following is
a full text of the interview.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu: I have been thinking of sending my greetings to
the American people through the media before my visit to the
United States. At the same time, I hope to see a good atmosphere
created to help me achieve the purpose of my visit, i.e. to
enhance the friendly relations and cooperation between China and
the United States. However, before you raise your questions, I'd
like to share with you some of my recent thoughts about my
upcoming visit to the U.S. I think this might be a bit more
newsworthy for you.
</P>
<P>
As I said at a press conference on March 15, I predicted that I
would meet with many difficulties on this visit to the United
States. I might be an unwelcome visitor, and some people might
even be hostile to me, but I was still willing to make the trip. I
thought I could make some explanations about certain issues to the
American people and tell them the truth so as to enhance mutual
understanding. At the time of the press conference, I was fully
confident about this. But after that, things developed very
quickly and many unpredicted events took place, thus complicating
the situation.
</P>
<P>
First of all, the issue of the military action taken against
Kosovo cropped up. President Jiang has already made remarks on
many occasions, clearly outlining our position on this issue.
However, the Chinese people feel very strongly about this issue. I
received many telephone calls and letters, all expressing
opposition to my visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Then, the US decided to table a draft human rights resolution
condemning China at the UN Human Rights Commission session in
Geneva. This also caused quite a lot of indignation in China.
</P>
<P>
And still another issue is related to the WTO negotiations.
Originally, the negotiations were proceeding fairly smoothly, but
recently, we assume, due to pressure from the U.S. Congress, the U.
S. Government has shown a change in attitude in the negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Government Wins House Vote of Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government headed by
Prime Minister Abdel Raouf al-Rawabdeh Thursday overwhelmingly
won a vote of confidence in the House of Representatives (lower
house of Parliament).
</P>
<P>
After two days of debate over the policy statement presented by
Rawabdeh, the 80-seat lower house approved the new government by a
vote of 66 to 12 with two abstentions, the official news agency
Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
The Rawabdeh government has been widely anticipated to pass
the vote in the house after it was appointed by King Abdullah Bin
Hussein on March 4.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian monarch has the constitutional rights of
appointing governments and dissolving the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh has vowed in his policy statement to lift the
country's economy out of stagnation by creating favorable
circumstances for local and foreign investments and by sweeping
out corruption.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh was faced with a negative economic growth in 1998, a
two-digit unemployment rate and a fact that over one third of the
country's 4.6 million population are living under the poverty line
of 210 U.S. dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
On foreign affairs, Rawabdeh said his government would pursue
friendly ties with all Arab countries and would campaign for the
lifting of international sanctions imposed on Iraq, Sudan and
Libya.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed in his statement to support all legitimate
rights of the Palestinians, including their rights of setting up
an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.

<HEADLINE> German Businessman to Be Released on Bail in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Thursday announced that
German businessman Helmut Hofer, who was sentenced to death for
having illegal relations with an Iranian woman, would be released
on bail.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Iranian judiciary Mohammad Reza Abbasfard
said that the decision was made with the consideration of the
need for further investigation and the period Hofer has been
jailed, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Hofer will not be allowed to leave Iran, Abbasfard
said, adding that so far Hofer has not been released because he
can not afford the bail.
</P>
<P>
Abbasfard said that an Iranian appeal court started its
investigation into Hofer's case on Thursday after the Iranian
Supreme Court found some problems with the verdict on him.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was arrested in September, 1997 at Tehran international
airport upon his arrival from Germany with an Iranian woman who
was waiting for him. He was sentenced to death by a local court
in Tehran in January, 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to relevant Iranian laws, non-Muslim men are
forbidden to have any sexual relations with Muslim women.
</P>
<P>
However, Hofer appealed the court ruling by claiming that he
has converted to Islam before meeting the Iranian woman.
</P>
<P>
The sentence against Hofer cast a shadow over relations
between Iran and Germany as Bonn repeatedly urged Tehran to
release the German businessman.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials have stated that Hofer's case is a judicial
one and the Iranian judiciary is the only competent body to deal
with the case.
</P>
<P>
However, some reports said that the two countries have held
talks over the issue in order to make a compromise.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier's Interview with U.S. Publisher (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In fact, on the part of the U.S. government, they should agree
among themselves that China has already made major concessions on
the issues related to its accession to the WTO. Such concessions
were unimaginable even to the Americans three or five years ago.
If these concessions can help us reach an agreement, it will
facilitate the development of trade and cooperation between China
and the U.S. and also be conducive to reducing the China-U.S.
trade deficit, and it will be in the interests of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
From my meetings with U.S. business people, I fully understand
that if this agreement is made public, it will surely be welcomed
and supported by the American business community.
</P>
<P>
However, it was due to opposition from members of the U.S.
Congress, the U.S. negotiators have so far not shown a positive
attitude on this issue. On the morning of the day before yesterday,
I met with two congressional delegations from the U.S., including
both senators and representatives. Altogether there were 20 people.
One group was led by Senator Roth and the other by Senator Thomas.
I spent the whole morning talking with them. I said to them that
they should not have the misconception that China cannot but
accede to the WTO. Of course, we hope to enter the WTO. For this
goal, we have negotiated for 13 years. Nevertheless, we are not
unable to survive without the WTO. The past 13 years of history
has proven that we can survive without it, and that we have been,
in fact, doing better and better.
</P>
<P>
I also said to them that I am more of an expert than many of
them in this area, because I know more about the whole process of
the negotiations. I know all the details of the 13-year process. I
know better than them how big are the concessions China has made,
and, in fact, these concessions are to the United States'
advantage. I believe that once this agreement is announced, it
will definitely receive the support of the U.S. business community.
</P>
<P>
But some U.S. congressional members are accusing the Clinton
Administration and Ms. Barshefsky of trading in principles. I
don't think that's fair. Actually, Ms. Barshefsky has been very
tough during the whole negotiation process. I "offered" her a word
in our talks -- I said, "If I give you an inch, you ask for a foot
". I told her that I had never met with such a tough negotiator
before. I said that once the agreement is announced, perhaps the
Americans will not accuse the U.S. Government of trading in
principles. I am very worried that the Chinese people may accuse
me of trading in principles.

ADDIS ABABA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian President Negasso
Gidada said here Thursday that Ethiopia and Turkey should pay
attention to water resources development and technical
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by the Ethiopian president when meeting a
visiting Turkish delegation which is led by Numan Hazar, African
affairs coordinator with the Turkish foreign ministry.

According to the Ethiopian News Agency, president Negasso said
the two countries should further bolster their cooperation in the

<P>
Ethiopia and Turkey signed in 1993 an economic cooperation
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The seven-member Turkish delegation came here Saturday to
promote the existing cooperative relations between the two
countries. During its stay here, the delegation exchanged views
with executives of 12 Ethiopian governmental organizations and
business community on possible areas of cooperation. They reached
an agreement to sign agreements for investment protection and
abolition of double taxation.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish delegation is expected to leave here Thursday
evening after its six-day visit to Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Holds Welcome Ceremony for Zhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
held a 19-gun salute welcome ceremony to visiting Chinese Premier
Zhu Rongji here Thursday with the two leaders pledging to continue
to build a constructive strategic partnership between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
At about 9:40 a.m. (local time), national anthems of China and
the United States were played on the White House South Lawn and 19
salute guns were fired just several hundreds meters away.
</P>
<P>
Under a clear and sunny sky, Premier Zhu walked down from the
platform together with President Clinton to review the guard of
honor.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Clinton welcomed Zhu and his wife Lao
An as well as members of Zhu's entourage to the White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that at the dawn of a new century, "we now
recognize that our interests coincide on many issues and diverge
on some others, but that we have a fundamental responsibility to
speak with candor and listen with an open mind."
</P>
<P>
"And certainly we can agree that China and the United States
can best achieve our hopes in the next century if we continue to
build a constructive strategic partnership, a relationship that
allows us to make progress on the issues that matter to our
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Zhu said that President Jiang Zemin and President
Clinton exchanged successful visits and they decided that China
and the U.S. will work together to build towards a constructive
strategic partnership. "Such friendly relations and cooperation
between China and the United States serve the interests of our two
peoples, the interests of the cooperation by all countries in the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the Chinese people are determined to strive
tirelessly for consolidating and developing such relationship for
generations to come.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-U.S. ties, Zhu said that the friendship between the two
countries, based on the three china-U.S. Joint communiques and the
Joint china-U.S. Statement as well as solemn commitments made by
the two countries to each other, is a friendship that cannot be
undermined by anybody.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is any problem or question between our two
countries that cannot be resolved through friendly consultations.
Our two countries might have some disagreements or differences,
but I think only friends who can discuss and resolve their
differences are good friends. And only true friends are sincere
friends, are friends who can tell each other in the most sincere
and open manner," the Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the United States has a stake in China's
success, in a China that has overcome that challenges it faces at
home, a China that is integrated into the institutions that
promote global norms on proliferation, trade and the environment,
a China that respects human rights and promotes peace.
</P>
<P>
"China has pursued wise economic policies, striving to maintain
growth, low inflation, a stable currency," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Present at the ceremony were U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Secretary of Finance Robert Rubin, Secretary of Commerce
William Daley as well as other American high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
Also present were members of Zhu's entourage including State
Councilor Wu Yi, State Councilor and Secretary-General of the
State Council Wang Zhongyu, Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan,
Minister in charge of the State Development Planning Commission
Zeng Peiyan, and Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Shi Guangsheng.
</P>
<P>
Zhu is on an eight-day official visit to the United States, the
first by a Chinese premier in 15 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
Q: You spoke as if an agreement had been reached. Is it right?
</P>
<P>
A: I think there is only a little way to go before we reach an
agreement. But as the USTR has been under all kinds of pressure,
she is afraid of covering this little bit of distance.
</P>
<P>
Q: You also seem to be saying, when you say China has made the
utmost concessions, that you are now drawing a line and saying, no
more concessions, this is it?
</P>
<P>
A: Just about right. You may ask me why China has made such big
concessions. Well, I say, make no mistake about it and don't
misunderstand it. China is not begging for accession to the WTO.
Isn't China doing quite well without WTO membership? We have made
such big concessions for the sake of the overall interests of the
friendly relations and cooperation between China and the U.S. We
are doing so in order to build towards a constructive strategic
partnership, a goal set by President Jiang and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
We hope this positive momentum will move forward, and it will
not be in danger of going backwards as it is now. Therefore, I
said to those gentlemen from the Congress, if they oppose reaching
an agreement between China and the U.S. as they do now, it will
not serve the interests of the United States. China does not have
to conclude this agreement, nor does China have to conclude this
agreement before my visit to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Our main purpose is to serve the overall interests of the
friendly relations between China and the U.S. We may not be able
to get an agreement, and China may not be able to join the WTO at
this stage. Nevertheless, without WTO membership we can still
develop bilateral relations with countries all over the world on
the basis of our concessions. Should this happen, only the U.S.
will be left out of this game.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Discusses Peace Process with Lebanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 8 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) Middle East
Envoy Miguel Moratinos Thursday held talks with Lebanese leaders
on the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud, Moratinos
told reporters that during their talks Lahoud reiterated
Lebanon's position in the peace talks and thanked the EU for its
understanding to his country's stance.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria have been insisting that the two countries
conduct negotiations with Israel simultaneously. However, Israel
has been trying to separate the two tracks.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
It has refused to return the Golan Heights it captured from
Syria during the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
The envoy said their talks also focused on the prospects of
the resumption of peace talks between Lebanon, Syria and Israel
after the Israeli general elections due on May 17.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that every party concerned, including
Lebanon and Israel, should play its own role in order to
revive the talks after the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said his visit was also aimed at discussing with
Lebanese leaders the preparations for the upcoming
Euro-Mediterranean forum, which will be held at foreign minister
level this month in Stuttgart, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The forum will address the cooperation between 15 EU member
states and 12 countries along the southern and eastern
Mediterranean coasts in the fields of economy, culture, security
and politics.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon will sent a senior official to attend the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos arrived here on Wednesday after concluding a similar
visit to Syria.

<P>
Just now, Mr. Peter Khan, you also asked me if we would make no
further concessions. That's not the problem. To put it accurately,
the problem is not that we cannot make any further concessions,
but rather, that the concessions that the American side is asking
for are unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
For example, let's look at the opening up of the telecom
industry. In China, this industry was completely closed to the
outside world in the past. Now we've undertaken to open up the
telecom industry. We can allow foreign investors to hold an equity
ratio of 25 percent to 30 percent for the few years to come. After
this transitional period of a few years, we can further ease
restrictions on the equity ratio of foreign investment allowed.
However, we do have one condition, which is that China must hold
the controlling proportion of equity. But the U.S. side demands
that U.S. investors should be able to hold controlling equity.
</P>
<P>
I argue that in many industries in the U.S. you do not let
foreigners control equity. For instance, your civil aviation
industry only allows a foreign investment ratio of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
All countries including South Korea as well as the region of
Taiwan have imposed ceilings on the foreign investment equity
ratio. Not that only China has.
</P>
<P>
In other sectors, such as banking and insurance, our level of
openness has in fact exceeded what the U.S. had originally asked
for. As for securities, we've learned a lesson from the financial
crisis in some Southeast Asian countries. China must not be too
hasty in opening up the securities sector. The U.S. is very clear
about this position of ours. Yet, we can still open up B shares to
foreign investors, though not A shares. Even if the U.S. insists
on this demand, China cannot do it. Moreover, if we were to do
this, we would follow in the footsteps of the crisis-stricken
Southeast Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier's Interview with U.S. Publisher (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: What do you mean by the opening up of A and B Shares?
</P>
<P>
A : I'm afraid this is a question of a specialized subject
which I don't have time to explain now.
</P>
<P>
In short, I feel that an economic question -- the WTO
negotiations are an economic issue -- has now been turned into a
political issue altogether. This makes the problem much more
complex.
</P>
<P>
The day before yesterday when I met with some members of the U.
S. Congress, one of them said very bluntly that the WTO
negotiations should be directly linked with such issues as the
human rights and nuclear non-proliferation. I told him then and
there that I did not agree. Should all China-US economic issues be
linked to other issues like the human rights or nuclear non-
proliferation or should any economic issues be linked to political
issues, I am afraid that it would be impossible for the U.S. and
China to develop friendly relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
As for the negotiation on agriculture such as TCK of wheat,
citrus and meat quarantine, we have made full concessions. The U.S.
side feels that the two sides can very well reach agreement on
these issues. So I proposed that the two sides could make public
the agreement on these issues so as to win public support which
will facilitate our efforts to reach agreement on other issues.
But I did say that the announcement of this agreement did not
signify that the entire package of WTO issues had been agreed upon.
Such an agreement would come into effect only when the package of
WTO issues were agreed upon. A prompt announcement would help
improve the atmosphere and also facilitate the reaching of
agreement on other issues. But the United States did not agree,
saying "It's impossible".
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, I asked myself, what's the point of
making a trip to the U.S.? What could I accomplish there? However,
after repeated consideration, we still think we should set store
by the overall interests of China-US relations. Obviously, the U.S.
is the sole superpower, and China is the most populous nation in
the world. The development of the friendly relations and
cooperation between our two countries will have an impact on world
peace and the pattern of international cooperation. President
Jiang Zemin and the Chinese leadership still decided that I should
accept President Clinton's invitation and go to the United States.
We hope to do our part to promote communication between our two
countries and our two peoples, to discuss certain issues, and to
see if we can find a way to promote the forward movement of the
overall friendly and cooperative relations between China and the
United States.

OTTAWA -- Canada and its NATO allies are actively planning for
the possible deployment of ground troops in Kosovo to force a
peace settlement on the Yugoslav leadership, Canadian Defense
Minister Art Eggleton said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Eggleton said that the refugee crisis and the refusal of
Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Yugoslavia, to resume peace
talks despite heavy bombing has forced NATO to consider the option
of using ground forces.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO is actively considering sending in combat troops
without a peace agreement in place -- a subject that will be on
the agenda of Monday's meeting of NATO foreign affairs ministers
in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Eggleton said he had also discussed the issue of ground troops
with William Cohen, the U.S. defense secretary, and George
Robertson, the British defense minister. (Canada-NATO-Kosovo)

PARIS -- France has decided to send four more Mirage 2000D
bomber-fighters to join the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia,
said French Armed Forces Chief of Staff Jean-Pierre Kelche on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kelche said at a press conference that over the past two weeks,
NATO has struck more than 140 targets in Yugoslavia, mainly
Belgrade and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said that a certain number of strikes are on radio and
television relay stations, which he said are the "tools of
propaganda" of the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
The general said that NATO is controlling the Yugoslav airspace
and the Yugoslav planes take off "very rarely."
</P>
<P>
He said that the strikes are beginning to "erode the capacity
to hold on" by Yugoslav forces, principally in Kosovo. (France-

LONDON April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England cut interest
rates by 0.25 percent Thursday which means the base rate is now at
5.25 percent and at its lowest level for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
It is the sixth time in seven months that the Bank of England's
Monetary Policy Committee has decided to lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The decision came as a welcome relief for manufacturers and
unions who have been suffering from the high value of the pound as
well as for homeowners.
</P>
<P>
However, the UK's largest mortgage lenders, the Halifax and
Addey National banks, reacted cautiously saying they would review
the situation before deciding whether to cut their rates for
homeowners.
</P>
<P>
Business is pleased by the Bank's decision to keep interest
rates moving down, but they want a more aggressive attitude to the
lowering of base rates. (UK-BANK-RATES)

MOSCOW -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin Thursday reiterated
the pledge not to get involved militarily in the Balkan crisis,
saying that Russia would not provide weapons for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Providing arms for Yugoslavia would mean dragging Russia into a
world war, Yeltsin told Interfax before meeting with Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev. Yeltsin warned that it was in the Balkans
that the First World War erupted.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's statement came after a non-binding resolution passed
by the Lower House which called for military aid to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
NATO has expanded its range of bombing to civilian facilities.
The bombing was an unconscionable act, said Yeltsin.
</P>

During the meeting with Sergeyev, Yeltsin said that Russia

<HEADLINE> Municipal Bank Offers Consumer Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Municipal Commercial
Bank introduced a new loan program today to enable consumers to
buy consumption goods.
</P>
<P>
The bank has joined a group of other banks in pioneering
consumer credit. The Chinese government recently adopted a policy
to stimulate consumption in order to reverse a decline in the
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The new bank loans are available under restricted conditions.
For example, consumers can only use the funds at 17 major shopping
malls in Beijing. The approval must be approved by related
establishments prior to signing contracts with the bank.
Recipients must also deposit funds ranging between 20-40 percent
of total loan.
</P>
<P>
The loans will be extended for periods ranging from six months
to five years. Loans will range from 3,000 yuan (360 U.S. dollars)
to 100,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing bank has offered consumer credit loans on a trial
basis since March, with two loans granted to consumers. The bank
is expected to approved another 12-odd loans in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Consumers can use the funds to purchase appliances, computers,
furniture, physical fitness equipment, musical instruments and
other consumer durables. The bank is also considering loans for

<HEADLINE> Economists Cite Need for Venture Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists and officials
recently called on the government to introduce venture investments
in order to resolve the shortage of funds for research and
development projects.
</P>
<P>
Economist Cheng Siwei, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress (NPC), said today that venture
funds will attract a large volume of private funds for research
and development projects.
</P>
<P>
He noted that banks do not want to take the risk involved in
funding venture projects and added that the annual average for the
commercialization of patented technological innovations stands at
a only five percent.
</P>
<P>
Cheng made the remarks during a seminar on promoting the
development of venture investments.
</P>
<P>
He said that conditions are in place to establish a venture
investment mechanism in China. Cheng noted that the government
should bravely experiment in the field by absorbing the successful
experiences in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Finance Jin Liqun pointed out that the
government has not as yet drafted a definite plan for
administrative standards covering venture investment. He noted
that venture investment is currently being conducted on trial
basis at the local level.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Dongsheng, deputy director of the Department of Economic
Policy Coordination under the State Economic and Trade Commission,
said the government should encourage individuals and privately-run
enterprises to invest in venture projects.
</P>
<P>
Economist Gu Shengzu pointed out that the government should
play the role of a go-between, rather than as a major player in
venture investment.
</P>
<P>
Cheng called for the establishment of venture investment
consulting companies, investment funds and an exchange market for
related funds.
</P>
<P>
China has already consummated memorandums with U.S. companies
to inject one billion U.S. dollars in development of venture
investment over the next seven years. The central government and
domestic banks have provided three billion yuan in start-up funds
for small enterprises.

ATHENS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Parliament Speaker Spyros
Kyprianou left here Thursday afternoon for Belgrade on a mission
to secure the release of three U.S. soldiers captured by Serb
forces last week at the Kosovo border with Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before boarding a Hellenic Air Force C-130 transport
plane, Kyprianou said that he hoped the mission would bring
positive results.
</P>
<P>
He added that releasing the three Americans would be a signal
to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) that Milosevic
wants a peaceful resolution of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas also expressed his
optimism about Kyprianou's initiative, saying that there was a
hope that the initiative would succeed and if it did, it would
have a positive effect.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic reportedly invited the
Cyprus speaker to go to Belgrade to take back the U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The three Americans, Andrew Ramirez, Steven Gonzales and
Christopher Stone, would first be sent to the Cypriot capital of
Nicosia, where the Cyprus government would hand them over to the
U.S. embassy there.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The IRA's political wing Sinn Fein
on Thursday declared the proposals by Britain and Ireland to end a
deadlock in the Northern Ireland peace process as "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued following a party meeting, Sinn Fein said
the proposals tabled in the so-called Hillsborough Declaration
last week were "an attempt to rewrite important aspects" of the
Good Friday peace accord signed by major parties in Northern
Ireland last April.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was put forward last week by the British and
Irish governments as a way of breaking the deadlock over
paramilitary weapons.
</P>
<P>
Party chairman Nitchel Mclaughlin said the declaration proposed
a "massive change" to the Good Friday Agreement, particularly on
decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament is still the biggest problem for the peace process
in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Mclaughlin called on both London and Dublin to defend the peace
agreement, not attempt to re-write it.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said last weekend that the IRA
was under "no obligation" to hand over its weapons before the
setting up of an executive for the Northern Ireland assembly.

were forced to flee by Iraqi anti-aircraft troops at 11:45
a.m. local time (0745 GMT), the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes resumed their regular attacks on
Iraqi targets a week ago when the the holy period of pilgrimage
ended.
</P>
<P>
During the holy period, the allied forces suspended their
raids, which almost took place daily, on Iraqi targets in the
no-fly zones to avoid arousing protests from Arab people.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
After the mid-December U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq,
Iraq declared that it did not recognize the restricted zones and
would fire at any allied planes violating its airspace.

<HEADLINE> European Central Bank Sinks Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN April 8 (Xinhua)--The European Central Bank lowered its
major lending rate from 3.0 to 2.5 per cent. The decision was
announced Thursday in Frankfurt following a ECB council meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ECB also sank its two other key rates, the rate on marginal
lending facility from 4.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent, and the rate
on deposit facility from 2.0 per cent to 1.5 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The reduction, far bigger than 25 basis points that most
analysts had expected earlier Thursday, was aimed at boosting the
weak economy of the 11 Eurolands, ECB President Wim Duisenberg
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after the meeting, Duisenberg
said the rate cut would not result in the danger of inflation,
quoting that the currency volume in the Euro-zone expansed only by
5.1 per cent in February, slowing down from the 5.6 percent
monetary expansion rate in January.
</P>
<P>
It was the first rate-cutting action by the ECB since it took
over the monetary management for the 11 nations that have merged
their economy to form the common currency of Europe, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates have been trumbling also outside the Euro-zone
with the Bank of England cutting the short-term rate by 25 basis
points to the lowest level in five years, and Switzerland
following by reducing its rates by 50 basis points.
</P>
<P>
The ECB's decision of monetary easing came after a week of
market expectation that the economic stagnation in Germany,
France, and Italy would force the central bank to cut rate.
</P>
<P>
The three counties together make up 75 per cent of the gross
domestic product (GDP) of the Eurolands.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission in last month reduced its forecast for
economic growth in the Euro-zone this year by almost a half
percentage point to 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The leading economy in the Euro-zone, Germany, is expected to
be among the slowest in economic growth in the Europe this year
with its unemployment remaining at over 4 million and domestic
orders falling.
</P>
<P>
Recent talks over a European rate cut has added to the pressure
on the Euro, which has devalued about 8 per cent against the U.S.
dollar since its launch in this January.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday adopted a presidential statement, saying the 15-member
body hailed all parties concerned who contributed to the handover
of suspects accused of the 1988 bombing a Pan Am airliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council welcomes the letter of the
Secretary-General to the President of the Security Council of
April 5, 1999, reporting that the two persons accused of the
bombing of Pan Am flight 103 have arrived in the Netherlands for
the purpose of trial" before a Scottish court in the Netherlands,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council expresses its deep appreciation to the
Secretary-General, the Governments of South Africa and the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia and other countries for their commitment towards
reaching a satisfactory conclusion relating to Pan Am flight 103,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council further noted the role played by the
League of Arab States, the Organization of the Islamic Conference,
the Organization of African Unity and the Non-Aligned Movement in
this regard," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council responded to the April 5 letter by the
Secretary-General with the announcement of the immediate
suspension of the sanctions against Libya, first imposed in 1992
and tightened in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Under the relevant Security Council resolution, the Council
could automatically suspend the sanctions upon a report from the
Secretary-General of the arrival of the two suspects in the
Netherlands for a trial before the Scottish court.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council will vote in 90 days to lift the
sanctions against Libya.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of the American airliner took place in December
1988, killing 270 people.

MOSCOW, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
reiterated Friday that the Kosovo crisis can only be solved
through political means, and Russia will still strive for such a
political solution.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark after his meeting with the speaker of the
Russian State Duma Gennady Seleznyov, who had just come back from
Belgrade on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin again ruled out the possibility that Russia will
provide weapons to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) still has not
decided whether to dispatch ground troops, and Yugoslavia is
determined to fight till the last person, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that anti-American sentiments are currently upsurging
in Russia because of NATO's airstrikes against Yugoslavia. Such
bombings undermined the international order and the Charter of the
United Nations, he added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Export Zones Draw More Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen industrial units with a
proposed investment of 60.02 million U.S. dollars registered with
Bangladesh's two export processing zones (EPZs) in Dhaka and
Chittagong between last July and February this year, the official
BSS news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 18 industrial units, eight were owned by South Koreans
and the rest came from Hong Kong, the United States, Singapore,
Britain, Italy, Taiwan and Bangladesh, officials at the Bangladesh
Export Processing Authority (BEPZA) were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The investment trend in the EPZs was encouraging despite global
economic recession during the last couple of years, they said.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative investment in the Dhaka and Chittagong EPZs
stood at 347.35 million dollars in January this year, they said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997-98 fiscal year, the BEPZA exported goods worth 636
million dollars, or 12.32 percent of the country's total export of
5.164 billion dollars, reflecting an upward trend of exports from
the EPZs, they said.
</P>
<P>
Export target for the current fiscal year starting July 1998
has been set at 800 million dollars, of which 347 million dollars
had been achieved by January this year, they said.
</P>
<P>
In the two EPZs, 126 industrial units are in full operation
employing about 76,000 workers, and 113 other industries are in
different stages of construction under both foreign and local
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by positive responses from foreign investors, the
Bangladeshi government has approved three more new EPZs, and
feasibility studies on two others are going on, according to the
BEPZA.

<HEADLINE> Textile Industry Witnesses Steady Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China's textile industry witnessed
steady improvement in the first two months of the year, but still
faces an arduous task in terms of erasing losses and reversing the
downturn in exports.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the State Administration of Textile Industry
(SATI) indicated that state-owned textile enterprises reduced
losses by 440 million yuan (53 million U.S. dollars) in the
January-February period compared to the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The sales volume for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which
account for the major part of the country's textile industry, was
up over one percentage point on the same 1998 period, with the
production-sales ratio growing by over three percentages points.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has targeted the textile industry as a
area for breakthroughs in eliminating loss-making SOEs. Plans call
for reducing losses for textile SOEs by an additional three
billion yuan by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Government efforts to introduce mergers and bankruptcies for
textiles enterprises over the past two years enabled related SOEs
to write off a substantial portion of their debts and improve
efficiency, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government's drive to stimulate the consumer
market has had a noticeable effect on the textile market. Retail
sales for consumer textiles and garments jumped by 147 percent
during the first two months of the year compared to the 1998
period.
</P>
<P>
However, increased sales were achieved at the expense of
shrinking profits. Average prices for textiles and garments
dropped by 7.75 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned factors reflect the fact that many textile
enterprises have failed to update products in accordance with
market trends and the need to improve profitability, according to
SATI.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, exports of textiles and garments continued
to fall in January and February. The exports volume for the two-
month period plummeted to 4.7 billion U.S. dollars, down 22.35
percent on the 1998 period. However, the SATI noted the rate of
decline is slowing somewhat.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Hong Kong and Macao fell by 52.95 percent, or 94.5
percent of the total drop in the nation's textile exports during
the period.
</P>
<P>
The SATI plans to accelerate efforts to restructure textile
enterprises and help enterprises readjust the product mix during
the remainder of the year. It also plans to rev up mergers and
bankruptcies of state-owned textile enterprises in order to
streamline the workforce and enhance efficiency.

<HEADLINE> NATO Says Civilian Damage Caused in Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 9 (Xinhua)-- North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) said here on Friday that some serious civilian damage had
been caused early this morning during air strikes against radio
relay and main phone exchange targets in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
NATO military spokesman David Wilby told a daily news briefing
that although three of NATO bombs hit the targets, "despite of our
best efforts, it appears on this attack one bomb may have caused
some collateral damage."
</P>
<P>
He said the possible civilian damage of "a small residential
area" was just 200 to 300 meters from the planned target.
"Obviously we regret any unintended damage or loss of civilian
life. I would like to stress this was considered a critical target
and collateral damage risks were taken into close consideration
during our attack planning," Wilby said.
</P>
<P>
"It is also worth bearing in mind that most of the Kosovar
Albanians, if not all, had already been driven out of the city by
Serb action," the NATO spokesman said, not referring any Serb
civilian life.
</P>
<P>
Wilby also made an apology for "poor information" about strikes
against Serb TV and radio facilities he gave to reporters in
Thursday's briefing.
</P>
<P>
"But despite this unintended collateral damage, our operations
are not responsible for the widespread and random damage that has
been reported throughout the city," he said.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Sends Needs Assessment Mission to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 9 (Xinhua) --The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) decides to send experts to Albania to
assess the needs of the enormous influx of refugees created by
massive NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia, a sovereign and
independent member of the 185-state world body, U.N. officials
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Experts from UNDP's Emergency Response Division will leave for
Albania Sunday to make the needs assessment, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The mission will focus on improving the ability of host
communities to receive refugees. "The impact on the host country
and the needs of the population receiving refugees are often
neglected in situation like this. Our goal is to make sure their
requirements are taken into consideration," said Omar Bakhet,
director of the Emergency Response Division.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, more than
300,000 people have fled from Kosovo, a Serbian province, to
Albania. The large exodus of refugees occurred after the U.S.-led
NATO launched the on-going air strikes on Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
The experts will assess the capacity of local government
institutions in the province bordering Kosovo, and the effect fo
the flow of refugees on basic services, such as water and
electricity.
</P>
<P>
They will also look at the roles of other U.N. agencies and
international organizations, to ensure that UNDP's efforts are
directed towards areas where they are most needed. The mission
will be followed up by a high-level group of officials, possibly
in cooperation with other international organizations and
financial institutions.

<HEADLINE> Krajicek Crashes Out of HK Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Nine aces were far from enough
for top seed Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands to overcome the
incredible precision shown by Hendrik Dreekmann of Germany as the
Dutch player crashed out of the 350,000 US dollars Salem Hong Kong
Open here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dreekmann, who eliminated eighth seed and Hong Kong favorite
Michael Chang of the United States Thursday, beat the world No.4
Dutch player 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek is the fourth top ten player since 1995 to become a
victim of the 24-year-old German, who has also defeated Boris
Becker and Goran Ivanicevic.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek got a slow start in the first set, conceding three
break points quickly before losing his first game.
</P>
<P>
With the early advantage, Dreekmann displayed great precision
in backhand as well as forehand returns when he sent the ball to
both corners of the court for Krajicek to chase.
</P>
<P>
After a normal second set in which Krajicek broke Dreekmann
once and won, the decider became a repeat of the first set when
Krajicek lost his first game quickly.
</P>
<P>
The match could have ended at the eighth game before Krajicek
made two 205 km/h serves to save two break points. Dreekman
eventually served to win the final set.
</P>
<P>
"I had a chance in the first set and I held it, and it gives me
confidence," said an excited Dreekmann.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek said he played too much tennis in the past week and "
really needs a rest."
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to cover Dreekmann's shots," Krajicek said, adding
that he needs to improve his backhand strike and footwork in order
to achieve good results at the upcoming French Open and Wimbledon,
particularly the latter.
</P>
<P>
In other quarterfinals, Germany's Bernd Karbacher, who
surprisingly knocked out second seed Patrick Rafter of Australia
in the first round, maintained the winning streak to eliminate
seventh seed Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden 6-4, 6-4. Third seed Andre
Agassi of the United States chalked up an easy 6-2, 6-2 win over
fifth seed Nicolas Kiefer of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Karbacher, who came from behind to win both sets, said he
always likes playing in Hong Kong since he once won a challenger
tournament here in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"If I like to play I usually play well," said Karbacher.
</P>
<P>
Agassi broke Kiefer for a second time in the second set before
Kiefer wasted three break points to narrow the score.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who conceded no more than three games in every set of
the event, said he is playing the best tennis. "I do believe I
can win. I hit the ball cleanly and I keep firing on both wings,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Expects Further Ceasefire Offers: UK's Cook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook reiterated Friday that the only ceasefire offer NATO would
consider would be a complete capitulation by Yugoslavia to NATO
demands for an end to "ethnic cleansing" in Kosovo and a safe
return of refugees to their homes.
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference here that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic was feeling the impact of relentless NATO airstrikes on
his forces and might offer new ceasefire at this weekend.
</P>
<P>
President Milosevic was "feeling the heat" and trying to divide
the NATO alliance with "empty gestures" such as this week's offer
of a "unilateral ceasefire" in Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cook predicted that President Milosevic would make another "
empty gesture" this weekend to try to stop the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"It won't work. It will take more than an empty gesture to
stop NATO's military campaign," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We will now only stop the NATO campaign if Milosevic makes an
offer of real substance that meets NATO's key demands -- a
ceasefire on the ground and a halt to ethnic cleansing," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We would expect any negotiations to commence on the basis of
the Rambouillet peace accords," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore I think it is right in that regard that we should be
looking for something further than we envisaged in Rambouillet,"
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Cook's remarks echoed comments by British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, who suggested in a television interview on Thursday that
Belgrade risked losing Kosovo altogether and seeing it become
independent.

<HEADLINE> EU Hopes to Share US Benefits From China's WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is eager
to share benefits the United State may gain from China's entry
into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in possibly near future,
as EU trade representative Leon Brittan said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
As vice president of the European Commission, the EU's
executive body, Brittan said in a statement that the EU and US
have been pursuing very similar objectives in negotiations with
China. "So the progress made in the negotiations between China and
the US is good news. Nonetheless, for accessions to take place
negotiations have to be concluded not only with the US but also
with the other WTO members, including of cause the EU," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will want to examine the details arefully, to look at the
commitments that have been put forward by China. We will then need
to complete our own negotiations with China, in order to see what
extra commitments are required to ensure that the EU's legitimate
commercial interests are properly safeguarded," Brittan said.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to doing this in the weeks ahead on behalf of
the EU, in particular when I visit China in May. It is the end
game now," said the EU commissioner, who had resigned with his 19
colleagues las month but still in his position before a new
executive body is formed
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that with hard work and real commitment on all
sides we can enter the final stretch of this important negotiation
and bring it to a rapid and successful conclusion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and US president Bill Clinton
have announced that they have achieved significant progress on
terms for China's entry into WTO, which Brittan said will give
powerful impetus to China's accession process.
</P>
<P>
The EU believes that China's accession to the WTO will benefit
both the organization's members and China itself, the EU trade
deputy said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects UN Panels' Proposals on Weapons and Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Friday rejected the
recommendations by the three U.N. panels, saying that they
provided Iraq's enemies with a pretext for aggression.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum to the United Nations Security Council, Iraq
said " The new integrated approach uses practically the same
procedures previously practiced but under a new label. This
unfortunately provides the enemies of Iraq with the pretext for
future aggression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq said the reports by the three panels, which are on
disarmament, humanitarian issues and Kuwaiti prisoners of war and
property, relied too heavily on data submitted by the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said the proposals made by the three panels in their
reports infringed on "the sovereignty or territorial integrity of
Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"The net result of the recommendation is disappointed and falls
short of the goal which should have been clearly recognized and
recommended, namely putting an end to the prolonged regime of
sanctions." Iraq said.
</P>
<P>
The three panels, set up according to a note by the Security
Council on January 30, 1999, were aimed to help the Council to
forge a new U.N. policy towards Iraq after the U.S. led military
strikes against Iraq last December.
</P>
<P>
The panel on disarmament concluded that most but not all of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction had been dismantled and
recommended intrusive inspections as part of a monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
The panel on humanitarian issues said that Iraq is facing
deteriorating humanitarian crisis and suggested easing U.N.
sanctions against the country by allowing foreign investments in
Iraq's oil industry to promote its capacities to pump and export
oil.
</P>
<P>
The panel on Kuwaiti prisoners of war and property said Iraq
has not cooperated enough in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka, New Delhi Reach Agreement on Bus Fare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and India reached a final
agreement here on Friday on the fare of passengers of the direct
bus service between Dhaka and Calcutta, India, sources told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The price of a return ticket for one passenger was fixed at 25
U.S. dollars, the sources said. Officials of the two countries
held talks in Calcutta on Wednesday to negotiate the fare, but
failed to arrive at a consensus. Bangladesh proposed a fare
between 20-22 dollars both way, while India put it at 40 dollars.
</P>
<P>
A Bangladeshi bus left here Tuesday morning for Calcutta
marking the start of the trial run of the bus service between the
two countries, and an Indian bus arrived in Dhaka on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bus service, delayed several times, took place following
the signing of a two-year agreement in India in February this year
by officials of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Two buses would ply from each side for six days a week during
the initial period of commercial operation, which would begin
sometime later this month, and after three months of commercial
operation, the number of buses on the route would be determined by
the market demand.
</P>
<P>
Karar Mahmudul Hasan, joint secretary of the Ministry of
Communications, said on Monday that about 500,000 Bangladeshi
nationals visit India each year, and the direct bus service would
greatly reduce the hassle of the passengers who had to undergo in
the past.
</P>
<P>
The service would facilitate movement of people and provide an
opportunity for greater interaction between the two peoples, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's First Crematorium Under Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaited construction of the
first crematorium in the Tibet Autonomous Region commenced today
in the suburbs of Lhasa, the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 100,000-sq.m., the complex has a floor
space of over 5,000 sq.m. and will consist of a crematorium,
public tomb, urn exhibition hall, a memorial area, an office block
and a residential compound.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Civil Affairs will provide 12 million yuan for
the project, one of 13 welfare and charity projects funded in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to regional civil affairs officials, many Tibetans
have expressed the need for crematorium for a number of years due
to the increasing costs for traditional forms of burial, including
tower, fire, sky, water and tomb burial.
</P>
<P>
Tibetans traditionally inter the remains of highly respected
personages such as Living Buddhas in towers, burn the remains of
monks and practice sky burial for common people. The latter
practice involves leaving pieces of the body in the open for
eventual consumption by vultures.
</P>
<P>
Tibetans living in mountain areas in eastern Tibet are
accustomed to disposing of bodies in rivers, with earthen tombs
used only for individuals who died from infectious diseases.
Tibetans consider vultures to be sacred birds and thus refrain
from practicing Sky Burial for the remains of people succumbing to
diseases.
</P>
<P>
An official revealed that Tibetan families could not afford the
charges of traditional burials, of which the cost for sky burials
ranging between 300-400 yuan due to lack of sky burial masters.
</P>
<P>
Lhasa, a city with a population of 130,000, is home to 12 sky
burial masters.
</P>
<P>
Dawa, the local government official in charge of civil affairs,
said the crematorium will not only offer Tibetans a new option,
but will also provide services for non-Tibetans in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has adhered to the policy of protecting
traditional Tibetan burial practices. The regional government
issued a special decree in 1985 ordering all local residents and
units to respect the traditions.
</P>
<P>
People are prohibited from watching, photographing or filming
sky burials without approval of concerned parties. Individuals
violating the rules face severe punishment.
</P>
<P>
"The policy to respect Tibetan burial traditions will remain
unchanged with the construction of the crematorium," said Liu
Jiajie, director of the regional social welfare department. He
noted that "people will be free to choose the form of burial."

Yugoslavia was a mistake.

It will not work to interfere in the internal affairs of a

by force.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Sends Aid to Yugoslav Town Attacked by NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) has dispatched 5,000 blankets to Aleksinac, a
small mining town in central Serbia, to help those who had their
homes damaged by NATO bombs, said the ICRC here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC will send to the town, around 200 kilometers south of
Belgrade, a further consignment comprising 2,000 square meters of
plastic sheeting for covering broken windows and 500 mattresses,
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after the ICRC and the Yugoslav Red Cross
jointly carried out a survey of the humanitarian situation in
Aleksinac.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ICRC said that it is looking into ways of
helping the medical center in the town, which was serving some 65,
000 people in the region but is now badly damaged, to resume its
work.
</P>
<P>
An investigation team will visit Nis, Vranje and other areas of
southern Serbia to determine the needs of civilians affected by
the air strikes. Another team is going to Novi Sad on April 13 to
assess the situation there, particularly in view of the disruption
of the city's water supply.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC said it is working in close cooperation and
coordination with the Yugoslav Red Cross. Since the beginning of
the NATO air strikes, it has provided the national society with
about 125 tons of food, 19,000 blankets, 22,000 jerrycans and some
medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
More medical supplies for treating the wounded are currently
being purchased by the ICRC at the request of the Yugoslav Red
Cross, according to the ICRC.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
has called on the Yugoslav authorities and NATO to stop military
activities immediately.
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply distressed by the tragedy taking place in Kosovo
and in the region, which must be brought to an end," Annan said in
a statement issued Friday at a U.N. agency in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"The suffering of innocent civilians should not be further
prolonged," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. chief said that the suspension of NATO's air
bombardments upon the Yugoslav territory should follow the
acceptance by the Yugoslav authorities of certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
The conditions which he outlined in the statement include:
</P>
<P>
-- To end immediately the campaign of intimidation and
expulsion of the civilian population;
</P>
<P>
-- To cease all activities of military and paramilitary forces
in Kosovo and to withdraw these forces;
</P>
<P>
-- To accept unconditionally the return of refugees and
displaced persons to their homes;
</P>

<HEADLINE> China, Pakistan to Cooperate More Closely: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China and Pakistan will
cooperate more closely in the changing international arena, the
visiting Chinese top legislator, Li Peng, said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
During a joint interview with five major Pakistani media
organizations, Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress of China, said China and Pakistan are
old friends and the friendship between the two countries had
withstood the test of time.
</P>
<P>
"No matter what happens to our respective countries and to the
world, China and Pakistan always support and assist each other.
The Sino-Pakistani friendship is all-weathered," said the Chinese
leader.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about the two countries' future relations
and cooperation in economy, defense and politics in the new
situation, Li said: "The international situation is undergoing
changes. But the changes have not reduced the weight of
Sino-Pakistani friendship and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"At this very moment, China and Pakistan should cooperate more
closely," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He also said both China and Pakistan belong to the developing
world, so for the two countries, "development is the top
priority."
</P>
<P>
And development requires a peaceful international and domestic
environment, Li said, adding that China and Pakistan are all
committed to peace and development.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China and Pakistan have supported and helped each
other. "We never thought that the support and assistance provided
by China to Pakistan was a one-way communication. On the contrary,
they have been mutually beneficial," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that China did have some cooperative projects with
 Pakistan in the defense field. "China has provided some equipment
to Pakistan which is only for defensive purposes, and will not
threaten any neighboring countries."
</P>
<P>
"Such cooperation helps Pakistan defend itself and achieve
peace and stability in South Asia," Li said.

<HEADLINE> China Set to Draft Government Procurement Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China's National People's Congress
(NPC) today announced the formation of a team which will be
responsible for drafting a government procurement law, one of the
most important legislative items in the eyes of the general public.
</P>
<P>
Officials attending today's ceremony marking formation of the
team noted that enactment of a procurement law would have saved as
much as 80 billion yuan (9.64 billion U.S. dollars) in annual
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
"The government procurement system will provide an important
safeguard to protect the interests of the state, combat corruption
and ensure economic order," said Chen Guangyi, chairman of the NPC
Financial and Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The system will also represent an objective requirement for
China's membership in the World Trade Organization," according to
Chen.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Zhigang, assistant to the minister of finance, said the
absence of a procurement system consistent with international
practices has led to "irregularities, waste and corruption" in
many localities and departments throughout China.
</P>
<P>
Economists note that goods, projects and services a developed
government consumes each year equal an average 10-20 percent of a
country's gross domestic product (GDP), with the rate for China
estimated at 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Pilot operations with the government procurement system in
various areas indicate that the new system can save at least 10
percent of government annual budgeted expenditures.

<TEXT>
<P>
The fact that China's 1998 GDP stood at about 8,000 billion
yuan and government consumption approached 800 billion yuan led
economists to conclude that a procurement law would have saved
expenditures of close to 80 billion yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
"The figure is indeed shocking," said Yao Zhenyan, vice-
chairman of the NPC Financial and Economic Committee and chairman
of the drafting team.
</P>
<P>
The team is comprised of officials from government finance and
planning departments and the People's Liberation Army, as well as
legal and economic scholars.
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the draft law to be presented to the NPC
Standing Committee in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The trial procurement system has been introduced to 373
counties in 23 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.
The average savings rate stands at 13.5 percent and exceeds 25
percent in terms of projects and services.
</P>
<P>
The general public and members of the industrial sector have
appealed for related legislation for a number of years, with NPC
deputies tabling numerous bills calling for formulation of the law.
</P>
<P>
"The government should be able to use its tremendous purchasing
to regulate the economy and promote major policies," said Yao
Zhenyan.
</P>
<P>
The government is attempting to fill the existing vacuum by
formulating provisional regulations on government procurement,
according to an official with the Ministry of Finance.

<HEADLINE> India's Industrial Growth Falls to 3.9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- India's industrial growth went
down to 3.9 percent in the first eleven months of the financial
year 1998-99 which began on April 1, 1998, the Central Statistical
Organization (CSO) said.
</P>
<P>
The main reason of the slowdown was a negative growth in mining
and a slump in the manufacturing sector, according to estimates of
Index of Industrial Production (IIP) released here Friday by CSO.
</P>
<P>
In February alone, CSO said, growth of the mining sector
slipped by a negative 7.8 percent, thereby pulling down the
overall industrial growth to 4.9 percent for the month while
industrial growth rate was as high as 6.9 percent in the first 11
months in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Industrial slowdown was also evident in basic and consumer
goods even though the capital goods sector showed a record growth
rate of 10.5 percent during the April-February period as compared
to 6.3 percent in the corresponding period of 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
For the 11 months under review, the manufacturing sector grew
by 4.3 percent as against 7 percent in the same period of 1997-98,
while the mining sector recorded a negative growth rate of 1.7
percent compared to 6.2 percent of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Only the electricity sector maintained more or less the same
growth trend as witnessed last year. The current period showed a
6.4 percent growth rate compared to 6.5 percent of the previous
year.

<HEADLINE> Indian Minister Justifies Silk Import From China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Indian Commerce Minister
Ramakrishna Hegde Friday ruled out reviewing the central
government's policy on import of raw silk from China, saying it
had not affected the interests of domestic farmers.
</P>
<P>
"It (the policy) has not affected the prices so much as to hurt
the interests of farmers," the Press Trust of India (PTI) quoted
Hegde as saying in Bangalore, 2,060 kilometers south of here.
</P>
<P>
The minister justified the Indian government policy on import
of raw silk from China and said the decision was taken as Chinese
silk could not be produced in India.
</P>
<P>
On reports that the price of Indian silk had come down, Hegde
said that it was not much, adding that "silk prices do not go by
daily fluctuations, they are market fluctuations."

<P>
MOSCOW, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian official has
denied reports that President Boris Yeltsin has given an order to
target Russian strategic missiles at NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
The chief of general staff of Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces,
Anatoly Perminov, told Itar-Tass that he had received no such
order from the president yet, adding that should Yeltsin's order
come, the military will make corresponding reaction.
</P>
<P>
The denial came after Chairman of Russian State Duma Gannady
Seleznev said on earlier Friday that President Boris Yeltsin has
ordered Russia's strategic missiles to retarget the NATO countries
involved in the bombardments of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev made the remark in an exclusive interview with the
Interfax News Agency after a work meeting with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin himself made no mention of the missiles during remarks
on Yugoslavia earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the United States have stopped targeting their
missiles at each other, as they did during the Cold War.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Sharon Agree to Back U.S., NATO Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon have agreed that the
Israeli government will support the U.S. and NATO efforts to
resolve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two also agreed that Israel will continue to grant
assistance to the Kosovo refugees, but the Israeli government
will not take any position on the future status of Kosovo
province.
</P>
<P>
The two reached the consensus during their telephone
conversation Thursday night while discussing the ongoing Kosovo
crisis, Israel Radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, currently in the United States accompanying his wife
undergoing medical treatment there, is scheduled to meet
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Friday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Albright is expected to express her displeasure at Sharon's
recent equivocal statements regarding the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Refusing to express explicit support for the U.S.-led NATO
airstrikes in Yugoslaiva, Sharon said earlier this week that "a
future independent Kosovo could become a base of Islamic terror
in Europe."
</P>
<P>
Natanyahu has distanced himself from Sharon's comments, saying
they reflect Sharon's own opinion, and has reaffirmed Israel's
support for NATO's campaign.
</P>
<P>
Considering Israel's "friendly relations" with both Russia and
Yugoslavia, the Israeli government has not been so active in
supporting the NATO's military action against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Sharon is scheduled to visit Russia on Sunday. He said his
mission is to work with his Russian counterpart Igor Ivanov to
persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to release three
U.S. soldiers being held by Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
Israeli opposition politicians have criticized Sharons' remarks
on Kosovo, but they ignored the reports of his efforts to secure
the release of the three U.S. solders.
</P>
<P>
Ehud Barak, leader of the major opposition Labor party in
Israel, on Thursday called on the Netanyahu government to "come
out and express Israel's clear and unequivocal support for the
actions of NATO and the U.S. in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Barak also offered his full backing to efforts to put an
end to the atrocities taking place in Kosovo.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Employment in almost all the
major economic sectors in Hong Kong decreased in December 1998
over a year earlier, according to figures released today by the
Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The decrease was due to some companies downsizing their
workforce further amidst the economic downturn and uncertain
business outlook, said the department.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector and construction sites recorded
relatively larger declines in employment.
</P>
<P>
However, a moderate increase in employment was seen in the
community, social and personal services sector.
</P>
<P>
Vacancies decreased markedly across economic sectors as well as
across occupation groups in December 1998 over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
For all the sectors surveyed taken together, there were around
25,350 vacancies in December 1998, of which 18,940 were in the
private sector and 6,410 in the civil service.
</P>
<P>
Compared with December 1997, the total number of vacancies fell
substantially, by 52 percent.

LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said on Friday that NATO troops being sent to Albania to help
deal with the refugee crisis would not be used to invade Kosovo.
</P>

"We have no intention of risking our troops in those
circumstances. It's not going to happen," he insisted.
</P>

Cook's comment was made shortly after NATO decided to send 8,
000 ground troops to Albania to cope with the apocalyptic refugee
crisis in the Balkans.
</P>

He was echoing comments made earlier by Prime Minister Tony

CAIRO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- Dubai has sent a new message to foreign investors
asserting its keen interest in maintaining open door and free
market economic policies. It called on the investors to invest in
its industrial sector and to establish joint ventures that will
help transfer technologies.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Arab daily Al Hayat said the message was incorporated
in the statement made by the Crown Prince of the Dubai Emirate
Sheikh Mohamed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum at the opening ceremony of a
Lipton tea packing factory in the free zone of Jebel Ali.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABIE -- Jassim Al Manaie, chairman and general manager of
the Arab trade funding program, has diclosed that a number of
positive and negative factors have influenced foreign and inter
Arab trade from 1997 and 1998, among which was the slump oil price.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the program's tenth general assembly meeting
held in Abu Dhabi Thursday, Manaie said these developments have
led to a drop in the Arab states' quota in overall international
trade to less than 3 percent, Friday's Al Hayat reported.
</P>
<P>
MUSCAT -- Oman is expected to cut crude oil exports in May by
over 8.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Oman has informed its Japanese buyers of the cuts, which were
made in response to an agreement by OPEC (Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries) and non-OPEC countries last month
to slash crude oil production by over 2 million barrels a day, the
Alam Al Yom newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Oman was also considering further cuts to 13 percent in line
with its commitment as an oil-producing country to boosting oil
prices by reducing supply.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- A pipeline linking Zahran to Riyadh and on to Al
Quassim will go into operation Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It is a project undertaken by the "Saudi Arabian ARAMCO" which
aims at modernizing the oil distribution network throughout the
Saudi kingdom, said a company report.

<HEADLINE> EU Hopes to Share U.S. Benefits From China's WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is eager
to share benefits the United State may gain from China's entry
into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in possibly near future,
EU trade representative Leon Brittan said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
As vice president of the European Commission, the EU's
executive body, Brittan said in a statement that the EU and U.S.
have been pursuing very similar objectives in negotiations with
China.
</P>
<P>
"So the progress made in the negotiations between China and the
U.S. is good news. Nonetheless, for accessions to take place,
negotiations have to be concluded not only with the U.S. but also
with the other WTO members, including of course the EU," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will want to examine the details carefully, to look at the
commitments that have been put forward by China. We will then
need to complete our own negotiations with China, in order to see
what extra commitments are required to ensure that the EU's
legitimate commercial interests are properly safeguarded," Brittan
said.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to doing this in the weeks ahead on behalf of
the EU, in particular when I visit China in May. It is the end
game now," said the EU commissioner, who resigned with his 19
colleagues last month but still in his position before a new
executive body is formed.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that with hard work and real commitments on all
sides, we can enter the final stretch of this important
negotiation and bring it to a rapid and successful conclusion," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Both Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and U.S. president Bill Clinton
have announced that they have achieved significant progress on
terms for China's entry into WTO, which Brittan said will give
powerful impetus to China's accession process.
</P>
<P>
The EU believes that China's accession to the WTO will benefit
both the organization's members and China itself, the EU trade
deputy said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Labor Department said
Thursday that the number of claiming unemployment benefits rose by
11,000 last week, but remained at less than 300,000 for the 10th
consecutive week.
</P>
<P>
It said first applications for unemployment checks last week
edged up to a seasonally adjusted 299,000. A four-week moving
average of jobless claims increased 1,750 to 295,250.
</P>
<P>
The 10 weeks of initial claims of less than 300,000 marked the
longest such stretch since 1973, reflecting the fact that the
nation's unemployment rate, at 4.2 percent in March, was at a 29-
year low.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas Inc., a Chicago-based
job-search firm, said Wednesday that publicly announced job cuts
totaled 68,984 in March, up 11 percent from February and nearly
triple the 23,028 announced in March 1998.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt. Urged Not to Import Maize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia National Farmers Union
Friday expressed disappointment at the government decision to
import 100,000 tons of maize next month.
</P>
<P>
President of the farmers union, Auay Vashee said in a statement
released here that there is no need for the government to import
maize when local farmers are also harvesting theirs.
</P>
<P>
It is astonishing that someone can even contemplate the
importation of maize when the country's farmers are busy
harvesting and at the threshold to supply the market, Vashee
noted.
</P>
<P>
He charged the government with being insincere in deciding to
import maize and ready to do anything which could distort the
market.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the government to reduce the imports of maize
from 100,000 tons to 20,000 tons which he said would be enough to
meet the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
There would be enough maize this season and the imports of the
crop should be left to the private sector if there would be a
shortfall at the end of the marketing season, the union leader
said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the government to give the local farmers the same
price which is given to South African maize.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said on Friday that NATO's airstrikes on Yugoslavia posed no
threat to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The comment was made shortly after Russian President Boris
Yeltsin was reported to have ordered Russian missiles to target
NATO countries involved in the bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We have not had any direct confirmation of this. I have asked
our embassy in Moscow to seek urgent clarification," Cook told a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
"I would stress here that there is nothing we are doing in
Yugoslavia or Kosovo .... that poses the remotest threat to Russia,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is an operation not meant in any way to challenge the
security of Russia. There can be no justification in Russia for

the Foreign Secretary insisted.

Earlier in Moscow, parliamentary speaker Gennady Seleznyov said
Yeltsin had issued the order on missiles. The report has not been
confirmed by the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
But President Yeltsin issued on Friday his strongest warning
yet against a NATO ground offensive in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He was reportedly said that Russia would interfere militarily
in the NATO campaign against Yugoslavia if it was "pushed into it
by the U.S."
</P>
<P>
Reports have also emerged that Russia would be prepared to
station troops in Yugoslavia in the event of an alliance.

<HEADLINE> Kabila in Tanzania for Talks on Congo Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) President Laurent Kabila held talks here Friday with his
Tanzanian counterpart Benjamin Mkapa on bilateral issues and the
situation in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who arrived late in the morning from Kinshasa, held
two-hour private talks with Mkapa in the State House, which was
even closed to their foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
"We have discussed bilateral relations and regional issues,"
Mkapa told reporters after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Kabila Thursday attended a summit in Luanda with Presidents of
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, for talks on the situations in
Angola and Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
He came to Tanzania to brief Mkapa on the results of the
regional summit which were said to be determined to carry on the
war.
</P>
<P>
DRC officials said that Kabila will have a private lunch in the
downtown Sheraton Hotel before leaving for home aboard his special
plane.
</P>
<P>
This is Kabila's first visit to Tanzania since he took power as
the Congolese president in 1997 from former Zairean ruler Mobutu
Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
Since Uganda and Rwanda recently expressed willingness to
withdraw their troops from backing the rebels in the eastern part
of the DRC, Kabila has started a tour of his neighboring countries
in a bid to end the eight-month old civil war.
</P>
<P>
Although many neighbors are involved in the DRC war, with
Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad on Kabila's side and Uganda and
Rwanda backing the rebels, Tanzania has remained neutral but
accommodated a great number of refugees from the vast central
African country.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania stands for political settlement of the DRC conflicts
through peaceful talks attended by all factions including the
rebels.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Relief Cooperation Proves Beneficial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Support from comparatively
developed coastal areas in east China has proved highly beneficial
in helping poverty-stricken areas in southwest China alleviate
poverty.
</P>
<P>
The State Council's Poverty Relief and Development Leading
Group met today in Guiyang to discuss and exchange experience in
poverty relief cooperation between eastern and western China over
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the meeting pointed to the fact that related
cooperation efforts commenced in 1996 under the overall
coordination of the central government.
</P>
<P>
Nine Provinces and four cities in coastal areas, including
Guangdong, Liaoning, Shanghai and Shenzhen, were designated to
provide support for 10 poverty-stricken provinces and autonomous
regions in the western pat of the country.
</P>
<P>
Developed coastal provinces and cities have donated funds and
materials valued at more than one billion yuan to poor inland
areas over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, contracts valued at over four billion yuan have
been signed for more than 2,600 cooperation projects.
</P>
<P>
Laborers from poverty-stricken areas have provided developed
areas with labor valued at over 800 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Information released by the State Council's Poverty Relief
Office show that support from the central government and developed
areas has led to a sharp decrease in the poverty-stricken
population in western China over the past few years, with the
income level of farmers growing by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from developed provinces and cities pledged
they will continue efforts to support the nation's poverty relief
drive.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's 1st Quarter VAT Revenue Hits US$22 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian government
collected some 22 million U.S. dollars in value-added tax (VAT)
during the first quarter this year, according to Finance Minister
Keat Chhon.
</P>
<P>
The sum is about 6.75 dollars million higher than the
government's target. VAT collection in March was 8.4 million
dollars, the highest of the three months while in February the
government obtained 5.8 million dollars and in January 7.7 million
dollars, the newspaper Cambodia Daily quoted Keat Chhon as saying
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's VAT, which went into effect on January 1, is a
10-percent tax collected on various goods and services. Many
businessmen said they supported the tax, which has been praised
and demanded by the international donor countries, but complained
they were not given enough time to prepare to pay it.
</P>
<P>
Of the VAT revenue, according to an official, 60 percent will
be used to pay salaries of the military and police personnel and
40 percent those of the civil servants.
</P>
<P>
But as about 80,000 military and police personnel will be
demobilized in five years, a larger portion of the VAT revenue
will be allocated to civil servants, who are due to get a
30-percent pay raise starting May 1.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Egyptian President Mohamed
Hosni Mubarak vowed Friday that his country will play a
constructive role in the efforts to promote peace and stability on
the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks following a meeting with his South Korean
counterpart Kim Dae-jung, who urged the Egyptian leader to play an
important role in promoting peaceful coexistence and active
cooperation between Seoul and Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, the first Egyptian head of state ever to visit South
Korea since the two nations established diplomatic ties in 1995,
said he hopes that peace and stability on the Korean peninsula
will be promoted through "dialogue between Seoul and Pyongyang."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president, who arrived here for a three-day visit
Friday, said he fully backs President Kim's sunshine policy, which
seeks reconciliation, cooperation and exchange with the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea and a separation of politics from
business.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador to Seoul, Hussein Derar, said on the eve of
Mubarak's arrival that his government had acted as messenger
between Seoul and Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
"We've delivered a message from the South to North Korea that
Seoul is sincere in its quest for peace on the Peninsula," Derar
said.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Mubarak, President Kim said that Seoul
supports Middle East peace negotiations on the basis of the United
Nations resolution and the Oslo Treaty.

all parties concerned, will be respected and fully implemented.

After the meeting, the two leaders signed a memorandum of
understanding on science and technology cooperation.

cooperation in nuclear power generation and maritime and cultural
affairs.

<HEADLINE> No Damage Reported After Strong Quake in Jilin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- No damage or aftershock has been
reported after an earthquake measuring 7.0 on the Richter Scale
hit northeast China's Jilin province on Thursday night, according
to local seismologists.
</P>
<P>
The quake shook the Huichun-Wangqing area of Yanbian Korean
Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province, Northeast China at 21:10
(Beijing time), April 8.
</P>
<P>
Local seismologists said the epicenter was 540 kilometers deep
and the earthquake was therefore less destructive as a result of
the energy consumption occurred when the shock wave traveled
through the ground.
</P>
<P>
Studies by local seismologists show that no further earthquakes
will occur in Jilin in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The quake was centered at 43.4 degrees North Latitude and 130.3
degrees East Longitude.

<HEADLINE> Newly Printed Money Reaches Somali Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 9 (xinhua) -- A large convoy of more than 50
battle wagons and hundreds of heavily armed militiamen escorting
the newly printed money have reached Mogadishu's main Bakara
market late Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the money followed the settlement of the dispute
over its control Between faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid and
businessmen belonging to his Haba Gidir clan in South Mogadishu
early thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Even though the terms of the agreement between Hussein Aidid
and the businessmen was not announced publicly, it is now
understood that the businessmen were allowed to have the control
of the money and its administration.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the businessmen indicate that a sum of money
was allocated to Hussein Aidid which the businessmen described
that it has met his demands.
</P>
<P>
The money which is said to be 35 billion Somali shillings,
worth of four million U.S. dollars, has been divided into portions
for its safeguarding.
</P>
<P>
A load of the money has been seen being unloaded in the former
 presidential palace now resided by faction leader Hussein Aidid,
another sum has been put in a telecommunications compound near
the former spaghetti factory while the major part was put in
former food stores inside the main Bakara market.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people have come up and around the stores where the
money was being unloaded.
</P>
<P>
Since the word of the agreement was announced early Thursday
morning, many of the businessmen have just closed down their
shops while others have stopped selling their goods in Somali
shillings at Bakara market.
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty was not confined to the store owners alone,
but the money exchange dealers have themselves put to a halt all
of their activities. However, some small exchange retailers have
started with a new value for the Somali shilling against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
In the morning the shilling took a new low by hitting 9000
shillings against each dollar sinking down from its value of 8560
a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
But the worst came after the new money was poured into the
stores of the market late in the afternoon making the shilling go
down to 10,000 shillings against one U.S. dollar, the lowest in
its history.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fear of the economists of a total economic collapse
in Somalia and in particular a bankruptcy to the small business
owners, the businessmen who imported the money are planning
modalities which they think will save the shilling by economizing
its distribution.
</P>
<P>
Analysts foresee that the huge importation of Somali shilling
notes and the weapons flowing from every direction into Somalia
are all further complicating the already stagnant peace process
of Somalia.

<P>
JERUSALEM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- About 150 Peace Now activists
held a demonstration in Hebron Friday to protest against the
Israeli government's policy of building more Jewish settlements in
the city.
</P>
<P>
"The peace activists are coming from different parts of the
country and through this demonstration in Hebron we are trying to
tell the government led by Benjamin Netanyahu that its policy of
building Jewish settlements in the city must stop," an organizer
told Xinhua via a mobile phone.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration, which is till going on, was held at the
entrance to the Ibrahim Mosque inside the city. Several local
Jewish settlers leaders tried to intervene, but were stopped by
the Israeli police and military personnel, the organizer said.
</P>
<P>
Peace Now, an Israeli peace group supporting the peace
process, strongly criticized the Israeli government's policy of
building Jewish settlements, demolishing the Palestinians' homes
and confiscating the Palestinians' lands in the occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Moshe Arens said in Hebron on Sunday that
Israel will build more Jewish settlements in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Arens made this promise to the local Jewish settlers while
laying a corner stone of a new settlement to be built near
Dabouya in the old city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Situated in the south of the West Bank, Hebron is a city
under Palestinian control. The Palestinian population in the city
is about 130,000.
</P>
<P>
But there are about 500 Jewish settlers living in several
settlements in Hebron under heavy military protection of the
Israel Defense Force (IDF).
</P>
<P>
Conflicts and shooting incidents occur quite often between the
local Palestinians and Jewish settlers in the city.
</P>
<P>
On January 4 this year, a Palestinian gunman opened fire at a
settler's van and wounded three Jewish women settlers in the city.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, 20-year-old Badar Kawashmeh, a Palestinian
resident in the city, was shot dead by the IDF.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Banks Invest 100 Million Dollars Into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel's five largest banks are
investing 400 million shekels (about 100 million U.S. dollars) to
inoculate themselves against the Year 2000 computer bug.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the big share of this money has already been spent,
according to a report published by these banks on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The five banks are expected to budget additional tens of
millions of shekels for the effort in 1999, bringing the total
they will spend on the millennium bug to some half a billion
shekels.
</P>
<P>
Computer users across the globe are rushing to reprogram old
computers whose internal calendars measure the year in two digits
rather than four -- meaning that they may reset themselves to 1900
instead of 2000 at the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
Bank Leumi, the second largest bank in Israel, reported having
spent 210 million shekels (53 million dollars), making it the
biggest spender among the five banks.
</P>
<P>
The payments are being made over a period of three years, and
over three-fourths of the total amount has already been spent.
</P>
<P>
Bank Leumi's relatively high bill may result from its heavy
reliance on outside contractors to adapt its computer systems,
whereas the other banks have tried to use mostly their own staffs
in the Y2K effort.
</P>
<P>
The bank is also preparing for the possibility that national
infrastructure systems will crash, and is stockpiling electric
generators, gasoline and cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
Bank Hapoalim, the largest bank in Israel, reported spending
70 million shekels (18 million dollars) on Y2K preparations, with
37 million shekels (9 million dollars) being on external support,
equipment and programming, and the rest on wages of its personnel.
</P>
<P>
For the other three banks, Israel Discount Bank reported
spending 54 million shekels (14 million dollars); United Mizrahi
Bank 31 million shekels (7.8 million dollars); and the First
International Bank of Israel 29 million shekels (7 million
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Reacts Positively to European Rate Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar regained
around half a U.S. cent Friday, encouraged by rate cuts in Europe
but remained trapped in a tight range below the 63 U.S. cent mark.
</P>
<P>
The rate cuts provided both positive and negative impetus for
the local currency.
</P>
<P>
Bullish news for the Australian dollar came in the fact that
the interest rate differential now makes Australia look good to
European investors.
</P>
<P>
However, the European rate reductions could prompt a similar
move here, which is bad news for the local currency.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 62.82 U.S. cents, up from
Thursday's close of 62.36.
</P>
<P>
Thursday night the European Central Bank cut its main
refinancing rate to 2.5 percent from 3.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most economists had been expecting a cut to 2.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) held its monthly board
meeting on Tuesday this week but no move on official interest
rates has occurred.
</P>
<P>
The RBA last changed its monetary policy on December 2, 1998
when it cut the cash rate by 25 basis points to 4.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the close the Australian dollar was buying 0.5849
euro from 0.5777 at Thursday's close and 75.94 Japanese yen from
75.40.

<HEADLINE> Dish-Washer Sales to Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Dish-washers are expected to
become another hot consumer item in China following in the wake of
TVs, washing machines and refrigerators, according to today's
People's Daily, the country's leading newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The sales of dish-washers increased by 9 times from January to
August last year over the same period in 1997, representing one of
the highest in sales growth among household electric appliances.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of 22,000 families in 10 major cities indicates
that 2.3 percent of the families wish to buy dish-washers soon,
while 6.4 percent intend to buy one in the near future.
</P>
<P>
China's dish-washer market is currently dominated by domestic
brand Little Swan and German brand Siemens while other overseas
makes are striving to enter the market.
</P>
<P>
Sector-insiders predict that competition in the market will be
more fierce in the later half of this year, adding that dish-
washers will in fact become the last hot consumer item of the
century in China.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Asks Xanana to Revoke Armed Struggle Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Justice Minister Muladi
has given jailed East Timorese pro-independence leader Xanana
Gusmao one week to revoke his call for the East Timorese to resume
armed struggle against Indonesian forces.
</P>
<P>
Xanana must revoke his call through a written document which
will be made public, or he will face going back to the Cipinang
high-security prison, Muladi told reporters following a meeting
with President B.J. Habibie here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Xanana, who made the call early this week, is serving a 20-year
jail term but has been moved to a special detention house to
enable him to help in the peaceful settlement of the East Timor
issue.
</P>
<P>
"His written call must be revoked by another written
announcement. It must be announced by Xanana himself through the
electronic media or whatever, and not by his lawyer," Muladi said.
</P>
<P>
Clarifying his statement on Wednesday, Xanana said, "I did not
say that we were ready for a war but I call on the people to
prepare themselves... Do not die like an animal."
</P>
<P>
He said that despite his statement, he remained committed to a
peaceful solution in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian Defense Minister and Armed Forces Chief
Gen. Wiranto Friday said a proposal for a U.N. peacekeeping force
to be deployed in East Timor following recent violent incidents
there cannot be accepted as East Timor is part of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Calls for a U.N. peacekeeping force in East Timor have recently
intensified following a shooting incident between pro- and
anti-integrationist groups in Liquica district early this week.
</P>
<P>
News reports said more than 20 people died in the encounter but
the armed forces said there were only five victims.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said it is unreasonable to ask for a U.N. peacekeeping
force in the province as the situation in Liquica has been put
under control.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975.
It became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the United Nations
never recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
On January 27, the Indonesian government announced that it is
ready to release East Timor if the alternative to provide wider
autonomy is rejected by people in the region and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has suggested that a U.N.-sponsored
direct balloting to determine if East Timor wants autonomy or
independence should be held in July.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Reaffirms Political Solution to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
reaffirmed that the Kosovo crisis in Yugoslavia should be settled
only by political means.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin reiterated Russia's position when he met with Chairman
of State Duma Gennagyij Szeleznyov, who returned Thursday from a
visit to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president, who said he believed the Yugoslav people
will fight to the end against NATO, again ruled out the
possibility that Russia would provide arms for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin held that the military alliance has not made up its
mind to send in ground troops to Kosovo because this will cause
great losses.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Yeltsin said that NATO's air attacks against
Yugoslavia were a violation of the international law and the
Charter of the United Nations. He reminded reporters that anti-U.
S. sentiments are mounting in Russia because of NATO's bombings of
Yugoslavia, especially the facilities in Belgrade and other cities
that are essential to the livelihood of the residents there.
</P>
<P>
He stressed again that Russia will continue its efforts to seek
a political solution to the conflict in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Becoming More Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua)-- Almost 80 percent of China's urban
residents claim they are suffering from stress as a result of the
huge changes sweeping the country as it continues building an
economic powerbase for the 21st century, according to today's
China Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide survey carried out last November discovered that
stress has been rising considerably since 1995 with nearly 75
percent of the people questioned convinced the pressure will
increase.
</P>
<P>
The whole fabric of China's society is changing, the survey
noted, especially in terms of social security, medical care,
employment and housing, major concerns of the residents.
</P>
<P>
The newly formed Economic Restructuring Office of the State
Council, conducted the survey among 2,430 households and
questioned one person per household aged between 16-69.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the most pressing personal worries for a lot of
Chinese people were listed in priority as unemployment, closely
followed by becoming hospitalized and decreasing income.
</P>
<P>
Researchers attributed the mounting pressure to people's
failure in adjusting to the speed of reforms, adding that people
who have managed this are less stressed.

<HEADLINE> Fernz Ponders Shift Across Tasman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's ninth largest
listed company, Fernz Corporation, is considering shifting to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post Friday quoted the Auckland-based multinational
chemicals company as saying the move across the Tasman will "give
it access to a larger capital market, reflect where its business
lies and where opportunities are greatest."
</P>
<P>
A final decision on the move will be made within a few months,
the Wellington-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Doug Rathbone, the company's chief
executive designate, as saying Fernz has "outgrown the New Zealand
business pond."
</P>
<P>
He added that the company can significantly reduce its future
financing costs by moving to Australia, especially if it raises
money for growth.
</P>
<P>
As part of the move, Fernz plans to change its name to Fernz
Nufarm. That recognizes the significant part that agricultural
chemicals group Nufarm is expected to play in the company's future
growth.
</P>
<P>
Nufarm contributes the bulk of the company's Australian
earnings, which now account for about 40 percent of Fernz's total
revenue.
</P>
<P>
According to Fernz, only about 10 percent of its sales and 8
percent of its assets are now in New Zealand. The company's total
turnover last year was 1.36 billion NZ dollars (700 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the company expects to move its head office
to Melbourne, along with a main listing on the Australian Stock
Exchange. It will maintain a local listing for its 5,500 New
Zealand shareholders.
</P>
<P>
Fernz will continue to own and operate chemical manufacturing
and distribution facilities in New Zealand, including a South
Auckland industrial chemicals plant, the newspaper said.

WASHINGTON -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said here
Thursday that both China and the United States should spare no
effort to further the Sino-U.S. relations in the fundamental
interests of the two peoples and for the sake of peace and
development of the world.

Holding talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Zhu said though
the international situation has witnessed great changes, the fact

remained intact.

Both China and the United States should review and deal with
their bilateral relations "in a historical altitude and long-term
perspective," and properly handle their existing differences on
the basis of the three joint communiques and the China-U.S. Joint
Statement so as to boost the development of the bilateral
relations in a healthy and stable manner, said the Chinese premier.

<HEADLINE> U.S., China Pledge to Continue to Work for Strategic Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji and U.S. President Bill Clinton pledged here Thursday to
continue to work toward building a constructive strategic
partnership between their countries.
</P>
<P>
"I hope and believe we can make the kind of progress together
that will enable both of us to have the kind of strong partnership
that would be very much in the world's interest in the 21st
century," Clinton said at a joint press conference with Zhu at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who arrived in the United States Tuesday for an eight-day
official visit, said the two countries will be able to promote "
the objectives of working to build a constructive strategic
partnership between the two sides" by communication and exchanges
of views.
</P>
<P>
In October 1997, Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin
agreed to work to build a constructive strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
However, efforts for such a relationship were undermined by
allegations that China stole U.S. nuclear weaponry technology and
contributed to political campaign in the United States.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States also differ on human rights and
certain international affairs such as the crisis in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"I have no illusions that cooperation with China can resolve
all of our differences. Our countries are too large, our
backgrounds are too different," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said, "It is not that friends who only say yes to you are
good friends, we believe that maybe the friends who are able to
say no to you are the best friends for you." Zhu's visit is the
first to the United States by a Chinese premier in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed that the two sides should seek
cooperation instead of confrontation despite differences.
</P>
<P>
"Where our interests diverge, we will continue to stand for our
values and to protect our national security," Clinton said. "But a
policy of confrontation for confrontation's sake ... will
accomplish nothing but the fulfillment of the bleakest prophecies
held by people in both the United States and China."
</P>
<P>
"It is in the interest of the American people and the Chinese
people that whenever we can cooperate, we should," Clinton
declared.
</P>
<P>
"This relationship, complex though it may be, is profoundly
important to the future of every American and every Chinese
citizens, and indeed, to all the world," said the U.S. president.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Seed and Fertilizers Hurt Kenyan Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A shortage of maize seed and high
 fertilizer prices have hampered some Kenyan farmers in the past
planting season, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A variety of maize seed popular among Kenyan farmers was not
available, according to the state-owned Kenya Seed Company.
</P>
<P>
Although the company claimed an alternative variety of seed was
also good, farmers did not believe it, saying that the variety
was prone to the attack by pests.
</P>
<P>
The farmers think the price of the seed was too exorbitantly
charged  with a 10-kilogram packet of the seed at 910 shillings
(about 14 U.S. dollars). They need to sell at least a 90-kilogram
sack of maize and add some more money to purchase a 10 -kilogram
of seed maize.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that scrupulous traders could take advantage of
the shortage of seed maize to sell fake ones.
</P>
<P>
The farmers expressed concern that the Kenya Seed Company
exported 1,000 tons of seed while locals suffering shortage of
the seeds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the price of a 90-kilogram bag of fertilizer rose to
1,700 shillings (27 U.S. dollars) from last year's 1,000
shillings.
</P>
<P>
"We are required to sell nearly two bags of maize to purchase a
sack of fertilizer, making us operating at a loss, " a farmer
said.
</P>
<P>
Distributors blame the increased costs of the fertilizers to
high transportation costs from the port of Mombasa, which
farmers term as exploitation "by a few selfish individuals".
</P>
<P>
The prevailing economic recession had made it impossible for
most businessmen to import fertilizers into the country,
according to the Kenyan National Farmers' Union.

<HEADLINE> Kaddoumi: Palestinians To Continue Struggle Till </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian nation will
continue its campaign till the liberation of Jerusalem and the
entire Palestine by "mobilizing every potential and possibility",
a senior Palestinian official said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the political bureau of the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO), made the remarks to the Islamic
Republic News Agency upon his arrival for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the PLO favors peace, but is against any kind of
solutions which do not guarantee the rights of the Palestinians
and hinders hoisting of the Palestinian flag in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The main hurdle on the way of the Middle East peace talks is
the Israeli occupation of Arab and Islamic territories in
Palestine, south Lebanon and Syria's Golan Heights, the PLO
official said.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the United States for its partial position
on the Middle East peace talks and said that Washington is not a
neutral mediator in the Middle East crisis.
</P>
<P>
Referring to relations between Iran and the PLO as historical,
Kaddoumi said these relations will continue until Jerusalem and
the occupied lands of Palestine are freed from under Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
He noted he will discuss the latest developments in the
occupied lands as well as regional issues with Iranian officials
during his two-day stay.

<P>
JAKARTA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was killed and
100 houses set on fire during a clash between villagers of Dalo
and Lao in Manggarai district, Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara
Province, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Tens of Lao residents have sought refuge at the police
headquarters in Manggarai," spokesman of the provincial police
Maj. Sismantoro told Antara News Agency on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the houses that were burned belonged to Dalo villagers.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that residents of the two villages have been
involved in a dispute over five plots of hereditary land. The
Supreme Court previously ruled that two plots of the land belonged
to the Dalo people.

<P>
Sismantoro said the first clash between the two villages broke
up last month, killing five people.

When asked for comment, East Nusa Tenggara Governor Piet

"We should settle it through a cultural approach. We should be
able to bring them to a table for talks," he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Rejects Allegation on Nuke Stealing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji on
Thursday rejected the allegations that China stole nuclear
technology from the United States and funneled money as political
contribution to the country.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who is on an eight-day visit to the United States, made
the rejection at a joint press conference with U.S. President Bill
Clinton at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"In the capacity of the Premier of the State Council of the
People's Republic of China, I'd like to make a very solemn
statement here that I have no knowledge whatsoever of any alleged
espionage or theft of nuclear technology," Zhu declared.
</P>
<P>
"And I don't believe such a story," he added. "It is not the
policy of China to steal so-called 'military secrets' from the
United States," he added.
</P>
<P>
Recent U.S. media reports alleged that China stole nuclear
warhead designs and perhaps neutron bomb technology from the
United States, an allegation that has been strongly refuted by the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
"Given the tight security measures in the United States and the
advanced technology, I think it's entirely impossible for China to
steal any nuclear technology or military secrets from the United
States effectively under such tight security measures," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
On the allegation of political contribution, Zhu said
emphatically: "We have never done and we will not do such a kind
of thing."
</P>
<P>
Noting that China has a foreign exchange reserve as huge as 146
billion U.S. dollars, Zhu pointed out that it would have been too
foolish of China to contribute the alleged sum of only 300,000 U.S.
dollars to the U.S. political parties and make the contribution
work effectively.

<HEADLINE> China to Halt Pollution of Dianchi Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China will build two more sewage
treatment factories in the suburbs of Kunming, capital of
southwest China's Yunnan Province, and will adopt some emergency
measures to clean up the blue green algae rampant in the Dianchi
Lake near the city.
</P>
<P>
The two factories, with a total investment of more than 400
million yuan (about 48 million US dollars), will have a daily
treatment capacity of 75,000 tons and 50,000 tons respectively.
</P>
<P>
Once they become operational the sewage treatment rate in
Kunming will be increased to 80 percent from the present 60
percent, according to an official of the State Environmental
Protection Administration.
</P>
<P>
Some environmental experts warned that this year will be the
driest and hottest year in the meteorological history of the city.
</P>
<P>
Local environmental department plans to adopt some emergency
measures to collect and clean the algae floating in the lake to
improve the water quality during the '99 Kunming World
Horticulture Exposition which is scheduled to be held from May 1
to October 31.
</P>
<P>
The famous lake, on a high plateau which covers 307 square
kilometers, plays a key role in balancing the ecological
environment in Kunming.
</P>
<P>
However, the lake's water has become murky through the amount
of industrial and domestic waste discharged into it over the last
20 years, and fast-increasing algae, whose growth is encouraged by
the chemicals and warm waters from sewage and factories, is also
clogging it up.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan Provincial Governor Li Jiating emphasized recently that
governments at various levels must strengthen supervision and
examination of the enterprises and hotels releasing serious
pollution into the lake.
</P>
<P>
Serious polluters will face a compulsory shutdown of their
businesses if they fail to meet the tight restrictions imposed to
transform the lake in time for the opening of the World
Horticulture Exposition.

<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO cleared a "safe corridor" through its bombardment
Thursday night in the hope that a Cypriot mission to Belgrade
would win the release of three captured American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- France has been barred from some of NATO's top secret
military plans because Washington fears they will be passed to the
government of Slobodan Milosevic, a senior Western military source
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- The propaganda war moved into top gear Thursday as NATO
threatened to destroy television transmission systems in
Yugoslavia and the alliance's secretary-general, Javier Solana,
accused Serbian troops of turning back Kosovar refugees to use
them as "human shields" against the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO is sending 8,000 troops to cope with the apocalyptic
refugee crisis in the Balkans, as fears grew that thousand of
refugees herded back into Kosovo may end up being used as "human
shields".
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The European Central Bank Thursday night cut its benchmark
interest rate by a bigger than expected half a percentage point.
The cut was the ECB's first such move since the euro's launch at

<HEADLINE> Significant Progress Seen in China-U.S. Talks on China's WTO Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
visiting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said on Thursday that their
countries have achieved significant progress in the negotiations
to bring China into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the White House after their
talks, Clinton said the two countries will issue a joint statement
recording the "significant progress we have made on the WTO and
committing to work to resolve all remaining issues this year."
</P>
<P>
"Today we were able to make progress in areas that benefit both
the American and Chinese people." Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said, "In my view, the gap between the two sides is really
not very significant."
</P>
<P>
"A fair WTO agreement will go far toward leveling the playing
field for our companies and our workers in China's markets; will
commit China to play by the rules of the international trading
system," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president stressed that China's accession to WTO is in
the interests of the American people.
</P>
<P>
In response, Zhu said that although China has made the biggest
possible concessions, China's accession to the organization will
also be in the interests of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"If China wants to join the WTO, wants to be integrated in the
international community, it must play the rules of the game," Zhu
noted.
</P>
<P>
"China cannot do that without making concessions," he affirmed.
But he noted that such concessions might bring about a huge impact
on China's state-owned enterprises and markets.
</P>
<P>
"But I have every assurance to say here that thanks to the
achievements made in our reform and opening up process, we will be
able to stand such impact," he said. "The competition arising from
such impact will also promote a more rapid and more healthy
development of China's national economy."
</P>
<P>
The negotiations on China's accession to WTO have been going on
for 13 years. Agreement between the U.S.-- the biggest
contracting party of the WTO -- and China is critical.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will sign some agreements on sectors such as
agriculture. "In my view, all these will further promote the
development of friendship and cooperation between China and the
United States," Zhu said.

DAR ES SALAAM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Burundi peace

sheltered in western Tanzania to be represented in the ongoing
peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Freed Philippine Police Officer Reunited With Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine police inspector Roberto
Bernal, released by the National Democratic Front (NDF), was
reunited with his family Friday as the rebels warned that he could
be targeted again.
</P>
<P>
Bernal, turned over by the rebels to representatives of the
International Red Cross at 9:30 Friday morning, met with his wife
and daughter at 10:00 in a monastery in the eastern province of
Sorsogon, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
After a tearful reunion with his family, Bernal said, "I'm
going back to the service."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the New People's Army (NPA), military arm of the
NDF, said Bernal could be abducted or targeted again should he
commit another offense against the NPA.
</P>
<P>
In a statement received by the local media, the NPA said
Bernal's release "was due to humanitarian consideration and his
acquittal on three charges against him."
</P>
<P>
But Bernal's release does not mean that he will not be
"touched" anymore, the NPA said.
</P>
<P>
Bernal was released by the rebels on the 47th day of his
captivity.
</P>
<P>
He will be subjected to medical examination and then asked to
answer a red cross questionnaire on how he was treated by his
captors.
</P>
<P>
Bernal is one of the five military and police officers abducted
by the rebels during the past two months. The others include army
general Victor Obillo and his aide.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government suspended its formal peace talks with
the rebels after the rebel group abducted these military and
police officers.
</P>
<P>
The NDF announced last month that it would release the five
abducted officers between March 22 and April 19.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada said earlier that the
government will resume the peace talks with the NDF after it
releases all the hostages.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Experts predict that China's
environmental protection products will maintain an annual growth
rate of 23 percent in the coming decade, with the output value
expected to surpass 47 billion yuan (5.66 billion U.S. dollars) in
2010.
</P>
<P>
Many favorable conditions in China at present offer a promising
future for the development of the environmental protection
industry, said Yu Yuefeng, vice-president of the China Association
of Environmental Protection Industry, adding that the growth rate
of the industry is expected to far exceed that of the gross
national product.
</P>
<P>
A series of key environmental protection programs are underway
which will give strong support to the development of the industry,
said Yu.
</P>
<P>
China now attaches importance to environmental protection, and
the creation of laws, policies and standards on environmental
protection has been growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China has initiated a trans-century environmental
protection program that requires all industrial enterprises to
meet state pollution standards by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
China has strengthened pollution control in the Liaohe, Huaihe
and Haihe rivers, and Taihu, Chaohu and Dianchi lakes, and has
made efforts to reduce acid rain and sulfur dioxide pollution. The
city of Beijing has also adopted many new effective measures to
improve its air quality.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that there will be a large demand in China for
technologies and facilities for the treatment and disposal of
urban sewage, garbage, and smog and dust, and that with market
stimulus, the environmental industry will become a key sector in
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Environmental Protection
Administration, said recently that China increased its investment
in environmental protection to the equivalent of one percent of
the gross domestic product in 1998.

He said the state approved more than 330 environmental projects
in 1998, with a total investment of 107.6 billion yuan (13 billion
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
China's annual environmental investment was close to 40 billion
yuan (4.8 billion US dollars) in the period 1991-1995, only 0.8
percent of the yearly GDP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some state financial institutions including the
State Development Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China and the Construction Bank of China have put a number
of industrial pollution-control projects in their major loan
support coverage.
</P>
<P>
"The fund will be mainly used for the control of urban air
pollution and water pollution in majors river and lakes," Xie said.
</P>
<P>
However, experts acknowledge that compared with the advanced
world level, China's environmental industry has a long way to go,
and the environmental market still lacks adequate management.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that in addition to introducing advanced technology
from abroad, China has improved product quality and has developed
new technologies and facilities which are highly efficient and low-
energy consuming, .
</P>
<P>
The environmental protection industry encompasses machinery
manufacturing, the construction of environmental projects,
environmental information services, and technology development.

economic cooperation not only between Zambia and Britain but in
Europe and would this year be discussing cooperation for the next
century, Nassling said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the British government had responded to Zambia's
proposals for the new Investment Protection and Promotion
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be the first between the two countries and
will also serve to protect industries that will engage in new

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji and U.S. President Bill Clinton pledged to enhance Sino-U.S.
relations and make joint efforts to build a better future as
Clinton hosted a dinner in honor of Zhu at the White House
Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Zhu arrived in the United States on Tuesday for an eight-day
official visit, the first by a Chinese premier in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the banquet, attended by over 200 people,
Clinton said that the Chinese civilization has dazzled the world
for thousands of years. Since 1784, he said, Chinese and Americans
have shared a lively dialogue over how to achieve common cause in
the countless pursuits that animate great nations.
</P>
<P>
"Our dialogue and cooperation have now survived over two
centuries, and over considerable challenges. Today, the premier
and I worked hard to renew both," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We spoke to each other with candor and respect about our hopes
for our people and our children's future," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that this year marks the 20th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the United
States. "I always believe that the friendly relations and
cooperation between China and the United States are developing and
growing in greater depth and scope," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the historic mutual visits by President Clinton and
President Jiang, Zhu said, new important progress has been made in
the relations between their countries, which not only serves the
interests of the peoples of the two countries but also those of
the people in the world.
</P>
<P>
"So we should steadfastly stay on this course," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said that disagreements are unavoidable
between friends and any difference between China and the United
States can be resolved through dialogue and friendly consultations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
welcomed visiting Qatar Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani to
Beijing today and said that the Emir's visit will help deepen
mutual understanding and friendship between the two countries, and
unveil a new chapter in bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Since the two countries established diplomatic relations more
than a decade ago, bilateral ties have witnessed continuous
progress, Hu said, pointing to fruitful achievements in economic,
trade, and cultural cooperation, and mutual understanding and
support in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates Qatar's pursuit of the "one China" policy on
the issue of Taiwan, and is willing to further expand cooperation
in many fields based on the five principles of peaceful
coexistence, jointly explore new cooperative forms, and establish
long-term and stable strategic cooperation oriented to the 21st
century, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president also highly praised Qatar's domestic and
foreign policies, saying China is glad that the Qatar government
and people, under the leadership of Emir Hamad, have made
considerable achievements in developing their national economy,
and building a modern and democratic nation.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of Qatar's independent foreign policy of
peace, neutrality, and non-alliance, and its active role in
safeguarding regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Hamad voiced his admiration for China's achievements in many
fields, and said that in the future multi-polar world, China will
acquire an important position. Qatar is fully aware of China's
role in world affairs, and especially appreciates China's stance
that all countries, large or small, are equal.
</P>
<P>
Qatar is grateful to China for its just stand on Middle East
issues, and hopes to increase cooperation with China in all
sectors, economic and trade in particular, the Emir said.

<HEADLINE> 7th Plenary Meeting of Macao SAR Preparatory Committee Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The 7th Plenary Meeting of the
Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region
(MSAR) opened today at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen noted that electing the
Selection Committee for the First Government of the MSAR through
secret ballot is an important task of the 7th Plenary Meeting.
</P>
<P>
He required that all Preparatory Committee members elect the
Selection Committee in accordance with the Basic Law and the
decision of the National People's Congress (NPC), under the
principle of impartiality, justice, openness, democracy, and
honesty.
</P>
<P>
The list of the 243 candidates of the Selection Committee
members was decided yesterday at the meeting of the chairman and
vice chairmen of the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
These candidates represent a broad scope and cover all walks of
life in Macao, said Qian, who is also chairman of the Preparatory
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning his first visit to Macao at the invitation of
Portugal last month, Qian called his talks with Portuguese
President Jorge Sampaio a practical and friendly one.
</P>
<P>
Both sides said that China and Portugal generally maintain
sound cooperation on the Macao issue, although there are some
matters to be solved through negotiation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Portugal is concerned that Macao characteristics will remain,
or in other words, whether the influence of Portugal will continue
in Macao," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, this point has been explained clearly in the policies
of 'one country, two systems,' 'Macao people administering Macao,'
and a high degree of autonomy," he noted, adding that both sides
should be concerned with opening a new page in Sino-Portuguese
cooperation through the smooth transition and transfer of power in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the two-day 7th Plenary Meeting will also
examine three documents concerning the formation of the first
Legislative Council of the MSAR, the establishment of a
recommendation committee of judges, as well as the emblem, seal
and flag of the MSAR government and its public administrative
institutions.

<HEADLINE> Study: Broadband PC, Interactive TV to Battle for Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Internet operators are shaping
up to deliver video-based content via broadband networks, while
broadcasters are ready to respond by adding interactive services.
</P>
<P>
This is the conclusion of a new study by Strategy Analytics, a
U.S. consulting business in high technology. The study also notes
that in the battle for consumer dollar, broadcasters will have the
edge in the near future: 14 percent of U.S. households will have
interactive TV by 2002, compared to only seven percent with
broadband PC.
</P>
<P>
A number of new and traditional players in the United States
have staked their positions in this new market within the past few
months, including Internet service providers, network operators,
broadcasters and technology providers, according to the study
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Video and interactivity are the catalysts bringing these
players into the same marketplace: Internet providers offer
enhanced content while broadcasters add interactivity.
</P>
<P>
The emerging broadband PC market is a result of increasing
ownership of cable and digital subscriber line (DSL) modems.
Analysts at the consulting firm believe that many consumers will
not pay the current high costs of broadband Internet, and that DSL
and cable modems are still unproven as far as full interactive
video services are concerned. Nevertheless, they forecast that, by
2002, broadband modems will be in seven percent of U.S. households
and two percent in European households.
</P>
<P>
By this time, however, interactive TV services will be
available in 14 percent of U.S. homes and 23 percent of European
homes. The firm predicted that many of these services will arrive
"by the back door" as part of enhanced digital television services,
allowing consumers to access home shopping, video-on-demand and
interactive information services through their TV sets.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, interactive video will offer the
Internet four great challenges, namely the cost, usability,
technology and TV. Internet operators may ultimately find that the
challenge from broadcasters is the greatest obstacle to success,
the study predicted.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt to Encourage Private House Ownership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has set
aside 40 billion kwacha (about 17 million U.S. dollars) to build
1,200 housing units here as part of the Presidential Housing
Initiative (PHI) introduced at the end of last year to enhance
private house ownership.
</P>
<P>
But PHI chairman Richard Sakala said here Thursday that quotes
and rates from bidders have put the value at almost double
government's estimated budget, the Post newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted him as saying that by the end of
this month PHI will have approved and awarded contracts for the
construction of the houses.
</P>
<P>
He said some international interest has been generated by the
project, "very soon we may see international private partners
coming into the housing project."
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year 70 percent of the work should have been
done, he said.
</P>
<P>
The project will initially concentrate on building low cost
houses for Zambians, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said 4,000 housing units are intended for Lusaka, Zambia's
capital, and then the project will spread to other districts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Sakala said that modalities will be put in place to make sure
loans for the purchase of houses are available.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Urges Rebels to Free All Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Following police inspector Roberto
Bernal's release, Philippine President Joseph Estrada Friday urged
the rebel National Democratic Front (NDF) to free all the abducted
officers to speed up the resumption of the stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The simultaneous release of the hostages held by the rebels
would be a good start for both sides to ensure the success of the
peace process, Estrada told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I urge them not to add to the sufferings of the hostages," he
said. "I urge them to release the hostages simultaneously so we
can immediately resume the peace process."
</P>
<P>
He said the formal peace talks between the government and the
NDF should be concluded this year, noting that the conflict "has
gone on for too long."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a radio interview, Secretary of Defense Orlando
Mercado made it clear that formal peace negotiations with the NDF
will be reopened by the government only after the release of all
the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Bernal, one of the five military and police officers abducted
during the past two months, was released by the rebels on Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The other four are army general Victor Obillo, his aide Eduardo
Montealto, Sergeant Alipio Lozada and a military intelligence
officer.
</P>
<P>
Bernal, turned over by the rebels to representatives of the
International Red Cross at 9:30 Friday morning, reunited with his
wife and daughter at 10:00 in a monastery in the eastern province
of Sorsogon, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
After the tearful reunion, Bernal said, "I'm going back to the
service."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the New People's Army (NPA), military arm of the
NDF, said Bernal could be abducted or targeted again should he
commit another offense against the NPA.
</P>
<P>
In a statement received by local media, the NPA said Bernal's
release "was due to humanitarian consideration and his acquittal
on three charges against him."
</P>
<P>
But Bernal's release does not mean that he will not be
"touched" anymore, the NPA said.
</P>
<P>
Bernal was released by the rebels on the 47th day of his
captivity.
</P>
<P>
He will be subjected to medical examination and then asked to
answer a red cross questionnaire on how he was treated by his
captors.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government suspended its formal peace talks with
the rebels after the rebel group abducted these military and
police officers.
</P>
<P>
The NDF announced last month that it would release the five
abducted officers between March 22 and April 19.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada said earlier that the government will resume
the peace talks with the NDF after it releases all the hostages.

innovative and improved feeding, management and husbandry
practices.

<HEADLINE> China Firmly Opposes U.S. Human Rights Bill: Zhu Rongji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China is firmly opposed to a U.
S.-tabled draft resolution on human rights against China at the
Human Rights Commission session in Geneva, visiting Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I not only regard that as unfair, but also take it as an
interference in China's internal affairs," he said at a joint
press conference with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu pointed out that China has made very big progress
in the area of human rights over the past several decades since
the founding of new China, adding that "the Chinese people today
enjoy unprecedented extensive democratic and political rights."
</P>
<P>
Through certain legal procedures, Chinese people can voice
their criticism of the government, exercise supervision over the
government, and also fully express their opinions.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, in terms of the freedom of speech and freedom of
press, China indeed has made very great progress," he added.

<P>
Zhu, who is currently paying an eight-day official visit to the
U.S. at the invitation of President Clinton, noted that the
question of human rights should be put in a historical perspective,
saying "I think different countries should have a different
understanding of this question."
</P>
<P>
Different countries have different conditions, and human rights
actually is also a concept that has evolved in history, he noted.
Given different levels of education and income, he said, it is
natural that people may have different concepts of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Every country has its own approach to the improvement of its
human rights because human rights include so many aspects, said
Zhu, the first Chinese premier to visit the United States in 15
years.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is willing to have dialogues on the issue of
human rights with other countries such as the United States,
Canada and Australia, with which China has channels of dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want a confrontation in this regard," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> More Congolese Refugees to Enter Zambia: UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- About 15,000 more Congolese
refugees will enter Zambia through Kaputa in Northern Province of
Zambia next month, the United Nations World Food Program has
predicted.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated arrivals will raise to nearly 40,000 the total
number of Congolese refugees in the province.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Times of Zambia newspaper quoted WFP Zambia country
director Techeste Zergaber as saying a new survey conducted by WFP
in Kaputa revealed that the influx had continued unabated with as
many as 500 people entering Zambia on some days.
</P>
<P>
"As this rate we could easily see another 15,000 people
arriving within a month. WFP has been able to borrow food from
other program to feed the refugees but those supplies are rapidly
becoming exhausted," he said in Lusaka Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17,467 refugees are being supported by the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) while an additional
6,000 refugees have sought refugee among the local people.
</P>
<P>
"The refugees are mostly coming from the Kalemie, Moba and Pepa
areas of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. They share close
ethnic and social ties with the Zambian people living in Kaputa
district," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zergaber said the arrival of some refugees, especially those
who had spontaneously settled in Zambian villages, was putting a
significant strain on the community.
</P>
<P>
He said the people were still recovering from the severe food
shortages caused by heavy flooding in the area during the
1997/1998 crop season.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs Of Macao SAR Basic Law (19) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Following is Part 19 of a question
and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
What will happen if laws enacted by the MSAR legislature
contravene the Basic Law?
</P>
<P>
Under the Basic Law, the MSAR has extensive legislative powers
and can enact its own legislation on anything that is within the
scope of autonomy, including criminal, civil, commercial,
administrative, procedural, and tax laws.
</P>
<P>
MSAR's Legislative Council can enact, amend, suspend or repeal
laws in accordance with the Basic Law. It is expected to report
laws it enacts to the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) for its records and these laws are not to be
affected by this reporting for the record.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee has the power to review laws enacted
by the MSAR Legislative Council. Any law it rejects immediately
becomes invalid if it is proven not to conform to Basic Law
provisions about areas that are the responsibility of the Central
Government or if it regards Central Government-Regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee has the power of review and respects
and upholds the high degree of autonomy of the MSAR.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Following is Part 20 of a question
and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
What national laws apply to the MSAR?
</P>
<P>
Article 18 of the Basic Law and Annex III to the Basic Law
state that 8 national laws apply to the MSAR. These are given in
Annex III and deal with national defense, foreign affairs,
national unification, and territorial integrity and directly
concern the exercise of state sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that the national laws listed in Annex III
can be amended in the interest of national unification and
territorial integrity and Article 18 of the Basic Law states that
the NPC Standing Committee can add laws to the laws in Annex III
or delete them after consulting the MSAR Basic Law Committee and
the Regional Government. The laws in Annex III to the Basic Law
are to be limited to those relating to defense and foreign affairs
and to matters outside the limits of autonomy of the Region as
specified by the Basic Law. In the event the NPC Standing
Committee decides to declare a state of war or, because of turmoil
in the MSAR endangering national unity or security that is beyond
the control of the Regional Government, decides that the region is
in a state of emergency, the Central People's Government can order
the enforcing of certain national laws in the region.

<HEADLINE> PNG PM Vows to Crack Down on Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea's (PNG) Prime
Minister Bill Skate promised Friday that he would find the funds
to fight rampant crime "by hook or by crook, within the laws" if
they were available.
</P>
<P>
He made the promise in his closing address to a national
law-and-order conference in Port Moresby, capital of PNG, saying
crime in PNG was hindering business investment.
</P>
<P>
Skate said law and order was a priority for his government
along with the economy and the peace process in Bougainville.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that every year about 11,000 serious or
indictable offenses were committed in PNG, including murder, rape,
armed robbery, assault, housebreaking and drugs and firearms
offenses, the Australian Associated Press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
PNG is considered the crime "hot spot" of the South Pacific,
the AAP said earlier this week in a separate report.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent business survey conducted by a private
think-tank, the Institute of National Affairs, 98 percent of
respondents put theft and crime as the biggest single obstacle to
business in PNG.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 15 percent of the urban workforce had crime as a primary
source of income, and crime cost the community 112 million U.S.
dollars, or 4.6 percent of gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the conference, Chief Justice Arnold Amet said
Papua New Guinea's courts and jails were so slow and inefficient
that countless criminals, including violent rapists and murderers,
evaded prosecution or escaped from jail.
</P>
<P>
Arnold said the PNG judicial system took too long to prosecute
offenders, resulting in witnesses "going AWOL (absent without
leave)" and the accused being discharged or "jumping the fence."
</P>
<P>
On average, 50 percent of all serious crimes went unreported.
</P>
<P>
About 35 percent of serious crimes occurred in the national
capital, Port Moresby.
</P>
<P>
Police estimated that there were 50,000 criminals known as
"rascals" operating in the Port Moresby area.
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner Peter Aigilo said earlier this week that
crime was rising as the youth of PNG rejected their traditional
village culture and flocked to the cities, where they had few job
opportunities and little support.
</P>
<P>
He said there were 40,000 unemployed youths in Port Moresby and
84 illegal squatter settlements and little was being done to
address the problem.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Auto Sales Hit Record High in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumers bought a record
number of new cars and trucks in the first three months of this
year, as automakers throttled back on the incentives they had been
using for years to lubricate vehicle sales, according to a report
from Detroit.
</P>
<P>
The major U.S. automakers -- General Motors Corp., Ford Motor
Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG -- set a new all-time monthly record of
1.54 million new cars and trucks sold in March. First quarter
sales also reached their best level in more than a decade at 3.92
million.
</P>
<P>
Sales were brisk in the first quarter even though the
incentives were about even with or less than those of 1998.
</P>
<P>
For the industry as a whole, total incentives including cash
rebates, merchandising offers and lease deals fell from 2,087 U.S.
dollars per vehicle in January to 1,692 dollars in March, reported
Art Spinella of industry research firm CNW Marketing Research.
</P>
<P>
Incentives for March 1998 were 1,728 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the sales growth last month to a
combination of several factors, including strong consumer
confidence, low interest rates and low unemployment. Consumers
also put their tax refunds and mortgage refinancing proceeds to
work by purchasing new vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the U.S. government during the past few
months show the price deflation on new cars and trucks that marked
the past two years has come to an end.
</P>
<P>
The average sticker price of a new vehicle was 24,736 dollars
in March, a 10-percent increase over a year ago, CNW said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Ready to Help Kosovo Refugees: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley said here Friday that her country is ready to offer
refuge and aid to refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a media release, Shipley said New Zealand can be providing
direct help to them as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
"There has been an outpouring of concern by New Zealanders
about the plight of refugees. This government has an obligation as
a good international citizen to do whatever we can to help," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said her government officials have been
talking this week with the New Zealand Albanian community who are
eager to see a refuge provided for Albanian family groups from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
As well as offering places for those refugees, the government
is in touch with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to
assess how best New Zealand can help in providing refugee
assistance, she said.
</P>
<P>
She added that her government will consider specific proposals
on Monday to provide temporary refuge and humanitarian aid in the
region, such as a small mobile medical team to work in refugee
camps along the border areas of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Bid to Scrap Whaling Sanctuary Predicted to Fail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A Wellington-based newspaper
Friday predicted that a Japanese bid to abolish a whaling
sanctuary
will fail at next month's International Whaling Commission (IWC)
meeting in Grenada, West Indies.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post said the Japanese bid is seen as its way of
stopping the establishment of a new South Pacific sanctuary
promoted
by New Zealand and Australia and at next month's IWC meeting the
Japanese will propose scrapping the sanctuary agreed to only five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"However, it needs a three-quarters majority and New Zealand
authorities are optimistic it will fail to obtain this," the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly will very, very strongly oppose any move to
abolish
the sanctuary," the newspaper quoted New Zealand's commissioner to

the IWC Jim McLay as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is supported by other anti-whaling countries such as
Australia,
the United States and Britain, he added.
</P>
<P>
"In fact I suppose this is probably a strategic move to head
off a
proposal to establish a South Pacific sanctuary which would add on
to
the Southern Sanctuary," McLay said.
</P>
<P>
Simon Towle, a New Zealand scientist with the World Wildlife
Fund
for Nature, was quoted as saying the proposal to set up a new
South
Pacific sanctuary has a chance of succeeding.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the South Pacific sanctuary would
extend the feeding grounds of whales and cover important breeding
grounds and other species not part of the sanctuary.

having 76 affiliated organizations and more than 800 local
affiliations nationwide. It also publishes 67 different medical
journals in Chinese and English," Cao added.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the advisory function of his organization. For
example, national research into viral hepatitis spurred the
Ministry of Health to launch a Hepatitis B vaccination campaign
for new born babies. Analysis and approval of drugs and monitoring
examinations for doctors also have the support of the CMA.
</P>
<P>
"Now 84 years old, the CMA has seen its overseas influence
growing," Cao said.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the association has joined 15
international medical organizations including the World Medical
Association, hosted nearly ten international conferences, and
published Chinese editions of medical journals from the United
States and Britain following close cooperation with relevant
foreign medical associations.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, which is held every five years, will
also elect new officials and an executive board.

</P>
<P>
Mubarak, the first Egyptian president ever to visit South Korea

<HEADLINE> Cleveland-Based University Rated Most-Wired US Campus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Case Western Reserve
University (CWRU) in Cleveland has been ranked as the most-wired
campus among the U.S. colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
According to a CWRU news release published Thursday, the rating
by Yahoo Internet Life magazine was based on a survey examining
hardware, academics, free services and miscellaneous computing
services.
</P>
<P>
At CWRU, 90 percent of public computers are available around
the clock, every resident hall room is wired and free technical
support is available daily. Students are guaranteed 25 megabytes
of Web space and can retain free e-mail access for life after
graduation.
</P>
<P>
CWRU is a private institution enrolling 9,800 students. Some 90
percent of its undergraduates own their own computers. About 400
undergraduate courses -- some 40 percent of all offered --
incorporate the use of network-based activities.
</P>
<P>
More than 6,000 miles of fiber-optic cable have been installed
on campus. The network can transmit the amount of information
contained in the Library of Congress across campus in 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The campus began installing asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
for its network in 1994. There are now 4,000 ATM devices on its
Net and ATM technology is available in all student residential
areas and many academic buildings.
</P>
<P>
CWRU school of medicine converted its 6,000-page syllabus to
electronic form in 1992, and in the following year began issuing
laptops to all incoming students so that they could access and
interact with these materials. The school also has a link for two-
way video conferencing with an affiliated hospital in Detroit,
where students and faculty can participate in joint lectures and
seminars with campus counterparts.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the management, engineering, dental and social
work schools conduct distance-learning. The school of management
offers courses in conjunction with affiliated schools in Hungary
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The university also said that undergraduate students will use
the new Web-based registration system when registering for fall
classes, instead of waiting in line.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Croatian Prime Minister Zlatko
Matesa told cabinet members Thursday that NATO's airstrikes
against neighboring Yugoslavia have already inflicted heavy
economic losses on Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Due to Croatia's support of NATO in the political and military
arena, NATO's military actions in Kosovo are "causing greater
threat and increasingly serious consequences upon the Croatian
economy," Matesa said.
</P>
<P>
Because both Croatia and Yugoslavia were listed as war-prone
areas, some business contracts signed by Croatia and foreign
countries were suspended, he said.
</P>
<P>
A major shipyard in the port of Rijeka lost contracts worth 12.
5 million U.S. dollars, according to Matesa.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign cargo ships, which were due to dock in Rijeka, now
have to dock in the Slovenian port of Koper, he said.

ASHKHABAD, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Presidents from five central
Asian nations met here Thursday to discuss regional cooperation
and the issue of saving the Aral Sea.
</P>
<P>
President of Turkmenistan Saparmurad Niyazov, Kazakhstan's
Nursultan Nazarbayev, Uzbekistan's Islam Karimov, Kyrgyzstan's
Askar Akayev and Tajikistan's Emomali Rakhmonov, agreed that the
five nations should increase mutual understanding, live in peace,

endangered Aral Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Aral Sea, which is located in the Southeast of Central Asia,
was once the forth biggest inland lake in the world.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1960s, the water level of the Aral Sea has dropped by
more than sixty percent and the lake's ecological safety is in
great danger.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Manufacturing Sector's Productivity Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Total Factor Productivity
(TFP) of Malaysia's manufacturing sector grew by 1.02 percent
between 1996 and 1998, International Trade and Industry Minister
Rafidah Aziz said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
A higher TFP growth indicates efficiency of utilization and
management of resources and materials and inputs necessary for the
production of goods and services, she said at the on-going annual
dialogue of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
(MITI).
</P>
<P>
The Seventh Malaysia Plan (1996-2000) and Second Industrial
Master Plan (1996-2005) emphasized the shift in the growth
strategy from input or investment-driven to productivity-driven by
enhancing the contribution of TFP to real gross domestic product
from 28.7 percent in the Sixth Malaysia Plan to 41.3 percent in
the Seventh Plan, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that productivity-linked growth is crucial to
sustaining competitiveness in the current global economic
environment.
</P>
<P>
She said the factors that determined changes in the TFP are
demand intensity-related as reflected by the ability to expand
market share and capturing new market as well as higher
utilization of machinery and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Other factors, she said, are the higher level of skills and
ability to manage advanced machinery coupled with technological
progress, which are determined by positive work culture, high team
spirit within the work force, multi-skilling, using new techniques
in operation process, utilizing new innovations to create new
products and using capital to buy latest machinery for better
production.

BANGKOK, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of outbound Thai
tourists rose by 19 percent to 246,000 during the first two months
of this year, compared with 206,000 for the same period last year,
according to the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT)
</P>
<P>
Tour operators expected this figure will increase to at least
25 percent during the Songkran Festival this month.
</P>
<P>
During the previous two years, the number of outbound Thai
tourists shrank due to the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government is concerning about the rising number of
outbound Thai tourists this year. Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda recently asked the TAT to prepare tourism
promotion campaigns to encourage domestic tourism.
</P>
<P>
The rising number of outbound tourists could cause economic
problems as it is sapping Thailand's foreign currency reserves at
a time when the Thai government is trying to increase them. TAT
Deputy Governor Juthamas Siriwan was quoted Friday by The Nation
as saying that overseas expenditure by Thai tourists is one of the
most serious issues. For example, in January 1999 Thai tourists
spent a total of 1.6 million U.S. dollars in Singapore.

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka's Apparel Exports Amount to 2052 Mln Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's apparel exports, the
prime earner of foreign exchange, have grown to 2052 million U.S.
dollars last year from a modest 9.9 million dollars in 1977, the
official Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Trihene Gomez, the outgoing chairman of Sri
Lanka Garment Buying Offices Association, as saying that apparel
industry accounted for 66 percent of industrial exports and 44
percent of total exports.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005 when the Multi Fibre Arrangement is scrapped,
apparel exports will be on the basis of merit instead of quota. By
then, the projections of growth in Sri Lankan apparel exports will
reach 8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
This indicates a swift economic growth and its importance to
the socio-economic stability of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gomez outlined proposals of his association to formulate a
Macro Economic Strategic Plan for the industry to face challenges
in the pre-and-post quota period.
</P>
<P>
He observed that due to negative growth in buying trends from
major export markets in the United States and Europe, buyers
demands have become more exacting.
</P>
<P>
He added that the apparels sector was approaching uncertain
times but if the industry took up the challenges thrown at them,
the post 2005 phase out era could well prove to be the best of
times.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Parties to Stage Hartal This </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition alliance has
called a nationwide dawn-to-dusk hartal (destructive strike) to
protest deterioration of law and order situation, spiraling price
of essential commodities and an electricity and water crisis in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The program, also aimed at pressing home their four demands,
was announced separately by the major opposition - the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party, the Jatiya Party, theJamaat-e-Islami, the
Islami Oikya Jote and some other small parties on Thursday, press
reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The demands included replacement of the chief election
commissioner and stopping harassing opposition workers and
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The countrywide shutdown would be preceded by rallies,
demonstrations and procession at the six divisional headquarters
on April 17 and across the country on April 15.
</P>
<P>
This would the fourth hartal sponsored by the opposition
alliance this year.
</P>
<P>
The country's donors have raised their concern over the
political conflict in Bangladesh, and have asked for a resolution
between the government and the opposition earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"We've advised them (the donors) to not talk politics any
more... not to be worried about the political situation. We
assured them it will not affect foreign-aided development
projects," Commerce and Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed was
quoted as saying on Thursday by The Daily Star newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"We don't like to see the donors interfere in local politics,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition also had its own say. "We can straight go for
dialog with the government if it accepts out demands. We've
already communicated our position to the donors," BNP Secretary
General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan said. The April 18 hartal would the
first step in a series of hartals to oust the government, he said.
</P>
<P>
The donors will meet in Paris for a meeting of the Bangladesh
Development Forum, known previously as the Paris Aid Consortium,
scheduled for April 19 and 20 this year, and analysts here
speculated that the political standoff might have some impact on
the meeting.

Another lady donor added that they donate with blood instead of
money and properties which they cannot afford. She believes that
people are poor because they did less charity services in their
previous existence according to the religious saying. "That is why
I try to make more donations so far as I am alive," she reasoned.
</P>
<P>
Among the donors, there appeared a middle-aged monk, who looked
strong with smile and were being served with simple nutritious
food arranged by the blood bank after blood transfusion was
carried out, said he has come from a remote township outside
Yangon for 52 times for the purpose since he was 20 years old,
aiming at saving human life with available drop of his pure blood
and goodwill without discrimination of whether the patient, in
need of blood, is friend or enemy.
</P>
<P>
The monk disclosed that he was awarded a third-level honorable
title for prominent undertaking in social charity services in
terms of blood donation, presented by the government in 1998 after
he had made the donation for 48 times.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, a blood donor is eligible to claim the third-level
title when he or she has done at least for 40 times with record
forwarded," the monk clarified.
</P>
<P>
It is also known that those, who have made the donation for 60
times, may claim for the second-level title and those for 70 times
for the first-level one.
</P>
<P>
U Tun Myint, an official of the blood bank, briefed that there
are about 100 people, including men and women as well as monks,
coming for blood donation daily. Of them, 42 percent are men and
25 percent women, while 33 percent are monks.
</P>
<P>
He went on disclosing that there was a man who has donated his
blood for 95 times, winning the highest number of times in the
move.
</P>
<P>
Donation of blood in Myanmar is acceptable for people at the
age between 18 and 55, who weigh over 100 pounds (45.36 kilogram)
for male and over 90 pounds (40.82 kg) for female and must have
designated blood pressure and sound health requirements.
</P>
<P>
There registered thousands of blood donors in Myanmar. Although
blood donation is allowed once four months in the country, rare
persons can do more than three times a year.
</P>
<P>
A blood donor is allowed to transfuse his blood on each
occasion to the other with a volume of 350 cc or 7 percent of
one's body blood, while served with coffee, cake and egg as well
as provided with medicines free of charge for blood recovery.
</P>
<P>
The donor, if he is a public servant, will be granted two
holidays on presentation of testimonial issued by the concerned
blood bank for the act.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government rewards people yearly who donated blood
for over 50 times in order to encourage them to do more social
charity services. This year's event is set to take place in
December.
</P>
<P>
There are 30 blood banks in the entire Myanmar. The two in
Yangon and Mandalay, are the largest ones in the country.

Returning from Belgrade, Szeleznyov said if Yugoslavia had a
modern air-defense system, NATO could not strike their targets
with such accuracy.
</P>
<P>
All the weapons Yugoslav troops are using were made in the
former Soviet Union or Russia. He said Russia would like to be
able to keep these weapons in a state of preparedness.
</P>

He added that Russia is considering whether or not to offer new
high-tech weapons to Belgrade.

The chairman of the lower house of parliament reiterated that
Russia is making an effort to urge the conflicting sides to meet
again at the negotiation table. He said that Russia would not like
to become involved in a war.

But if the conflict in the Balkans intensifies,Russia will
fight for Yugoslavia, he said. He also warned Washington that the
Serbs will fight to the last man. No military intimidation will

<HEADLINE> Rockwell Plans New Investments in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Rockwell, an international
electronic controls and communications company, will open three
new facilities in China.
</P>
<P>
These facilities, with a total investment of 30 million U.S.
dollars, include an automation-avionics service and logistics
company; an automation research center in Shanghai and Rockwell's
China headquarters in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"China remains a high priority for Rockwell's strategic
activities as we approach the 21st century," today's China Daily
quoted Don Davis, chairman and chief executive officer of Rockwell,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Working with our partners in China, we have great confidence
that we will continue to build on our leading positions in
industrial automation, avionics and communications, and in
electronic commerce," Davis said.
</P>
<P>
The automation-avionics service and support company consists of
a service and support center for maintenance, repair, training and
technical assistance for avionics and in-flight entertainment
systems supplied to Chinese airlines, and a logistics center for
distribution of Rockwell automation products.
</P>
<P>
The three facilities are expected to speed up the development
of innovative automation technologies and support the localization
of Rockwell products in conjunction with Chinese partners and
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to invest more in the future as we grow our
business in China," Davis said.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Rockwell's annual sales in China have averaged 70
million U.S. dollars a year. Its automation division accounts for
about two-thirds of these sales.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, Rockwell has set up operations in 14 cities in
China with a staff of 200.

<HEADLINE> Premier Zhu Holds Talks With President Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji said here Thursday that both China and the United States
should spare no effort to further the Sino-U.S. relations in the
fundamental interests of the two peoples and for the sake of peace
and development of the world.
</P>
<P>
Holding talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Zhu said though
the international situation has witnessed great changes, the fact
that the two countries share important common interests has
remained intact.
</P>
<P>
Both China and the United States should review and deal with
their bilateral relations "in a historical altitude and long-term
perspective," and properly handle their existing differences on
the basis of the three joint communiques and the China-U.S. Joint
Statement so as to boost the development of the bilateral
relations in a healthy and stable manner, said the Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the Taiwan issue is the most important and
sensitive core issue in the bilateral ties, Zhu urged the U.S.
side to strictly abide by the three joint communiques, commit to
its promises concerning the problem, and not to provide the
Theater Missile Defense system, known as TMD, as well as its
technology and equipment or other advanced weapons to Taiwan in
any way.
</P>
<P>
"The talks are constructive and productive. The two leaders had
an in-depth exchange of views on China-U.S. relations as well as
on international and regional issues of common concern in a frank
and candid atmosphere," a spokesman of the visiting Chinese
delegation told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who is currently paying an eight-day official visit to the
United States at the invitation of Clinton, said China and the
United States, as two big influential countries, are responsible
for the peace, prosperity and development of the world.
</P>
<P>
Zhu recalled that during the historic talks between Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and Clinton in Washington in late October
1997, the two sides decided to make joint efforts to establish a
constructive strategic partnership between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that over the past year and half, China and the
United States held effective consultations and cooperation on some
international and regional issues such as easing the Asian
financial crisis and preventing nuclear proliferation in South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved that a mutually beneficial cooperative
relationship will not only serve the interests of the two peoples,
but also play a constructive role in stabilizing the international
financial situation and promoting security and development of the
region and the world, he noted.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Clinton reiterated the commitment of the U.S.
government to its "One China" policy as well as the three Sino-U.S.
joint communiques and its relevant promises.
</P>
<P>
He agreed with Zhu that a good U.S.-China relationship is in
the fundamental interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government attaches great importance to its relations
with China, Clinton said, adding that Zhu's visit is very
important and will give a new impetus to the development of the
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Clinton spoke highly of China's active role in dealing with the
Asian financial crisis, especially its policy to keep the Chinese
currency stable under great pressure.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also exchanged views on human rights and the
situation in Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav and the Serb
governments have halted military actions against the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA), the Yugoslav government announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two governments decided to halt military actions after a
Tuesday meeting between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, a statement issued by the
Yugoslav Information Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The decision is intended to create conditions suitable for
refugees to return home and for resolving the Kosovo issue
politically, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The information ministry said that NATO shelled civilian
facilities in Pristina and other sites throughout Kosovo during a
time when refugees were reportedly returning home and the
situation was easing, which is apparently aimed at undermining the
process for a dialogue and a political accord among the Serbs,
ethnic Albanians and other nationalities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The statement renewed the call for all remaining Kosovo
citizens to stay in their homeland so as to help prevent further
NATO air strikes.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnam Journalists' Association
vehemently condemned NATO's gruesome military acts against the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and asked it to end them
immediately, local press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The association said in its statement issued in Hanoi on
Thursday that "together with the Vietnamese people and
peace-loving people all over the world, the Vietnamese press
circle is very indignant at NATO's savage military attack against
the Yugoslavian people."
</P>
<P>
It said that " we are journalists from a country that
experienced heavy losses and sacrifices in wars caused by foreign
invasion. Therefore, we have great compassion for the Yugoslavian
people and journalists' serious losses resulted from NATO's
military attacks."
</P>
<P>
The association also expressed their belief in the will of
independence, freedom and effective self-defense actions of the
Yugoslavian people in their just fight.
</P>
<P>
The association called for a peaceful and just solution
hammered out by negotiation to solve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese journalists calls on their colleagues to raise
their voice to protest NATO's inhumane military acts and demand
NATO put an end to the war.
</P>
<P>
They also calls for respect for the principle of neither
threatening nor using force to settle international disputes and
honoring the United Nations Charter to restore peace in the Balkan
region, thus contributing to peace on the world as a whole.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Rice exports dropped
sharply by 21 percent year-on-year to 1.71 million tons in the
first quarter this year, resulting from a reduction in world
demand as well as severe competition, according to the figures
released by the Thai Rice Exporters' Association available here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In baht terms, the value fell by 36 percent compared with the
same period last year, from 26.76 billion baht to 17.15 billion
baht, while in dollar terms, it declined by 20 percent, from 572
million U.S. dollars to 457 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The drop in exports, both in value and volume, is forcing the
Thai government to urgently consider new marketing strategies to
bolster exports otherwise it would raise serious problems soon,
such as a fall in rice prices domestically.

Last year, Thailand exported 6.3 million tons of Rice.

<HEADLINE> Italian Prosecutor Asks 15 Years Imprisonment For Andreotti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 8 (Xinhua) -- An Italian public prosecutor Thursday
asked the court hearing charges of Mafia involvement against
former Italian premier Giulio Andreotti for a sentence of 15
years' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary hearing on a 2,000-page indictment against
Andreotti on the charge of Mafia association was opened on January
23, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Scarpinato, a prosecutor in the southern Italian city
of Palermo, also called on the judges to bar Andreotti, 80, from
public office to end his political career during which he served
seven terms in the premier's office and held a number of
portfolios in post-war cabinets led by his former Christian
Democratic party.
</P>
<P>
According to the main points in the prosecution's case,
Andreotti is guilty of having maintained "more than occasional"
relations with members of the Sicilian "Cosa Nostra" and "the
transformation of his faction" in the once all-powerful Catholic
party into "a structure at the service of the Mafia".
</P>
<P>
Scarpinato argued that "Andreotti's contribution allowed the
Cosa Nostra to pursue a purpose it would not have been able to
pursue with its own military structure".
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the defendant, who was not present in the
courtroom, attorney Gioacchino Sacchi said there was not a shred
of evidence to back up the charge.
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyers will begin their summation on May 18 for a
41-day suspension of proceedings here while a trial in the central
city of Perugia reopens again.
</P>
<P>
In Perugia, Andreotti and his one-time close aide are charged
with ordering the murder, in 1979, of journalist Carmine Pecorelli
who, according to the prosecution, was preparing to use his
magazine to attack Andreotti over a tax-milking scandal.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Imposes Restricts on Yugoslav Citizens' Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Restrictions have been imposed on
the entry of Yugoslav citizens to Bulgaria, the Bulgarian Interior
Minister Bogomil Bonev said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo ethnic Albanians are no longer allowed to enter Bulgaria
except in transit, the minister said after the government approved
a program to mitigate the adverse effects of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
If, however, Yugoslav citizens apply for asylum in Bulgaria, it
will be granted, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are no restrictions on the entry of ethnic Bulgarians
coming from the Western Outlands -- a territory which Bulgaria
lost to Serbia after World War I -- and Macedonians. International
transit traffic is unimpeded, too.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo Albanians transiting en route to Turkey are allowed free
entry. They are escorted to the Kapitan Andreevo checkpoint and
handed over to Turkish authorities.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo Albanians who have crossed into Bulgaria illegally will
be accepted and granted refugee status.
</P>
<P>
"We do not send them back, unlike some other countries in the
region that spout rhetoric in support of refugees but have
actually deployed troops at their borders to prevent their entry,"
Bonev said.
</P>
<P>
Another 12 Yugoslav citizens claiming to be Kosovo Albanians
applied for refugee status on Wednesday, bringing the number of
such asylum seekers to 152. Some 64 of them have arrived since
NATO air strikes began, the Government Information Office said.

YANGON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar increased its import of
capital goods in recent years in an effort to meet the demand of
building economy domestically.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official figures published by the
country's Central Statistical Organization, Myanmar imported
capital goods worth 1.42 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, accounting
for 50.28 percent of the total import.
</P>
<P>
The import volume in the year increased by 34.5 percent and
80.5 percent as compared with that in 1997 and 1996 which were

<P>
Of the capital goods imported in 1998, transport equipment was
valued at 794.7 million dollars, accounting for 55.96 percent of
the total, while electrical machinery and apparatus was worth 251
million dollars, representing 17.67 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Exports Continue to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports continued to
decline in the first two months of 1999, falling 31 percent in
baht terms and 5.2 percent in U.S. dollars, the Thai Business
Economics Department said.
</P>
<P>
The department said in a statement received here on Friday that
export value in baht terms for the two months totaled 303.28
billion baht (8.32 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports for the period totaled 262.54 billion baht
(7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Exports that declined included agricultural and agro-industrial
products, such as rice, rubber, frozen shrimp, refined sugar and
canned seafood.
</P>
<P>
The statement attributed the year-on-year decline to the
strengthening of the baht to about 36.29 against the dollar in
January, compared with 51.15 in the same month last year. The rate
in February was 36.60 compared with 49.19 in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The dollar decline was caused by sagging economies in Asia and
declining demand in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Another factor was intense competition, with sporadic
price-cutting by rivals Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines,
South Korea, Mexico and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The liquidity shortage among Thai exporters also contributed to
the fall.
</P>
<P>
Among Thailand's major export markets, in particular Eastern
Europe, plunged 45.6 percent in January and 25.3 percent in
February. Exports to the United States, EU, ASEAN, Hong Kong,
China and Africa also posted declines.
</P>
<P>
Exports of frozen seafood and canned processed products are
likely to face difficulties, particularly in the EU following
Thailand's removal from the preferential tariff scheme this year.
</P>
<P>
However, export markets were expanding in Japan, Taiwan, South
Korea, the Middle East and Australia, particularly for vehicles

<HEADLINE> Philippines Lowers Investment Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Due to the slack in the investment
inflow, the Board of Investments (BoI) of the Philippines has
decided to cut down the investment target for 1999 by 25 percent
to 7.5 billion U.S. dollars from the original estimate of 10
billion U.S. dollars, the Philippine Post said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The BoI reported that investment target now set for 1999 is
only 12 percent higher than the actual investments of 6.68 billion
U.S. dollars registered in 1998, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in the target could be attributed to the slack in
the movement of investments into the country due to impact of the
regional financial crisis, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the year, BoI-registered investments amounted
only to 128 million U.S. dollars, an 86 percent decrease from the
919 million U.S. dollars recorded in the same period last year, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government is intensifying its promotion efforts
to boost investments by taking measures to improve the country's
attractiveness as an investment destination, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- New contact lenses which allows
extended wear for up to 30 days and nights were launched Friday in
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
During a ceremony to launch the new product, CIBA Vision, the

The product is the result of a major technological breakthrough
by scientists from two leading Australian research centers and a
university in Sydney: CSIRO, Australian Cooperative Research
Center and the University of New South Wales.
</P>
<P>
The extended wear lenses is designed to address the valuable
rapid growing vision care market currently worth 4 billion U.S.
dollars, CSIRO said.

<HEADLINE> Neolithic Stone Carving Found In Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A Neolithic stone carving of a male
body with a blazing sun symbol above his head was found recently
at an archeology dig in the Three Gorges area where China is
building a huge water control project.
</P>
<P>
The stone figure, dates back about 7,000 years, was discovered
in Zigui County in central China's Hubei Province, where there is
a primitive site of a culture that lived during the Neolithic Age
(some 10,000-4,000 years ago).
</P>
<P>
The grey, 150-kg stone is 105 cm tall and 20 cm wide. It
clearly depicts a male body with two clusters of constellations at
the waist. The facial features and genitalia are distinct as are
the limbs.
</P>
<P>
This is the first primitive stone carving of a male body and a
sun to be found in China that Chen Zhenyu, a prominent
archeologist says he knows of. Chen, who is director of the Hubei
Archeology Bureau, which conducted the project, says that they
still do not know whether the suns are totems for sun worship or
symbols of masculine power.
</P>
<P>
A 10.88-meter long dragon also found at the site may be the
longest ever unearthed in China. It is made of 150 pebble stones
of various sizes, with its held-high head well paved with double
layers of pebbles, and body and tail winding. Archeologists say
that the design shows the early origins the deified image that the
Chinese so admire.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, approximately 600 pieces of earthenware, stoneware,
ceramics and porcelain, and iron and copper relics were unearthed
in an ancient city site nearby, which is believed to have been
established sometime between the Shang and Zhou dynasties (1600-
221 BC) and used for as long as the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian Deputy Prime Minister
and Trade Minister Tim Fischer Friday welcomed the outcome of
trade talks between China and United States as a positive step
forward in the negotiations for China's membership of the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"This is good news both for Australian exporters and the world
trading regime," the deputy prime minister told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He indicated there may be successful outcome of negotiations
between Australia and China on China's WTO membership during his
trip to China next month.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said he expects China now to move
progressively to resolve outstanding issues with other WTO
members, including Australia, so that China could enter the WTO
later this year.
</P>
<P>
"(The Australian federal) Cabinet this week authorized me to
push ahead with Australia's negotiations with China, and I remain
hopeful of a successful outcome when I visit China next month," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Progress in negotiations between China and the United States
is an important step towards China's admission to the WTO,
hopefully later this year, and it parallels the recent steps by
Australia to finalize its bilateral agreement with China," Fischer
said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of significant progress was made during a
joint press conference between U.S. President Bill Clinton and
visiting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji in Washington early Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
"While full details of the U.S.-China negotiations are yet to
be released, initial indications are that the outcome will provide
significantly improved and more predictable access to the large
Chinese market, with in-built growth for a very wide range of
products and services."
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the market access offers by China, which will be
open to all WTO members, are expected to address many of
Australia's priorities, however, there are a number of issues of
particular importance to Australia that would still need to
resolved, including satisfactory access for wool and sugar, access
implementation arrangements and balanced outcomes on tariffs and
services.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Make Burn Victim Discovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist at an army
hospital has discovered the existence of Macro-LDH, a molecular
compound, in blood samples of burn victims.
</P>
<P>
The finding was confirmed by the American Association of
Clinical Chemistry, according to Assoc. Professor Liu Zejun, the
scientist, of Military Medical University No.3's Southwestern
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The molecular compound has only been found in patients with
liver and heart ailments and this is the first time for Macro-LDH
to be found externally, Liu says.
</P>
<P>
Macro-LDH, which has polymerized enzymes, a compound and an
enzyme and other elements, appears in the blood of people with
health problems and disappears when the ailment disappears.
</P>
<P>
Macro-LDH in the blood can reflect the existence of an illness,
Liu says. He began doing research on the subject in 1996, when he
was at a Japanese medical university as a visiting scholar.
</P>
<P>
Liu's finding appeared in the November 1998 issue of the US's
Clinical Chemistry journal and his method of checking on Macro-LDH
appeared in the US's Clinical Laboratory Science journal.
</P>
<P>
Liu and his research group doing a further study on the causes
of Macro-LDH and its relation to other types of diseases. He says
he believes that the research is important for the study of
genetics because it could help in the study of genetic abberations
among Chinese people.

<HEADLINE> Asian Journalists Look to Restore Economic Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Media of Southeast Asian countries
should join forces to restore confidence in rebuilding the
regional economy, participants in the ongoing China-Asean Press
Seminar agreed this week.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed they need to sharpen their edge in the ever-
fiercer media competition in the region, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Thirty journalists from members states of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) joined their Chinese counterparts
at the seminar which runs from Monday to tomorrow in Beijing and
Shenzhen. The seminar was held by the All-China Journalists'
Association.
</P>
<P>
The delegates exchanged views on how mass media could help
promote Asian economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis has not only dealt an unprecedented blow
to the economy of Southeast Asian countries, but also prompted
local mass media to rethink their role and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, participants said, media should provide a
fair and comprehensive account of events and issues, which is a
home truth of journalism, but has not always been practiced.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the crisis broke out two years ago, people were
led to believe in Southeast Asia's bright prospects. But a sharp
turnabout by the world's dominant Western media plunged them into
hopelessness and despair.
</P>
<P>
Asean countries for long have not been satisfied with the way
Western media are covering the region. But local media's voices
are still weak.
</P>
<P>
The best way to break the Western media's monopoly,
participants in the seminar agreed, is to join hands and create a
collective voice by using modern technology.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Top Shuttler Likely to Miss Team Events </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's number one women's
singles shuttler Mia Audina could be kept off the team for the
Sudirman Cup and World Championships next month due to
undisciplined behavior, the Jakarta Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chief of athlete development for the Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) Mangombar Ferdinand Siregar said Mia would be
excluded if her "technical and nontechnical" performance was
judged unsuitable for the major competitions held over two
consecutive weeks.
</P>
<P>
"If she cannot maintain her condition during her leave, then
we'll definitely drop her from the team. We are still preparing
other shuttlers anyway," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will send a 30-member to both events in Copenhagen
from May 10 to May 24.
</P>
<P>
PBSI is grooming women's singles players Cindana, Lydia
Djaelawidjaja, Meiluawati and Ellen Angelina to take over if Mia
is absent.
</P>
<P>
"We still have no idea how many shuttlers will compete in both
events, but the International Badminton Federation sets a quota of
30 members in a team," Siregar said.
</P>
<P>
PBSI sent a warning letter to Mia, who skipped practice after
the All England championships last month.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said he did not know Mia's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
"Her father gave me phone and fax numbers. I have contacted
both but always failed to get through. So I don't know exactly
where she is," he said.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said PBSI had not decided on sanctions for the 19-year-
old shuttler and acknowledged the country still needed Mia.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out the possibility of dismissing Mia of the
National Badminton Center if her behavior remained unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
"We are still hoping that she will change but we can't just
dismiss her due to her prolonged absence. If the PBSI chairman
considers her attitude as unforgivable, maybe we'll dismiss her,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the PBSI official in charge of talent scouting Icuk
Sugiarto blamed the organization for indecisiveness in handling
Mia.
</P>
<P>
"I agree with PBSI sending a warning letter. But I think a
warning is not enough. PBSI must punish Mia for her behavior," he
added.

<HEADLINE> China to Form Orderly Local Market for Internet Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China's internet industry is
trying to regulate the market at an early stage.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, eight leading Chinese Internet Content Providers (
ICPs) clinched an agreement in Beijing to form the China ICP
United Development High-Profile Conference, China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In this way, some irrational business operations are not so
likely to harm the sector over the long run, the companies decided.
</P>
<P>
The eight ICPs are: Sohu, Sina, Chinabyte, Netease, China Wide
Web, Goyoyo, Shanghai Online and Information Highway Tech.
</P>
<P>
Although competing toughly in the market with 2.1 million
Internet users nationwide, the eight ICPs said they hope the
organization will help to pave the way for a healthy competitive
arena and set up business rules accepted by all.
</P>
<P>
The conference agreed that local companies need a regulated
domestic market which ensures Chinese companies are able to expand
quickly and have enough strength to compete with their foreign
counterparts that have shown a lot interest in entering the market.
</P>
<P>
The organization is committed to take united action to promote
Internet-related training and education, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> China Establishing Weather Disaster Early Warning System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the China
Meteorology Administration and Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)
have started a research program arranged by the Ministry of
Science and Technology that focuses on major weather disasters and
forecast methods.
</P>
<P>
China expects to introduce an early warning system to predict
torrential rains and other major disasters based on this research
to reduce the loss of lives and property.
</P>
<P>
Scientists want to find reasons for the repeated torrential
rains in certain parts of the country and droughts and floods that
hit major industrial areas, according to Science and Technology
Daily.
</P>
<P>
China is often hit by various weather disasters in areas with
specific geographical features and it plans to build one or two
research centers to establish models for forecasting major
disasters like El Nino.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe that the research program is important for
promoting disaster prevention and relief and guaranteeing economic
development.

<P>
On the way back to Russia after meeting with Milosevic in
Belgrade, Seleznev said at Budapest international airport Thursday
that Milosevic and Rugova could solve the crisis without the
participation of foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
He said that Yugoslavia would withdraw its troops from the
Macedonian borders after NATO stopped its air strikes and pull its
military forces out of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Russia was considering offering military aid and cooperation to
Yugoslavia, the Russian Duma chairman said. He also said NATO must
understand that Russia was making efforts to resolve the Kosovo
crisis by political means, but the political ways would be
necessary sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev alleged that in the air strikes, NATO had used cluster
bombs which were prohibited by an international convention. He
said he had taken the bomb pieces to his country for analysis.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev arrived in Belgrade Tuesday and held talks with
Milosevic on the resolution of the Yugoslav crisis Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> McAllister Forced to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Scotland soccer team captain Gary
McAllister has blown the whistle on a long and distinguished
international career after he was criticised by fans following his
country's 2-1 defeat to the Czech Republic last week.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC on Thursday, the Coventry City midfielder,
who was capped 57 times by his country, was booed by a large
contingent on the terraces after he lost the ball to Patrick
Berger and was later substituted.
</P>
<P>
His game against the Czech was his first international match
after a 16-month injury lay-off and Scotland fans were expecting
the usual dynamic performance from the man they dubbed their
midfield general.
</P>
<P>
McAllister refused to be interviewed after Scotland's defeat
but later said: "I am extremely disappointed because I know I am
still good enough to play at international level and contribute
something to the Scotland side.
</P>
<P>
"But there comes a point when that type of pressure from a
certain section who are looking for me not to do well, whether
that be the fans or the media, becomes too much.
</P>
<P>
"Last week's result was the crescendo of a night which had a
major bearing on my decision," he added.
</P>
<P>
McAllister admitted that his penalty miss against England at
Euro 96 may have provoked some ill-feelings from the Scottish fans.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The penalty miss at Wembley was probably the catalyst
to make the situation worse."
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old was forced to miss the World Cup in France
through injury -- a tournament which many thought would be the
pinnacle of a great career.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it is a sad end to an illustrious career both for
Scotland and for the clubs who were lucky enough to have
McAllister amongst their playing staff.
</P>
<P>
After hearing the news both the PFA and his Scotland team-mates
tried to persuade McAllister, who guided Leeds United to their
League Championship victory in 1992, against his decision to
retire but the Scot seems unlikely to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a difficult decision to make because it's every
player's dream to play for his country and I came into
international football relatively late in my career.
</P>
<P>
"To give up before my time is very disappointing indeed," he
said.

LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- England striker Michael Owen has
warned Liverpool they must start winning trophies again if he is
to remain at the club.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Anfield star repeated his warning to Liverpool
fans that he may not be at Anfield in future if the club do not
turn around their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
"I have always said that if Liverpool were successful and they
were winning on the pitch there would be no better place for me to
want to stay," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In an ideal world I would stay there all my career and be
winning the championship every year.
</P>
<P>
"But if they don't do anything in four or five years and they
are not looking like they are going to, it might be time to look
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not giving up and hopefully we can start winning things
soon," he added.
</P>
<P>
Owen missed Kevin Keegan's first game in charge against Poland
through injury but was back in action for England, helping to
launch the brand new England home strip in Birmingham.

LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain, which was eliminated by
the United States in the Davis Cup world group first round tie,
has been landed with another difficult draw at home to South
Africa in the Davis Cup World Group qualifying round.

The venue for the match, to be played on September 24-26, has

<HEADLINE> Liverpool Decide Against Intertoto Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool have decided not to enter
the much-maligned InterToto Cup in a bid to qualify for Europe
next season.
</P>
<P>
The Merseysiders were not among the seven teams confirmed as
interested in the summer tournament by the Football Association's
5pm deadline on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the FA will tell UEFA on Friday that Aston Villa and
West Ham's names have been added to those of Leicester,
Middlesbrough, Wimbledon, Southampton and Nottingham Forest who
all expressed an interest in January.
</P>
<P>
Southampton and Forest will not qualify because only teams in
the top 12 are considered.
</P>
<P>
And a spokesman for the Anfield club said: "Liverpool has
decided not to apply for the InterToto Cup. We do not feel it is
the correct preparation for the season."
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken after an astonishing day of brinkmanship,
in which the FA had received late applications from West Ham and
Villa to take part.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool seemed to have changed their minds about the Cup
during the day. Sources at the FA were expecting a fax confirming
Liverpool's entry in the morning, but when they contacted the club
in the afternoon, they were told there was now a doubt.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that a telephone vote among the club's directors
was taken, and eventually a decision was announced to turn their
back on the tournament.
</P>
<P>
For a club who have won four European Cups and two UEFA Cups,
the reality is that they are highly unlikely to qualify for Europe
for next season -- for only the third time since Liverpool first
took part in UEFA competitions in the 60s.
</P>
<P>
The tournament this summer will see three groups produce three
teams to go into the UEFA Cup. Ties will be played on July 18 and
24; semifinals on July 28 and August 4, with finals on August 10
and 24.

the second round of the world youth championship on Thursday.

Mali up for a 2-1 win over Portugal. Paulo Costa's 58th minute
reply meant they had some desperate defending to do late on.

An own goal by Richard Cooper in the 64th minute gave Cameroon
victory in the group E match in Kano and left England as the only
team not to have scored in the tournament.

WASHINGTON -- The Clinton administration said Thursday it
pledged NATO would press its bombing campaign with undiminished
fury even as hopes ran high for the release of three American
soldiers held by Yugoslavia.

State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said only an
unconditional release would be acceptable. "Any attempt to use
this as a bargaining chip is both illegal and immoral," he said.

In Iowa, Vice President Al Gore told reporters, "There are no
significant new developments in Kosovo. Milosovic knows what he

Program (UNDP) distributed some 36 million U.S. dollars to 24
Indonesian organizations to support their electoral activities,

PANAMA CITY, April 8 (Xinhua)-- Nobel Prize Winner Rigoberta
Menchu Tum strongly condemned NATO's bombings against Yugoslavian
targets.
</P>
<P>
"I energetically condemn these bombings, as well as any kind of
ethnic cleansing, and I make common cause with the victims of this
conflict," Menchu said Thursday at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Menchu also pointed out that because of NATO's action, the
world balance, which was based upon the United Nation's authority,
has been broken.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. Security Council must feel a great deal of shame
since it does not now have the ability to negotiate and solve
international conflicts," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Nobel Prize winner also indicated these attacks have not
always been precise and have on occasion struck civilian
objectives.
</P>
<P>
"I feel powerless, like all the spectators caught up in the
deployment between these big powers. I criticize them because I
believe it is the only way for our peoples to address the crime
against peaceful co-habitation," she said.
</P>
<P>
Menchu demanded Latin America countries show their disapproval
and nonconformity before the human tragedy which is devastating
the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
"Could we ever acknowledge the fact that we should remain
silent while a small country is crushed?" she questioned.

ROME, April 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
said Thursday at the NATO air base of Aviano that the NATO
offensive in Yugoslavia will continue until President Slobodan
Milosevic agrees to all the alliance's demands and insisted that "
NATO will win this battle".

Cohen, who ended the visit to NATO's headquarters in Brussels,

at the Aviano air base from where NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia have been conducted over the last two weeks.

<P>
He reviewed the long diplomatic efforts to defuse the Kosovo
crisis and said that with the failure of these initiatives, NATO
was determined to "crush his army so that it can never again do in
future what it has done in the past".
</P>
<P>
"The world cannot accept any false reconciliation gesture and
can not accept any promise of peace made on paper which Milosevic
can tear up when it's most convenient for him," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
He added that NATO must persevere until Milosevic withdraws the
army and police, allowing the safe return of all the refugees to
their homes and their resettlement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Semiconductor Industry Welcomes U.S.-China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Semiconductor Industry
Association (SIA) Thursday welcomed the announcement that the
United States trade representative and China have made significant
progress toward China's accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
"Our industry would very much like to see China join the WTO
when a commercially viable agreement is reached," said the San
Jose, California-based SIA, the leading voice of the U.S. chip
industry, in a statement. "Such an agreement should increase U.S.
exports and help expand China's market for American semiconductor
companies."
</P>
<P>
In the next decade, the SIA said, China is expected to become
one of the largest semiconductor markets in the world. The
association estimates China currently to be a semiconductor market
of 8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In part, the SIA said, the growth of the market in recent years
can be attributed to Chinese government reforms to open the
Chinese market to increased international trade and investment.
For instance, Chinese tariffs on semiconductors, which were 20
percent in 1995, have been reduced to 6-10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Continued liberalization of Chinese trade and investment rules
would further permit growth in the Chinese market for
semiconductors, to the mutual benefit of U.S. semiconductor
producers and the Chinese information technology industry, the SIA
said.
</P>
<P>
"We highly commend the Administration's efforts and progress
and strongly support China's WTO accession on commercially viable
terms," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Citing the PC market as an example, the SIA noted that many
experts believe the market potential in China for American
semiconductor companies could potentially double over the next few
years. In the U.S., there is one personal computer for every three
people, while in China, there is only one PC for every 400 people.
</P>
<P>
SIA member companies comprise more than 90 percent of
U.S.-based semiconductor production. Collectively the U.S. chip
industry employs a domestic workforce of 276,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Blair: No Land Force For Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Thursday defended NATO's refusal to send ground forces to war-torn
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the BBC soon after NATO agreed to send 8,000 troops
to Albania to help with the mounting refugee crisis, Blair said
the Allies had the right position over the ongoing conflict
against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the air campaign will be successful," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Real damage is being done.... I can say that today's attacks
on (Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's) military police and
his paramilitaries on the ground in Kosovo were actually very
successful," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
But he also acknowledged that it would not be easy to defeat
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"It won't be done overnight. There's no point in trying to
pretend it will be," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although Blair strongly refused to commit NATO forces to a
ground invasion of Kosovo, he did say troops would form part of an
"international" protection force to allow the ethnic Albanians to
return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
"NATO does not have proposals for a land force to invade
Kosovo. We do have proposals, however, to make sure we have the
requisite troops in the area to form a protection force to let
people back into Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, speaking at a public meeting, Blair said NATO had no
intention to send ground troops to Kosovo when it started the
airstrikes on Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
"We made it clear from the very beginning the dangers and
problems of putting a land invasion force into Kosovo and people
really have to realize what that means," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The reason we ruled out a land invasion force was for pretty
good reasons. We have got the right position on this there really
are no easy solutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the air campaign, now in its third week, would
continue for as long as was necessary.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pledges to Press Attacks Amid Hopes for POW Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration said
Thursday it pledged NATO would press its bombing campaign with
undiminished fury even as hopes ran high for the release of three
American soldiers held by Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said only an
unconditional release would be acceptable. "Any attempt to use
this as a bargaining chip is both illegal and immoral," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Iowa, Vice President Al Gore told reporters, "There are no
significant new developments in Kosovo. Milosovic knows what he
has to do to bring this to a conclusion." Asked if that meant the
bombing would continue, Gore said, "Yes, indeed."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, NATO officials reiterated that there would be
no pause.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen has given NATO's top commander,
Gen. Wesley Clark, a green light to augment the air armada that is
striking Yugoslavia, but no decisions have been made, officials at
the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said Clark probably would ask for a relatively
small number of extra fighter aircraft, probably Air Force A-10
"Warthogs," to hit Serb armor, more reconnaissance planes and
refueling aircraft. NATO already has upwards of 600 planes
involved, including some of the most sophisticated bombers and
fighters in the U.S. arsenal.
</P>
<P>
According to Western military officials, the latest wave of air
attacks focused on Serb police and army units scattered in rural
areas of Kosovo. Small Yugoslav units have been blamed for most of
the atrocities against ethnic Albanians and targeting them in the
hills and forests of the largely rural province has proven
difficult. The Serbs reportedly are hiding tanks and other armor
in damaged buildings and in civilian areas.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Survivors Charges Bishop with Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Roman Catholic Bishop of
southwest Gikongoro diocese , Augustin Misago, has been charged by
genocide survivors of having played an active role in the 1994
genocide of Tutsis, Rwandan News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Accusations were leveled at Kibeho, 100 kilometers southeast of
the capital, during the Wednesday reburial of the remains of over
20,000 Tutsis butchered in the local catholic church by government
soldiers, the police and Hutu militia.
</P>
<P>
The survivors charged that Bishop Misago, who was moving freely
while the butchery was going on, has remained silent and has never
come forward and testified about the massacres which rocked his
diocese, especially at Kibeho.
</P>
<P>
Five years have passed, the Bishop has never said a word about
the killings he saw with his own eyes, one survivor charged.
</P>
<P>
The Bishop is notably alleged of having taken dozens of schools
girls who had survived the carnage to a ''safe haven'', but five
years later he has never said anything about their death. They
charged him also of complicity in the massacre of one priest, and
22 nuns.
</P>
<P>
Bishop Misago has been cited in reburial ceremonies in various
parts of Gikongoro prefecture, notably at Kaduha and Murambi,
where respectively more than 20,000, and 40,000 were killed in
1994.
</P>
<P>
President Pasteur Bizimungu said that Misago was not above the
law and therefore, he should face the long arm of the law. But the
collaboration of the Catholic Church has lacked, he said.
</P>
<P>
If proven innocent, Bizimungu said, he should be redeployed
elsewhere, not in Rwanda. Many clergy people were involved in the
1994 genocide, either directly or indirectly in abetting the
crimes.
</P>
<P>
''The file case of Misago is complete," Rwandan minister of
justice, Jean de Dieu Mucyo told reporters. Misago, like any other
genocide suspects will be brought to book, he added.
</P>
<P>
This ceremony was held in commemoration of the 1994 genocide
which claimed the lives of more than half million people, mostly
ethnic Tutsis and opposition Hutus.

<HEADLINE> Antarctic Ice Shelves Break Up Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Two ice shelves on the Antarctic
peninsula are breaking up much faster than anyone predicted,
British and U.S. scientists have discovered.
</P>
<P>
The shelves, Larsen B on the eastern side of the peninsula and
Wilkins on the southwest, have together lost nearly 3,000 square
km in the last year.
</P>
<P>
The two shelves are in "full retreat", said researchers form
the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, UK, and the National
Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder,
U.S..
</P>
<P>
The scientists, who had predicted the break-up would happen
gradually, said they were surprised at the rapid speed.
</P>
<P>
David Vaughan, of British Antarctic Survey, said that over the
last 50 years the shelves had lost about 7,000 square km.
</P>
<P>
However, "to have retreats totalling 3,000 sq km in a single
year is clearly an escalation," Vaughan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Within a few years, much of the Wilkins ice shelf will likely
be gone," he added.
</P>
<P>
The scientists believed the retreats are caused by a regional
warming trend, which has caused the annual melt season to lengthen
by two to three weeks over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
According to a study by the British Antarctic Survey, the
average annual temperature in the region has increased by about
2.5 degrees C since the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The shelves are floating on the ocean surface, so they do not
cause sea levels to rise when they crumble, but scientists said
that the glaciers behind the shelves could melt more quickly if
they lost the shelves' protection.
</P>
<P>
And melt water from the glaciers would add to sea level rise,
the scientists warned.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Claim to Have Inflicted Heavy Losses to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Rebels fighting to remove Laurent
Desire Kabila, president of the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC), claimed Thursday they have inflicted heavy losses to
government forces and their allies in a fierce battle at Kakuyu,
about 1,500 kilometers southeast of capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
A rebel commander who asked not be named, told the Rwanda News
Agency that during the battle which raged Wednesday, the rebels
captured three tanks, eight armored personnel carriers, one troop
carrier, four anti- aircraft guns, and six land-cruisers.
</P>
<P>
''The fighting broke out when Kabila's fighters tried to break
a siege set up by the rebels about two weeks ago,'' the commander
said. Many were killed or captured as they ran in disarray, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Many bodies of Congolese, and Zimbabweans killed in the
engagement are still littering the battlefield which had turned
into killing fields, the commander explained. But his claims could
not be confirmed by independent sources.
</P>
<P>
Congolese rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said that
pressure by his troops is mounting on Kabila's allies on several
fronts. He said he was ready to attend talks proposed by Kabila
to be held in Rome under the auspices of San Egidio Community.
</P>
<P>
But he must be formally invited, he insisted.
</P>
<P>
Wamba said that in a meeting with Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi, Kabila was playing publicity to show that he wants to end the
war politically.
</P>
<P>
According to the rebel leader, Kabila and his supporters are at
loss, that the situation has got out of their hands in DRC,
Angola, and Congo- Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
''Kabila and his allies are in big difficulties, that's why
they have met in Luanda to sort out things,'' Wamba said.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese rebels are backed by Rwanda and Uganda, while
Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola, Chad, and Rwanda Hutu rebels are
fighting for Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The rebels who were flushed out of the suburbs of Kinshasa and
Lower Congo at the beginning of the war in August last year, now
claim to have controlled over 50 percent of the territory.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expects Higher Gasoline Prices This Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The national gasoline prices,
having risen sharply since February, are projected to average 1.13
U.S. dollars per gallon this summer, up about 9 to 10 cents from
last summer, the Department of Energy said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline demand is expected to be up by 2 percent over last
summer, aided by solid economic growth and by prices that are
still moderate by historical standards, the department said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. gasoline stocks are currently at the high end of the
normal range, particularly on the East Coast, signifying an
adequate supply situation overall, according to the Short-Term
Energy Outlook released Thursday by the Energy Information
Administration of the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
However, rising crude oil costs and refinery problems on the
West Coast have pushed wholesale and retail prices up in recent
weeks. Retail regular gasoline prices in California averaged 1.59
dollars per gallon as of April 5, 49 cents higher than year-ago
levels.
</P>
<P>
Because of the problems in California, summer prices are
expected to peak at 1.18 dollars in May, earlier than usual, the
department said.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices in the world market are expected to keep on an
upward track through 2000, thanks to significant net cuts in world
oil production this year, including substantial cuts announced by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
The world crude oil price, as measured by the average cost to
U.S. refiners of imported oil, is expected to be about 15-16
dollars per barrel by December 1999 and move close to 17 dollars
per barrel by the end of 2000, the department said.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Cut Fails to Lift London Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON April 8 (Xinhua) - London stock market finished the
session Thursday in negative territory, a victim of profit taking
following an interest rate cut by the Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's decision to cut interest rates by 0.25 percent to
5.25 percent failed to lift the UK's blue chip index which closed
down 35.3 points at 6437.9.
</P>
<P>
Analysts and traders alike say the Bank's interest rate cut was
already priced into the market, as most market players were
expecting the move.
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't anywhere for the market to go after the cut but
down," a London analyst said. "It's fair to say that what we're
seeing now is profit taking," said a trader.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly acknowledged here that the London market had run
too far ahead of itself prior to the easing of rates.
</P>
<P>
"We've seen a big run and now it's time for a pause until we
see something concrete to push the market further," another
analyst said, adding the 25 basis point rate cut wasn't big enough
to satisfy bullish appetites.
</P>
<P>
Germany's electronically traded Xetra Dax closed up 0.81
percent, or 40.51 points, at 5067.76.

In Paris, the CAC 40 hit a new 1999 closing high on the day,

a late-day kick from a Dow upturn led by financial stocks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says No Deal to Gain Release of the Three Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. officials said that NATO
arranged for safe passage Thursday of a flight by a former
president of Cyprus that is intended to secure the release of
three U.S. soldiers held captive in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
But Serbia's vice premier said the three should be tried as
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The official, Vojislav Seselj, told reporters Thursday that
freeing the three was "out of the question."
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters traveling with
Secretary of Defense William Cohen Thursday in Germany that NATO
had arranged to ensure that no allied bombing missions would
interfere with the plane carrying the Cypriot leader, Spyros
Kyprianou.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials insisted there would be no deal that included
easing NATO's bombing campaign, which is intended to force
President Slobodan Milosevic to reverse course in rebellious
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Kyprianou said in Belgrade he planned to
meet Milosevic on Friday and that the Americans might be freed
during the long Orthodox Easter weekend, which began Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In Iowa, Vice President Al Gore told reporters,"There are no
significant new developments in Kosovo. Milosevic knows what he

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A two-day conference aimed at
 promoting trade and economic links between the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) and the United States will be held in
Botswana next week.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 U.S. government officials and business
representatives are expected to be in Gaborone, the capital, to
meet top officials from the region, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first U.S.-SADC forum, which is established
following a proposal by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
that the U.S. government engage in regular dialog with the
14-member trade bloc.
</P>
<P>
"The forum's objective will be to build deeper cooperation and
engagement between SADC member states and the United States," the
U.S. Information Service said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The forum will promote regional integration efforts already
under way and help reconcile U.S. policy toward the region with
the needs of the emerging southern African community of nations."
</P>
<P>
The talks are expected to focus on trade and investment,
particularly the U.S.-Africa Growth and Opportunity Bill which is
awaiting approval by the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
The bill is a product of U.S President Bill Clinton's tour of
Africa last year and proposes giving access to U.S. markets to
African countries perceived to be making progress toward free
market economies and transparency in government.
</P>
<P>
Elements of the U.S.-Africa Growth and Opportunity Bill have
been severely criticized by African nations who object to
prescriptions on how their countries should be run in order to
benefit from trade with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The two-day forum, which takes place on April 14 and 15, will
also discuss HIV/AIDS, small arms trafficking, drug control,
demining, disaster preparedness and environmental issues,
according to SAPA.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Ban Lead Shot from Wildfowling Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Lead shot from wildfowlers' guns is to
be banned in Britain to protect waterfowl from lead poisoning, the
British government announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Draft legislative proposals banning the use of lead shot in
certain circumstances have been sent to interested parties inviting
comments, said Michael Meacher, the British Environment Minister.
</P>
<P>
"It is my intention that the legislation should come into force in
England and Wales by the start of the shooting season on 1 September
1999," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Meacher said the ban did not constitute a restriction on shooting
as a sport, to which the British government remained unopposed.
</P>
<P>
"The aim is to prevent the gratuitously painful and unnecessary
deaths of birds," he said.
</P>
<P>
A typical 12-bore shotgun cartridge contains about 250 pellets of
lead, weighing about 35 grams. It is thought that about 2,000 tons of
shot are used by wildfowlers in Europe each season, much of which
falls directly into wetland habitats.
</P>
<P>
Waterfowl such as geese are at particular risk from lead poisoning
as they ingest shot when taking in grit to aid digestion and, in
wetlands which are shot over, lead poisoning of waterfowl has almost
invariably been found to occur.

NICOSIA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Parliament President
Spyros Kyprianou has said he will remain in Belgrade until he
exhausts all efforts for the release of three American soldiers,
captured by Serbian forces near the Macedonian-Yugoslav border
late last month.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with the Cyprus News Agency from

He described the climate during his meetings with Yugoslav
officials upon on arrival in Belgrade earlier Thursday as "very

</P>
<P>
Kyprianou said "whether NATO's bombing stops or not, I will
stay on until I exhaust this effort of mine".
</P>
<P>
The president, who has been provided with security during his
stay by the Yugoslav government, described his meeting with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic "very important."
</P>
<P>
However, he said he has not yet been informed of the exact time
the meeting will take place.

Meanwhile, reports here said that an American C-9 military
transport aircraft is on stand-by in Greece to come to Cyprus and
transport the three soldiers out of the country.

<HEADLINE> European Central Bank Lowers Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonn, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank lowered its
major lending rate from 3.0 to 2.5 percent. The decision was
announced Thursday in Frankfurt following a ECB council meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ECB also sank its two other key rates, the rate on marginal
lending facility from 4.5 percent to 3.5 percent, and the rate on
deposit facility from 2.0 percent to 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The reduction, far bigger than 25 basis points that most analysts
had expected earlier Thursday, was aimed at boosting the weak economy
of the 11 Eurolands, ECB President Wim Duisenberg said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after the meeting, Duisenberg said
the rate cut would not result in the danger of inflation, quoting that
the currency volume in the Euro-zone expanded only by 5.1 percent in
February, slowing down from the 5.6 percent monetary expansion rate in
January.
</P>
<P>
It was the first rate-cutting action by the ECB since it took over
the monetary management for the 11 nations that have merged their
economy to form the common currency of Europe, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates have been trumbling also outside the Euro-zone with
the Bank of England cutting the short-term rate by 25 basis points to
the lowest level in five years, and Switzerland following by reducing
its rates by 50 basis points.
</P>
<P>
The ECB's decision of monetary easing came after a week of market
expectation that the economic stagnation in Germany, France, and Italy
would force the central bank to cut rate.
</P>
<P>
The three counties together make up 75 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP) of the Eurolands.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission in last month reduced its forecast for
economic growth in the Euro-zone this year by almost a half percentage
point to 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The leading economy in the Euro-zone, Germany, is expected to be
among the slowest in economic growth in the Europe this year with its
unemployment remaining at over 4 million and domestic orders falling.
</P>
<P>
Recent talks over a European rate cut have added to the pressure on
the Euro, which has devalued about 8 percent against the U.S. dollar
since its launch in this January.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of Angola, Zimbabwe,
Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) held a meeting
here Thursday, expressing their support for the Angolan government
in wiping out the armed forces of the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
In their four-hour summit, the four presidents discussed the
current situations in the two war-torn countries of Angola and
the DRC.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued after the summit, the presidents
expressed their worries over the escalating violence launched by
the UNITA rebel movement, while declaring their firm support for
"the unremitting efforts by the Angolan government in wiping out
the armed forces of (Jonas) Savimbi".
</P>
<P>
They also voiced their appreciation over the government's
continuous implementation of the policy of national reconciliation
and social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sam Nujoma of Namibia, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe,
and Laurent Kabila of the DRC also reiterated the resolution by
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) last September,
denouncing UNITA Chairman Jonas Savimbi as a war criminal, and
appealed to the SADC members for political, diplomatic and
material support.
</P>
<P>
The summit also urges the international community, especially
African countries, to strictly abide by the resolutions of the
U.N. Security Council and enhance arms embargo, as well as
financial and trade sanctions on UNITA.
</P>
<P>
On the DRC issue, the four heads of state expressed their
worries over " Rwanda and Uganda's aggression of its sovereignty"
and expressed "the firmest support for the legitimate government"
of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
What's worth noting is that the meeting appreciated Kabila's
initiative to have nationwide discussions on the peace issue.
</P>
<P>
The presidents were also concerned about the increasing
conflicts in other part on the African continent, which they said
have affected peace, stability, security and the social and
economic development of the continent.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after the summit, Kabila and
Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos stressed the principles on
common development strategy between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The three visiting heads of state left for their home country
after their one-day summit later Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Takes Over Commercial Bank from Asian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Uganda (BOU) has taken
possession of Uganda Commercial Bank Limited (UCBL) because its
Asian management violated the Financial Institutions Statute 1993.
</P>
<P>
This takeover with immediate effect is instituted under the
provisions of sections 31 and 32 of the statute, a press statement
signed by Emmanuel Lule, deputy governor of the Bank of Uganda,
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lule said this action is necessary in order to strengthen the
central bank's control over the management of UCBL.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that it is also meant to protect the
interests of depositors and to remove Westmont Land Asia, a
Malaysian company, from the management of the bank.
</P>
<P>
Lule said that this arrangement will not affect the normal
operations of the biggest commercial bank in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the bank management extended credit to
certain borrowers well in excess of the limits permitted under the
law.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the services of the current Board of Directors of
UCBL and the seconded management staff of the Malaysian company
have been terminated with effect from April 8 of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the authorities of the Bank of Uganda have
appointed Jayant Virani as the acting managing director of UCBL.
A new board of directors has also been appointed.
</P>
<P>
The UCBL will remain under the management of the central bank
until the shareholders make alternative and acceptable
arrangements for its management.
</P>
<P>
The Westmont Land Asia bought the 49 shares in UCBL in October
of 1997 when UCBL was put on the privatization list. Under the
contract with the Ugandan government, the Asian company cannot
sell the shares in three years, nor transfer the management
without approval from the Ugandan side.
</P>
<P>
Previous reports said the company sold the shares to Salim
Saleh, President Yoweri Museveni's younger brother and former
presidential advisor on security and defense. Salim Saleh resigned
from his post after his clandestine purchase of UCBL was exposed
in newspapers late last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan parliament Thursday
rejected the list of newly appointed ministers submitted by
President Yoweri Museveni.
</P>
<P>
The appointment committee of the parliament said there are more
 ministerial vacancies than appointed ministers and that the
proposed list does not cater for all the region, Radio Uganda
reported in its evening news.
</P>
<P>
Member of parliament Stephen Chebrot said the western region
has the largest number of ministers followed by the central
region, While the northern region has the least posts whereas
there is no minister from the east.
</P>
<P>
This regional imbalance in the ministerial post distribution
caused heated debate in the committee, he added.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise cabinet reshuffle Monday, Museveni removed
several ministers from the new cabinet list. He appointed 12 new
ministers who are subject to approval by the parliament while
leaving 14 posts vacant.
</P>
<P>
This major cabinet reshuffle is widely regarded as a result of
mounting pressure from the parliament for the government to axe
the corrupt or incompetent officials.
</P>
<P>
The parliament has censured two ministers for misconduct and
abuse of office. Vice President Specioza Kazibwe, who is also the
Minister of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, was likely
to face censure if Museveni did not remove her from the
agricultural portfolio this time.
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe has been accused of failing to supervise the valley dam
project which caused the government to lose 3.4 billion shillings
(3.4 million U.S. dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- World Habitat Day this year
will be celebrated on October 4, 1999 and the theme this year is
"Cities for All," a U.N. release said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Center for Human Settlements (Habitats) is
the lead United Nations agency for World Habitat Day. The center
has dedicated this year's celebrations to "all urban residents who
are excluded from enjoying the benefits fo urban life, either
because their physical, social or economic condition does not
allow them to participate in urban activities, or because they are
not legally or politically recognized as citizens of the cities in
which they live."
</P>
<P>
According to United Nations estimates, over half the urban
population in most developing countries live in informal
settlements which are neither recognized or serviced by city
authorities.
</P>
<P>
"The urban poor are the most excluded group in cities," says
Klaus Toepfer, the acting executive director of Habitat. "They
live in constant fear of eviction and most do not have access to
formal finance and loan schemes which could enable them to improve
their living conditions."
</P>
<P>
The city of Dalian in Northeast China will host the global
celebrations of World Habitat Day 1999.

</P>
<P>
The 26-member delegation, led by Han Duck-soo, ROK Minister of

procedures through a one-stop center, in addition to reducing
immigration procedures and the tax burden.
</P>

determination to further its relations with South Korea, saying
that the bilateral relationship will become stronger if the
private sector is involved.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are only two South Korean companies operating in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Duck-soo expressed his country's respect to
efforts made by the Tanzanian government in bringing about the
economic reforms in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said South Korea and Tanzania have many areas for
cooperation and efforts should be made to bring the two countries
closer.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the South Korean delegation is scheduled to meet
with Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, Prime Minister Frederick
Sumaye, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International
Co-operation, Jakaya Kikwete, and address a press conference

BONN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping said Thursday that NATO should start releasing more air
surveillance photos showing what is going on in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Bonn new briefing, Scharping said, "I know that
many more pictures are available than those shown yesterday and

Aerial surveillance pictures depicting the current situation in

<P>
Scharping claimed that Germany had obtained through
"clandestine sources" Yugoslavia's action plans which Scharping
said were to expel or kill ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The information proved that Milosevic had long been preparing
the expulsion, Scharping said.

Scharping also announced that four intelligence officers of the
German forces would start interviewing refugees in Macedonia to

<HEADLINE> AIDS Infection Rate Plunges in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- AIDS Infection rate in Uganda has
plunged to 7 percent, down from the level of 12.8 percent two
years ago, an official has said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Joshua Musinguzi, acting program director of sexually
transmitted disease and AIDS control program in the Ministry of
Health, made the remarks when addressing the first National
Conference on Counseling.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this dive of the epidemic to increasing AIDS
consciousness among masses and intensifying efforts against
HIV/AIDS by both the government and non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
Sensitization workshops on AIDS, more effective preventive
measures and behavior change also contributed to this plummet.
</P>
<P>
In a speech read for him by the Director General Health Service
in the Ministry Francis Omaswa, the Minister of Health Crispus
Kiyonga said counseling HIV/AIDS patients scales down the rate of
early death and adds value to patients' lives.
</P>
<P>
The national conference has attracted officials from the
Ministry of Health and non-governmental organizations to share
challenges on how to intensify the struggle against this deadly
disease.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's first case of AIDS was reported in 1982 and more than
500,000 Ugandans have died of this pandemic ever since. The
infection rate was as high as over 30 percent when the National
Resistance Movement came to power in 1986.
</P>
<P>
At present there are 47 million people suffering from this
pandemic in the world, while 95 percent of which are in the
developing countries. In the 5.8 million new infections in 1998 in
the whole world, Africa accounts for 70 percent of the total.

LUANDA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos Thursday called on central African countries to unite and
face the challenges of rebel forces which have joined their hands
in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said at a press conference held after a summit meeting of
Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) that most central African countries now face the same
situation, referring to the fact that the legitimate governments
democratically elected are confronting domestic rebellion and
foreign intrusion.
</P>
<P>
According to dos Santos, the rebel forces in these countries
are coordinating their action, behind which there are "a great
conspiracy" from outside the continent to systematically sabotage
the stability in central and southern Africa so as to control the
rich mineral resources in the region.
</P>
<P>
To change the present situation, he said all the governments
in the region must unite with one another.
</P>
<P>
On the Angolan crisis, the president said Malanje Province in
the north, Bie and Huambo provinces in central Angola, are the
three tension areas.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the government army has survived the
difficult time of defense and successfully accomplished the target
set by the supreme command.
</P>
<P>
As the general commander of the Angolan armed forces, dos
Santos said: " I think in a short period of time, the situation
there will also have some changes."
</P>
<P>
DRC President Laurent Kabila echoed dos Santos' words, saying
he believed that "peace and trust will be rebuilt" among the
Congolese people, with the mutual support from democratic
governments.
</P>
<P>
He particularly underpinned the results of his just concluded
visit to Kenya, saying the significance of his joint statement
with President Daniel arap Moi is "known to all", because Kenya is
"the neighbor of aggressors (Uganda and Rwanda) of his country."
</P>
<P>
The joint statement signed between Kenya and DRC, Kenya vowed
to respect the Kabila government and demand the withdrawal of
troops of uninvited countries from the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who is regarded as the
coordinator of the four-country ally, said the meeting of four
heads of state is very important at this time when the situations
in Angola and the DRC are tense, and that such contact should
continue in the future.
