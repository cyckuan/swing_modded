 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Memories of Moscow
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russian retrospective ...
</P>
<P>
   I've made seven trips to Moscow since 1990. This last visit,
indeed, may be my last.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying I liked Moscow better under communism. But
neither do I like what it's become since the fall of communism.
</P>
<P>
   Notes from along the way:
</P>
<P>
   _ At Moscow's airport, the first greeting that visitors receive
is that of capitalism. There are now ads, in English, above the
booths where passports are checked.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prostitutes, whose prices range as high as $250, are
commonplace on Moscow streets. In the days of the Communist state,
unmarried couples weren't even allowed to check into a hotel room.
Women wrestlers, in the guise of hall attendants, made sure no one
sneaked in.
</P>
<P>
   _ So congested were the recent hordes of hookers that members of
Parliament were having to fight their way through the crowds to get
to their hotels. A special law had to be passed restricting
prostitutes to certain areas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nudity on TV, which flourished with the fall of communism, has
also been restricted and is now seen only on paid channels.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moscow has become one of the most expensive cities in the
world. Eight years ago a lavish apartment in downtown Moscow could
be had for about $50,000. The price now is closer to $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moscow's new extravagant shopping center, near Red Square, is
named Manehz in honor of the czar's palace-style stables where
aristocrats exercised their horses.
</P>
<P>
   _ When Manehz opened, crowds wandered about the mall in awe of
its opulence (including a three-story fountain flanked by glass
elevators), not unlike the Bolsheviks after they had stormed the
czar's residence.
</P>
<P>
   _ I love the Russian sayings. One that I heard for the first
time on this trip was, ``When I spoke, she looked into my mouth.''
What it means, I'm told, is that she sought my wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   _ Something I noticed about the mouths of Russians, they're
beginning to wear braces on their teeth. Nor do you see so many
people with stainless steel teeth, commonplace during Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maybe that has something to with the fact that I met a
saleslady who actually smiled, a rarity in Moscow. Most stores
operate as if they were still under communism when everyone was
treated the same _ with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beware of famous brands of liquor sold here. They're often
counterfeit. No telling what you end up drinking.
</P>
<P>
   _ A waiter, presented with my American Express card, couldn't
believe the card notation that I'd been a member since 1970. ``I
had no idea American Express had been around for so long,'' he
said, amazed.
</P>
<P>
   _ When I first visited Moscow, it was routine for a driver to
remove the vehicle's windshield wipers when leaving it parked.
Otherwise, they would likely be stolen. I noticed this trip that's
no longer the practice, which I mentioned to a Russian friend.
``Right,'' he said. ``Now they just steal still the whole car.''

COYOTES NEAR DEAL WITH EX STARS WING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Coyotes' search for a scoring left wing took on a
``local'' look Monday when former Northern Arizona star Greg Adams
confirmed that he and the team are close to reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A high-level source with the team also confirmed that the team
has a definite interest in Adams, who earned $1.5 million last
season and played on the Dallas Stars' top line alongside Mike
Modano and Jere Lehtinen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very close, but I'll let them tell you about it,''
Adams said late Monday night from his home in the Vancouver,
British Columbia, area. ``I haven't really talked to them
personally. My agent, Ron Perrick, has been handling everything for
me, and they're trying to work out some details.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would really enjoy coming back to Arizona. There are only a
couple of places I would play, and Arizona is certainly one. I
enjoy it there.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to confirm the team's interest, Coyotes General
Manager Bobby Smith said, ``He can definitely score, and he's one
of the better free agents who are available.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams could provide insurance against a prolonged contract
holdout by Keith Tkachuk, the team's first-line left wing, or
provide a scoring presence on the team's No. 2 line alongside Cliff
Ronning and Rich Tocchet.
</P>
<P>
   Adams scored 108 points and 58 goals in two seasons for NAU's
now-defunct hockey program in 1982-83 and '83-84, scoring 44 goals
and 77 points in his last season. In 15 NHL seasons with New
Jersey, Vancouver and Dallas, he has scored 30 or more goals four
times and has had five 20-goal seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a knee injury against Edmonton on Dec. 19 that
limited his season to 49 games, but he still scored 32 points with
14 goals.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of an offer from the Stars, Adams was thought by
the Dallas media to be considering retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided two years ago that I was going to take it one season
at a time,'' Adams said. ``So I took a month away from hockey to
sort things out and allow things to settle down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll approach every season the same way from here on. If I
sign, chancesare it will be a one-year contract, but I haven't
received a contract yet.'' &QL;

PRESIDENT CLINTON FINALLY ADMITS IT _ SO WHAT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   Don't
you just love it? All those moralists thumping their chests and
wagging their accusatory fingers at President Clinton. They have
eagerly read and memorized the varied accounts of Clinton's affair
and throughout it all clucked their tongues disapprovingly _ while
lapping up a daily diet of alleged sexual details.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They can be titillated and self-righteous at the same time _
such is the hypocrisy of America's Puritan heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the media has danced like a gaggle of gleeful puppets
in this long charade _ playing to the sexual schizophrenia of the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   Sex _ as a nation we don't know what to do about it. Some want
all references to sex eliminated from books and the Internet,
others will buy something they don't need if it's sold in a sexy
manner, as any advertising director can verify.
</P>
<P>
   Self-righteous moralists can't get enough of the nitty-gritty on
the president's sex life _ so they can feel and act superior. They
would deny, however, any tingling sensations that might arise from
their prurient interests.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday night, a hounded and subpoenaed Clinton finally
publicly admitted that he had sex _ ``an inappropriate
relationship,'' as he called it _ with Monica Lewinsky. Even so, he
didn't quite confess to what he had denied previously.
</P>
<P>
   Some pundits act shocked; others call for him to step down _ as
if Clinton were the only president who had affairs while in office.
These commentators seriously need a reality check. They act as if
they are totally naive about the relationship between power and
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Power is an aphrodisiac _ to those who have it and to those in
proximity. From the kings and queens of England to the generals in
the early republic, power has been granted sexual favors.
</P>
<P>
   Others comment that Clinton's presidency will be diminished in
the view of history. Have any presidencies been diminished
historically because of rambunctious sexual cavorting? Not one _
from Washington to Jefferson to Kennedy and Johnson. Presidencies
are historically judged on leadership and the state of the nation
when they ended their tenures.
</P>
<P>
   When the years erase the topical and irrelevant, only the
accomplishments remain.
</P>
<P>
   Were any of the two dozen known philandering presidents forced
to admit that they had affairs while in office? No.
</P>
<P>
   The office of the president was respected, even if a particular
president wasn't. Such investigations would have been squelched.
Now, the office has been so degraded that Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
can call the president a jerk on national TV.
</P>
<P>
   Is a president's sexual behavior the public's business?
Generally, no.
</P>
<P>
   No more than it's the president's business to look into our
sexual partners. The only time such revelations would be important
is if there was a significant showing that the president's ability
to lead the country was severely compromised by the relationship.
There's been no such showing.
</P>
<P>
   What has hampered the president is Special Prosecutor Kenneth
Starr's politically-motivated investigation and chipping away at
the office of the president. Through his actions, Starr may have
seriously diminished future presidential prerogatives.
</P>
<P>
   Starr took years and what some estimate will be a $50 million
tab to uncover this illicit relationship between two consensual
adults. Was it worth it? Only to those Republicans who have been
harboring retribution in their dark hearts _ anxious to pay back
Democrats for bringing President Nixon down.
</P>
<P>
   After the air strikes against terrorists in Afghanistan and
Sudan, ordered by the president, Republican Sens. Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania and Dan Coats of Indiana cast doubt on Clinton's real
motivation. They intimated that the attacks were to deflect the
public's attention from the Lewinsky affair. Paybacks for Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   If we were to split Starr's $50 million into 50 portions --- $1
million to investigate each state house in our nation, there would
be many uncomfortable governors looking for places to hide.
</P>
<P>
   How many people could withstand such scrutiny into their private
lives?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sex isn't your Achilles' heel _ perhaps greed is, or
cruelty, or alcohol, or temper, or lack of courage. A hound dog
prosecutor like Starr could make you look like a fool. He's turned
his office into that of an old-time divorce detective _ hiding in
order to snap incriminating photos and gather semen-stained
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone be shocked that the president denied a sexual
liaison with Lewinsky? Most men and women when asked about an
illicit sexual relationship deny it. They deny it to cover their
tracks, to protect the other person in the affair, to protect their
wives or husbands. They deny it in order to provide time to think,
to provide cover. Sometimes they deny it so that the relationship
can continue. It's human nature.
</P>
<P>
   It's reality.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine also that the answer given is going to be broadcast to
the entire nation. Wouldn't most people deny?
</P>
<P>
   The real question: Why was it anyone's business?
</P>
<P>
   The Starr investigation was outrageously rampant _ from an
Arkansas land deal to sex in the Oval Office _ but politically
impossible for a Democratic president with a GOP-controlled
Congress to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Starr conducted a fishing expedition that eventually found
evidence of the president's weakness. He has such latitude, money
and resources, and political motive that anyone he targets can be
brought down.
</P>
<P>
   Special prosecutors can be useful to the publ they bring
to light fraud and illegal activities of those in high office. But
Starr has crossed into a tawdry, tabloid-style investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to the people to put an end to this travesty. The
special prosecutor law must be revised and strict restrictions put
on the office. The sooner, the better.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Y2K: Bad bug, cool name
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why 2K?
</P>
<P>
   Does it really take so long to say ``year 2000''? Abbreviations
got us into this mess in the first place and now we expect to fight
back with more of them.
</P>
<P>
   For those still in denial, the Y2K problem -- or Millennium Bug,
except that it happens a year before the new millennium, but let's
not get into that -- is a chain reaction of terrible computer
problems that will kick in when years begin with twos instead of
ones.
</P>
<P>
   And what will happen after 00:01 in the year 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Planes will show up late at airports and be misscheduled by
people who don't care. ATMs will refuse to work and charge
outrageous fees when they do. VCRs will forlornly flash
12-12-12-12. Chewed gum will drop from under desks and chairs and
onto our shoes. Candy bars will get caught hopelessly in vending
machines. Soda machines will contemptuously spit back dollar bills.
Pens will leak permanent ink. Teenagers will wise-off and wear ugly
shoes. Cats will chase around the room for no apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the end of the world as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   For those too sophisticated to believe the world will come to an
end just because warrantees tend to expire when odometers
accumulate zeros, Y2K offers an alternative catastrophe theory.
</P>
<P>
   Unseen mysterious forces will not plunge the world into chaos.
Short-sighted programming will.
</P>
<P>
   That's much better.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has its roots in the way our machines remember
numbers. They often store only two digits. This means that what
they do after 99 is no sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologists tell of primitive tribes and ancient cultures
whose words for numbers go: one, two, three, many. We laugh at
their simplicity. We have developed to where we can design machines
that count: 1997, 1998, 1999, many.
</P>
<P>
   The two-digit shortcut for four-digit years means when the year
2000 rolls around, some computers will think it's the year 1900.
They will refuse to believe they exist or only accept commands from
operators wearing celluloid collars.
</P>
<P>
   Other machines will think it's the Year 1K and promptly expire
from plague.
</P>
<P>
   For those who take comfort in the belief that our machines are
no smarter than we, this is deeply reassuring. And we make a mental
note to pay for the next year's New Year's dinner in cash before
going home on foot.
</P>
<P>
   But not to worry, pros are working on the problem. Sure, they
are the same kind of pros who created the problem in the first
place, but let's not get all panicky. There are reasons for
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   The first sure sign that a solution is on the way is when the
pros develop a snappy name for a problem. So now we have a Y2K
problem. Y is for the year, 2K is for 2,000. This is A Great
Advance.
</P>
<P>
   This is in keeping with the way we attack many of the world's
great challenges. First we worry awhile and identify the problem.
Then, we make insane alarmist predictions about the disruptions and
terrors the problem will cause. Then we give the problem a cool
name. We repeat the cool name until everyone is thoroughly sick of
hearing about it and wants to move onto something else. And then
people stop worrying.
</P>
<P>
   This is how we solved global warming.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe we didn't ``solve'' global warming in the strict sense
of the term, but we sure do worry about it less.
</P>
<P>
   One side effect of the cycle this time is the way people throw
Ks around. K used to be baseball shorthand for a strike. Now it
means 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even nonmetric folks, who would never walk a kilometer if they
could help it, are busily attaching kilos to everything. Folks have
become so cozy with kilos that they have affectionately nicknamed
them Ks. And they use them everywhere. I've heard it 1K times.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that after having so much fun with Y2K, construction
won't go away. The next year will be Y2K1. Then we'll toast Y2K2.
Welcome, class of Y2K3!
</P>
<P>
   Assuming, if course, that it's still an industrialized world
then and everything with a microchip didn't melt when Y1K99 ends.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the end of the world as I know it has been happening on a
near-daily basis for years now. It's hard to get worked up about it
anymore. I'll just make sure the typewriter stays in the closet and
doesn't get thrown out right away.

 &HT;    Most of the new network shows boring, witless
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there was an award for funniest network TV slogans, ABC would
win in a landslide. I love such lines as ``TV, so good they named a
frozen meal after it.'' Or ``Before TV, two World Wars. After TV,
zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's one line you won't see on ABC _ but should.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV is bad. Get cable. Now!''
</P>
<P>
   It's nothing to laugh about. With the debut of Fox's That '70s
Show and Holding The Baby, the network TV season officially kicked
off. Over the next two months, you'll be bombarded with 34 new
shows.
</P>
<P>
   And the buzz on most of those shows can be summed up quite
succinctly: bad.
</P>
<P>
   What we're about to witness, I'm afraid, is one of the worst TV
seasons in recent memory. That's not a great revelation. TV's been
bad before (remember NBC's Supertrain?) Of the 36 shows that
debuted last fall, only three (Ally McBeal, Dharma &AMP; Greg and
Working) will return this year.
</P>
<P>
   There were several shows that deserved to come back, though, but
didn't. Nothing Sacred was nothing short of brilliant. After
stumbling badly, Brooklyn South and Michael Hayes finally found
their way. The Gregory Hines Show was the season's smartest comedy,
and 413 Hope St. was raw and intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming season looks so woefully mediocre, raw and
intelligent are two adjectives I'll be hard-pressed to use. Madison
Avenue is grumbling. Fellow TV critics are shaking their heads and
even some network producers are privately wondering what's going
on. You know a season's in trouble when Lifetime has three of the
season's best shows.
</P>
<P>
   Although the problem is a complex one, it essentially boils down
to lousy writing. With seven networks (including the upcoming Pax
TV), a host of cable networks and syndicators, the writing talent
pool is maxed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks are not getting the best writers, and it's
showing up on the screen every night from 8-to-11 p.m.,'' says John
Rash, a senior vice president of broadcast relations at
Campbell-Mithun-Esty, a Minneapolis, Minn., marketing
communications company. ``The networks have been doing business the
same way for decades, yet the need for product is much higher than
it's ever been. All the studios are competing for the same writers,
the same stars and the same concepts. That caught up to all of the
networks this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Penny-pinching networks are also caught up in too much deal
making. Instead of putting the best shows on the air, networks are
often contractually beholden to studios and stars. And all the
networks are looking to cut costs by owning their own shows.
Unfortunately, those programs, many of which don't deserve shots on
local access channels, get on the air first.
</P>
<P>
   Says Tom Werner, producer of such hits as The Cosby Show,
Roseanne and 3rd Rock from the Sun: ``The agendas that the networks
have right now are very mixed. It's not just about the best program
in the best time period.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy Brown creator Diane English is more blunt: ``If you don't
like what you see on TV, sometimes you're seeing a deal on the
screen rather than someone's passion or vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun-shy networks are also afraid of taking risks. For every Ally
McBeal, there's a Union Square. I mean, how many more shows
featuring working women at a magazine or three twentysomething
people living in a huge apartment can we take?
</P>
<P>
   The networks know the stakes are high and that viewers are
tuning out. Audience erosion is at an all-time high. Last year, an
astounding 1.4 million households stopped watching network TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still believe the network television business is a very
good business, but changes must be made to ensure the networks
provide more diverse assortment of programming,'' says Leslie
Moonves, CBS' president and CEO. ``The relentless pursuit of
demographics is turning the network business into narrow-casting.''
</P>
<P>
   And boring-casting.
</P>
<P>
   What do we have to look forward to this fall? Two shows about a
black family moving into an all-white neighborhood. Bo Derek as a
shapely cattle rancher in Hawaii. A smart-mouthed, Boston bartender
who would make Howard Stern blush. A weak Larry Sanders rip-off
that takes place at an ESPN-like sports show. And the most
ridiculous of all? A butler who becomes President Lincoln's
confidant. It's a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not making this stuff up.
</P>
<P>
   NBC didn't say it, but its schedule is so weak, entertainment
president Warren Littlefield tried to hide its poor shows with a
bunch of fancy, chest-thumping charts and graphics during a recent
preview for the press. Sorry, Warren, but we don't care if NBC came
in first or second place every night of the week last year. It
doesn't matter that the network is reaching those money-spending,
18- to 49-year-old viewers Madison Avenue craves.
</P>
<P>
   What's really important is why your comedies look like UPN
rejects. And why is your schedule so lily white?
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said about the other networks. While TV has
never made developing strong minority-themed shows a priority, it
looks as if the networks have abandoned the idea completely. During
one of CBS' presentations at the press tour, one of the network
publicists pulled me aside and told me how embarrassed she was at
the lack of diversity on CBS' shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at them, they're all white-bread and look like Ken and
Barbie,'' she complained.
</P>
<P>
   I nodded and agreed. But that's nothing new, and it's getting
worse. Networks never have satisfactory answers, but at least they
make some feeble response about addressing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Williams, Home Improvement's creator, came right out and
said it. When asked why the big three networks (ABC, NBC, CBS) have
trimmed minorities from their shows, he shrugged, ``The WB has
taken that audience ... there is an outlet for that programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that wasn't the intent, but it was an arrogant and glib
response. The translation: Black audiences have The Wayans Bros.,
so what's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   But before you start making Blockbuster plans every night, don't
think there's nothing worth watching this season. A few shows hold
promise. ABC's romantically sweet Cupid and the sinister Fantasy
Island look interesting. That '70s Show is the season's funniest
new sitcom. The WB's witch drama/comedy Charmed looks charming,
UPN's time travel drama Seven Days is a nice thrill ride and CBS'
retro-detective drama Buddy Faro is worth a look. (Our annual TV
preview of fall shows will run next month when most shows
premiere.)
</P>
<P>
   And there's always the hope that a few sleeper hits will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all of TV's problems, not everyone believes it's getting
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those people that thinks network television is as
good as it's ever been,'' says Diane English, executive producer of
Fox's new comedy Living In Captivity. ``I think the bar keeps
getting raised ... I don't think that we're in a huge slump of
quality. I think that there's so much competition for our time,
Americans have a lot less time to spend watching TV.''
</P>
<P>
   You're wrong, Diane.
</P>
<P>
   Why do you think more people are watching less network TV? Bad
shows. Create good shows, and viewers will come.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens on a more consistent basis, maybe we can
seriously answer this ABC slogan: ``If TV's so bad for you, why is
there one in every hospital room?''

 &HT;    Kooky humor plentiful as `That '70s Show' looks at Me Decade
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Polyester leisure suits. Garish platform shoes and _ yikes! _
The Captain and Tenille.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Me Decade is back in psychedelic living color on That
'70s Show, Fox's kooky blast-from-the-past sitcom. Remember The
Brady Bunch? Well, imagine if Marcia &AMP; Co. weren't such do-right
squares. Think Greg trying to cop some brew from his parents'
swinging disco party. (Yeah, we know it's tough imagining Mike and
Carol doing the bump to Play That Funky Music White Boy, but work
with us.) Think Peter, Marcia and Greg having a pot party in the
basement. Think Jan steaming up the back seat of a Vista Cruiser
with a studly teen.
</P>
<P>
   Now you have a better idea of what That '70s Show is all about.
The year is 1976. The place: suburban Wisconsin. Eric Foreman
(Topher Grace) and his buddies are typical '70s teens. They like to
party, tease their uptight parents and make out with the opposite
sex. Hey, come to think of it, that describes many of today's
teens.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, since this is the '70s, we see a lot of smile buttons,
goofy haircuts and toothy Farrah Fawcett posters that actually
talk.
</P>
<P>
   To get away from his parents, Eric hangs out in the basement
with his cool crew, including the sexy, next-door-neighbor Donna
(Laura Prepon); Kelso (Ashton Ketcher), the hunky, but dense as
Vinny Barbarino guy; his spoiled girlfriend Jackie (Mila Kunis);
conspiracy buff Hyde (Danny Masterson); and Fez (Wilmer
Valderrama), a foreign-exchange student who sounds a lot like
Taxi's Latka.
</P>
<P>
   That '70s Show is a goofy, laugh-out-loud hoot. As the deadpan
Eric, Grace is particularly funny. The guy's blank stares say more
than three pages of dialogue. You can tell the 3rd Rock From the
Sun creators (Bonnie and Terry Turner) are behind this often manic,
live-action cartoon. When the laughs aren't coming (and there are a
few of those moments), the Turners jazz up the show with clever
scenes and odd camera angles.
</P>
<P>
   The funniest is when a wide-eyed, stoned-on-reefer Eric tries to
look cool while talking to his folks. The problem? The walls keep
spinning in front of him. In an inspired fantasy scene, the kids
mimic what they think their parents are talking about at a party.
``Hey everybody, let's hustle!''
</P>
<P>
   You should hustle to check out this sweet and often hilarious
comedy.

 &HT;    Actor performs almost too well in cruel roles
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past year, actor Aaron Eckhart has been receiving hate
mail.
</P>
<P>
   His film debut as a sadistic male chauvinist who cruelly toys
with a hearing-impaired secretary in the controversial film In the
Company of Men proved too persuasive for some moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhart understands the reaction. ``Nobody knows who I am, so
they have no other choice but to believe that that is me. They say,
`I hate you,' and I say, `Thank you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Eckhart and director Neil LaBute have teamed up on another
downbeat movie about male-female relations, Your Friends &AMP;
Neighbors, co-starring Ben Stiller, Jason Patric and Nastassja
Kinski, which opened Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely to endear Eckhart any more to audiences, for he
plays Barry, an unsympathetic, unfeeling schmo, adrift in one of
the movie's loveless relationships. The story concerns six
intertwined, 30-ish, lost souls whose lives are disrupted by an act
of infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as a 90-minute concentration on the lows of
relationships,'' says the single,
</P>
<P>
   unattached Eckhart, 30. ``I think men and women can be honest,
but I think somewhere in that relationship, you're going to hit the
lows that are seen in this film.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute sees his new feature, which covers everything from
adultery to rape, as more skeptical than cynical. ``I think there's
less abject cruelty in this movie, but I think there's casual
brutality that is actually worse, in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not moviegoers warm to his characters, Eckhart knows
they are good showcases for his fledgling career. ``The challenge
with this character was to capture the reality of a man who is
flying out of control, a man who is knee-deep in quicksand and
going down,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long ago that Eckhart was toiling in LaBute's
hometown of Fort Wayne, Ind., making In the Company of Men under
penny-pinching conditions with no illusions about the movie's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even think that movie would be seen,'' he says.
``Imagine that we're shooting a movie with no professionals, no
expectations, (for) $25,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The housing arrangements were unusual, to put it mildly. ``Neil
made a deal with his next-door-neighbor, who had gone away for the
summer,'' says Eckhart. ``He would mow their lawn if we could stay
in the house. And it was just sweltering hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Then In the Company of Men caused shock waves at last year's
Sundance Film Festival, winning the Filmmakers Trophy and gaining
LaBute a development deal with Gramercy Pictures. So he dusted off
Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors, based on his play that Eckhart appeared
in during their college days at Brigham Young University. The
budget ballooned to $4 million, chump change by major studio
standards, but relatively cushy to Eckhart. ``We weren't having
bologna sandwiches,'' he says with a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Now LaBute and Eckhart are known quantities, at least on the
independent film circuit. And they have to worry about living up to
their first release. ``Oh, we were so conscious of the sophomore
slump,'' says Eckhart. ``The idea that we were just lucky the first
time. People would ask me, `Is your best work behind you?' I'd go,
`Uh, well, I hope not.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the publicity trail, sipping iced tea and chatting in a Fort
Lauderdale hotel restaurant, the slim, clean-shaven, blond-haired
Eckhart looks nothing like his character in Your Friends &AMP;
Neighbors. To convey the lumbering, gone-to-seed Barry, Eckhart
grew a thin moustache, had his hair dyed a mousy brown and gained
30 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would do anything for a film that I thought was necessary,''
he says. ``I'd do anything physically possible that I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, but gaining 30 pounds, that sounds like too much suffering
for your art. ``It hurt like hell, just eating more than you ever
thought you could eat,'' he recalls with a wince. ``And it didn't
take for the first week, and I was getting pretty disappointed.
Then all of a sudden, bam! When you shove enough butter into your
face, it'll catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Then how did he lose the weight? ``I ran. I ran from the women
who saw In the Company of Men,'' Eckhart quips. ``Instead of a
pizza, I'd eat a salad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I got another job, and that put the pressure on. You
don't know how much weight you lose, when you know in two months
you have to take off your shirt in front of the camera,'' he notes.
``All of a sudden, you get real motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   That movie, already completed for a possible Christmas release,
is Rescue Me, co-starring Elisabeth Shue as his autistic sister,
who boosts her intelligence through an operation, then regresses
back to her original state. ``Our parents have died, and she comes
to live with me, so it's kind of like a Rain Man in that way,'' he
explains.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhart says he liked the script and particularly liked not
playing another male chauvinist clod. ``Now directors are seeing
this film, through screenings, going, `Wow, let's think about him
differently.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Eckhart wants to keep working with LaBute and remain a
member of the director's informal repertory company.
``Absolutely,'' he says. ``Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten,''
referring to the director-actor duo from the Mercury Theater and
Citizen Kane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope so,'' says LaBute. ``He's very easy to work with
and he's a great interpreter of what I've been able to do so far,
so why wouldn't I go there again?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we plan to do something else,'' agrees Eckhart. ``Neil
and I kind of look at this as a trilogy, so we have to complete the
trilogy.''
</P>
<P>
   So there's another shoe to drop? ``No,'' corrects Eckhart,
``another body to fall.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Streaking in baggy pants
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio. There is little that warms the hearts of
teenagers more than the knowledge that they have totally grossed
out a grown-up.
</P>
<P>
   Hence: purple hair, pierced tongues, and a skull and crossbones
tattooed on an otherwise noble brow.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly stated: Kids like to make us sweat.
</P>
<P>
   This undeclared war between the generations has been going on
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Picture the following dinner table conversation: Father: ``So,
Attila, where are you off to tonight?'' Long-haired and noticeably
grungy kid mumbles with his mouth full: ``I thought I'd pick up a
few Huns and take over Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother: ``You're not leaving the tent looking like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Attila (whining): ``Like what? This is what all of the other
barbarians are wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a story as old as time, bearing out the syllogism: IF the
grown-ups don't like it, THEN the kids are gonna' do it. And often.
</P>
<P>
   In Opelousas, La., respectable folks have taken issue with young
males roaming the streets in britches so baggy anyone would swear
there used to be another kid living in there with them. Concerned
citizens insisted there ought to be a law against kids having more
underwear above the belt than below it.
</P>
<P>
   Well of course there is such a law and the Opelousas police are
invoking it. Youthful offenders caught with their Jockeys hanging
out can be sent up for six months on an ``indecent exposure'' rap.
</P>
<P>
   Kind of prophetic, I'm thinking, considering the whole
droopy-drawers fad began in New York's inner city where a bunch of
kids with little else on their minds decided to mimic the beltless
prison look because it's decidedly ``cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Obvious question: Why would any kid want to shlep around in his
fat Uncle Arthur's jeans with his skivvies hanging out?
</P>
<P>
   Obvious answer: To annoy the big folks. Why else?
</P>
<P>
   The tacky-trouser craze struck our village a while back but
didn't last. Only a handful of youngsters felt the need to make a
statement by lowering their pants to half-mast. Most felt it was a
real stupid look.
</P>
<P>
   Adults around here aren't much into jailhouse dress so they just
figured the kids with the half-bared backsides came from poor
families where their mommas were still buying clothes two sizes too
big so's they'd have room to grow into them. See what I'm saying?
Grownups are seriously deficient in ``cool.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is it with kids? Do they really feel their day has been
wasted if they haven't grossed out their parents, outraged an
adult, and defied at least one authority figure?
</P>
<P>
   Yup.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   I dunno.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one sure-fire cure for their antics. Indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Remember streaking? Where everything from major league ball
games to Junior League teaparties were fodder for folks suffering
from Godiva's syndrome _ only without the horse? My son was nine or
ten when that fad hit and although he didn't appear to be paying
any attention to reports of the latest outbreaks of naked
nip-and-tuck, I soon learned better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' I heard whispers coming from the backyard tent, ``but
what if your mom catches us?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dark,'' another voice answered, ``and if we're quiet she
won't know.''
</P>
<P>
   I stopped mid-stride, stabilized the tray of milk and brownies I
was carrying, and tiptoed closer. ``So when do we take our clothes
off?''
</P>
<P>
   That I recognized as my son's voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not til we're in the woods and it's safe,'' the first voice
answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not really streaking if there's nobody to see us,'' my
son reminded his buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' agreed the other voice, ``but if somebody sees us
we're going to be in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   I decided it was time to make my shadowy presence known. ``Snack
time,'' I called out as a warning as I tromped through the pine
needles outside the tent. ``What are y'all up to?'' I asked,
pretending ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   Silence. I put the tray down on the old milk crate they were
using as a coffee table and prepared to leave. My son couldn't
resist sharing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking about going streaking,'' he said. I knew this
was a test so I casually asked where. ``Dunno.'' I asked if they
wanted me to drive them. ``No-ooo!'' was the unanimous and
immediate reply. I turned and left, wishing them a good night and
sweet dreams. Of course, I dozed in front of the den window all
night to be sure no little jaybirds took off running down Brookside
Drive.
</P>
<P>
   The following night as I tucked my son into his bottom bunk, I
asked how the streaking had gone. He said it hadn't and I asked
why. ``Mom,'' he said quite seriously leaning up on one elbow to
look me in the eye, ``you took all of the fun out of it. Kids don't
want their moms to drive them when they're going streaking.''
</P>
<P>
   I apologized.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm thinking, maybe if grownups can stand it long enough,
green hair and platform tennies will fade into well-deserved
oblivion. And as for bared backsides? I can't help wondering what
would happen if schools tacked a nudity clause in the dress code
section of the student handbook: Absolutely no clothes will be
allowed on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, I suspect, we'd be witnessing a return to the
Victorian era. And the best part? The kids would think it was all
their idea.

 &HT;    Take heart - kind souls quietly doing good deeds
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are one of those people who go around committing random
acts of kindness and senseless acts of beauty out of sheer
anonymous decency, the jig might be up.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody might rat you out.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I keep a file on doers of good deeds, and I encourage
readers to tell on their friends. Cases in point:
</P>
<P>
   Donald Keller, of Lake Park, a.k.a. ``Dr. Duke,'' has
``adopted'' Lake Park Elementary to benefit from his magic show on
safety, and once a year brings in his mechanical toy circus animals
for a ``hands on'' exhibition. ``Dr. Duke'' is also suspected of
playing anonymous Santa every year with cash gifts for needy
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   When the West Palm Beach law firm of Bakst, Cloyd and Bakst took
on a pro bono case for the Legal Aid Society of Palm Beach County,
lawyer Tina Talarchyk learned the plight of ``Dorothy,'' an
asthmatic 70-year-old grandmother who was caring for her
grandchildren in an un-air-conditioned mobile home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor woman, who is overweight and also has emphysema, was
suffering terribly from the heat in that trailer, and could hardly
breathe,'' Talarchyk said. ``I tried to get her some government
help, but the red tape was incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   So she called the Home Depot in West Palm Beach on State Road7
and asked manager Devin Wagaman if she could get a deal on a
scratched or dented air conditioner. ``Mr. Wagaman called a day or
two later and said he had an air conditioner that the store wished
to donate. He was fabulous. When I came to the store, he just said,
`Here you go,' and I signed.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Palm Beach Post paper carriers' random acts of kindness at
the scene of separate fires have been upgraded by me to a random
act of alertness in one case and random act of genius in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Recognition for alertness in the face of surliness goes to
Ronald Hodgkins of Boynton Beach, who saw flames erupting from the
Four Sea Suns condominiums at 1800 N.E. Third Court. He ran to the
apartments, banging on doors, trying to rouse the residents, who
evidently could not hear the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   So he banged harder until finally, a cranky resident came to the
door and demanded:
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you knocking at 5a.m.? Don't you know everyone is
sleeping?''
</P>
<P>
   After rousing the residents _ all of whom escaped without injury
_ Hodgkins called 911 and then finished his route.
</P>
<P>
   While Post carrier John O'Hearn, 32, of Lake Worth, and Ray
Alvarez, 42, of West Palm Beach, have already been recognized for
rescuing an infant and two other children from a burning house in
West Palm Beach on Aug. 15, the way they teamed up deserves
mention.
</P>
<P>
   After Alvarez used a shutter to break a window, O'Hearn, passed
3-month-old Michael Dellapietro and 6-year-old Austin Buzon through
the window. Then, by leaning into the choking smoke with a garden
hose, O'Hearn shouted for Katie Lyn Thompson, 3, to follow the
stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a wet arm and pulled her to safety,'' O'Hearn said
afterward.
</P>

 &HT;    Anemic cliches deserve a stake through the heart
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ `Blade' Starring: Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff, Kris
Kristofferson, Traci Lords Director: Stephen Norrington
Screenwriter: David S. Goyer MPAA rating: R for gore, violence,
language
</P>
<P>
   `Blade'' touts itself as a different kind of vampire movie, and
in a few small ways it is.
</P>
<P>
   Its lead vampire is a martial arts-flinging superhero (Wesley
Snipes). The sinister, neck-noshing vampires dress like lounge
hipsters and hang out at a techno club (they're nocturnal; they
like to party). There's a garlic serum that staves off the bummer
effects of a vampire bite. And, while silver bullets and sunlight
can ruin a vampire's night, here ``Crosses don't do squat.''
</P>
<P>
   Cool.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Blade'' is similar to many vampire movies in that it's not
very good. Fraught with cliches and based on the Marvel Comics
character _ one of the first African American comic book heroes _
``Blade'' cross-weaves the dark, steely-sleek worlds of ``Batman''
and ``The Crow'' with bursts of Hong Kong action high jinks and all
the inane trappings of the blood-drinking genre. It looks neat, but
it sucks.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder screenwriter David Goyer also penned ``The Crow:
City of Angels'' (as well as ``Dark City''). In look, feel and
plot, ``Blade'' is uncomfortably close to ``The Crow,'' not to
mention ``Batman.'' All three follow brooding comic book heroes who
wear highly accessorized black costumes as they seek to avenge the
brutal murders of their loved ones. They're Hamlet, with 'tude.
</P>
<P>
   But Blade is a stiff, particularly humorless, type-A tree trunk
shrouded not so much in creepy mystique as chronic personality
deficiency. The tattooed vampire hunter speaks in curt, breathy
grunts _ Clint Eastwood with asthma _ and races around in his black
hot-rod armed with automatic weapons and the samurai sword that's
his namesake. Then he kicks vampire booty.
</P>
<P>
   Snipes _ one of those ``What happened to?'' actors whose career
instills deep concern _ cuts a dark if not terribly menacing or
sympathetic figure as the laconic Blade. He's so starched that
every time he breaks into martial arts, it's a revelation. Even his
deadpan one-liners (``It's open season on all suckheads'') move
like falling timber.
</P>
<P>
   In Goyer's maddeningly formulaic story, Blade is out to get
revenge for the death of his mother, who was bitten by a vampire
while pregnant with baby Blade and died giving birth. That makes
Blade a dreaded ``half-breed'' _ a man equipped with a vampire's
immortality, super-strength and regenerative powers (his wounds
heal like that), but none of its weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   With assistance from his pal Whistler (a biker bar-ready Kris
Kristofferson who looks like he should be called Thor), Blade takes
intravenous blasts of garlic concentrate to immunize him from the
ill traits of vampirism.
</P>
<P>
   Blade proves a formidable weapon against an underground army of
vampires who plan to take over the world. The vampires run their
affairs like a Mafia family _ all dark suits, boardroom rituals and
a seesawing hierarchy, which is threatened by punky renegade Deacon
Frost (a perfunctorily vile Stephen Dorff).
</P>
<P>
   Frost heads a band of mutinous, but terribly hip, vampires who
want it all. He also runs one of those all-night dance clubs
haunted by sun-shy vampires and crank fiends. We know Frost is pure
evil because he listens to electronica.
</P>
<P>
   Duck for flying body parts, ripping flesh and tsunamis of blood
when Blade confronts Frost and his stereotypical minions (aloof and
pretty moll; cackling, maniacal henchman). Good battles evil and
all that stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Director Stephen Norrington saturates ``Blade'' in MTV-style
gloss, but his feeble vision is eclipsed by the equally derivative
art direction and cartoonish computer effects. Norrington's notion
of directorial flare is to show a close-up of someone lighting a
cigarette and to amplify the crackling sound of burning tobacco.
It's an old trick done by a thousand young action directors. So is
this dull ``Blade.''

 &HT;    I'm slick, shiny and not sweating. I'm a vinyl Avenger
 &HT;    By Carolyn Kelly
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Ordinarily, you won't see me in shrink-wrapped clothes.
And in general, I'm not one to cavort around town looking like a
dominatrix, even if I haven't done laundry in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, here I am, weighing iceberg lettuce in Central Market on a
Saturday afternoon, dressed in a skin-hugging black vinyl cat suit.
Heads are swiveling, eyebrows are arching, voices are lowering.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this matters; I'm on important business. I'm trying
to determine if a woman can go about her day in Central Texas in a
slinky one-piece getup like the one Uma Thurman sports as Emma Peel
in ``The Avengers,'' the recently released cinematic dud.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the movie's shortcomings, Mrs. Peel's appeal from the
'60s TV show carries on. In her heyday, the sultry British
character was all the rage. As played by Diana Rigg, Mrs. Peel was
sexy and sardonic _ all style and smarts _ with a mod, mod wardrobe
. She was the cat's meow.
</P>
<P>
   While wearing her trademark cat suit, Mrs. P. could karate chop
evil chaps without ripping a seam, then languorously toast her
triumph with champagne.
</P>
<P>
   But what about her off hours, after dastardly deeds are avenged,
after Emma and John Steed trade flirtatious barbs and she hops into
her sporty Lotus Elan?
</P>
<P>
   What about doing this in Austin? Call me half-baked, but I was
going to zip myself inside this impossibly impractical,
ultra-form-fitting, head-to-toe apparel, in steamy August. And then
go shopping, run errands, catch a movie.
</P>
<P>
   My first mission was to find a cat suit.
</P>
<P>
   The J. Peterman catalog offers a genuine ``Avengers'' cat suit
of ``faux leatherette'' for a mere $2,000. Way over budget. I
called lingerie stores and costume shops, rejecting outfits that
included cat tails or perky ears. Though I'm sure Mrs. Peel never
browsed the clothing racks at erotica shops, I did. For $260,
Forbidden Fruit stocks a suit of latex, for that sensual
rubber-glove feel, with a zipper located where the moon don't glow.
My mother would have a conniption.
</P>
<P>
   I stumbled across success at the Bazaar Back Stage, where a
spit-shiny little vinyl number (a comfy 60 percent PVC, 40 percent
nylon; machine wash) for only $41.50 caught my eye. Though the
waistline was a bit baggy, a seamstress zealously took in every
spare inch until my outlandish outfit was sufficiently
asphyxiating. At least I'll never have to iron it.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I retrieved a pair of knee-high boots from my closet,
borrowed an incredibly wide belt and finished off the look with
Isotoner gloves. Voila. Pure Mrs. Peel.
</P>
<P>
   (OK, so maybe I don't have Uma Thurman's Architectural Digest
bone structure, lustrous almond eyes, air-pumped lips or conical
breasts. The voluptuous actress playing Emma Peel and I do share
some similarities: we both have a couple of X chromosomes and we
both have cat suits.)
</P>
<P>
   After contemplating the underwear question (should I wear any?),
I venture out with little more than a thin layer of baby powder
under my full-body rain slicker.
</P>
<P>
   At Central Market, I discover perhaps the only blessing of
wearing fabric that gasps for breath. For the first time ever, I'm
not shivering in the frosty produce department.
</P>
<P>
   Here, amid the bright green vegetables, strangers look my way
and then quickly glance down. Several heads whiplash around as I
wander the aisles, squishing and squeaking in my rubbery suit. I
start to feel like the star of some oddball performance art piece.
Only nobody is getting it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the bakery department, among the rustic bread
loaves, somebody hits a bull's-eye when a 20something guy says,
``Emma!'' barely within earshot.
</P>
<P>
   As I stroll by, one potbellied man shouldering a canvas Central
Market bag slowly rotates in my direction, like a surveillance
camera. Another older man, only a few feet away, eyes me, forehead
to toes and back up again. Their internal compasses follow my
costume like true north.
</P>
<P>
   Several folks kindly inquire whether I am overheating. And as I
hand my money to a bright-faced young girl working behind the cafe
counter, she says, with much sincerity, ``Everybody loves your
outfit.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes, from place to place.
</P>
<P>
   The guy selling dog chews at Bark n Purr pet shop keeps a poker
face, and the convenience store clerk chuckles discreetly. But
mostly, I feel eyes fixing on my outrageous garb, then dodging
away. Women slowly raise their menus for whispered fashion
critiques. Others beckon friends to hurry, come take a look. One
tipsy fellow sticks his index finger in my face and ventures a
guess: ``Cat Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm just thankful my cat suit doesn't garner any catcalls.
</P>
<P>
   As evening sets in, I head to the theater to see _ what else? _
``The Avengers.'' I'm accompanied by two friends, who graciously
tote my purse; after all, cat suits don't have pockets.
</P>
<P>
   After passing through the lobby with little fanfare, it feels
good to sit in a dark theater. I hadn't eaten much all day _ afraid
of bursting out of my clothing _ so I hunker down and hide behind a
giant popcorn tub. Soon I am wincing from the lousy dialogue and,
unbelievably, shaking from the icebox temperatures. I have the urge
to give the theater's thermostat a good ol' Mrs. Peel karate kick.
And to think I had worried about a cat suit meltdown. Only once
during my heavily air-conditioned day did I ever break a sweat _
while ever-so-glamorously pumping gas.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie mercifully ends and the crowd funnels toward the
exit, I feel the first flush of cat suit embarrassment. Why
couldn't I be dressed in a ``Titanic'' costume?
</P>
<P>
   But nobody cares, as I walk to my car in my rubbery, glossy,
downright silly cat suit. After all, this is Austin, and they've
seen a lot weirder.
</P>
<P>
   So, as Mrs. Peel would say, it's time for a champagne toast. Now
somebody help get me out of this thing.

 &HT;    Chelsea vulnerable as only child
 &HT;    By Ricardo Gandara
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ People can only guess the impact of her father's
admission. A front-page picture of Chelsea Clinton recently showed
her holding hands with her parents, the young woman bridging the
gap between the president and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   And we wonder: What is this doing to Chelsea? What does a
dysfunctional marriage do to the psyche of an older child? What
happens when a parent makes a revelation that rips the heart of a
family?
</P>
<P>
   It likely forces an older child to re-evaluate the parent, says
Carl Pickhardt, an Austin psychologist and author of several
parenting books, including ``Keys to Parenting the Only Child.''
``You have to reconcile what the world is saying and what you have
been led to believe. It's an enormous sense of betrayal,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Drake, a licensed marriage and family counselor in Austin,
agrees. ``A child will rethink their parents. This is the person
who taught me to tell the truth who is now lying. It's heavy,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   It gets more complicated with only children. ``To some degree in
a one-child family, there is a highly emotional and sensitized
relationship. They are sensitive and considerate of each other. It
is a three-person marriage, and they treat each other as equal
partners,'' Pickhardt says.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of infidelity on a marriage is harsher on older
children, especially in the 18 to 23 age group, which is considered
the last stage of adolescence. Of course, older children understand
a parent's actions more _ from a standpoint of the meaning of an
infraction _ but it goes beyond that, says Drake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little kids don't have the maturity for adult issues. However,
a 19- or 20-year-old comes to view her parents more as people.
However, it's still traumatic to enter the adult business of their
parents. A daughter still wants to say, 'Dad, I want you to be the
Dad you've told me about all these years,' '' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The issues confronting an older child are deeper than they can
be explained: mistrust, betrayal, embarrassment and anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be like your world blowing up,'' says Jamie Ross of
Austin, a junior at Wake Forest University.
</P>
<P>
   She has what she describes as the ultimate close relationship
with her parents, Richard and Sharon Ross. To talk about them
cheating is absolutely foreign. ``We're best friends. We talk about
everything. I have so much respect for them. They are so in love.
They're brought us up the best way possible. I've been incredibly
blessed,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   However, if her father were to ever do the unthinkable and
reveal an adulterous affair, ``I'd wonder about everything that
came out of his mouth. Is it the truth?''
</P>
<P>
   There would be humiliation. ``I'd be horribly embarrassed.
Chelsea's at Stanford, a long way from home. She depends on her
friends when she has to talk to someone at 3 o'clock in the
morning. You know her friends have been watching all this, and
they've formed opinions. Who can she trust? Who can she talk to? It
makes me wonder,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   However, because the 21-year-old sees her parents as adults and
human beings, it would help her cope. ``I think I would forgive my
father because that's what he's always taught me. I'd see him as a
human being who made a mistake. You just don't abandon the people
you love,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Pickhardt agrees. ``Something like this may alter a child's
perception but it doesn't alter the love she has for a parent. It
may give a child a greater compassion of the frailties of a
parent,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   However, it could also destroy the child's belief that marriage
can be wonderful. ``They lose hope that marriage can be monogamous.
It puts question marks that it may happen to them in their
marriage,'' says Drake.

 &HT;    Mike's memories
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The list of guests featured on The Mike Douglas Show reads like
a ``who's who'' of Hollywood in the '60s and '70s:
</P>
<P>
   John Lennon and Yoko Ono (who co-hosted the show for a week in
1972) _ ``We thought he was kidding when we asked him who he wanted
on the show and he said the Chicago Seven. So we booked them.
(Black Panther Bobby Seale and Jerry Rubin were on the same show as
President Nixon's surgeon general. Things got ugly quick.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thrill of his life, though, was when we had his
idol, Chuck Berry, on the Wednesday show that week he hosted. He
was so happy that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods _ ``I was sitting at home watching a local show in
California and they had this little kid, cute as a button, 2 1/2
years old. The thing that was unusual was that here you had this 2
1/2-year-old swinging the club like an adult. So we had him on the
show. It was scary how good he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixteen years later, that kid came to me and sought me out at
the L.A. Open. I was hosting the Open that year ... and he came up
to the first tee. He was about 6-foot-1, and he said, `Mr. Douglas,
I'm Tiger Woods,' and I said, `Boy, how you've changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Johnny, Merv and Dinah, Mike Douglas held his own
during the heyday of TV talk shows. Here's his take on a few
well-known shows:
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Carson: ``He was the best. Anyone who watched him knew
that. He could get more laughs out of one look ... He could always
dig himself out if he was bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch the other two shows (Jay Leno and David Letterman),
and you make up your own mind. My golly, they're not even in the
same ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosie O'Donnell: ``She's great. I love Rosie. She does what I
think is the most important thing: she listens. How can you have a
conversation if you don't listen to what the guest is saying?
Whenever anyone asks for advice, that's what I tell them. Just
listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Springer: ``I think he's truly dangerous, what he's doing.
A kid comes home after school and sees that, how could someone not
be affected by that?''
</P>
<P>
   More of Mike's memories
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Davis Jr.: ``The first time I had Sammy on ... I told my
executive producer and director that they had to get rid of all the
guests. We had five or six guests booked, but I told them, `He'll
do the whole 90 minutes. He will sing. He will dance. He will do
impersonations. He will play the drums. He will do the whole
thing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked me how I knew this and I said, `Have you ever seen
him perform live? The man could do two hours standing on his head.'
He did an unbelievable show. Ninety minutes later, the audience was
limp.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha Mitchell: ``She said to me when we finished taping that
week, `If this show was live, I'd give you a show that would blow
everybody out of the water.' She was going to tell me all about
Nixon and would have done it on the air. Two days after we finished
the show, he resigned.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry Gordy: ``I had Berry Gordy say to me one time, `You're the
guy who made the label (Motown) for us.' We used his people when no
one else would. I had Stevie Wonder on the show when he was 12. You
could see what a talent this kid was.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey: ``He does better impressions than anyone ever!
Better than Rich Little, better than anyone. He must have the best
ear in the world. When he does Sammy Davis, he has the quality of
the voice, the posture, everything. He's incredible, this guy. He'd
go into a comedy club and paralyze people. And he's thrown all that
material away!''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Cash: ``There was a time when he was having trouble with
pills and alcohol, and he had to cancel once. I'll tell you what a
gentleman he is. A couple years later, I was doing The Carol
Burnett Show, and I was backstage and heard this voice. And his
voice, it can only be one voice. He came in my dressing room and
said, `I owe you a show.' I said, `No you don't, Johnny.' And he
said, `I want to do the show, and I don't want any money for it. I
did a terrible thing and I'm sorry, and I was having problems in
those days. So we booked him, and he brought his whole band, all
the girl singers, his wife June Carter. He did the show and gave
the money to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only three people in 23 years canceled on us. One was Johnny
Cash. Another was Roger Miller. He was an enormous talent, but he
got on the wrong plane, went to the wrong city and missed the show.
He called and said, ``I was having a bad day, and I went to the
gate and got on the wrong plane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chevy Chase was the other no-show. Not a phone call from him
explaining why, nothing. I just don't understand people like that.
You know, it's the biggest stars, stars like John Wayne, Bob Hope,
Lucille Ball, they are the best. It's not the people who are
teetering.''

 &HT;    Bad behavior is the norm for these despicable pals
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ `Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors' Starring: Ben Stiller,
Catherine Keener, Jason Patric, Amy Brenneman, Aaron Eckhart,
Nastassja Kinski Director: Neil LaBute Screenwriter: Neil LaBute
MPAA rating: R for sexually explicit language, adult themes
</P>
<P>
   Neil LaBute's chatty acid-bath ``Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors'' is
the writer-director's follow-up to last year's savage and
incendiary ``In the Company of Men.'' It's difficult to figure
which movie is more pungently, unrepentantly vicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men'' was cruel and nasty with pointed specificity: Two
misogynist SOBs target a pretty, deaf woman and sexually play her
like a wounded mouse before biting her head off and chewing between
triumphant cackles _ all figuratively speaking, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends' '' malignancy is more expansive: Six lovelorn
characters knit a cat's cradle of lies, insults, betrayal and
revenge, with the outcome a steaming battlefield of mutilated egos.
War is hell? Try love.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute wields his misanthropy the way David Mamet does. He's
convinced backstabbing and verbal violence are banal human
pastimes, not merely social pathologies, and amplifies this view to
deafening levels for heightened dramatic effect.
</P>
<P>
   He's fascinated by this behavior and observes it like a maker of
nature films. Camera hidden in the brush, he captures our species
as it conducts its exotic social rituals. He also captures those
wincing scenes of predation; the lion always gets the gazelle.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it all so chilling is that LaBute never blinks. He
remains an amorally distant and nonjudgmental spectator. Like the
callous nature shooters who watch the food chain without heroically
disrupting it, LaBute is aloof, and you just know he's smirking
behind that tree.
</P>
<P>
   Richly written and incisively acted by a cast that includes
Jason Patric, Amy Brenneman, gifted indie princess Catherine Keener
and Ben Stiller, in perhaps his best performance, ``Your Friends &AMP;
Neighbors'' is the sort of bleak comedy of manners Woody Allen
would have made if he was of a different era. (Scenes and
characters frequently echo those in ``Manhattan.'') We laugh at how
sick people can be, then curdle at the similarities to ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Populated by smart, urban neurotics, the movie, like Allen's, is
obsessed with sex, positively drenched in the concept of coitus.
But there's not a single nude scene. What's nude are the
characters' interiors, stripped of flattering light, dignity and
self-worth. The unsparing candor is squirm-inducing.
</P>
<P>
   The extremity of the cruelty nudges the movie into the absurd,
bordering on an especially cerebral brand of farce. The tip-off
LaBute is operating on levels viewers may not anticipate arrives in
an over-the-top scene in which Patric's psychotic scoundrel
describes in unreal detail his ``best f----.'' (If any more
dialogue were to be transcribed, this page would become a hailstorm
of Morse code dashes.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the movie's meticulous structure, the six characters _
two married couples, Patric's icy misogynist and Nastassja Kinski's
lesbian artist's assistant _ seem to float about in a largely
plotless universe. The ``friends'' have each other over for dinner,
meet at cafes and used book stores, bond at the gym, make
acquaintances at art galleries, and engage in various degrees of
really bad sex. (The ``Manhattan'' echoes grow louder.)
</P>
<P>
   The characters' names and the movie's urban setting are never
spoken; LaBute doesn't want to distract us from the psychological
hell he's constructing with tactile trivia. What LaBute, an alert
and expressive visualist, is concerned with are his characters'
actions and words, and his literate, tightly crafted and shrewdly
nuanced writing bears this out. The story emerges from what these
flawed people do; their fate never seems preordained by a narrative
blueprint. They act horrendously, then feel bad. Repeat.
</P>
<P>
   This makes room for the excellent performers to develop
full-bodied characters. A lesser cast would kill this movie.
</P>
<P>
   Stiller, as the stammering Woody character, shows again he is
our best modern parodist. Keener is sharp and typically commanding.
Patric will repulse you with his twisted intensity. And Aaron
Eckhart, so convincingly repugnant in ``In the Company of Men,''
embodies the sad cuckold, complete with added flab, a dreadful
mustache and a matted, Hitlerian haircut.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute is shaping up as an exciting filmmaker with a singular
satirical spin. His work is sophisticated and uncompromising in
ways that make you laugh and think with equal vigor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends'' is a darkly audacious film (the chamber orchestra
playing Metallica songs over the credits hints at things
subversive) that bristles with the prickly stuff of life. And the
fiendish LaBute finds clever ways of weaving in his ugly themes.
When a character drop kicks a plastic fetus, you're suddenly
watching allegory.

 &HT;    Writer Jong comments on first lady's 'deal with the Devil'
 &HT;    By Anne Morris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Twenty-five years after ``Fear of Flying,'' feminist
poet Erica Jong revisits the war between the sexes in a new book,
``What Do Women Want?'' due out in September from HarperCollins.
Its subtitles: ``Bread. Roses. Sex. Power.''
</P>
<P>
   In it, Jong dedicates a chapter to her observations on first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Here's a sample of what she writes
about the Clinton's political marriage:
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our rock stars bizarre and our First Ladies ordinary.
HRC will never be ordinary if she lives to be 127. ... The Clinton
administration and the Clinton marriage are both historic. As a
couple, the Clintons raise major issues about politics and sexual
politics. They are the first couple to have been elected President
of the U.S. jointly. It is clear that without HRC's participation,
Bill Clinton would have gone right down the Gary Hart sewer.
Because his wife stood by him on that first Barbara Walters
interview in 1992 ... the first Clinton campaign was able to
weather and rise above what had been killing sexual crises for
other presidential candidates. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Hillary Rodham Clinton's forgiveness, Bill Clinton's
appetites would have sunk him. But because of her fierce
protectiveness, the presidency has triumphed over past bimbo
eruptions, even made them seem suspect and irrelevant. Hillary has
almost single-handedly revolutionized the political marriage. ...
The very American ideal of a 'power couple' who add up to more than
the sum of their parts was perfected during the Clinton presidency.
After the unveiling of Monica Lewinsky and Kathleen Wiley, Hillary
Clinton claimed even more power in the marriage. She became Bill
Clinton's indispensable character witness. And even though nobody
believed in his character, Hillary loomed larger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``... Bill Clinton seems to have the best of Hillary: She
validates his feminist credentials with the electorate while he
remains free to go on being a Dogpatch Bob Packwood _ supporting
womankind in public, groping individual women in private.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal of the Clinton marriage fascinates me. ... Clearly
Hillary Rodham Clinton figured out in law school that if the time
was not yet ripe for a woman President, it was likely to be ripe
for a guy as driven and smart and personable as Bill Clinton. And
she could be his chief adviser, patron ... cheering and booing
sections, and disciplinarian. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume that Bill Clinton's erotic life is no better and no
worse than any other male politician's. ...``I'm glad his political
agenda is feminist. ... Hillary Clinton ... is in the same bind as
many strong, intelligent women. She has made her deal with the
Devil and now she must live with it.''

 &HT;    Here's Mike Douglas
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    ART AVAILABLE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Palm Beach Post
<TEXT>
<P>
   Genevieve Douglas walks to a corner of the walnut-paneled den in
her North Palm Beach home and randomly pulls a gold-covered
scrapbook from a shelf. There are dozens more stacked side-by-side,
reaching to the ceiling, making the wall glimmer amid the dark
woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which one is this, I wonder?'' she says softly, almost to
herself. She gently peels the binder open and the first page is
filled by a black and white photo of her husband and his friend.
She calls to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike ... this one is of you and Marlon.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlon. Brando. With her husband, Mike. Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' he says. ``Greatest actor there ever was, in my
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of scrapbook collection you accumulate when you
host 6,000 episodes of a TV talk show over 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   The scrapbooks were his wife's idea. Every celebrity who spent a
week co-hosting The Mike Douglas Show got a copy of photos shot on
the set. Didn't matter if you were Sammy Davis Jr., John Lennon or
Wayne Rogers, everybody got one. And, since he was the host,
Douglas got one, too.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the 73-year-old star needs them to remember his five
decades in the entertainment industry. Born on the west side of
Chicago, he became a singer in his teens, eventually playing
nightclubs and fronting Kay Kyser's big band. (It was Kyser who
switched his stage name from Michael Dowd to Douglas.)
</P>
<P>
   As a staff singer in town at NBC affiliate WGN, he got his first
break when host Ernie Simon couldn't make it on the air one day to
broadcast a morning show called Hi Ladies. Douglas went on and had
to wing it. ``It felt so good to me. It was so natural. That was
the beginning of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, Westinghouse was looking for an unknown to
host a show, someone who could sing, dance, do a serious interview
and take a pie in the face on occasion. An executive was watching
TV one day, saw Merv Griffin on a game show and was reminded of
Douglas, who at the time was between jobs in Los Angeles. In 1961,
The Mike Douglas Show debuted.
</P>
<P>
   More than 15 years have passed since his last show.
Westinghouse, which co-owned the show with Douglas, replaced him in
1980 with John Davidson. Douglas carried on in syndication for
three more years, paying the $8million budget on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Today, his life with Genevieve _ 53 years of marriage and
counting _ has downshifted into a relaxing blur of grandchildren,
golf and dinners with friends who live in the exclusive golf club
community of Lost Tree Village.
</P>
<P>
   The couple vacationed for years in Palm Beach County before
leaving Hollywood in 1994. They bought their current home in 1997,
and spend a great deal of time with their daughters, two of whom
live in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of the nicest people I have ever met,'' says friend
Betty DiVosta. She and her husband, Buz, the Palm Beach County real
estate developer, live about 10 houses away and have dinner with
the Douglases every few weeks. Douglas often shares tales of his
showbiz life, but doesn't make a point of doing so. ``He's kind,
very warm and a sincere person,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The Douglas' golf course house, with marble floors, grand piano
near the entrance and azure pool out back, is impressively
extravagant but homey nonetheless. It's a fraction of the size and
price he paid in the '80s for a $2.3million Beverly Hills mansion,
but it's more than comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we looked at that place Donald Trump owns now,
before he bought it ... beautiful place,'' Douglas offers. ``We
decided not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Mar-a-Lago?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep. Beautiful place.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at his age and with all this domestic bliss, you get the
sense he could don the jacket, grab the microphone, belt out a tune
and start all over again without missing stride. He could make it
on recollections alone.
</P>
<P>
   Point to any photo on the wall of his den or in a scrapbook, and
invariably an entertaining yarn is attached. As he sits on the end
of an expensive leather couch, he casually but proudly talks about
the five Emmy awards or his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Dressed in gray slacks, black loafers and a light pink Oxford
button-down with his initials stitched on the pocket, the memories
spill forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray Charles?'' he says, as a smile sneaks into the corner of
his mouth. ``We got Ray Charles to ride a motorcycle. He wanted to
do it. He had a blast.''
</P>
<P>
   Point to the photo of Barbra Streisand. ``The purest voice I've
ever heard. We had her on the show several times when she first
started. She walked around backstage pointing at her throat and not
talking. We started to panic until we realized she was just saving
her voice for the show. She was magnificent.''
</P>
<P>
   Point to the photo of Mike and actor Wayne Rogers standing with
... Mother Teresa?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the feeling I was in the presence of somebody very, very
special. I was so in awe of this woman. I had difficulty doing that
interview. Wayne was co-host that week.''
</P>
<P>
   As everything from the '70s gets a rehash in the '90s, Mike
Douglas is being rediscovered. His dormant career is starting to
awaken. His autobiography is due to be published by the end of the
year. He's making public appearances on talk shows and will be
performing with Marvin Hamlisch and the Pittsburgh Symphony
Orchestra in October. VH1 has broadcast old tapes of his shows, and
Rhino Records has issued a box-set of five shows on which John
Lennon and Yoko Ono were hosts in 1972. There are rumblings about a
possible radio show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turn down a lot of stuff,'' Douglas says without a hint of
braggadocio.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the overdue recognition he's receiving from the
latest generation of TV talkers. In an era when Jerry Springer is
TV's tawdry king, Rosie O'Donnell and Howie Mandel are having
success with what has been labeled ``Nice TV.'' The mixture of
entertaining, non-threatening interviews, guest hi-jinks and
musical performances should be renamed ``Mike TV,'' since it was
the formula Douglas worked so well.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell openly claims hers is a carbon copy of The Mike
Douglas Show.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of show I set out to make, a show where guests
feel safe and respected,'' O'Donnell said during a recent telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to watch Mike every day after school,'' she said. ``I'd
sit down with a bowl of popcorn at my grandmother's house, and I
just loved it. He was always so hopeful and fun. And he always
seemed like he was friends with the people he was interviewing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the perks of having your own show is that you can invite
your idols to appear. A few months back, O'Donnell asked Douglas to
be a guest. He was apprehensive at first _ it had been almost 15
years out of the spotlight _ but he agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came out, the audience stood and cheered and I was,
like, my goodness,'' Douglas said, still floored by the reaction.
</P>
<P>
   For Mandel, who grew up watching in Toronto, The Mike Douglas
Show holds special significance because it was the first American
talk show he appeared on as a stand-up comic in 1979. Mandel's talk
show debuted two months ago, and he also has scheduled Douglas to
appear. The show was scheduled to be taped last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to Hollywood, it was so intimidating, and yet he
had such an easygoing persona,'' Mandel remembered. ``He put me
immediately at ease when I sat down. A good talk show host is like
the host of a party in his own home, and that's the way Mike was.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of today's daytime talk shows, Mandel says Douglas'
show excelled because of the mix of guests. One day's panel might
feature a politician sitting next to a rock star, who was next to a
doctor, who was next to a militant activist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It truly was a variety show,'' Mandel says. ``Every 7 minutes,
it was something fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the reason Douglas' simple formula flourishes amid
Springer's controlled riots or Howard Stern's potty-mouth pranks,
O'Donnell and Mandel agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you give people the option, they're always going to
choose something like Mike,'' she says. ``Something like Springer
has a short shelf life.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Mandel says, ``Good solid entertainment always works.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas explains the mix of guests this way: ``I had a producer
who was insane. He'd send me into cages with wild tigers, telling
me it's harmless and that there won't be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything unexpected ever happen? Are you kidding me? Every 10
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Spend enough time with the Douglases and the topic invariably
turns to family.
</P>
<P>
   There are the daughters who all graduated college. There are the
grandchildren, one of whom is an accomplished amateur golfer.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the love of his life, Genevieve. The two still
act like love-struck kids. Which isn't out of character, since he
met her when she was a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew her brother and he would tell me, `You ought to see my
kid sister.' Gen was 16 when I first met her and she was 17 when I
proposed to her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were both kids, but it worked,'' she adds. ``I had written
in my diary when I met Mike, `Some day I'm going to marry him.'''
</P>
<P>
   She gets self-conscious at the memory. ``It sounds like we
didn't know what we were doing,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I knew what I was doing,'' he says, with a lusty wink at
her. She dips her head and grins shyly.
</P>
<P>
   In 53 years, she's never had a job outside the home. Raising the
kids and building their marriage was enough. ``There's only one
star in the family. Whatever support I can give Mike, that's my
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas is nothing if not practical about the recent attention.
He doesn't need the money. He claims not to miss the grind _ ``The
only thing I miss is getting a good table at a restaurant'' _ and
he knows that although the adulation is rewarding, he's still been
away from television for a long time. To illustrate this, he has a
story, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Seems once in the later years of the show, he booked Michael
Keaton, who was a stand-up comic at the time, before he became a
star in Beetlejuice and Batman. During a commercial break, Keaton
told Douglas, ``Mr. Douglas, do you know what my real name is? Mike
Douglas. I had to change it because of you.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, Douglas is watching The Tonight Show. The
guests: Keaton and Michael Douglas, the actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the show, Keaton leans over to Douglas and says, `Mr.
Douglas, do you know what my real name is? Michael Douglas. I had
to change it because of you.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way Hollywood works,'' he says with a slight
chuckle. ``That's show business.''

 &HT;    TKTS celebrates 25 years helping shows break a leg
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I hate to stand in lines. It's bad enough when I have
to wait at the bank, but it's far more aggravating wasting time in
line when I'm on vacation. With one exception.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for half-price theater tickets at the TKTS booth in New
York not only makes economic sense, but is itself a dose of street
theater performance art. Located at 47th Street and Broadway, on a
triangular block known as Duffy Square, the booth has been luring
bargain hunters and keeping many a show afloat with extra revenue
for the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   It opened in June 1973, and the idea caught on instantly with
the public. Today, when the booth opens daily at 3 p.m. (10 a.m. on
matinee days), there will be a line all the way down to 46th Street
that usually snakes back to 47th. But food vendors, steel band
percussionists and out-of-work actors with handbills for nearby
restaurants know a captive audience when they see one, so they
descend on the block with their street pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The TKTS booth is also a site where cast members of current
shows often come to campaign for ticket sales. The more sales they
can generate, even at a discount, the more likely their shows will
remain open and they can keep working. After all, their
enthusiastic entreaties can, sad to say, be at least as
entertaining as some of the shows they are in.
</P>
<P>
   And since the common denominator of all the people standing on
the TKTS line is that they want to attend the theater that day, it
is an easy matter to strike up a conversation about what those
around you have already seen, hope to see or wouldn't be caught
dead seeing. Opinions get shared, and unsavvy out-of-towners seek
critical advice (``Cats. Is that any good? What's that about,
anyway?'' ``Well, it helps if you're under 10. About two-and-a-half
hours.'') Think of it as a living, breathing theater chat room, and
time passes surprisingly quickly.
</P>
<P>
   If the buying public embraced the booth from its start, some
show producers were understandably wary of slashing their prices.
Sure, gaining half of a ticket's face value is better than having
the seat remain empty, but producers worried that last-minute
impulse purchasers would head to the discount booth rather than the
theater box office.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, some do. That's certainly where I head if I haven't
made advance plans. Arriving unexpectedly early into New York in
May, in time for a matinee, I hopped on line and snagged an
excellent seat for The Beauty Queen of Leenane, the Irish play that
went on to win four Tony Awards.
</P>
<P>
   All shows not available
</P>
<P>
   They may still grumble about it _ theater producers are
notorious grumblers, anyway _ but these days, it is the rare show
that does not consign some tickets to the half-price booth. Ten
years after it opened, Phantom of the Opera has yet to use the
booth, a reflection on its continued fanatical following. Of other
holdover hits, only Rent and Chicago are selling well enough to not
need the booth's push. There is also no point in checking TKTS's
electronic display if you're intent on seeing this year's big hits
_ The Lion King, Ragtime and Cabaret. Not yet, at least.
</P>
<P>
   But it is just a matter of time, says TKTS's head treasurer
James Gatens, who has been with the booth since it opened a quarter
of a century ago. ``You see, the theater ticket business is very
much like life,'' he says philosophically. ``In the beginning,
people need help to get started. Then they get real strong in the
middle at some point, and then, towards the tail end, they start
weakening again, and they need help again.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked which formerly sold-out shows have since extended their
lives through discount sales, Gatens mentions Cats and Miss Saigon.
``We sell a lot of seats for them,'' he says. ``The most popular
show we have right now on the board would be Titanic, last year's
Tony winner. They're starting to use us on a fairly regular
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Variety, the TKTS booth accounts for about one
ticket out of every seven sold for a Broadway or off-Broadway show.
Speaking in early June, just after the Tony Awards, Gatens said,
``This week, we'll sell about 37,000 seats, and we'll return back
to box offices approximately $1.3mil-lion.'' No wonder producers
have come to appreciate the booth.
</P>
<P>
   How many tickets to consign to the TKTS booth or whether to use
the booth at all is completely up to each show. And a new option
started about five years ago allows producers to offer a 25 percent
discount instead of 50 percent. It's an enticement for relatively
healthy shows to use the booth sooner and more frequently. At the
moment, Jekyll &AMP; Hyde has been selling 25 percent off seats at
TKTS.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1973, there have been some significant changes in the
booth's physical plant and its operations. ``We even have bathroom
facilities here now, which we didn't have for the first 15 years,''
says Gatens. ``We had to run across the street to Wienerwald or the
hotels in the area to use their facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all computerized now
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of runners, the booth used to employ a squad of
couriers to shuttle tickets from the city's various box offices to
TKTS to be sold. Today, ticket sales are about 90 percent
computerized, so seats can be consigned for discount with the press
of a button. Each show seems to have its own strategy for when to
send tickets to the booth, how many and how often. That's why
Gatens can't answer the one question everyone wants to know, ``When
is the best time to come to get great seat locations?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can walk up here at 3 o'clock and get the best seats in
the house, or they might be released much later in the day,'' says
Gatens. ``There's no set policy for them.''
</P>
<P>
   He can tell you that the line is longest in the first hour of
sales, 10 to 11 a.m. for matinees and 3 to 4 p.m. for evening
performances. By noon for matinees or 6 p.m. for evenings, the line
has usually dwindled to its shortest point.
</P>
<P>
   If you really don't like lines, and you don't mind going
downtown, TKTS has a satellite booth on the mezzanine of Two World
Trade Center. The lines are shorter, it is air-conditioned and
sheltered from the elements, and it opens weekdays at 11 a.m. to
accommodate workers on their lunch breaks. It is also worth
remembering that matinee tickets are sold here the day before the
performance _ Friday for Saturday's matinee, for instance. About 15
to 17 percent of TKTS sales come from the World Trade Center
outlet.
</P>
<P>
   At 25, the TKTS booth is healthy and successful. So is Broadway
at 100, thanks in part to the sales generated by the half-price
booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't make big hits bigger, we don't make bad shows any
worse,'' says Gatens. ``It's those middle-of-the-road shows that
need that extra percentage to keep the doors open. That's what we
do.''

 &HT;    Trysting the night away: Bill, Monica are frolicking in historic
company
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carl Jung said a man who has not passed through the inferno of
his passions has not overcome them. If Bill Clinton is feeling
heat, it may be because he lingered too long in the inferno.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is old and seemingly hard to learn: Affairs are
dangerous, possibly wrong, professionally destructive and wrenching
to loved ones. Or, they may not be. Peccadilloes march, stumble and
steal hand in hand through history with the greats, near greats and
not-so-greats.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes everybody wins. Usually, someone loses.
</P>
<P>
   Louis XV, 18th-century French king, learned when you give away
the keys to the kingdom for reasons of the flesh the kingdom
becomes unglued as well as unlocked. His mistress, Madame de
Pompadour, ruled as virtual queen for 20 years, sinking France into
wars, taxes and famine. On the plus side she financially supported
artists and poets, most now forgotten. Her tastes ran to the
pedestrian except in lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Stewart Parnell, leader of the Irish freedom movement in
the late 19th century, scuttled Ireland's cause when he took up
with Katherine O'Shea, the wife of an army captain. Parnell's fall
gave Britain the leverage to rule parts of Ireland to this day.
</P>
<P>
   John Profumo, British war minister, learned in 1963 that
sleeping with the enemy is not a good idea for war minsters. When
his mistress, Christine Keeler, turned out to be a call girl,
tongues wagged but eyes winked. When she turned out to be a
confidant to Soviet spies, Profumo's career ended with a whimper.
He exchanged his life of philandering for one of philanthropy and
was later cited by the queen. For his good deeds.
</P>
<P>
   Bertrand Russell, perhaps the greatest logician of the 20th
century, said that ``civilized people cannot fully satisfy their
sexual instinct without love.'' Married four times, divorced three,
Russell was known to park his bicycle in front of houses wherein
lived the wives of fellow professors. For tea, we presume. Or,
perhaps he was looking for love. Anyway, he was tossed out of the
City College of New York in 1949 as ``an enemy of morals.'' His
1932 book, Marriage and Morals, is considered a classic by many
progressive thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hart challenged the press to put a tail on him during his
1988 presidential bid in order to dispel rumors of sexual misdeeds.
The press did. Hart, who was married, quit the race soon after the
press photographed him and friend Donna Rice in an unpresidential
pose.
</P>
<P>
   The press need not get on its high horse. William Randolph
Hearst, who took yellow journalism to new shades of jaundice during
the Spanish-American War, lived openly with his mistress, actress
Marion Davies, in his California mansion. His wife never
editorialized, in public anyway.

   On one end of our spectrum we have the discreet (and unverified)
assignations of FDR, who is rumored to have found succor in the
arms of another woman. The same has been said of Eleanor. Perhaps
because of grace and strength of character, their partnership
transcended any lapses. Same with JFK and Jackie. Ditto Dwight
Eisenhower and his wartime assistant, Kay Summersby. We'll never
know exactly what happened. The pat answer is the press was less
willing to dig into private lives in our more innocent past. Maybe.

   Or maybe the targets of suspicion displayed more intelligence
and stealth than some of their modern counterparts. Remember
Arkansas Congressman Wilbur Mills splashing with Fanne Fox in the

 &HT;    Mathias is full-speed when it comes to football
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI, Ohio _ Amidst the glittering array of major college
stars stands the NFL's version of the underdog ``Rudy'' _
5-foot-10, 180-pound Ric Mathias from NCAA Division III University
of Wisconsin-La Crosse.
</P>
<P>
   Intimidated? Not at all. Eager to show he belongs in the NFL?
Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   All the undrafted rookie cornerback did in the Bengals' 33-19
victory over Detroit was commit two crimes _ one that aided the
enemy and another that sealed the win.
</P>
<P>
   Flagged for fair-catch interference when he bumped Detroit's
Terry Fair while trying to down a punt inside Detroit's 5-yard
line, Mathias made up for it by intercepting a Chris Dittoe pass
and racing 67 yards for a touchdown with 34 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Mathias' last-minute heroics may not be enough to make the team.
That's why he's sweating out today's seven cuts as NFL rosters get
reduced to 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking every play like it's my last play,'' Mathias said.
``I'm enjoying the people I'm around. I'm very, very grateful to be
in this situation and I just don't want to take anything for
granted.''
</P>
<P>
   What isn't subject to debate is his intensity, desire and
lightning quickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like his guts, determination, quickness, speed and
toughness,'' said Jim Lippincott, the Bengals director of
pro/college personnel. ``The kid has a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL teams are always hunting talent. So when the Bengals got a
call from UW-La Crosse coach Roger Harring regarding Mathias, they
figured: Why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't expecting very much,'' Lippincott said. ``What we
got was something pretty commendable. Ric plays the game the way
it's meant to be played _ 100 miles an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathias knows he fighting tremendous odds with his size and
inexperience. But when skeptics say, ``You can't,'' he says, ``I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from a small school, you're not expected to make it to
this level,'' he said. ``You see these guys on TV and you just
dream of playing with them someday. Now all of a sudden it's come
true. You have to understand you're here and you can't get caught
up in all the hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not intimidated by these guys as far as their speed and
strength. It's just a matter of getting to know who I've got to
respect and how many steps I've got to give certain receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathias admits the complexity of the Bengals 3-4 defense with
all the checks, formations and responsibilities is ``a lot more
mentally taxing'' than college. But he's adjusting well.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are pulling for me to see if I can hang on,'' he said.
``I just want to make the most of my opportunity.''

 &HT;    Capital Metro makes top-job offer
 &HT;    By Debbie Hiott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Capital Metro, which has been without a general
manager since December, is getting a new boss from Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The board of directors voted recently to begin negotiating with
Karen Rae, acting director of surface transportation for the
Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority in Buffalo, to take over
Capital Metro's top job.
</P>
<P>
   Board members, who struggled with a decision for several months,
said Rae, 43, stood out because of her passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard not to be impressed with how dynamic she is,'' board
Chairman Lee Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Board member George Denny, mayor of Cedar Park, said he heard
high praise for Rae at a recent transit conference he attended. He
said Rae is energetic and experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very impressed with her,'' Denny said.
</P>
<P>
   But Walker said it was more than the energy they saw on the
surface that won board members over. It was Rae's reputation in
Buffalo for community involvement and her ability to scrap for
limited dollars in hard economic times that made their choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is somebody who's very frugal,'' Walker said. ``They have
not had the relative abundance we have here. They've had to do with
less and less.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason it's unlikely Rae will turn down a chance to
come to Capital Metro, where she will have better resources _ a
one-cent dedicated sales tax that is bring in more money each year
_ to work with.
</P>
<P>
   Board members Monday worried about the risk of announcing their
top choice without a firm contract in hand, but Walker said he
thought the board had to be open with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief is that if we run an open shop, we'll be ahead of
the game here,'' Walker said. ``Obviously, if we can't reach a
deal, we can't reach a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rae said she doesn't think it will be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely committed to getting there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Rae makes a little less than $77,000. If she chose to
stay in Buffalo, her salary would be $85,000. Capital Metro's
former general manager, Justin Augustine III, received $118,500 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Rae said she knows there will be challenges at Capital Metro,
particularly in changing negative perceptions of Capital Metro in
the community. But Rae called working in the community ``the thing
I love to do most.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it very interesting to get out and talk to the
public,'' she said. Rae put that interest to use during the 14
months before the Buffalo transit authority started a pilot program
called Hublink that attempts to link inner-city workers to suburban
jobs and make suburb-to-suburb commuting easier.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the program, Rae attended about 90 community
meetings, trying to get an idea exactly what the community wants
and needs from its transit authority.
</P>
<P>
   The same concept is needed in Austin, Rae said, where she'd like
community members to determine what service standards they want,
whether it's the frequency of service or the size of the buses.
</P>
<P>
   Rae said she has taken a close look at a performance review
released last month by the state comptroller's office that was
critical of Capital Metro. She said it was a well-done audit that
serves as ``a good road map'' to turning the agency around.
</P>
<P>
   But she stressed that audits, by their nature, often leave out
the things an agency does well.
</P>
<P>
   ``My challenge is to find those strengths and build on them,''
Rae said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, Denny and board member Margaret Gomez, a Travis County
commissioner, will negotiate with Rae. Board members said they hope
to have Rae at Capital Metro by Oct. 1, when a new budget year
begins.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the board of directors got a budget preview that
includes plans to operate the bus system on about two-thirds of the
agency's $100 million sales tax levy. Earlier this year, the board
and staff struggled to get bus operations to three-quarters of the
sales tax and to reserve one-quarter for future rail or other
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a healthy economy _ sales tax revenue is forecast to
increase 5 percent _ more money can be set aside for future
projects. At the same time, operating expenses could increase 8
percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
   The draft budget will be released in the near future. The board
is expected to approve a budget Sept. 28.

 &HT;    Cheaper Canadian cattle driving down US prices
 &HT;    By Heather McGregor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Western beef producers are organizing
and raising money to pursue an international trade complaint
against Canada. They allege that subsidized Canadian beef imports _
boxed and on the hoof _ are driving down domestic calf prices by
$100 to $250 a head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have market fluctuation anymore. We're just getting
slammed,'' said Kathleen Sullivan Kelley of Meeker, a rancher and
vice president of Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The R-CALF group argues that since Canada can no longer sell
beef to Asia because of economic troubles there, it's exporting as
many as 1.5 million cattle a year to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   And Canadian producers are subsidized by a variety of government
programs that allow them to sell cattle to U.S.-based packers at
below-cost prices, the group contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is slamming down domestic prices, while we as an industry
can't even begin to meet our U.S. consumer demand,'' Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
   Below-cost imports are skewing the standard economic rule that
heavy demand and short supply leads to higher prices, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in our fifth year of reduced cattle prices, and
nationwide we're down 10 million head since 1994. We'll see as much
as a 30 percent reduction in producers in the next year, ranchers
simply selling off their cattle and going out of business,'' Kelley
said.
</P>
<P>
   The economic strain on the beef industry is as much blamed on a
concentration of ownership in the meat packing industry as on
imports. While a separate lawsuit against Iowa Beef Processors is
underway in federal court by Midwestern cattle growers, ranchers in
the northern tier states are focusing on imports.
</P>
<P>
   R-CALF founders Leo McDonnell of Columbus, Mont., and Mike
Callicrate of St. Francis, Kans., have gone on the lecture circuit
of town meetings in Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska and the Dakotas.
Crowds of 350 to 800 have turned out in recent weeks, and the
organizers have had no trouble raising the $50,000 needed to retain
legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley plans to make an organizing swing through Texas starting
in mid-September. She is available to speak to groups in Colorado
until then.
</P>
<P>
   They must raise an estimated $1.5 million to fight the entire
legal battle, and they must prove that at least 300,000 cattle
growers _ 25 percent of the nation's total _ support the action.
</P>
<P>
   R-CALF has hired Stewart &AMP; Stewart, a Washington, D.C., law firm
that has specialized in international trade disputes for more than
40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The group could pursue up to three avenues of complaint, said
attorney Terence Stewart, and the action will likely be filed in
September:
</P>
<P>
   _ An Anti-Dumping petition could be filed with the U.S.
Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission.
The petition would allege that Canadian beef is being sold in U.S.
markets at below-cost prices. In a briefing document, Stewart
states that his evaluation ``suggests that imports from Canada are
being sold in the U.S. at dumping margins that are significant
under U.S. law.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A Countervailing Duty petition could also be filed with the
same two federal agencies. The petition would allege that the
Canadian government is offering subsidies to growers that allow
them to export beef at below-cost prices. Stewart's analysis
``suggests there is a large number'' of such subsidies benefitting
Canadian beef exports.
</P>
<P>
   The petitions would trigger year-long investigations by the two
agencies, involving extensive research on pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Commerce officials must rule on the allegations of
dumping and unfair subsidies. International Trade Commission
officials must determine damages to the U.S. cattle industry caused
by imports.
</P>
<P>
   If both agencies see a serious problem, then Commerce officials
will direct the U.S. Customs office to collect extra import fees to
offset the dumping or subsidy margins.
</P>
<P>
   _ A complaint alleging violation of the North American Free
Trade Agreement may also be filed with the U.S. Trade
Representative. A Section 301 complaint would be aimed directly at
the Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
   If the U.S. Trade Representative's office accepts the complaint,
it would initiate talks with Canadian trade officials in hopes of
convincing the country to trade more fairly. If such a deal can't
be struck, the U.S. could impose prohibitively high tariffs on
Canadian goods, Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   The focus at present is on Canada, Kelley said, but cattle
growers are watching the southern border as well. Mexican cattle
imports are of concern, and Congress will consider this fall
whether to enact ``fast track'' legislation that would bring Brazil
and Argentina into the NAFTA free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
   Like Canada, Brazilian and Argentinian producers are looking for
a new market following the Asian economic collapse. With a high
demand for beef and few trade barriers, the U.S. market is a
logical choice.

 &HT;    Lower meat prices steer industry downhill
 &HT;    By Heather McGregor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW CASTLE, Colo. _ Barton Porter supported the North American
Free Trade Agreement, but now he feels that U.S. beef packers are
taking advantage of the open border to buy cheap Canadian cattle.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 to 1994, fat cattle sold for an all-time high of $80
to $84 a hundredweight. Since early 1997, however, the price has
stuck below $60 a hundredweight, said Porter, 74, a rancher and
feeder.
</P>
<P>
   Porter buys steers and heifers from growers all over the West.
He ships them to feedlots in Kansas where they spend about four
months fattening up on grain, and then sells them to a
slaughterhouse. He rarely sees the animals, and does his business
over the telephone, often with buyers he's never met in person.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at the kitchen table in his ranch house up Alkali Creek,
south of New Castle, Porter pulls out the balance sheets to
illustrate the financial squeeze growers and feeders are under.
</P>
<P>
   He spent from $70 to $75 a hundredweight to buy the cattle, and
they put on an average of 400 pounds in the feedlot. By the time he
pays the feedlot bill, about $250, he's got about $750 invested in
each animal.
</P>
<P>
   But at the current fat cattle price of $59 a hundredweight,
Porter is selling those cattle for about $650 a head.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cattle are losing $100 a head. We'd need a price of at
least $65 (a hundredweight) just to break even,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't correlate that exactly to the Canadian situation, but
if they couldn't buy those cattle from Canada, it would certainly
raise our price here,'' Porter said. ``I'm kind of a free trade
advocate myself, but maybe we need some government intervention to
subsidize our operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Porter does a bit more math to bring home his point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't just us taking these losses,'' he said. About 650,000
cattle are sold to slaughter every week in the U.S. At a $100 a
head loss, the nation's cattle growers are collectively losing $65
million a week.
</P>
<P>
   Porter's grandfather homesteaded on Alkali Creek in 1904. Barton
and his bride, Martha, started ranching in 1949, and they have
grown the place to 3,600 acres where they run about 600 yearlings.
The ranch's 700 irrigated acres produce 1,500 tons of hay a year.
</P>
<P>
   Porter sells hay, and he sells hunting privileges, but he admits
that the ranch doesn't make money. ``It's a lifestyle, really,'' he
said. Behind him on the kitchen counter, a dozen jars of freshly
canned apricots glow in the morning light.
</P>
<P>
   Porter's feeder trade of up to 2,200 head a year is what keeps
the place afloat, and that's why he is so concerned about the long
spate of low prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're taking $59, there's no way it will work out,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Dell passes on cheaper PCs: Too much trouble
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp. and other personal
computer makers announced several new systems recently that
incorporate the newest processors from Intel Corp., including a new
and improved chip for the sub-$1,000 market.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, however, will not use the chip to enter the fast-growing
market for computers that cost less than $1,000. It remains the
last of the major PC makers without a sub-$1,000 PC.
</P>
<P>
   The Round Rock-based company will use Intel's new Celeron chip
to help launch a new line of its Dimension computers, its consumer
and small business line, that start at $1,399. That will be Dell's
lowest-priced computer for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell also introduced its most powerful OptiPlex, the desktop
computer for large customers. It is powered by Intel's newest
Pentium II, a 450-megahertz microprocessor that is considered an
evolutionary, not revolutionary, improvement over the 400-megahertz
Pentium II. The high-end OptiPlex GX1p with the 450-megahertz
Pentium II starts at about $3,100.
</P>
<P>
   New products from Dell, Compaq Computer Corp. and others were
expected with Intel's formal announcement of the new
microprocessors, which are the brains of computers. It has become
the pattern in the industry in recent years for PC manufacturers to
base new computers on the improved processors that come once or
twice annually from Intel, whose chips run an estimated 80 percent
of PCs in use today.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, from the industry's point of view, the new processors
are accompanied by significant ``buzz'' or anticipation, such as
the intense interest that Apple Computer Inc.'s iMac has generated.
That typically translates into more sales.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation of the new offerings from Intel was relatively
modest.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, although less powerful than the Pentium II, the new
300-megahertz and 333-megahertz Celeron chips have attracted more
attention than the 450-megahertz Pentium II because the Celeron
introduced in April was a disappointment, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new chip is what the Celeron should have been to start
with,'' said Keith Diefendorff of Microprocessor Report, a
chip-industry publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had Celeron been there when it was introduced, Intel wouldn't
have lost quite as much market share in the sub-$1,000 market.''
</P>
<P>
   Microdesign Resources, the Silicon Valley firm that publishes
the newsletter, estimates that AMD had 54 percent of the budget-PC
market in June, compared with 40 percent for Intel. AMD
manufactures processors in Austin and California.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Thomsen, a researcher at Microdesign Resources, said those
estimates don't give a complete picture of the chip's sales because
many of them ended up in computers that sold for more than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the original Celeron had shortcomings, which opened the
door for AMD and Cyrix, the Dallas chip maker that is owned by
National Semiconductor Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Dell ignored it because it did not have a backside, or level 2
cache, which stores data on the chip for faster processing. The new
Celeron has 128 kilobytes of L2 cache.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what was in the pipeline,'' said Dell spokesman T.R.
Reid, explaining that Dell decided to wait until Celeron had the
cache feature before putting the chip in its computers.
</P>
<P>
   But Dell remains the sole major computer maker to eschew the
sub-$1,000 market, which accounts for an estimated 10 percent of PC
sales. Dell has long targeted more sophisticated customers who are
likely to buy more high-end machines where profit margins are
somewhat higher.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, buyers of cheaper PCs tend to be less computer

   ``It's not where our customers are taking us,'' Reid said.
``That, combined with the fact that we've got a variety of growth
opportunities, perhaps more than we can effectively manage, (means)
it becomes a matter of choices, and to focus on the higher end of
the market is an obvious choice for us.'' iDOT.com, a new Austin
company that sells PCs exclusively over the World Wide Web, offered
a $999 computer using the 300-megahertz Celeron processor. The
company offers 450-megahertz Pentium II products starting at
$1,799.

   Monitors start at $99, iDOT said.

 &HT;    Laredo prepares for flood wave on Rio Grande
 &HT;    By Laylan Copelin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Laredo braced for a fast-moving flood wave on
the Rio Grande that is expected to crest at levels at least four
times about flood stage and could close the Laredo bridge later
this week, forecasters said Monday, August 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not historic, but this is very serious flooding,'' said
Daryl Williams, a National Weather Service forecaster.
</P>
<P>
   The flood wave, which was reported to be a mile wide, will reach
34 to 36 feet at Laredo, where the river floods at 8 feet, Williams
said. ``This will be a full 15 feet below the record flood in June
of 1954, but it's still bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State, federal and Laredo officials met Monday night at City
Hall to prepare for the flood wave. At 36 feet, the crest would be
almost at the level of the international bridge spanning the Rio
Grande in downtown Laredo. It raised the possibility that the
heavily traveled thoroughfare to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, might have
to be closed.
</P>
<P>
   If floodwaters lap at bridge level, ``We'd rather take the
precaution of closing it,'' said Marco Alvarado, public information
officer for the City of Laredo. ``We're ready to take action if
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Alvarado said, authorities were warning
residents along the river banks to be prepared to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   The crest was moving Monday night and this morning through the
sparsely populated ranch country south of Eagle Pass. It must
travel about 125 miles to reach Laredo by Wednesday afternoon,
Williams projected.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's moving fast,'' said Ken Rakestraw with the
International Boundary and Water Commission. Water typically takes
2 1/2 days to travel from Eagle Pass to the Falcon Reservoir, south
of Laredo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get from Eagle Pass to Laredo in a little over a day is
fast, but that's typical for a flood wave,'' Rakestraw added.
</P>
<P>
   The floodwaters were the result of the remnants of Tropical
Storm Charley, which stalled Monday morning over the Del Rio area,
north of Eagle Pass, before moving slowly north and east during the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The computer models projected the storm would move north and
west, Williams said, ``but nothing has gone as it should.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters had expected Charley, which swept through Central
Texas over the weekend, to continue toward Mexico and West Texas,
breaking up as it went. Instead, the system stalled, dumping a
flood on ground that had been parched until rains earlier last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been dry all year, and they get all of it in one week,''
Williams said. ``If the rain stopped right now (Monday), we'd still
have problems'' in the Del Rio area.
</P>
<P>
   The International Amistad Reservoir north of Del Rio was 60 feet
below normal levels, so it absorbed floodwaters north of the city.
But nothing could stop flooding south of the international dam
toward Del Rio and Eagle Pass.
</P>
<P>
   Even rural areas were being hit hard. Sgt. Pedro Hinojosa of the
Maverick County sheriff's office said many ranch houses are built
near the river. Border Patrol helicopters were flying up and down
the Rio Grande on Monday afternoon, warning residents about the
flood wave, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reports of people stranded in trees,'' Hinojosa said.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding is worse on Mexico's side of the river, he said,
because the bank is lower.
</P>
<P>
   Ty Fain, a University of Texas at El Paso professor who has
studied the Rio Grande, said the brush country between Eagle Pass
and Laredo has few people on either side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mostly small villages, ranches and farms,'' Fain said.
``There are some pretty helpless people in those settlements. To
them, this could be a calamity.''

 &HT;    Sunbeam redesigns comeback
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ Sunbeam Corp.'s latest turnaround strategy
calls for abandoning cost-cutting plans former Chairman Al Dunlap
put in place before he was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Officer Jerry Levin said recently he will keep
open four of the eight plants Dunlap sought to close, delay the
closing of one and retain two businesses that were slated to be
sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plants are being kept open,'' Levin said, ``to ensure a
high level of quality and customer service, as well as a
consistency of supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin, who spoke to Wall Street analysts after the market
closed, said discussion of Sunbeam's financial performance would
have to wait until the company restates its results by the end of
September.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled appliance maker, whose accounting practices are
under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, has
said it will issue new numbers for 1997, the first quarter of 1998
and possibly all of 1996 as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam also faces the difficult task of selling off bloated
inventories. Levin said he expects it will take 18 months to clear
warehouses of excess grills through outlet sales and special
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenges we face in the near term are significant,''
Levin said. ``But they are more than offset by the upside of our
businesses _ the consumer is still buying our products.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have been waiting to hear from Levin since he took the
helm at Sunbeam in June, several days after the board fired Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-July Levin had assembled a new management team made up
primarily of executives who worked for him at Coleman Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly much more optimistic now, given the management
team in place, than I have been in the last 12 months,'' said
William Steele, an analyst with New York-based Buckingham Research
Group.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Steele has no plans to change his neutral outlook
on the stock, which he has rated a ``market performer.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin, who ran Coleman until Sunbeam bought the camping products
maker in March, was brought in by financier Ronald Perelman, who
became Sunbeam's second largest stockholder when he sold the
company his Coleman shares.
</P>
<P>
   The part-time Palm Beach resident will become the appliance
maker's largest investor if he exercises warrants he received this
month to buy 23 million additional shares at $7 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam issued the warrants as part of a settlement to avoid a
lawsuit from Perelman, who has seen the value of his Sunbeam
investment plummet.
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire investor got a 14 percent stake in Sunbeam in
March, when the stock (NYSE: SOC) was trading above $40 a share. It
closed Monday at $8.81, up 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   To keep employees happy, Levin said the company will allow them
to trade in stock options set at exercise prices higher than $10
share for fewer options at Perelman's price of $7 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said his options are set at exercise prices of $7, $10.50
and $14 a share. In addition, he said Sunbeam will no longer pay
shareholders a quarterly dividend of a penny a share.
</P>
<P>
   Levin attributed much of Sunbeam's problems to poor customer
service and a lack of communication between Sunbeam's sales and
manufacturing divisions, both of which reported directly to Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   ``As things would change with customers, the word literally
never made it to the manufacturing floor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Levin plans to pull back from the centralization
Dunlap had planned and give each of the company's three business
units _ outdoor leisure, household products and international _
more control and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said the company will keep open plants in Maize, Kan.;
Pocola, Okla.; Aurora, Ill.; and Acuna, Mexico. The closing of a
plant in Mexico City will be delayed three months, until December.
Sunbeam also will retain Coleman's Eastpak outdoor products
division and its Powermate compressor business, which were to be
sold.
</P>
<P>
   Levin eased analysts' concerns about the company's liquidity,
saying Sunbeam has $300 million available in cash and credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no intention of going bankrupt,'' Levin said. ``It's
in nobody's interest.''

 &HT;    Banks facing difficult times
 &HT;    By Earl Golz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After three years of record profits, Texas banks
may be headed for some turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings were still good for the state's 855 banks in the first
quarter 1998, according to the latest figures from Austin-based
bank research company Sheshunoff Information Servces Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But banks' net interest margins _ the difference between what
banks charge for loans and what they pay for deposits _ took a
nosedive during the quarter, according to Sheshunoff.
</P>
<P>
   Banks typically derive most of their profits from two sources,
fee income and interest income. The declining interest income could
be a harbinger for lower profits, said Bob Colvin, Sheshunoff's
managing director of community banking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This indication of weakness may point to more difficult times
ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The net interest margin at Texas banks dropped 40 basis points,
from 4.43 percent to 4.03 percent, in the first quarter from the
fourth quarter 1997, according to Sheshunoff.
</P>
<P>
   The margin is the lowest in the last five years, Colvin said. It
continues a steady quarterly decline since the second quarter of
1997, when Texas banks reported their third straight record
earnings at $2.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The net interest margin has declined since,'' Colvin said.
``While it was steady most of last year in the 4.40 percent to 4.50
percent range, it looks as if we have moved to another range.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 basis point decline was even greater than the decline of
33 basis points for all banks in the nation in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in interest spreads is indicative of banks'
increasing reliance on fees for everything from checking accounts
to use of tellers.
</P>
<P>
   But with more competition, some doubt whether banks can continue
to raise fees to offset the declines in interest income.
</P>
<P>
   ``With more competition, and shrinking margins, can these fees
continue to rise at a pace to offset any future declines in the net
interest margin?'' Colvin asked. ``Only time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Banking Commissioner Catherine Ghiglieri agreed that banks
are ``under a lot of pressure to reduce fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers also have a ``sense of urgency trying to book loans and
they are squeezing their margins down to almost nothing,''
Ghiglieri said. ``They are not leaving any room for any costs they
may incur in the future in terms of collection or any kind of cost
of care. So it is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As mergers and acquisitions give larger banks in Texas a larger
share of the market, pricing policies will have a depressing effect
on the rest of on the rest of the banking industry, said Steve
Scurlock, senior vice president of the Independent Bankers
Association o.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been hearing from our community banks that some of the
larger banks are doing some fairly aggressive pricing on some
lending,'' Scurlock said. ``I guess they feel like they can make up
for a loss in spread, or net interest margin, by volume.''
</P>
<P>
   Rates on loans and long term investments rates have inched
downward as deposit rates stayed steady, said Hartland Bank
Chairman David Hartman, partly the result of heightened competition
between banks. ``It's basically the state of the monetary market
and increased competition,'' said Hartman. ``Banking is always most
profitable when there is a steep yield curve, and short term rates
are low and long term rates are high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving into the exact opposite situation right now.''

 &HT;    Texas techies outnumber oilers
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN -- It's official: nerds and geeks outnumber wildcatters
and roughnecks in the Lone Star state.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the presence of two of the world's biggest personal
computer makers _ Compaq in Houston and Dell in Round Rock _
oil-and-gas still packs a bigger economic punch than high-tech. In
a study released recently, the state Comptrollers office said the
number of high-tech jobs in Texas surpassed those in the
oil-and-gas industry for the first time in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That trend is sure to continue, said Comptroller John Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``High technology has emerged as one of the main engines of
economic growth in the state,'' said Comptroller John Sharp.
``There are strong signals that our high-tech industry will become
even more dominant in the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, oil-and-gas accounted for 11 percent of the state's
economic output, while high-tech accounted for 8 percent, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of jobs, however, high tech will continue to grow
beyond oil-and-gas. The report says jobs in the five core high-tech
businesses will pass 500,000 this year year, compared to 453,599 in
oil-and-gas.
</P>
<P>
   The core businesses are: semiconductors and computers;
communications, biotechnology, defense and electrical and
electronics equipment. Sharp released the study at a press
conference at the University of Texas at Dallas. The data also are
published in the comptroller's latest Fiscal Notes newsletter. It
is available online at
http://www.window.texas.gov/comptrol/fnotes/fnhome.html.
</P>
<P>
   When two related employment areas _ technical services and
``technology-intensive manufacturing'' _ are added, then Texas
high-tech employment swells to 781,000, or about 10 percent of the
state's work force.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech workers are far better paid than the typical Texas
worker, with an average annual salary of $48,000 compared with
$28,000 for all workers, but the benefits of the high-tech
explosion in the state are, for the most part, limited to the
state's largest metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of them are in Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston,
while another 16 percent are in Austin and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas Triangle of Dallas-Forth Worth, Houston, Austin and
San Antonio are the primary beneficiaries'' of high-tech growth,
said Bernard Weinstein, director of the Center for Economic
Development at the University of North Texas. ``It's not getting
spread out to the hinterlands of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein noted that three areas tied to petroleum and
petrochemicals, Beaumont, Odessa-Midland and Galveston-Texas City,
have high jobless rates of 7.7, 5.8 and 7.1 percent respectively.
By comparison, two high-tech centers, Dallas and Austin, have
jobless rates of 3.5 and 2.9 percent. High-tech has been gaining on
the oil-and-gas industry in Texas for some time. But the
comptroller's study said that the high-tech core industries gained
more than 51,000 jobs between 1994 and 1996 to top the 454,000 jobs
statewide and surpassed Texas' oil-and-gas employment for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   If Texas can keep training workers, high-tech jobs should keep
growing in the state, Sharp said. His office projects Texas will
add 51,000 high-tech industrial jobs in the next four years. Sharp
warned that the state must continue to train more workers for
high-technology jobs or risk having its job growth slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the computer power in Texas cannot match the brain power
of our young people,'' Sharp said. ``We have to do all we can to
create a technically skilled workforce to meet industry's demand.''

tongues, and a skull and crossbones tattooed on an otherwise noble
brow. Plainly stated: Kids like to make us sweat. (Schuett, Cox

   STILLER-KINGS _ They're back! ``Seinfeld's'' Jerry Stiller stars
in ABC's ``The King of Queens.'' (Kloer, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) ETA: 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   THAT-70S-SHOW _ That '70s Show is a goofy, laugh-out-loud hoot.
As the deadpan Eric, Grace is particularly funny. The guy's blank
stares say more than three pages of dialogue. You can tell the 3rd
Rock From the Sun creators (Bonnie and Terry Turner) are behind
this often manic, live-action cartoon. (Thompson, Palm Beach Post)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   BORING-TV _ With the debut of Fox's That '70s Show and Holding
The Baby, the network TV season officially kicked off. Over the
next two months, you'll be bombarded with 34 new shows. And the
buzz on most of those shows can be summed up quite succinctly: bad.
(Thompson, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   AARON-ECKHART _ For the past year, actor Aaron Eckhart has been
receiving hate mail. His film debut as a sadistic male chauvinist
who cruelly toys with a hearing-impaired secretary in the
controversial film In the Company of Men proved too persuasive for
some moviegoers. Now, Eckhart and director Neil LaBute have teamed
up on another downbeat movie about male-female relations, Your
Friends &AMP; Neighbors. (Erstein, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MIKE-DOUGLAS _ This is the kind of scrapbook collection you
accumulate when you host 6,000 episodes of a TV talk show over 23
years. The scrapbooks were his wife's idea. Every celebrity who
spent a week co-hosting The Mike Douglas Show got a copy of photos
shot on the set. Not that the 73-year-old star needs them to
remember his five decades in the entertainment industry. (Houck,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   DOUGLAS-SHOW _ The list of guests featured on The Mike Douglas
Show reads like a ``who's who'' of Hollywood in the '60s and '70s.
(Houck, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TICKET-BOOTHS _ Waiting for half-price theater tickets at the
TKTS booth in New York not only makes economic sense, but is itself
a dose of street theater performance art. The booth has been luring
bargain hunters and keeping many a show afloat with extra revenue
for the past 25 years. (Erstein, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE
</P>
<P>
   FRENDS-N-NEIGHBORS _ Neil LaBute's chatty acid-bath ``Your
Friends &AMP; Neighbors'' is the writer-director's follow-up to last
year's savage and incendiary ``In the Company of Men.'' It's
difficult to figure which movie is more pungently, unrepentantly
vicious. (Garcia, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CATSUIT _ I'm trying to determine if a woman can go about her
day in Central Texas in a slinky one-piece getup like the one Uma
Thurman sports as Emma Peel in ``The Avengers,'' the recently
released cinematic dud. (Kelly, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   BLADE-REVIEW _ `Blade'' touts itself as a different kind of
vampire movie, and in a few small ways it is. But ``Blade'' is
similar to many vampire movies in that it's not very good. (Garcia,
Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JONG _ AUSTIN _ Twenty-five years after ``Fear of Flying,''
feminist poet Erica Jong revisits the war between the sexes in a
new book, ``What Do Women Want?'' due out in September from
HarperCollins. Its subtitles: ``Bread. Roses. Sex. Power.'' In it,
Jong dedicates a chapter to her observations on first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton. Here's a sample of what she writes about the
Clinton's political marriage: (excerpt follows). (Morris, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NEWSSTAND _ What do a vampire slayer, a birth control activist,
and a cybersex editrix have in common? They're all women, for one
thing. For another, they're on George ($2.95) magazine's list of
the ``20 Most Fascinating Women in Politics.'' (And other reviews
of this week's magazines.) (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
MOVED 8/24.
</P>
<P>
   SOUNDSHOPPING _ Look closely, and there's something for Elton
John fans of almost any age available or coming to market. For
starters, there's the lightly publicized compilation of others'
tunes that he recorded early in his career, ``16 Legendary Covers
From 1969/70.'' It includes versions of ``Up Around the Bend,''
``Love of the Common People'' and ``Spirit in the Sky.'' (DeVault,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   LIFESTYLE (l category)
</P>
<P>
   SIBLEY-COLUMN _ The two pleasantest words in our language, I'm
thinking, may be comfort and joy. Marianne Gilbert of Gainesville
sent some pages from a book she likes very much called ``Simple
Abundance, A Day Book of Comfort and Joy.'' (Sibley, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) ETA 8 p.m. ET.

   GETAWAY-HUNTSVILLE _ Taking the kids to the U.S. Space and

   SOUTHERN-FESTIVALS _ A calendar. (Thrasher, Atlanta

   CHELSEA-CLINTON _ AUSTIN _ People can only guess the impact of
her father's admission. A front-page picture of Chelsea Clinton
recently showed her holding hands with her parents, the young woman
bridging the gap between the president and his wife. And we wonder:
What is this doing to Chelsea? (Gandara, Austin American-Statesman)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   WIERD-MARRIAGES _ The lesson is old and seemingly hard to learn:
Affairs are dangerous, possibly wrong, professionally destructive
and wrenching to loved ones. Or, they may not be. Peccadilloes
march, stumble and steal hand in hand through history with the
greats, near greats and not-so-greats. ``It's a bawdy planet.''
Shakespeare, The Winter's Tale, Act I, Scene 1.(Reid, Palm Beach
Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   RANDOM-ACT _ If you are one of those people who go around
committing random acts of kindness and senseless acts of beauty out
of sheer anonymous decency, the jig might be up. Somebody might rat
you out. In fact, I keep a file on doers of good deeds, and I
encourage readers to tell on their friends. (Wiggins, Palm Beach

   RIO-GRANDE-FLOOD _ LAREDO, Texas _ Laredo braced for a
fast-moving flood wave on the Rio Grande that is expected to crest
at levels at least four times about flood stage and could close the
Laredo bridge later this week, forecasters said Monday, August 24.
``It's not historic, but this is very serious flooding,'' said
Daryl Williams, a National Weather Service forecaster. (Copelin,

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Memories of Moscow
 &HT;    (Corrects spelling of shopping center in grafs 10 and 11.7)
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russian retrospective ...
</P>
<P>
   I've made seven trips to Moscow since 1990. This last visit,
indeed, may be my last.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying I liked Moscow better under communism. But
neither do I like what it's become since the fall of communism.
</P>
<P>
   Notes from along the way:
</P>
<P>
   _ At Moscow's airport, the first greeting that visitors receive
is that of capitalism. There are now ads, in English, above the
booths where passports are checked.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prostitutes, whose prices range as high as $250, are
commonplace on Moscow streets. In the days of the Communist state,
unmarried couples weren't even allowed to check into a hotel room.
Women wrestlers, in the guise of hall attendants, made sure no one
sneaked in.
</P>
<P>
   _ So congested were the recent hordes of hookers that members of
Parliament were having to fight their way through the crowds to get
to their hotels. A special law had to be passed restricting
prostitutes to certain areas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nudity on TV, which flourished with the fall of communism, has
also been restricted and is now seen only on paid channels.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moscow has become one of the most expensive cities in the
world. Eight years ago a lavish apartment in downtown Moscow could
be had for about $50,000. The price now is closer to $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moscow's new extravagant shopping center, near Red Square, is
named Manezh in honor of the czar's palace-style stables where
aristocrats exercised their horses.
</P>
<P>
   _ When Manezh opened, crowds wandered about the mall in awe of
its opulence (including a three-story fountain flanked by glass
elevators), not unlike the Bolsheviks after they had stormed the
czar's residence.
</P>
<P>
   _ I love the Russian sayings. One that I heard for the first
time on this trip was, ``When I spoke, she looked into my mouth.''
What it means, I'm told, is that she sought my wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   _ Something I noticed about the mouths of Russians, they're
beginning to wear braces on their teeth. Nor do you see so many
people with stainless steel teeth, commonplace during Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maybe that has something to with the fact that I met a
saleslady who actually smiled, a rarity in Moscow. Most stores
operate as if they were still under communism when everyone was
treated the same _ with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beware of famous brands of liquor sold here. They're often
counterfeit. No telling what you end up drinking.
</P>
<P>
   _ A waiter, presented with my American Express card, couldn't
believe the card notation that I'd been a member since 1970. ``I
had no idea American Express had been around for so long,'' he
said, amazed.
</P>
<P>
   _ When I first visited Moscow, it was routine for a driver to
remove the vehicle's windshield wipers when leaving it parked.
Otherwise, they would likely be stolen. I noticed this trip that's
no longer the practice, which I mentioned to a Russian friend.
``Right,'' he said. ``Now they just steal still the whole car.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINSK, Belarus _ The Soviet Union has collapsed and the Moscow
nights swing nowadays, but back here in Minsk old communist-style
think is still the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of ``Pinocchio.'' The Belorussian version of the
traditional puppet show for children was yanked off the Minsk stage
not long ago when critics saw too many allusions to the current
nasty political scene in the play.
</P>
<P>
   How could a mere children's show cause so much offense in this
dictator-run land? That's easy. To begin with, Ales Surau, the set
designer, dressed the wooden ``actors'' in contemporary quilted
jackets, Russian workers' caps and workers' rubber boots.
</P>
<P>
   That act alone aroused the ire of the nation's critics. ``The
peasants look like criminals. I was at a collective farm not long
ago and I saw people there who were very well-dressed,'' one them
complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinocchio,'' or ``Lipawiczki,'' as the Belorussian version is
known, had been a big hit when it played earlier this year at the
Puppet Theater in Grodno, a provincial center that's a lot less
uptight than this rigid capital -- which is under the all-watchful
eye of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
   But when the play was shifted from Grodno to the Creative
Laboratory in the Puppet Theater here, located across from the
residence of the president, nothing apparently went right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole circle of critics came to see it,'' Surau, the
designer, recalled. ``But when they gathered there, they went into
shock. What had made people laugh in Grodno caused fear in the
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   As a backdrop for the puppets, Surau designed a three-foot
garland that bore a striking resemblance to the new Belorussian
national emblem -- a Lukashenko creation that the president had
made to replace the historical version.
</P>
<P>
   Surau added what he called ``a creative modification'' to the
new post-Soviet emblem. His garland consisted of fake bananas,
coconuts, pineapples and green tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stress the idyllic character and agricultural
significance of the performance,'' Surau said with a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   To further his rather mild anti-government parody, in the center
of the garland he placed a globe. And in the center of the globe he
painted a tractor, built by the state tractor factory and known as
``The Belorussia.''
</P>
<P>
   The tractor occupied the exact spot on the map where Minsk
should have been. And on the left side of the map was another
perceived slight: a small Catholic Church in the place of his home
town of Grodno.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the insults against the official line, the walls of
the stage were covered with the presidential newspaper ``Sovietska
Belarus,'' instead of ordinary wallpaper. And in the ``windows''
there were border posts, painted in red and green stripes, where
the actual action of the play took place.
</P>
<P>
   The performance consisted of two plots -- a play within a play.
</P>
<P>
   One plot line followed the traditional battle between good and
evil, as the wooden boy brought joy to the hearts of his father and
fought off evil in the form devilish cats. The other plot focused
on the life of a present-day Belorussian family who had lived for
70 years on a collective farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the wall of the peasant hut hung a very simple radio,''
Surau said, one which could tune in only one station.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the basic object of equipment in every village home,''
he pointedly noted. ``A few times during the play the national
anthem resounded from the radio. This same one which awakens people
every day at six in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critics were indignant that we had insulted the national
anthem. But it was really they who actually insulted it because
when they watched the performance, they never once stood up. When I
reminded them of this, they began to shout: 'You can't order us
when to stand up.'''
</P>
<P>
   The loyal critics also went ballistic over another scene that
they thought insulted Lukashenko. It depicted a peasant on the
collective farm reading the ``Sovietska Belarus'' newspaper and
thinking out loud, ``Who is the most beautiful person in our
country?'' and answering ``It's well known who.''
</P>
<P>
   After the critics complained, officials ordered the play off the
stage, supposedly to be ``polished up.'' Although the Minsk
audiences, minus the critics, loved it, the play has yet to be
revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to say whether we were dealing with critics or
censors, the outspoken Surau said. ``I guess they were critics who,
out of fear, took on the role of censors.''

   KINGSTON, Jamaica _ For years, hawkers, panhandlers, drug
dealers, and prostitutes have been as much a part of the landscape
of this Caribbean island as coconut groves and jerk chicken.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, a chorus of complaints from visitors has become so
deafening it's threatened to destroy the foundation on which
Jamaica's economy is built: tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce has come up with a
controversial solution to alleviate at least part of the problem:
legalize brothels so that red-light districts can be created.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we'd get the prostitutes off the streets,'' reasoned
Howard Hamilton, chamber president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem here and I don't think we should hide our
heads in the sand,'' he said. ``I'm not advocating prostitution,
but it's out there and we should regulate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is by far Jamaica's most valuable industry, accounting
for 45 percent of its foreign exchange, for 13.7 percent of its
$6.2 billion gross domestic product (GDP), and for one in every
four jobs.
</P>
<P>
   This island of 2.5 million people welcomed 1.9 million visitors
last year, including 700,000 cruise ship passengers. About 60
percent came from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But harassment by overzealous prostitutes, drug dealers, taxi
drivers, hair braiders and curio vendors has taken its toll in a
country that has been hit hard over the last few years by the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) -- losing dozens of foreign
businesses to lowered trade barriers between Canada, Mexico, and
the United States. After shrinking in both 1996 and 1997, Jamaica's
GDP is expected to do the same this year.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the stakes are so high for this country so bent
on protecting the new mainstay of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of tourists who visit other Caribbean countries
is expected to jump by a whopping 7 percent this year, the number
who visit Jamaica is expected to climb by a mere 1-to-2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we had three cruise ships come in here a week, but
this year we only have one a week,'' said Rijhu Jagwani, owner of
the Glad Rags store in Montego Bay. ``There's no question that
harassment has driven some tourists away, and this is hurting
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, persistent heckling threatens to ``kill the goose that
lays the golden egg,'' warned Prime Minister P.J. Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to refuse to come to Jamaica because of
harassment, resulting in a virtual collapse of the tourism industry
so that there'll be no jobs for anyone at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Holland America and Celebrity cruise lines have pulled
out of Montego Bay, partly because travelers were reporting
discomfort during their stops there.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by the Jamaica Tourist Board, 56 percent
of visitors to Jamaica last year said they'd been harassed at some
point during their stays. Of that number, 60 percent had been asked
to buy drugs and 13 percent said the incidents had spoiled their
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson has so far not commented on Hamilton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Patterson has initiated a government crackdown on
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Signs have gone up alongside many highways directed at Jamaicans
that say: ``Tourism Is Everyone's Business.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, the penalties for first-time offenders who bother
tourists to buy or barter for drugs, sex and souvenirs were raised
100-fold, from $27 to $2,700. The penalties for repeat offenders
were increased from $41 to $4,100.
</P>
<P>
   Night courts were established so that law-enforcement officers
can appear in court without having to abandon their beats.
</P>
<P>
   But while big fines might deter those with a legitimate business
who have a lot to lose, it's not clear how they will affect the
marginal players, the unemployed people trying to eke out a living
with few options to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel McCook, a spokesman for the Jamaica Tourist Board,
concedes that it's not easy to haul violators before the courts on
charges of harassment or solicitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a sensitive issue because on one hand you want to
encourage visitors to interact with average Jamaicans so that they
learn about the culture, but on the other hand you don't want
visitors to feel uncomfortable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least with red-light districts, Hamilton contends,
streetwalking prostitutes wouldn't be a bother.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's proposed that the government require medical
certification for the brothels and regular testing of the
prostitutes for sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   He said the districts could be modeled after the aptly named
Campo Alegre, or Camp of Happiness -- the government-operated
red-light district in Curacao.
</P>
<P>
   As a Dutch possession, prostitution is legal on that island and
is regulated by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Located on a hill near the airport, Campo Alegre resembles a
prison camp, and is guarded by policemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaica Council of Churches has blasted Hamilton's proposal,
issuing a statement that instructs chamber members to ask
themselves whether they would recommend prostitution for their own
sons and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamilton argues that with unemployment already nearing 20
percent, drastic action is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an economic situation in this country where people
are desperate to find jobs so of course they flock to the tourist
areas because it's the only place they can make money, but they're
scaring away the tourists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Making people even more desperate is the rising popularity of
all-inclusive resorts. Tourists tend to tether themselves there and
not make themselves available to the hawkers and small business
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``People offering things are more assertive now,'' McCook said.
``The manner of selling has gotten more offensive.''

 &HT;    IN OLD-STYLE COMMUNIST BELARUS, CENSORS PUSH 'PINOCCHIO' OFF

<P>
   MINSK, Belarus _ The Soviet Union has collapsed and the Moscow
nights swing nowadays, but back here in Minsk old communist-style
think is still the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of ``Pinocchio.'' The Belorussian version of the
traditional puppet show for children was yanked off the Minsk stage
not long ago when critics saw too many allusions to the current
nasty political scene in the play.
</P>
<P>
   How could a mere children's show cause so much offense in this
dictator-run land? That's easy. To begin with, Ales Surau, the set
designer, dressed the wooden ``actors'' in contemporary quilted
jackets, Russian workers' caps and workers' rubber boots.
</P>
<P>
   That act alone aroused the ire of the nation's critics. ``The
peasants look like criminals. I was at a collective farm not long
ago and I saw people there who were very well-dressed,'' one them
complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinocchio,'' or ``Lipawiczki,'' as the Belorussian version is
known, had been a big hit when it played earlier this year at the
Puppet Theater in Grodno, a provincial center that's a lot less
uptight than this rigid capital -- which is under the all-watchful
eye of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
   But when the play was shifted from Grodno to the Creative
Laboratory in the Puppet Theater here, located across from the
residence of the president, nothing apparently went right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole circle of critics came to see it,'' Surau, the
designer, recalled. ``But when they gathered there, they went into
shock. What had made people laugh in Grodno caused fear in the
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   As a backdrop for the puppets, Surau designed a three-foot
garland that bore a striking resemblance to the new Belorussian
national emblem -- a Lukashenko creation that the president had
made to replace the historical version.
</P>
<P>
   Surau added what he called ``a creative modification'' to the
new post-Soviet emblem. His garland consisted of fake bananas,
coconuts, pineapples and green tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stress the idyllic character and agricultural
significance of the performance,'' Surau said with a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   To further his rather mild anti-government parody, in the center
of the garland he placed a globe. And in the center of the globe he
painted a tractor, built by the state tractor factory and known as
``The Belorussia.''
</P>
<P>
   The tractor occupied the exact spot on the map where Minsk
should have been. And on the left side of the map was another
perceived slight: a small Catholic Church in the place of his home
town of Grodno.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the insults against the official line, the walls of
the stage were covered with the presidential newspaper ``Sovietska
Belarus,'' instead of ordinary wallpaper. And in the ``windows''
there were border posts, painted in red and green stripes, where
the actual action of the play took place.
</P>
<P>
   The performance consisted of two plots -- a play within a play.
</P>
<P>
   One plot line followed the traditional battle between good and
evil, as the wooden boy brought joy to the hearts of his father and
fought off evil in the form devilish cats. The other plot focused
on the life of a present-day Belorussian family who had lived for
70 years on a collective farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the wall of the peasant hut hung a very simple radio,''
Surau said, one which could tune in only one station.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the basic object of equipment in every village home,''
he pointedly noted. ``A few times during the play the national
anthem resounded from the radio. This same one which awakens people
every day at six in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critics were indignant that we had insulted the national
anthem. But it was really they who actually insulted it because
when they watched the performance, they never once stood up. When I
reminded them of this, they began to shout: 'You can't order us
when to stand up.'''
</P>
<P>
   The loyal critics also went ballistic over another scene that
they thought insulted Lukashenko. It depicted a peasant on the
collective farm reading the ``Sovietska Belarus'' newspaper and
thinking out loud, ``Who is the most beautiful person in our
country?'' and answering ``It's well known who.''
</P>
<P>
   After the critics complained, officials ordered the play off the
stage, supposedly to be ``polished up.'' Although the Minsk
audiences, minus the critics, loved it, the play has yet to be
revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to say whether we were dealing with critics or
censors, the outspoken Surau said. ``I guess they were critics who,
out of fear, took on the role of censors.''
</P>

Wyborcza,'' a leading Polish newspaper published in Warsaw and

anywhere else around here, so it might as well be the last.)
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the spot that had drawn his attention, I rolled down my
window and yelled, ``It's falling apart! That's rust!''
</P>
<P>
   The man, who is about my dad's age and often wears Bermuda
shorts on the job, stopped scraping. He walked around to my open
window and flashed a mischievous but genteel smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was bird doodie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I replied that I wished that was all it was.
</P>
<P>
   The man who runs the last drive-through car wash on Earth fixed
me with a stern look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it run?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Touche. I nodded and grinned.
</P>
<P>
   The man squirted special cleaner on my tires and pointed to his
own automobile parked behind the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought that new in '77,'' he said of a large, two-toned
luxury model from the Ford Motor Co. ``It's just about gone. But it
runs. And I drive it to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he released the conveyor belt that would pull me and my
12-year-old Civic through the one-minute automatic car wash, the
man and I talked about the price of new cars today. We agreed that,
barring some unforeseen shift in our finances, both of us had
bought our last new car.
</P>
<P>
   Which was maybe a little sad but not the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come in here with a $40,000 car, and I look _ they've
got dings and dents all over or they've been keyed all the way from
one end to the other,'' the man said. ``I don't know how you could
stand that.''
</P>
<P>
   As the conveyor began to pull me into the car wash, I waved
goodbye and settled back to listen to the prelude to Richard
Wagner's ``Parsifal'' on my radio. While soap suds covered the
windshield, I thought about how much pleasure this one-person
enterprise had given me over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   On the practical level, for the price of a glass of ordinary
wine, I got the soot-covered, plum-spotted, bird-doodied exterior
of my old, rust-marked car washed and dried. And I got it done in
less time than it takes to brush my teeth.
</P>
<P>
   But on another level, I got something much more important.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the $40,000 cars have dings, dents and key lines, they
always look pretty darn nice. When the people who drive such cars
turn them over to a valet parker, they never see his lip curl in
disgust or hear him say, ``Oh, uhhh-huh,'' because they've informed
him that there's a little trick to turning off the headlights.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have to watch at a regular car wash while a
half-dozen guys with drying rags avoid their cars and look all over
for any other car they can possibly find to wipe down. If someone
scrapes at a spot with a rag mop on the roof of their cars, the
only thing that comes off is the spot, not part of the roof.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, such people are accustomed to having their cars
treated with respect, admiration even. To them, the man who runs
the last drive-through car wash on Earth is probably just a nice
guy who gets them in and out for a quick, cheap wash.
</P>
<P>
   To me, though, he is a man of vision. He looks at a faded
hatchback that came over on the boat the same year the Iran-contra
scandal broke and Ivan Boesky was indicted for insider trading, and
he sees a great little car. A car worthy of washing. A car that
runs.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Tuppers' Hop Pocket Pils a bit of domestic nobility
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 27: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Driving through the German Rhineland, you see a vertically oval
green sign in every village and town you come to. On the sign you
read, in spare but elegant script, the word ``Pils.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign is the logo for Bitburger, from the town of Bitburg,
and ``Pils'' is a diminutive of pilsener, the lager style that
takes its name from Pilsen in the Czech republic. To most
Americans, ``pilsener'' (or ``pilsner'') is synonymous with cheap
six-pack beer poured from an aluminum pop-top can. A majority of
the beers throughout the world, in fact, are distant derivatives of
the style _ so distant that all resemblance has been lost. The term
has been bastardized to mean any golden lager. A parallel
circumstance in the United States used to be California ``chablis''
in those strawbound jugs. The real thing, originating from the
Burgundian town of Chablis, was a different wine altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, a real pils is among beer's nobility, assertive
and delicate at the same time. But few Americans have ever tasted
one.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is to introduce what might be the best domestic
example of the style. Tuppers' Hop Pocket Pils, brewed by Old
Dominion, arrived in the Atlanta market only a month after the gold
medal-winning Tuppers' Hop Pocket Ale sold out almost everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The two beers could hardly be more different. Where Hop Pocket
Ale is aromatic and bracingly bitter, with a long, lingering
finish, Hop Pocket Pils is crisp and dry, firm on the palate and
softly floral to the nose. Both are beers to be savored, not
guzzled. But savoring the one is a different experience from
savoring the other, just as a superior white wine is different from
a superior red.
</P>
<P>
   For the person unacquainted with ales, Hop Pocket Pils is the
more accessible of the two. At 35 to 40 International Bitterness
Units, Tuppers' is three times as assertive as Budweiser, but only
two-thirds the hopping rate of Hop Pocket Ale.
</P>
<P>
   But the flavor profile more than the IBUs defines a beer _ the
nature of the yeast, the quality of the barley, the interplay of
malt and hop. Tuppers' is a model of pils perfection. It pours into
the glass golden and slightly hazy, forming a rich, foamy head. The
Saaz hops, a trademark of the best pilseners, create a bouquet
that's detectable but not emphatic. On the palate, it's soft at the
outset, with a malty firmness in the middle and a satisfying
crispness at the finish. This is what a good German pils tastes
like.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, you won't find many in Germany as complex as
this. The more familiar imported brands _ notably Beck's,
Warsteiner, Veltin's, St. Pauli Girl _ come nowhere close. The much
overrated Heineken, brewed in the Netherlands and loosely in the
pilsener style, is even further removed.
</P>
<P>
   Bitburger is among the better German pilseners, but not as
assertive as some and not as characterful as Tuppers'. The one
German pils I'm familiar with that's comparable _ though not
identical _ is Jever, and I've never seen that beer in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Czech pilseners tend to be softer, less dry than the German
style. But for an American consumer the important consideration has
to be freshness. Pilsner Urquell, the original, is justly
celebrated, but it does not travel well. (In my experience, the
chances of getting a Pilsner Urquell that has oxidized approach 50
percent.)
</P>
<P>
   With any true pils _ German, Czech or domestic _ you look for an
almost perfect balance of malt and hops, and a finish that subtly
accentuates the latter. It is a beer best enjoyed alone or with
mild to moderately strong cheeses. But it also, like a fine
Chablis, accompanies white-meat fish well.
</P>
<P>
   ``An elderly emigre in Canada,'' Michael Jackson writes in the
``Beer Companion,'' ``once told me that his most evocative memory
from his homeland was of buying on the streets of Prague live carp
from the lakes near Trebon, and cooking the fish like schnitzels to
be served with Pilsner beer for Christmas dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   If you've not had carp for Christmas, you've probably not missed
much. But when you taste a pils like Tuppers', you realize there's
a world of beer you knew nothing about.

 &HT;    Enjoy the taste of the classic combo in sandwiches, salads and
even pizza
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 27: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker

<P>
   Making the perfect BLT can be as simple as assembling the
ingredients. Of course, it can be more complex than that, as well.
Take a few extra minutes to make a garlic-pesto mayonnaise to add
even more layers of flavor. Or use grilled green tomatoes instead
of red ones just off the vine.
</P>
<P>
   This combination that works so well for sandwiches can work for
other dishes, too, like salads, canapes and even pizza. With all,
the key is to assemble the freshest ingredients possible.
</P>
<P>
   A word about preparing the bacon. The tried-and-true way is to
fry it in a skillet, preferably a cast-iron one. But cooking it in
the microwave is popular too and certainly does the trick.
</P>
<P>
   There's one more option you may try _ baking it. Now, this
method takes more time but leaves your stovetop free and doesn't
require constant supervision. Simply place the bacon strips on a
broiler or cookie sheet and bake at 300 degrees for about 25
minutes or until crisp. You may want to turn the bacon once during
the process.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit in this technique is that you can dredge the bacon
in a coating first. Try pouring cornmeal or flour or a mixture of
flour and brown sugar onto a plate and simply coat each strip with
the dry ingredients, then place on the pan and bake. This method
adds texture, flavor and fun to an old favorite.

   What a delicious way to give new life to stale bread! Grilling
it first adds a slightly smoky flavor, though if you're not
planning to fire up the grill, you wouldn't lose much by toasting
it. (Not surprisingly, this is adapted from a recipe from the Weber
grill folks.) Serve it as a main course or as a side dish at a
picnic buffet.
</P>
<P>
   6strips bacon
</P>
<P>
   Scant 2/3 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons red wine vinegar
</P>

</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   4cups mixed salad greens
</P>
<P>
   In a skillet over medium heat, fry bacon until crispy; transfer
to paper towels to drain. In a glass measuring cup, combine 2
tablespoons bacon fat and enough olive oil to make 2/3 cup.
</P>
<P>
   In a small mixing bowl, combine vinegar, lemon juice, mustard
and garlic. Whisk in olive oil/bacon fat mixture. Taste the
dressing and season with salt and pepper. Place bread in center of
cooking grate to toast. Be careful _ the bread will blacken
quickly. Cut the toasted bread into 1-inch cubes. In a large mixing
bowl, combine bread with all but about 1/4 cup of the dressing. Let
bread sit for 30 minutes. To serve, toss the bread with the
tomatoes, red onion and parsley. Spread the salad greens on a
serving platter, drizzle with reserved dressing and top with the
bread salad. Crumble reserved bacon on top of bread and serve
immediately.

   1 1/2cups mozzarella cheese, shredded
</P>
<P>
   1cup provolone cheese, shredded
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a
skillet and saute onion, red pepper and yellow pepper until tender,
about 15 minutes. Fry the bacon in a skillet and let drain on a
paper towel. Save 1 tablespoon of the bacon drippings and combine
with 1 tablespoon olive oil in a Dutch oven or saute pan. Add the
chopped collard greens and saute until tender, about 20 minutes.
(Don't overcook.) Spread the tomato sauce on the pizza crust. Put
the collard greens on top of sauce, then layer the onions and
peppers, bacon and basil. Top with the shredded mozzarella and
provolone cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 20-25 minutes, until bubbly and browned. Let stand for
5 minutes before slicing.

   I'll sound the salt alert right now. The bacon, the cheese and
the olives all have their share. But the overall flavors blend
nicely here and this is fairly quick to assemble. Again, we cheated
on the ``L'', using spinach instead of lettuce.

 &HT;    Classic combination is sandwich of the season when its
ingredients are in perfect balance
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 27: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, the best things come in threes.
</P>
<P>
   Curly, Larry and Moe were the trinity of slapstick comedy.
Peter, Paul and Mary sang in perfect three-part harmony.
</P>
<P>
   The supreme trio of summer has to be bacon, lettuce and tomato.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of another combination that really does the
trick like BLT,'' says Damon Lee Fowler, author of ``Beans, Greens
and Sweet Georgia Peaches'' and ``Classic Southern Cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler remembers as a child getting dressed up in Sunday best
and going downtown with his grandmother to the Woolworth lunch
counter. While the crowd and conversation varied with each visit,
his lunch selection was always the same: the BLT.
</P>
<P>
   The trio has been the darling of the diner for decades because
it's so simple and inexpensive. And the diner tradition of creating
slang names for foods is probably how we came to know the sandwich
by its initials, according to John Mariani's ``Dictionary of
American Food and Drink.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to a good BLT, according to Fowler, is to have all three
ingredients in perfect balance. ``You want as much bacon as the
sandwich will hold, but it shouldn't overpower the tomato,'' he
advises.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that balance, let's break the triumvirate down:
</P>
<P>
   B: The bacon is the meat of the matter, providing not only
robust pork (usually) flavor but also a good shot of salt to the
formula.
</P>
<P>
   To get the lowdown on bacon, we turned to Sean Daniels,
organizer of Atlanta's annual Baconfest, which started as a reason
to have a party in college and now serves as a fund-raiser for
Dad's Garage Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice that in the late '90s we can admit, without fear,
that there are people out there who love bacon,'' said Daniels,
noting they went through 170 pounds of bacon at this month's event.
``We served bacon in piles, where bars normally have bowls of
peanuts. And we had a place where folks can make their own BLTs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some like it crisp, some chewy. Some folks have a high tolerance
for fat; others want only lean, center-cut bacon. And that's just
the beginning of the choices out there: applewood-smoked,
hickory-smoked, maple-flavored, turkey, veggie, low-sodium and
precooked. (For comparisons, see our handy chart inside.)
</P>
<P>
   To bacon lovers, of course, many of the options are not an
option. ``Healthy bacon is an oxymoron,'' Fowler says, showing
particular disdain for low-sodium, which he said often has too much
sugar. Daniels calls veggie bacon ``facon'' and wouldn't allow
little at a time, and whisk until of spreading consistency.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble: Arrange one layer on a cake plate. Carefully peel
off the wax paper. Spread 2/3 of the marmalade over the top,
smoothing it into an even layer. Invert the remaining layer onto
the top of the first layer, peel off the wax paper and spoon the
remaining marmalade onto the center of it, leaving a 1 1/4-inch
border around the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Frost the sides and top border area with the frosting, leaving
the marmalade on top of the cake exposed. Or, if you prefer, frost
the entire cake, adding the marmalade as a garnish atop. Chill for
at least 2 hours before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Per serving: 581 calories, 6 grams protein, 26 grams fat
(percent calories from fat, 41), 84 grams carbohydrates, 149
milligrams cholesterol, 199 milligrams sodium.

 &HT;    A really, really serious orange marmalade cake
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 27: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We weren't optimistic last month when Margarett Kinton of
Roswell, Georgia asked for the prize-winning orange marmalade cake
recipe referred to in Jan Karon's Mitford novels. They are, after
all, novels, and that presumably means the recipe would be
fictional, too.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. At about the same time, in its July edition, Victoria
magazine published a recipe it called ``Esther's Orange-Marmalade
Layer Cake.'' The magazine had commissioned Atlanta chef Scott
Peacock to create a cake in the fashion of the fiction. Many
readers saw the recipe and sent it along.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, others dug into their cookbooks and recipe boxes and
came up with a dozen marmalade cakes or breads. The chef-created
one given below is fairly complicated, so we'll follow it up with
one of the easier ones next week in the Mitford Cakes, Chapter 2.

<P>
   DESSERT
</P>
<P>
   Esther's
</P>
<P>
   Orange-Marmalade Layer Cake
</P>
<P>
   Makes 12 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: about 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooling time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Chilling time: 2 hours
</P>
<P>
   CAKE:
</P>
<P>
   3cups cake flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   2cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   3large eggs, at room temperature, beaten lightly
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon grated orange zest
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2teaspoons vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1cup buttermilk, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   ORANGE SYRUP:
</P>
<P>
   1cup freshly squeezed orange juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   FILLING:
</P>
<P>
   1cup orange marmalade
</P>
<P>
   FROSTING:
</P>
<P>
   3/4cup well-chilled heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   3/4cup well-chilled sour cream
</P>
<P>
   For the cake: Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Butter two 9-inch
round cake pans and line them with parchment or wax paper. Butter
and flour the paper, shaking out the excess.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, sift the flour, baking soda and salt. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, beat butter with an electric mixer until
creamed. Add the sugar, a little at a time, and beat until light
and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, orange zest and vanilla. Beat in 1/3
of the dry ingredients, then 1/2 of the buttermilk, until combined
well. Add half the remaining dry ingredients, then the remaining
buttermilk and then the last of the dry ingredients, beating until
smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the batter evenly into the pans, smoothing the surface.
Rap each pan on the counter to expel any air pockets or bubbles,
then place in the oven. Bake for 45 minutes or until a cake tester
inserted into the center comes out clean. Place pans on wire racks
to cool for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For the orange syrup: In a bowl, stir together the orange juice
and sugar until sugar is dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   With a toothpick or wooden skewer, poke holes at 1/2-inch
intervals in the cake layers and spoon the syrup over each layer,
allowing the syrup to be completely absorbed before adding any
remaining syrup. Let layers cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   For the filling: In a small saucepan set over moderate heat,
heat the marmalade until just melted. Let cool 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For the frosting: In a bowl, whisk the heavy cream with the
sugar until it forms firm peaks. Add the sour cream, a little at a
time, and whisk until of spreading consistency.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble: Arrange one layer on a cake plate. Carefully peel
off the wax paper. Spread 2/3 of the marmalade over the top,
smoothing it into an even layer. Invert the remaining layer onto
the top of the first layer, peel off the wax paper and spoon the
remaining marmalade onto the center of it, leaving a 1 1/4-inch
border around the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Frost the sides and top border area with the frosting, leaving
the marmalade on top of the cake exposed. Or, if you prefer, frost
the entire cake, adding the marmalade as a garnish atop. Chill for
at least 2 hours before serving.

STOCKING UP ON CHAMPAGNE FOR THE YEAR 2000 PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Last week, San Francisco's KRON-TV took a break
between presidential sex scandals and war with terrorists to warn
of a possibly worse disaster to come, the ``Y2K problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The station ran footage of the Marina burning, tap water drying
up, Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric switchboards flipping off and ATMs
refusing to show us the money.
</P>
<P>
   Then the news report got really scary. KRON's reporter warned
that our microwaves and toasters could shut down, too.
</P>
<P>
   Horrors. We'll have to eat room-temperature bread and real
popcorn, actually shaken in pans on the stove.
</P>
<P>
   What would cause a disaster of this magnitude? Hydrogen bombs
going off in the upper atmosphere?
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco government taking over the world? No, civilization
supposedly may crash because of the ``Y2K problem.'' ``Y2K'' stands
for ``the year 2000.'' The problem, also known as ``the millennium
bug,'' is that when big mainframe computers were built in the '60s
and '70s, engineers saved valuable storage space by giving them
clocks with years recorded only by their last two digits.
</P>
<P>
   Thus when 1999 turns into 2000, those clocks will flip back to
1900.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be so bad to have a chance to do this century over.
However, we could face worldwide computer breakdowns, according to
consultants who are trying to sell their services to solve those
computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of companies are selling Y2K services. There are fewer
than 500 shopping days until 2000, and after that no big computer
clock problems to fix until we get five-digit years.
</P>
<P>
   You bet. I'm going to call a $250-an-hour consultant to reset my
microwave. My microwave doesn't know what year it is, and my
toaster isn't run by a mainframe computer.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a team of salespeople from the Symantec Corp. stopped
by the San Francisco Examiner to pitch their Norton 2000 software,
designed to spot Y2K problems in small-business desktop computers,
which the company says are vulnerable to confusion about which
century they are entering.
</P>
<P>
   When computer hardware and software knows it's entering 2000,
and not the year of McKinley's re-election, it's called ``Y2K
compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Symantec brochure gives two opinions about the Y2K problem.
Sen. Robert F. Bennett, R-Utah, is quoted as saying it could bring
down financial markets and telecommunications. Heck, the Russians
can do that without the help of computers.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech writer Robert X. Cringely is quoted as saying his best
advice is to simply withdraw a big wad of cash, because ATM
machines may fail.
</P>
<P>
   Symantec product manager Tom Andrus said the magnitude of the
problem probably lies in between _ in desktop hardware and
software, where Symantec can fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   As KRON, its reporter said the Federal Reserve will provide
millions of dollars of extra cash. KRON warned us to be prepared
for fire, water shortages, power failures and shutdown of public
transit and public safety services.
</P>
<P>
   If KRON was trying to scare me, it didn't work. This is the San
Francisco Bay area, where every year brings disaster.
</P>
<P>
   I've had power outages lasting as long as six days, and lost my
water four times in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   I'm used to public transit not working.
</P>
<P>
   I don't expect cops or firefighters to come in case of a major
disaster. I've been through a 7.1 earthquake, and know they tend to
get occupied elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   I keep batteries, water and food on hand, and always have a wad
of cash hidden somewhere because I suffered through the legendary
ATM blackout (I mean, green-non-out) following the quake of '89.
Not being able to buy a beer in a bar is the problem I worry about,
not whether global telecommunications work.
</P>
<P>
   The stock exchange and many corporations have fixed the clocks
in their computers, but Andrus of Symantec said the government
might have problems. His direst prediction was that the IRS would
have no Y2K compliance problems. We'll have to remain taxation
compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Y2K led to that cruise-missile attack against terrorists
last week. Maybe the Pentagon had to use those missiles before
their clocks ran out.
</P>
<P>
   To me, the Y2K problem is the why-to-care problem, and not just
because I'm semi-prepared for the Earth to move and return us to
1906 _ the heck with 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Americans, I live in good times and expect the worst.
</P>
<P>
   The Symantec marketing team showed how pension software could
get confused at the beginning of 2000. Frankly, I don't expect ever
to see a pension, or Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Neither do I care if the Y2K problem ruins health care records.
You can't get an appointment with a doctor anyway.
</P>
<P>
   One thing we don't have to worry about, according to the man
from Symantec, is the Internet crashing because of its built-in
redundancy. No, that doesn't refer to all the repetitive Monica
jokes and ads offering to make computers Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not about to take to the hills in case the world's computers
crash. I already live in the hills, and the computers at work crash
every day.
</P>
<P>
   All I worry about is the world Champagne shortage at the turn of
the millennium. I'm stockpiling Taittinger, and even saying yes to
Kornell and Korbel. That's my Y2K problem.

FOR CONGRESS, A WAY OUT OF THE QUAGMIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Trent Lott started it back in March. He got no
bandwagon rolling _ the Senate majority leader rarely does _ but
the idea of Congress officially condemning President Clinton's
behavior, assuming it doesn't include an actual and proved abuse of
his office, such as obstruction of justice, has hung around.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, it is not gaining ground, but it has gained some
attention. It deserves to gain more, as long as various carts are
not placed before various horses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the somewhat increased level of attention for
what shorthand is calling a ``censure'' of Clinton, what I find
most interesting is that the topic is being discussed way up the
president's chain of command. That's far from official, or even an
indication of his own views, but it is plenty interesting and trial
balloons have flown with a lot less helium than that.
</P>
<P>
   From this perspective, censure stinks, if by that is meant a
distinct measure drafted and approved by both houses of Congress.
But there are other ways of skinning the same cat.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the only use of censure on a president in
American history left an aroma that is still around. In 1834, a
Whig-controlled Senate formally censured President Andrew Jackson
for a controversial use of power regarding a giant bone of
contention in those days, the national bank. Jackson rightly
accused his Whig opponents of lacking the guts to impeach him, and
when they lost the Senate two years later, the censure was promptly
withdrawn. No one has seriously attempted such a stunt since.
</P>
<P>
   For another, a motion of censure would set weird, if not bad
precedents. Since the grounds would presumably be an appalling
sexual liaison with a young woman and an effort to keep it secret
that included lying to the public, the question would arise if that
is the standard for such an action Congress means to set. What
about other presidential lies, for example, and what about other
examples of lies with huge public consequences (like the Vietnam
War) that get de facto grandfather status?
</P>
<P>
   There's still a way, however. The independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, is finally on the verge of presenting evidence to the House
of Representatives. Assuming for discussion that there is no
direct, dramatic, and unquestionable proof of obstruction or
subornation of perjury that could overcome the public's
overwhelming antipathy to further proceedings, the Congress (even
though it doesn't have to) could vote to ``accept'' Starr's report.
And in the measure accepting Starr's report, it could include
language condemning the president's behavior. That limits it to
this case.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage is that it would give official voice to genuine
feelings of horror and worse that people have about Clinton's
admitted conduct.
</P>
<P>
   It is still early for this, though not too early to have a few
decent ideas on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the president remains in seclusion with his
family, a delicate and properly private process that must still be
resolved before anything else matters. Clinton may also need a
similar process to see if he can repair relations with his official
and political families.
</P>
<P>
   He also will need to say more to the public than he did last
week to truly deliver the three Cs his chief of staff, Erskine
Bowles, falsely advertised his brief speech as about to deliver _
confession, contrition, and closure.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest short-term casualty of those remarks was the anger
of the very Republicans poised to try to find a way past this mess
_ Orrin Hatch in the Senate, and Judiciary Committee chairman Henry
Hyde himself in the House _ and who have said Congress should not
proceed toward even an inquiry into possible impeachment on the
sole basis of a sex and sex-lies case.
</P>
<P>
   That stance, if maintained, would probably split Republicans,
many of whom insist that the president go or be tossed out of
office. Even those leaders who have no stomach for a sex-based case
_ like Newt Gingrich himself and chairman Gerald Solomon of the
Rules Committee _ talk of expanding a Starr report on the Monica
Lewinsky affair into a reinvestigation of everything the prosecutor
has already investigated in his four-plus year, even if he has
found no evidence of impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Out of respect for the public's views and to avoid that kind of
madness, this may be a matter that cries out for responsible
settlement, unless the pure facts in Starr's report clearly
indicate otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   But first, we all need a signal from the first family. In one of
the least-noticed, most direct sections of his speech, the
president said, ``I must put it right, and I am prepared to do
whatever it takes to do so.''

FOR JAPANESE WOMEN, ATTITUDES CHANGE AT HOME, WORK

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; TOKYO -- Not long ago, unmarried women in Japan were referred
to only half-jokingly as ``Christmas Cake'' _ as in, no good after
their 25th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Even educated women were expected to get a job in order to find
a husband, and quit to rear children. Women who did have jobs
outside the home were still expected to carry the full burden of
housework.
</P>
<P>
   But like many attitudes in Japan, that is changing. A government
report released last month revealed that Japanese women are
marrying later (average age 26.6), staying single in record numbers
(5.1 percent), divorcing more (last year, 222,650), and having
fewer children, in large part because of a desire to pursue
careers. A record number _ 78.5 percent _ now want to continue
working after marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're coming out of a top university with the right degree
and qualifications, whether you're a man or a woman matters very
little today,'' said Mariko Fujiwara, research director at the
Hakuhodo Institute of Life and Living, a Tokyo think tank. ``If
anything, women are becoming more like men,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The deepest recession in 23 years in Japan is helping to speed
that change. As more men lose jobs to the worst labor market since
World War II, more wives are re-entering or staying in the
workplace as a matter of economic necessity.
</P>
<P>
   The economic downturn is also paving the way for shifts in
attitudes among employers and voters frustrated with old ways of
doing business and running government. Executives are starting to
revise the traditional Japanese management model now that it is no
longer seen as infallible, and with that overhaul, traditional
prejudices against hiring women are diminishing.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, citizens fed up with old-style politics are
turning to new parties _ and women candidates _ as alternatives. In
July's Upper House parliamentary elections, the long-ruling and
male-dominated Liberal Democratic Party got trounced, while women
won almost one in every five seats _ a record.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, women remain a minority in office _ just 4.8
percent of the powerful Lower House _ far below most European
countries and even lower than the relatively paltry 12.6 percent of
women in the US House. Japan ranks 84th out of 179 nations in terms
of the number of women in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic advances for women have been in the workplace,
and in the way that values are changing to accommodate, or promote,
women pursuing careers.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, the number of Japanese working women has risen more
than 22 percent, according to the Ministry of Labor, with four of
every 10 workers female. Sixty-three percent of working-age women
are employed outside the home today. (In the United States the
figure is a little more than 70 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, because of societal pressures against women working
after marriage, only one in three women employees were married;
today, nearly 60 percent are.
</P>
<P>
   Age is perhaps the biggest factor in attitudes here, and the
more progressive views of the younger generation suggest that a
change that was long incremental will snowball. Numerous Japanese
twentysomethings interviewed for this report say they reject the
``samurai capitalism'' of their parents' era that forced men to
devote themselves to work and ignore family, while wives served at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Sayaka Iwai, 23, is a television reporter whose mother didn't
work and whose father worked so much that he hardly was at home.
Still, her parents encouraged her to pursue a high-powered career,
and both they and her boyfriend support her plans to work after
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   She loves her job, but is unsure if it will pay off with a happy
life. ``I'll never be sure if my choice is right. I could be posted
in Okinawa for a year, in Hokkaido for three years. What man will
want to marry me then?''
</P>
<P>
   There may be more than she thinks. Societal mores have shifted
dramatically this decade. In 1990, 43 percent of women and 34
percent of men disagreed with the statement that ``men should work
and women should stay at home,'' according to a survey by the prime
minister's office. Five years later, 54 percent of women and 40
percent of men rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Daisuke Nishikawa, 27, who works in personnel for a Japanese
trading company, says not only would he have no problem with his
wife working outside the home, but he thinks that ``raising
children and having families'' is just as important for men as a
successful career. ``Somebody has to take that role, and it doesn't
matter whether it's the husband or the wife,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nishikawa is by no means alone. Goro Hokari, 26, who works at an
advertising agency, said he wants to marry a career woman ``because
I work till midnight, so if my wife is only housekeeping, she may
feel alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariko Bando, 51, vice-governor of Saitama Prefecture and the
highest-ranking woman in local government, recalls years of
sleeping just three hours a night when she had children, a husband,
and a government career to nuture. She criticizes Japan's lifelong
seniority system that grants promotions based on years of service _
excluding women who take time off for families.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, she says the prolonged economic slump this
decade proves the traditional Japanese management model is
outmoded. ``People are valued not for their achievement, but for
how much they sacrifice their private lives,'' she said. That
``must change through drastic upheaval of the economic system.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujiwara adds that as Japanese firms lose business to other
countries, they realize they can't afford ``not to hire the best
and the brightest women.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies will also be forced to hire more women because Japan's
birthrate is so low and its population aging so rapidly that there
won't be enough men to fill all jobs. By 2007, the population will
start declining.
</P>
<P>
   The already low birthrate of 1.39 children per woman is expected
to dip even further as more women defer marriage and avoid having
children, because husbands don't help at home and employers don't
allow flexible schedules. Working wives spend 4.2 hours a day on
housework, while their working husbands spend only 21 minutes,
according to a government survey released last month.
</P>
<P>
   That has meant that until now, most women could only make it to
the top by sacrificing family life. Only 8.2 percent of Japanese
managers are women, compared with 43 percent in the United States.
Sixty percent of female managers here are unmarried and only 25
percent have children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government should enact laws to help women, but they don't
because they are influenced by employers'' who prefer to hire women
at lower cost, said Ikuro Takagi, professor of social policy at
Japan Women's University.
</P>
<P>
   The average women's wage here is 63 percent of men's, compared
with the United States, where it is 80 percent. Women are not
unionized or politically organized, and that hasn't helped either.
</P>
<P>
   The 1985 Equal Opportunity Law recommended hiring without bias,
but imposed no penalties on employers who didn't. The law was
amended recently to ban discrimination and remove limits on women
working the same overtime hours as men, but there are still no
sanctions for noncompliance, said Jay Siegel, a lecturer at the
John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University who
specializes in Japanese workplace practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are bumping up against the bamboo ceiling,'' he said.
The old anti-discrimination law was ``a toothless tiger... and it
remains toothless'' with no penalties. In the 10 years after the
1985 law took effect, only 11 cases went to mediation under the
law, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some landmark cases fought under different laws,
such as a ruling in which a municipal government was ordered to
reinstate a woman with back pay after firing her for refusing to
report to work early to serve tea 10 times a day, in addition to
her secretarial duties.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more importantly, more women are trying to have
both careers and families today and are finding men to cooperate.
``People of both sexes need to have options. That's the ideal
society,'' said personnel manager Nishikawa.

SUICIDE EPIDEMIC SPREADS THROUGH POLICE RANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The coverup of how Catherine Galvin died began almost
as quickly as her life ended.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow officers found the 28-year-old state trooper just after
midnight on Oct. 29, 1994. She was seated in her bed in her South
Boston apartment, propped up by the headboard. Straight ahead, on
top of a dresser, a television broadcast a late-night show.
</P>
<P>
   Soon there was a swirl of police activity around Galvin's
lifeless body as dozens of uniformed officers and plainclothes
detectives studied the situation. Outside, curious neighbors and
reporters gathered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victim had an accidental discharge while cleaning her
firearm,'' a Boston police spokesman told the media several hours
after her death. Later, the spokesman said foul play and suicide
had been ruled out. The department's official report concluded:
``Victim accidentally shot self while cleaning weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   But Catherine Galvin didn't die accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, after the glare of the media spotlight had faded,
the truth came out in the medical examiner's report: She had
deliberately killed herself, firing a single bullet from a
.40-caliber handgun into her head.
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious the night of her death what happened to Galvin,
two officers at the scene told the Globe. But as she lay fatally
wounded, police decided to tell the public that what happened this
October night was a tragic accident.
</P>
<P>
   The Galvin case was not an isolated one. Every year, hundreds of
police officers across the country commit suicide. They do so at an
alarming rate, a rate that is much higher than that of the rest of
the population _ and rising. One expert calls it an epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The contributing factors are varied: stress, alcohol abuse, the
depressing grimness of police work, the frustration of office
politics. And unlike other high-stress jobs _ in medicine and
aviation, for instance _ police carry weapons that they can turn
against themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As in the Galvin case, dozens of those suicides are purposely
misclassified as accidents. Sometimes it's to ease the pain felt by
survivors and ensure they get better death benefits. Often, it's to
protect the reputation of the dead officer and the department from
what many police officers believe is a shameful act.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers are twice as likely to kill themselves as to be
killed by a criminal, according to the National Association of
Police Chiefs in Miami. In Buffalo, one of the few in-depth studies
of police deaths found that officers in that city were eight times
as likely to kill themselves as they were to be slain in the line
of duty. Buffalo officers were also three times more likely to kill
themselves than other city workers, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Police Department has one of the highest suicide
rates in the country _ only slightly behind Atlanta, and more than
double that of the New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago
departments, according to a 1994 study of seven urban police forces
by the New York City Council.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen Boston officers killed themselves in the past
10 years, a rate six times that of the rest of the working-age
population in Massachusetts. An analysis of computerized records of
deaths in Massachusetts from 1989 to 1995 found at least 50 law
enforcement deaths classified as suicides.
</P>
<P>
   The number of actual suicides is believed to be substantially
higher because many are misclassified as accidents. In Buffalo, for
instance, one in five police deaths were suicides wrongly
classified as accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the numbers _ and the occasional media attention
when a police department experiences a rash of suicides, as New
York City did in 1994 _ the death of officers by their own hand
remains one of law enforcement's most fiercely guarded secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Many police agencies in Massachusetts contacted by the Globe
refused to discuss police suicides or provide documents on the
subject requested under the state's public records law. Police
prefer to focus attention on officers killed in the line of duty,
viewed as a more heroic death. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The unwritten rule
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of interviews, individual officers and detectives
spoke of an unwritten rule: When confronted with the suicide of a
fellow police officer, do everything possible to classify the death
as an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is even the slightest doubt about what happened, we
go with accidental,'' said one veteran police investigator. ``All
you need is something to hang your hat on.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, that something is a nearby gun-cleaning kit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to a New York City cop, and when his dad went
through the police academy, they told him that if you ever have the
urge to eat your own gun, lay out gun cleaning equipment so it
looks like an accident,'' said John Violanti, a former New York
state trooper who has studied police suicide for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The ruse of gun cleaning is used for several reasons: One is to
avoid what some in law enforcement believe is the stigma of
suicide. Among police, suicide is often viewed as a cowardly act, a
black mark on the honor of a department. Many times, the suicide
may be the result of problems on the job, a fact police departments
want to keep private.
</P>
<P>
   Another is financial: The families of officers killed in the
line of duty are entitled to a $100,000 federal payment, maximum
pension benefits, and programs to pay for other expenses, including
the funeral. But the families of suicide victims may receive lower
pension benefits; some even lose life insurance payouts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as well-meaning as some of the efforts to disguise suicide
may seem, there are consequences. In a culture of silence where the
final act of desperate officers is hushed up, other officers who
are feeling troubled and upset get the message: Don't talk about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These departments are telling an officer something: `Stress
doesn't exist, and don't catch it or you will be deviant,''' said
John Carr, a former police officer who runs the Rhode Island
Centurion program, a statewide service for stressed-out officers.
</P>
<P>
   As many as one-third of the nation's police departments do not
have formal stress programs for officers or policies on protecting
the privacy of officers who seek help, Carr said.
</P>
<P>
   Misrepresenting the cause of an officer's death, meanwhile,
hurts the credibility of a profession the public relies on for
scrupulous honesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt abandoned during some of these suicide
investigations,'' said Boston Police Sergeant Richard Ross, a
veteran detective who has investigated several deaths of police
officers and wrote about police suicide for his master's thesis at
Boston University.

 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was Patricia McGovern, outfitted in her Bermuda shorts,
sneakers, and baseball cap, running around in the wilds of North
Carolina. About a dozen women of all ages were there to test their
mettle as they rappelled down mountains, climbed ropes, crossed
rivers, and camped out in a steady rain.
</P>
<P>
   The Outward Bound program had one rule: No one could say what
she did for a living. By the end of eight days, it was McGovern _
with little to no camping experience but plenty of problem-solving
ability as former chairwoman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee
_ who had emerged as the undisputed leader of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned home, McGovern and her friend Wendie
Gershengorn were greeted by Gershengorn's husband, Ken, at Logan
Airport. The two women were exhausted. But McGovern, 57, was also
beaming triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looked like she could turn around and start again,'' Ken
Gershengorn recalled. ``I've never seen her with a lack of energy
or enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, McGovern's indomitable spirit is her hallmark. She went
to law school when few women did such a thing. She ran for the
state Senate against a Democratic incumbent when she was told she
would lose. (She won.) She became the first woman to chair the
budget-shaping Ways and Means Committee, and she helped steer
Massachusetts through its worst economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she is facing perhaps her greatest challenge of all in
the Democratic primary for governor. Naysayers have suggested that
she get out of the race. (She won't.) They say she got in too late,
can't raise enough money, and doesn't have the statewide
organization necessary to win.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern remains optimistic, another trademark. She says
predictions of a low turnout at the polls mean ``it's anybody's
guess who's going to win anything.'' She has $602,000 in cash on
hand, and she's hoping that an expected debate with John Silber,
head of the state Board of Education, ``could give me momentum or
spark.''
</P>
<P>
   In the event that she prevails in the primary Sept. 15,
McGovern's rich history of public service as a former state senator
may either haunt her or help her. To some, she was among the first
to warn of the economic storm about to pound Massachusetts in the
late '80s, and among the first to take the requisite action. To
others, she is a tax-happy liberal, unable to resist raising taxes
and levying new ones _ to the tune of about $2 billion dollars
during her tenure as chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what I thought was right,'' McGovern says, comfortably
discussing her record. ``I really believed with all my heart in
what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Joe Walsh, the former Democratic senator from Dorchester, used to
call her ``the little girl from Lawrence'' on the floor of the
Senate chamber. McGovern took it as high praise, a term of
endearment from the old-time lawmakers she used to cajole into
doing this or that deal.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, few could have predicted McGovern would grow up not
only to join the most inside of men's clubs, but to help lead it.
Neither of her two sisters, Gayle Miller and Kathy Stella, was
driven academically or professionally the way that Patricia was.
And neither of McGovern's sisters had any interest in politics.
</P>
<P>
   They grew up in a triple-decker, working class and Irish
Catholic in a town where people knew each other well. Their father
was a health inspector for the city; their mother worked for the
Lawrence Housing Authority as a bookkeeper. There were no lawyer
role models in the family, and certainly no women lawyers. Two
uncles were politically active; one served three governors as
commissioner of labor and industries.
</P>
<P>
   She briefly showed interest in journalism, but soon McGovern
became hooked on Perry Mason and expressed a desire to study law,
Miller recalls. ``She was just very assertive from the moment she
was born,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern became the first in the family to complete college,
graduating from Suffolk University. She stayed there to receive her
law degree in 1966. And when her youngest sister considered ending
her formal education with high school, it was McGovern who urged
her on to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `You have to go, you have to get an education,'''
recalls Stella, a social worker. ``I'm glad I went to college. It
took me a while, but I made it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern, who has never married, is ``Auntie Pat'' to her niece
and four nephews. She talks about them often, displays their
photographs around her North Andover home, and takes them on some
of her travels. When her niece was 11, McGovern took her along on a
trip to China. When a nephew reached eighth grade, she took him and
his sister to Paris and London.
</P>
<P>
   It was on that trip that Patti and Phillip Stella insisted on
visiting the rocker Jim Morrison's grave. Phillip urged McGovern to
hang back so as not to embarrass the teen-agers. But McGovern
wanted to see the grave, too, and pretended not to know them as she
inched forward in the queue of devotees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smell of pot through the air,'' she exclaims now, waving
her arms as if churning up the odor. ``It was amazing!''
</P>
<P>
   She describes herself as ``a funny duck,'' and wants people to
know she has a sense of humor. Showing off a silver-framed
photograph of herself, her niece, and her nephews with President
Clinton, she refers jokingly to the leader of the free world as
``Mr. DNA.'' She is a gin rummy addict and she treasures weekends
in New Hampshire on Webster Lake.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a rare eye condition that has left her with little
sight since birth, she has traveled on safari in Africa and hot-air
ballooning over the Serengeti Plain; double- and triple-checked the
fine print of multiple state budgets; and read voraciously over the
years. The only thing she can't do is drive.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 a.m., before she's even had a cup of coffee, McGovern is
already moving rapidly throughout her colonial home, chattering
nonstop, as she is pressed to slow down and reflect on her
political career.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  There was no particular issue or personal story that galvanized
Patricia McGovern and served as a catalyst for her arrival on the
political scene. But she knew she wanted in. Never mind that women
were rarely included in Massachusetts politics back then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to run for office, all my life,'' she says,
describing herself as a creature of the Kennedy era, wanting to do
good. ``Government could be used in a positive way for social
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she always thought that if she ran, it would be for a
House seat. But eventually she settled on a target: state Senator
William X. Wall, a Democratic relic, in office for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, it was a lot to squinch up my courage and run
for office,'' says McGovern, who had so far spent her career
working as a public defender for juveniles and then running a state
criminal justice office.
</P>
<P>
   Though the party leaders tried to wave her away from Wall,
McGovern persisted. She won that race by 2,000 votes and arrived on
Beacon Hill in 1981 with an agenda favoring the environment,
education, and abortion rights, as well as economic development.

 BOSTON: ... economic development.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soon after she was elected, McGovern found herself at the center
of national attention, assigned a task that would prove her
organizational abilities and propel her up the leadership ladder.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' ``60 Minutes'' had broadcast a gruesome story about the
murder of 9-year-old Arnold Zeleznik, and the failure of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts to prevent his death. Vernal Walford
had been committed to Northampton State Hospital for 10 days in
1974 by a psychiatrist who called him ``the craziest man I ever
saw.'' An illegal alien from Jamaica, Walford was released 40 hours
after he was admitted, despite his hallucinations, screams, assault
on a nurse, and fights with two attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Three-and-a-half weeks later, he snatched Zeleznik from the
corridor of a Miami hotel and slit his throat.
</P>
<P>
   Carter Zeleznik, Arnold's father, wanted to know why someone
like Walford was out walking around free. He got no answers from
the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   After the ``60 Minutes'' report, then-Senate President William
M. Bulger asked McGovern to chair a special commission to
investigate just what had gone wrong. In the glare of the national
spotlight, McGovern discovered that Walford had tried to turn
himself in to the Immigration and Naturalization Service just two
weeks before the murder, but was turned away.
</P>
<P>
   The committee ultimately concluded that the hospital was guilty
of gross institutional negligence and should never have released
Walford. It also found that an investigation by the state
Department of Mental Health was ``thoroughly deficient and
extremely misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern's committee asked the Legislature to award the Zeleznik
family $50,000 in a public admission of error, and to establish the
Arnold Zeleznik Chair at the University of Massachusetts Medical
School in Worcester. Later, McGovern inserted language into the
budget to restructure the state's mental health system, following
the progress for years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, McGovern's political career was given
another boost. Bulger asked her to chair the Ways and Means
Committee, the panel responsible for writing the state's budget,
monitoring its economic health, and awarding lawmakers projects for
their districts. After the Senate president, the Ways and Means
chairman is the most important person in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were shocked when I was chosen,'' says McGovern, who
was still a relative newcomer to the crusty upper chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Her colleagues' shock was like a red-hot cattle prod as she
organized the committee and hired a staff, preparing to write her
first budget. ``You know everything you're going to do is going to
be looked at critically,'' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern thinks of herself as a problem-solver, a negotiator,
and a consensus-builder. She's also a policy wonk with a serious
penchant for fine print. And as she took over the committee, she
made sure to know every detail, dollar, and line in her budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Torres, her former staff director, remembers spending long
Saturday and Sunday sessions reviewing every one of the 1,300 line
items and every one of the line items' 14 subsidiary accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``She literally digested the state budget,'' he remembers. ``She
knew every line of it in the first year.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say that McGovern can get bogged down in details
_ a trait that might be more tolerable in a Ways and Means chairman
than in a governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fair comment,'' McGovern acknowledges. ``But I don't
think it's true now.''
</P>
<P>
   When she first took over, she says, ``I wanted to know every
detail and I wanted to know them all.'' Eventually, she realized
that what she was doing was not about the numbers, but about the
policy. ``In the end, I stopped worrying about the details, but I
knew the big picture,'' says McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   On the policy front, McGovern's tenure as chairman is perhaps
best remembered for her effort to provide universal health care to
every uninsured person in Massachusetts, assembling a fragile
coalition of hospitals, insurance companies, businesses, and
consumer groups. Though she pushed the legislation through, the
employer mandate _ the piece de resistance _ was never put into
place and the major component of the plan has gone largely
unrealized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work she did on universal health care was as important as
anything we did,'' says former governor Michael S. Dukakis. ``That
was Pat at her best. She just worked it and worked it and worked
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1989, McGovern began to notice signs of a faltering
economy. Dukakis had been off campaigning for president, uninvolved
in the state's affairs. Revenue was dwindling and certain programs
were costing more and more money.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern launched her war on the ``budget busters,'' reining in
the five items in the state budget that were on their way to
ballooning out of control: Medicaid, pensions and health insurance
for state workers, debt service, and the Massachusetts Bay Transit
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, she pushed to cut programs and raise taxes to deal
with the negative cash flow into the Treasury's coffers. Relations
with the Dukakis administration became strained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found ourselves in the worst recession since the Great
Depression,'' McGovern remembers. ``Unemployment was in the double
digits. We had to cope with that or things would grow worse.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern began calling for tax increases. And soon after,
taxpayers were faced with a 15 percent hike in their income taxes
in 1989, a 10-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax increase in 1990, as
well as a new and unprecedented tax on services such as
long-distance phone calls, fitness center memberships, and legal
and financial work.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was determined to raise taxes,'' remembers Barbara
Anderson, co-director of Citizens for Limited Taxation and
Government. ``I thought that was a real problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pezzella, the deputy legislative director for Dukakis at
the time, sees it differently. His boss, the governor, had little
clout with the Legislature as he returned from a humiliating
defeat, Pezzella says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she was the person who kept the state prudent and
fiscally sound,'' he says. ``She was the person who basically kept
the state together, more so than the administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, McGovern is calling for tax cuts. Back then, she raised
taxes. ``I don't regret doing it,'' she says matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   If she has a regret, it is her previous enthusiasm for the
services tax, which caused an uproar among the law firms and mutual
fund businesses that populate the state. Former Governor William F.
Weld rescinded it as soon as he took office and before the tax
could take effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been much easier for my life if I hadn't gone
down that road. We were a little too cutting-edge,'' McGovern says
now. ``It was not right for the times, nor is it right for the
times now. It was not right for the economy. ... You learn from
experience and you go back and do things differently.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufpibox &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, McGovern continued her work on the Ways and
Means Committee, attending to the needs of her colleagues and
addressing the issues of the day. Then, at the pinnacle of her
power, McGovern decided to give it all up. The decision shocked her
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she had tried to give herself a term limit as soon as
she got the job, writing down a deadline on a slip of paper. By the
time she left in 1992, she had surpassed the date she had set for
herself by two years. ``I wanted to stay through the fiscal
difficulties,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As she left, says McGovern, she thought about returning to
Beacon Hill, perhaps as treasurer, or maybe even as governor. After
a stint in private practice, she worked as a lobbyist for the firm
of Goulston &AMP; Storrs, which had clients such as Blue Cross and Blue
Shield and Malden Mills, and she served on several corporate
boards, including that of Massachusetts Electric Company.
</P>
<P>
   She says she still believes government can be a force for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to the end game,'' she says of the primary
race's final days.
</P>
<P>
   And win or lose, there's always Rome. She's already planning a
trip with her niece and two of her nephews.

SONG PARODY ONLY ADDS TO THE `MESS WITH BILL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He's lying low on Martha's Vineyard. The Republicans
want his head. He's political road kill on editorial pages from
coast to coast. And now one of President Clinton's diminishing
oases _ oldies radio _ has evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   In a blistering parody of a tune that he doubtless thought very
cool as an undergraduate at Georgetown University in 1966 _ ``Don't
Mess with Bill'' _ the president is skewered with his own finely
cut versions of the truth.
</P>
<P>
   A week after his prime-time, nationally televised expiation
about a sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica
S. Lewinsky, a doctored version of the old Marvelettes hit is the
hottest summertime song on WROR-FM in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the number-one requested song on the radio station
without any doubt,'' said Harry Nelson, the station's program
director. ``I hope things will get straightened out and the country
can get back to a more normal pace.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton struggles to achieve a personal form of domestic
tranquility, prepares his legal case for possible hearings in the
House, and attempts to relax during his island vacation, he finds
himself where no politician wants to be: the object of stinging
ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   The public's embrace of the song suggests that, a week after
Clinton's testimony before a grand jury in Washington, people still
simmer over his deceits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the `McLaughlin Group' or anything like that,'' said
Gordon McAdams, WROR's production director. ``We're the fun button.
That's our thing. And in this case it's at someone else's expense.
We certainly didn't open the door. We just rushed right through
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Clinton's partly contrite, partly defiant address
to the nation, McAdams and Nelson spent seven hours in a radio
station editing room piecing together the president's own words
from its well-stocked audio archive of Clinton cuts over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The result? The Marvelettes song, about a jealous girlfriend,
that rose to 7th on pop charts 32 years ago, portrays the president
as a gleeful philanderer and the first lady as the oblivious woman
done wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I misled people, including even my wife,'' Clinton is heard
saying from his confessional speech. To which the station has
spliced this out-of-context Hillary Rodham Clinton retort: ``At
this point, I don't pay much attention to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great,'' Nelson said. ``We've received a ton of
phone calls. We did it for a laugh and with no intention to be mean
to anybody. We were running out of jokes because they were being
recirculated. We were looking for something that was a little more
creative.''
</P>
<P>
   The song is played at least six times a day. ``We might slip it
in an extra time or two if the request lines start to get really,
really hot,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the radio station's signal can be heard as far
north as southern Maine, as far west as Worcester County, and as
far south as, well, Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yup, it comes in loud and clear down there,'' the program
director said.

RETURN TO SPLITSVILLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who thinks of British dictionary makers as stuffy
conservatives has got another think coming, now that Oxford
University Press has put out its latest blockbuster, the New Oxford
Dictionary of English.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the contents of the dictionary that shock, though some
of its judgments will rattle conservatives' teeth. It's the
publicity that verges on shamelessness, showing that when it comes
to selling, overstatement is a lingua franca.
</P>
<P>
   NODE, as the new dictionary is acronymically called, is not yet
available in the United States. But according to the publisher's
press release, the new dictionary ``reveals that the battle to
prevent us splitting infinitives has been based on a fallacy all
along.'' The Star Trek slogan _ ``to boldly go where no man has
gone before'' _ is a standard English construction, the publishers
say, ``broadly accepted as both normal and useful.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this stop-the-presses hype is the verb
``reveal.''
</P>
<P>
   True, there are still many people who were taught that splitting
infinitives _ that is, inserting a word between the two parts of
the infinitive form of the verb, as in to boldly go _ is bad form.
In fact, though, the split infinitive has never been universally
condemned; it wasn't even noticed, let alone named, till the 19th
century. Some grammarians of the time condemned it, arguing that
split infinitives aren't used (in fact, they aren't possible) in
Greek and Latin, the ideal tongues of the educated classes.
</P>
<P>
   But 20th-century usage writers have consistently rejected this
analogy, pointing out that adverb placement in English is crucial
to the emphasis of a sentence. Here are a few of the usage arbiters
who scooped NODE on the news from Splitsville:
</P>
<P>
   ``The objection to the split infinitive has never had a rational
basis'' (Merriam-Webster, 1994).
</P>
<P>
   ``The split infinitive, in actuality, is another pedantic bogey,
carried over from the Latinate prescriptions of the nineteenth
century'' (William and Mary Morris, 1985).
</P>
<P>
   ``Every good literary craftsman splits his infinitives when the
sense demands it'' (George Bernard Shaw, quoted in Follett, 1966).
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that it is a grammatical mistake to place a word
between to and the simple form of a verb ... is responsible for a
great deal of bad writing'' (Evans and Evans, 1957).
</P>
<P>
   NODE does offer some newsy language tidbits. The most often
misspelled words in English, the editors found, are restaurateur,
rendered as restauranteur 20 percent of the time, and millennium,
which is missing an n one time in 10. Snuck is gaining on sneaked,
thanks to American casualness, and will soon be standard, they
predict. Perhaps most controversially, NODE's editors endorse they
in reference to a singular antecedent _ ``ask a friend if they
could help'' _ as a way of avoiding the clunkiness of he or she and
the sexism of he alone.
</P>
<P>
   But the split infinitive's respectability is not only old news,
it's old news published and republished by Oxford University Press
itself _ in perhaps the most famous usage guide of all, H.W.
Fowler's 1926 Modern English Usage.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler would have gone green around the gills at snuck in, but
he preferred infinitive-splitting to being ``ambiguous or
artificial''; and though he conceded that rewriting could eliminate
any split infinitive, he reserved to writers ``the right of
deciding in each case whether recasting is worth it.'' Surely the
Oxford University Press still owns a copy of Fowler, but apparently
it's not on the shelf at the publicity office.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
Life in Latin
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maud Chaplin of Wellesley College and William Neenan of Boston
College zipped off e-mails noting the Latin error in The Word's
Aug. 9 &UR;  &LR; headline, which used the phrase curriculum vita. ``The
correct form is curriculum vitae _ literally the `course or run of
life,''' wrote Neenan; without the genitive case, it becomes the
nonsensical course life. A fancy word for resume, curriculum vitae
is common in academia; it's often abbreviated c.v., which is easier
to spell and fits nicely into headlines, too. But it can also be
shortened to vita, or ``life'' _ ``His vita is filled with
second-rate publications'' _ and in that case the nominative is
correct. In fact, my dictionary calls vita an English word, while
curriculum vitae remains Latin. Life is strange, and language
sometimes more so.

UPN'S `DESMOND PFEIFFER' PROMISES TO OFFEND EVERYONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'' is one
of the most inclusive shows on television. It will anger everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the overall theme, which is basically the lighter
side of slavery. There is no truth to the rumor that UPN is
secretly working on a project tentatively titled: ``Holocaust: The
Merry Musical.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the humor of this show in which Pfeiffer, a black
English nobleman with his own (white) valet is indentured as a
butler/confidant in the Lincoln White House at the onset of the
Civil War. Pfeiffer is not a slave, per se, but it is made clear he
is not free to leave.
</P>
<P>
   So what fuels this half-hour comedy? Oh, the usual.
</P>
<P>
   Like a sexually frustrated Mary Lincoln. And Abe Lincoln making
gay and pedophilia overtures. Clinton sex gags. (Actually, those do
seem to be mandatory for all fall shows.) Racial put-downs? Why not
some incest jokes? Suuuuuuuure. They are all there.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is based in fact, of course, (and even in the show
the Abe Lincoln sexual remarks are made under the influence of
alcohol spiked with an aphrodisiac). And despite his subservient
station on the kitchen staff, Pfeiffer is clearly the smartest man
in the White House, an homage to Robert Guillaume's erudite
character Benson the butler on ``Soap.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while there is some contemporary political satire
involved in the period piece (Lincoln laughs off as absurd the
possibility of any president sleeping with a female staff member),
this show set its sights squarely, if not solely, on attacking
political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desmond Pfeiffer,'' (the P is not silent, as the character
must remind everyone), may be the most politically incorrect sitcom
since ``Married ... with Children.'' Many critics have gleefully
panned it, stating it is merely offensive.
</P>
<P>
   This show is in fact not that bad especially by UPN standards
but hardly qualifies as quality television. So why am I futilely
rooting for the doomed ``Desmond Pfeiffer?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, let's look at what's going for it:
</P>
<P>
   _ It's not about some single twentysomethings living in New York
City apartments they couldn't afford even if they tripled their
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   _ In an age of network timidity the show tries to be different
and succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   _ It actually has some flashes of humor.
</P>
<P>
   _ No wacky neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   It's different. It may not work, but at least it earns a nod for
being apart from the standard, cookie-cutter, demographically
targeted yuppified pablum normally churned out by the network
conveyor belt.
</P>
<P>
   At a gathering of television critics in Pasadena in July,
creator and executive producer Barry Fanaro was asked if this show
could have aired on any network other than UPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. Not a chance. Not a prayer,'' he said. ``You would have
been laughed out of any other network, pitching this show.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Valentine, president and chief executive of UPN, told
critics he had sound reasoning for putting ``Pfeiffer'' on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about what show would (tick) you guys off the
most,'' he said. ``And the computer spit out that show and, you
know, we put it on.''
</P>
<P>
   In a more serious vein, Valentine added: ``There is room on
television for sometimes offensive, sometimes silly, sometimes
brilliant political satire. Our shows are kind of like pretty bland
compared to stuff like that. We wanted to try something and push
the envelope of comedy a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Chi McBride, late of the ``John Larroquette Show'' (he played
the janitor), stars as Pfeiffer. McBride has a message for anyone
who gets truly angry at the show, a group will undoubtedly include
fellow African Americans: Lighten up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can fine something to be offended about in everything,''
McBride said. ``That's why I don't play pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Pool? ``That's where the white ball chases the black ball off
the green table, which represents the Earth. See, that's why I like
bowling.''
</P>
<P>
   You have to ask: Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``The black ball knocks down the white pins with the red
necks,'' he said. ``I mean, c'mon man.''
</P>
<P>
   The show premieres Oct. 5. New shows on UPN are starting later
in the season than other networks. The sitcom is going to air
Mondays at 9 p.m. Eastern, against ``Monday Night Football,''
``Ally McBeal,'' ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' and ``Caroline in the
City.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Any dispute over quality aside, the competition makes
``Pfeiffer'' roadkill before it even gets on the air.
</P>
<P>
   So what? UPN is last in a six-horse field of networks. (A
seventh one, Pax TV, joins the field come next Monday.) Why not
take chances?
</P>
<P>
   While fellow newcomer WB has been able to carve a strong niche
market with youths, UPN has struggled to find its core. Executives
have said instead of trying to be a ``narrowcaster'' targeting a
particular market, UPN will strive to be a broadcaster, meaning
putting on a variety of shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'' certainly constitutes
variety, even if it will not have broad appeal. On that basis alone
it deserves our praise, even as we bury it.

ANOTHER SCORE FOR `TITANIC' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent full-page ad in Billboard trumpets the new ``Back to
Titanic'' as the ``most anticipated soundtrack sequel in history.''
Crass commercialism, right? If that's the slant, then you might as
well call it the ``Titanic'' cash-in, since its release is timed to
the ``Titanic'' home video, which is out Sept. 1 and has had
pre-orders of 22 million copies in the United States alone _ second
only to 30 million for ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the hype subsides, however, let it be said that the ``Back
to Titanic'' album is every bit as captivating as the first
soundtrack, which has sold a staggering 25 million copies
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The sequel comes out Tuesday (Aug. 25) and is going to be
drubbed by many cynics who feel the ``Titanic'' tentacles have gone
too far. I was ready to feel that way as well, but then heard the
record and was smitten again. All the raw emotionalism from the
original record surged back _ and, to the credit of ``Titanic''
composer James Horner, there's a lot of previously unreleased
material that helps flesh out the ``Titanic'' saga.
</P>
<P>
   Pop diva Celine Dion reappears with ``My Heart Will Go On,'' the
humongous hit destined to win song-of-the-year honors at the next
Grammy awards. This version, which includes interspersed dialogue
from Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet), the
star-crossed lovers in the film, originally was only available to
radio programmers.
</P>
<P>
   But composer Horner has really outdone himself elsewhere. He has
fashioned two long suites _ the 19-minute ``Titanic Suite'' and
nearly 13-minute ``Epilogue: The Deep and Timeless Sea,'' which
take some of the original movie theme music and weave it around
previously unissued music that is stunning. The merging of a
classical viola section (of 22 players, versus the normal six or
eight), together with the ghostly, world-music strains of uillean
pipes and pennywhistle, lends a fresh, cathartic magic to the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   More of Norwegian singer Sissel's wordless, ambient vocals
course through the sequel. Included for the first time are the
lively Celtic dance tunes played when Jack and Kate attend a party
in the ship's third-class section. The collection of jigs and reels
is nimbly played by Celtic group Gaelic Storm.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights are a new version of the hymn ``Nearer My God
to Thee,'' played solo by ``Riverdance'' fiddler Eileen Ivers; and
a new version of ``Come Josephina in My Flying Machine,'' sung by
ethereal Irish chanteuse Maire Brennan of Clannad. The song was
popular during the ``Titanic'' era and was briefly sung by Jack to
Rose in the film.
</P>
<P>
   So cynics, take note: It may be easy to slam this sequel purely
on the grounds of ``Titanic'' overkill, but give it a serious
listen and you'll be impressed by how much new material is here.
The dramatic power of the music is too much to deny.

<P>
   Sometimes it takes a designer with the stature of a Calvin Klein
to prove the obvious: There is nothing new in fashion anymore.
(itals)Everything(unitals) is recycled.
</P>
<P>
   Even clothes you thought you'd never see again, like the famous
1978 ``original'' Calvin Klein jeans, the skintight numbers Brooke
Shields put on the map.
</P>
<P>
   The originals are back in stores all right _ just in time for
school bells _ with their dark denim fabric, loop design on the
back pocket, and white and red label. The one key modernization
this time around is that they're looser (guess we're a fatter
population).
</P>
<P>
   But don't think that because Klein is pushing straight jeans
that the 1970s bell-bottom fad is over.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are two schools of thought on back-to-class
fashions this fall.
</P>
<P>
   It's still cool to go 1970s retro, with super-flared jeans and
platform shoes (or sneakers).
</P>
<P>
   But high school kids are embracing a new image as well, a
``cleaned-up, collegiate-school look,'' says Robert Rutkauskas,
Filene's fashion director. For girls, that means plaid pleated
skirts, crisp white shirts, and a cardigan, worn as an accessory.
It sounds private-schoolish, but kids make it chic with platform
shoes. ``It's almost like the uniform from years ago,'' says
Rutkauskas. ``All you need is an apple and a ruler and you're ready
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Boys are choosing a less conservative but still mainstream look:
khakis or cordoroy cargo pants and plaid shirts, worn open and
untucked, over a plain T-shirt. We've seen it on college kids and
now many high school students want to wear it too, rather than the
overalls and baggy jeans they wore last year.
</P>
<P>
   They're also continuing the athletic trend that started last
year: nylon sweat pants with white stripes down the sides. Instead
of a matching top, they're wearing ``hoodies,'' zip-up sweatshirts
with hoods.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)The(unitals) accessory this season is the messenger bag,
those square bags real messengers carry on their bikes. And of
course, pagers, cellular phones, laptop computers, and portable CD
players will be back on campus.
</P>
<P>
   MTV is hoping to capitalize on the electronic trend. It's now
offering a $69 MTV pager, which comes in colors like neon yellow
and is adorned with an MTV logo. Kids who buy the pager and
subscribe to an about $11 monthly service (from Nationwide Network
Services of Florida) will be paged twice a week. When they respond
to a toll-free number, they have the chance to win prizes, trips,
and (no surprise here) MTV merchandise and programming news.
</P>
<P>
   Even Calvin Klein has jumped on this. Kids who spend $55 on his
jeans can buy the pager for about $20. During September, network
users can win new clothes or a ticket to attend a Klein fashion
show in New York.
</P>
<P>
   So who knows? If you're lucky, maybe you won't have to actually
pay for too many ``original'' Calvins yourself.

 BOSTON: ... Boston University.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``No one would believe it was true. There was tremendous denial
and pressure on us when investigating it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross rejects the justification of investigators who say they are
acting out of loyalty to fellow officers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a coverup,'' he said. ``What is the message you are
sending to junior officers when you cover up? We don't do this for
lawyers or insurance salesmen.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Death remains a mystery
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Galvin's closest friends paid little attention to the
actions of investigators the night of her death. They were too
stunned by what had just happened.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-foot-2-inch bundle of energy, Galvin was unceasingly
cheerful and the first to offer a smile for a downcast colleague.
When she patrolled highways around Worcester, she was teased for
her South Boston accent and her frequent expressions of ``Southie
pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvin was constantly busy, working full-time, attending school,
and baby sitting during off-hours for her sister's children. Even
with this hectic schedule, she found time to maintain an active
social life, often traveling to the Cape or Berkshires when not
working. It was not surprising that at the State Police academy,
Galvin was the best endurance runner in her class.
</P>
<P>
   Running was one of the few things that came easily to Galvin
when she attended the academy, friends say. Her small hands made
handling a gun difficult, and she constantly fretted over exams.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin would later tell friends she hoped to one day return to
the academy as a drill instructor.
</P>
<P>
   She was drawn to police work, friends say, by a simple desire to
help people. Galvin grew up only a block from the Old Colony
housing development, and was a member of one of the poorest
Catholic parishes in the city.
</P>
<P>
   She was a frequent volunteer at homeless shelters and elderly
housing complexes.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the police academy in 1992, Galvin was
assigned to highway patrol in central Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   It was here that her idealism gave way to the reality of
midnight shifts, office politics, and gruesome accident scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some things that bothered her,'' said Jane Kennedy,
an academy classmate and close friend of Galvin's. ``Anything
involving children bothered her. She had a lot of compassion for
people and didn't get any pleasure from arresting people. It could
bother her.''
</P>
<P>
   The night Galvin died began with a celebration, a fund-raiser
for the Boston Police Gaelic Column that had had the trooper
excited for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The tickets were relatively cheap _ $20 a person _ and the
fund-raiser, which was really more of a party for cops from many
different departments, was being held less than a mile from her
home at the Boston Teachers Union hall, just over the South Boston
line in Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin had a lot of friends who were Boston officers. One of her
best friends was a piper in the bagpipe unit. She told her State
Police colleagues that it was important to show support for the
unit, which frequently played at the funerals of officers from
other departments and only weeks earlier participated in the
service for Trooper Mark Charbonnier, who was gunned down during a
highway stop on Route 3 in Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   ``She called me and made me promise to set aside two tables for
her,'' said James Barry, the president of the Gaelic column and a
Boston police officer. ``We had a real good showing from the State
Police.''
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raiser, Galvin worked the room of 300 people. ``If I
knew 10 people at an event, she knew 100,'' said Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Futile efforts
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But something was wrong with Galvin that night.
</P>
<P>
   Uncharacteristically, she began sobbing toward the end of the
evening. And then she said something to another female trooper that
alarmed her friends. No one will repeat what she said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about her well-being, another trooper drove Galvin to
her nearby home on the other side of Columbia Park.
</P>
<P>
   The same unidentified trooper also took Galvin's .9mm Sig Sauer
service weapon from her as a precaution, sources said, unaware that
she had another handgun at home. The friend stayed with Galvin for
a few minutes, but left after a smiling Galvin assured her she was
no longer upset.
</P>
<P>
   A carload of other troopers, meanwhile, was on its way to
Galvin's house. Their purpose was two-fold: They were worried about
their friend, and she had previously invited people to stop by
after the fundraiser.
</P>
<P>
   As they drove, Kennedy called Galvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we were on our way over and I asked if everything was
all right,'' Kennedy said. ``She said she was fine. She was
laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   When the troopers arrived, the door to Galvin's apartment was
locked. Kennedy ran down the street to Sullivan's, a bar Galvin
frequented. She wasn't there. At the same time, the other troopers
went upstairs to Galvin's sister's apartment and asked her to let
them in.
</P>
<P>
   The sister unlocked the door. Her screams led the troopers to
Galvin's body.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted to be found,'' said a trooper at the home that
night. ``She invited her friends to the fund-raiser and to her
house later.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy agreed. ``She knew we were coming.''
</P>
<P>
   In the investigation of Catherine Galvin's death, the detective
writing the report for the Boston Police Department was careful to
note a gun cleaning kit was nearby. However, several people
interviewed by the Globe who were at Galvin's home that night said
it was obvious she was not cleaning the weapon. The cleaning kit
was nearby only because it was in the same box that stored the gun,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, the Gaelic column , whose fund-raiser Cathy
Galvin had helped make such a success, played the bagpipes at her
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A wall of silence
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who were at Galvin's home the night of the suicide
are not talking.
</P>
<P>
   The Suffolk County assistant district attorney at the scene,
Mary Ames, is now in private practice, but said she would not
discuss the case without the approval of her former boss, Suffolk
District Attorney Ralph C. Martin II. Martin's office refused to
give her that permission.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Police Department also refused to allow the detective
who prepared the report of the incident to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor who performed the autopsy and labeled the death a
suicide agreed to discuss her findings, but was denied permission
to do so by her boss, Dr. Richard Evans, the state's chief medical
examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Galvin's friends on the State Police also declined to
talk about her death. Some said they were being pressured by other
classmates, the group of troopers who trained with Galvin at the
police academy, to keep quiet.
</P>
<P>
   For Jane Kennedy, who was one of Galvin's closest friends, it
doesn't matter what her death was labeled, only that her friend is
gone. Four years later, Kennedy is no closer to understanding what
her friend was thinking that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could tell you,'' said Kennedy. ``Because you are on
the job, you are apart. It is hard to reach out to anyone else. The
culture can make it tough. I don't have as many civilian friends as
I once had.''

POLICY SUICIDES RELY ON TOOLS OF GUNS, ALCOHOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG

And when you watch a person die 
And hear a battered baby cry 
Then do you think that you can be 
All these things that you ask of me? 
 
THE POLICE OFFICER'S LIFE 
AUTHOR UNKNOWN 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Gary Windsor didn't leave a suicide note when he killed
himself in his police cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   His grieving widow searched their home for clues, for anything
that would help explain why the 28-year veteran of the Metro Dade
Police Department took his own life.
</P>
<P>
   All she discovered was an empty bottle of Absolut vodka hidden
in a backyard shed.
</P>
<P>
   The decorated officer was drunk when he shot himself in the head
with his department-issued 9mm Beretta handgun on March 4, 1997.
His blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit for
driving.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Windsor's suicide is a familiar one in the nation's
law enforcement ranks. Not only are police officers killing
themselves at a disturbing rate, but they accomplish it with
haunting uniformity: In nearly every case, the officer uses his or
her police-issued handgun, and alcohol is a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Police veterans call alcohol ``an officer's worst friend,'' an
oft-used crutch for dealing with inexplicable violence on the
street and stress inside the station house.
</P>
<P>
   Modern-day policing, which calls for officers to do more in a
society that affords them less respect, and the old-school habit of
burying a bad day with a beer and a shot, can combine to deepen
depression. Depression can spiral into suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Today's officers are one and one half times more likely to
commit suicide than their predecessors only a decade ago, according
to John Violanti, a leading police suicide expert and former New
York state trooper.
</P>
<P>
   So many law enforcement officers are committing suicide that
Violanti calls the situation an epidemic in need of radical action
_ such as requiring officers to leave their guns at the station
after a shift.
</P>
<P>
   The roll of officers who have died by their own hand includes
those who worked in wealthy suburbs and rural towns as well as big
cities. Police suicide is as prevalent in Massachusetts as in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a 25-year veteran of the Holyoke Police Department
killed himself with his police handgun only days after being passed
over for a promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, a sergeant on the Municipal Police Department,
which patrols city-owned properties in Boston, killed himself at a
Braintree cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, a Wilmington police officer shot himself in a
wooded area off the Massachusetts Turnpike. He was the second
Wilmington officer in five years to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an uncommon thing in our profession,'' said
Wilmington Police Chief Bobby N. Stewart. ``You see so much of it
over a career that it becomes an accepted way to go.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `You find releases'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   James Barry, a 10-year veteran of the Boston Police Department
and vice president of the patrolmen's union, can recount every
detail of the day eight years ago when he discovered a young woman
on the floor of a Huntington Avenue apartment.
</P>
<P>
   How it was a Sunday morning and he was drinking a cup of coffee
when he was approached by the woman's worried mother. How he found
the 19-year-old woman in her apartment, a knife sticking from her
chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see that room and the girl's face just as if it happened
yesterday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other officers recount similar stories from the job. For some,
it was shooting a violent suspect. For others, it was responding to
a gruesome accident scene or finding a dead child.
</P>
<P>
   These traumatic events often produce a common gut reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inclination is to go right over to Doyle's'' pub, Barry
said. ``It's not a war tale you go home and sit over Sunday dinner
and talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You find releases,'' he continued, ``whether it be a half a
case of beer or what.''
</P>
<P>
   Some turn to alcohol to remedy problems on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alcoholism is a huge problem in the police community,'' said
Rory Gilbert, a psychologist who operates an eight-bed home for
alcoholic police officers in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Police work always has been difficult and subject to intense
stress. More than a hundred years ago, Gilbert &AMP; Sullivan penned
the famous line that ``a policeman's lot is not a happy one.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's police officers, however, have a job that is arguably
more difficult and stressful than at any time in history.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers encounter more violence and more dangerous
criminals, are given more responsibility and receive more scrutiny
than police officers just a generation ago, according to a 1997
report by the National Institute of Justice, the research arm of
the US Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Community policing, a concept that has swept the country, adds
to the tension by forcing police officers not only to enforce the
law, but to assume different roles, from social worker to referee
to minister to psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Television and the proliferation of videocameras, meanwhile,
have led to more scrutiny and the potential that almost any act
will be caught by an electronic eye and dissected by the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police work is getting more risky,'' said Violanti, who is a
professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology. ``The demands
on police officers have increased tremendously. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `A common denominator'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In moments of personal anguish, police officers find themselves
in the company of a dangerous tool: the gun they are given by the
department.
</P>
<P>
   Guns are used in about 60 percent of all suicides among
Americans, according to the National Center for Injury Prevention
and Control. Police officers, according to research by Violanti,
use their guns to kill themselves 95 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The use of handguns is so prevalent in police suicides that
Violanti argues police agencies should require officers to leave
their guns at the station when their shift is finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would save lives,'' he said. ``If they have to go somewhere
to get a gun, they might change their mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Violanti points to a study of London police, who are generally
unarmed, that found the suicide rate for officers was lower than
the rest of the population. He concedes, however, his proposal is
one that few police forces in the United States would seriously
consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police wouldn't like that because the gun is an integral part
of their being,'' he said. ``If you took the gun away, they will
tell you they would feel naked.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston Police Sergeant Richard Ross, who studied the suicides of
the 12 fellow officers who killed themselves in the past 10 years,
said guns were used in every case _ and alcohol usually was a
factor as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alcohol is a big-time factor, a common denominator,'' Ross
said. ``Alcohol is a crutch and key to social life in the
department.''
</P>

   Ross became interested in the problem of police suicides after
some of his closest friends on the department took their own lives.
He was an usher in their weddings, and a pall bearer at their

   ``I know a cop who very methodically left one round in his
semi-automatic, and wrote a beautiful note,'' Ross said. ``I'd
known him for 23 years and he shot himself in the chest. There were
a bunch of beer cans next to him. I was devastated when he killed
himself. I never saw it coming. He was the first cop I ever worked
with in 1970. I knew him very well. I thought, `How did I miss
it?''' &QL;

   Bureaucracy that can kill

   Robert Douglas was disturbed by many of the things he saw on the
street during his 23-year career as a Baltimore Police officer. But
as he sat in his study at home one night, staring at the barrel of
his service handgun, it was not a grizzly murder scene or the
senseless shooting of a fellow officer that was gnawing at him.
</P>
<P>
   For Douglas, it was the realization that after 15 years on the
force, he was failing to realize his goal of moving through the
ranks and some day becoming chief. Douglas was still a patrolman
and felt victimized by an unfair promotional system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a hot shot, boy,'' he says now. ``I wanted to be a
police commissioner. But I had to wait five years just to take the
sergeant's exam and then affirmative action came in. It got worse,
not better. I got frustrated to the point where I got depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas said his life was saved when his wife opened the door to
his study and asked what was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas told his story to 120 police chaplains who came from
around the world to a conference in Duluth, Minn., last year. The
former officer is now a minister, and on a mission to stop police
officers in the United States from killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing 250 to 300 cops a year to suicide. It may be 500
a year, but we can document 250 to 300,'' Douglas told the
chaplains. ``There is a terrible, terrible problem with police
officers and suicide. This number is growing.''
</P>
<P>
   What is suprising about police suicides is how many stem from
frustrations like those experienced by Douglas. For many officers,
it is not the blood on the streets, but the politics and conflicts
in the station house that can make life miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband came home more screwed up with department problems
than with anything he ever encountered on the streets,'' the wife
of a police officer told a US Justice Department panel studying
police stress in 1997 .
</P>
<P>
   The perception of unfair promotional systems and arbitrary
disciplinary procedures, the rigid requirements of a military-like
hierarchy, midnight shifts, and long hours are just some of the
sources of stress cited by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   A 1981 FBI study of what makes police work stressful found that
being passed over for a promotion was more difficult for police
officers to deal with than pursuing an armed suspect or responding
to a hostage situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police departments are notorious for being not necessarily a
healthy place to work,'' said Sergeant William Garrison, who runs
the Metro Dade Police Department's wellness center in Miami.
``There are a lot of stresses and anxiety that go on
organizationally. Most police officers will tell you the pressure
doesn't come from street, but the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrison works for the same police agency as Gary Windsor, the
Dade County police officer who killed himself last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the days before his death, Windsor was anxious about changes
in his unit. The senior officer was retiring, leaving the
51-year-old Windsor with the most seniority in the office.
Ordinarily that would mean a promotion for Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   But his supervisor warned him ``not to bank on getting'' the
job, according to Windsor's wife of 26 years, Natalie. The senior
man retired on a Friday. The following Monday and Tuesday, Windsor
called in sick to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he told me on Monday that he wasn't going in, I said to
him, `If you don't get that position, don't be all upset about
it,''' Natalie Windsor recalled. ``He said, `Don't worry about it,
Nat. I have it covered.'''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, he drove his green and white cruiser to the edge
of a canal near his home, and shot himself in the head. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the line of duty?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Banuelos realized there was something different about her
husband's death when she was told the police department would not
provide a traditional gun salute at his funeral.
</P>
<P>
   A seven-year veteran of the Orange County Sheriff's Department
in southern California, Ernie Banuelos shot himself in his car in
March, 1997. Much of the traditional ceremony of police funerals
was missing from his service. The sheriff didn't even attend; a
spokesman said he was at a conference in Los Angeles at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Banuelos' colleagues wore black cloth over their badges
in tribute, but even that gesture was made over the objections of
supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheriff's department did nothing for me,'' said Sylvia
Banuelos, who blamed her husband's death on his long-standing
frustration at being unable to win a promotion while junior
deputies he believed were less qualified rose above him.
</P>
<P>
   Although the reaction of police departments varies, many suicide
survivors quickly find themselves cut off from the law enforcement
community and the blue wall of support extended to the families of
police officers killed in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   An officer killed in the line of duty is praised for his work by
colleagues and public officials. The death of an officer by suicide
often goes unnoticed by the public, hidden from view because of
shame and guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The families of officers killed in the line of duty are entitled
to a $100,000 federal payment, maximum pension benefits and
programs to pay for other expenses, including the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   For suicide survivors, there may be some pension benefits and
perhaps some money from life insurance, although some policies may
be voided if the death was a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits for police officers who kill themselves are so
meager that the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association is trying to
win approval of a special bill filed at the State House that would
provide $5,000 to the daughter of Jose Martinez, an officer who
killed himself in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, filed in 1995, is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Many families of police officers who commit suicide find
themselves angry, isolated, broke and stigmatized.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a law enforcement officer takes the oath and wears the
badge, you are told that you are part of a family for life,'' said
Sylvia Banuelos, who was left with four sons. ``There is no little
paragraph that says that if you take your own life that you are no
longer family, but that's the way it is because that is what
happened to my boys and me.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an extensive support network for families of those
killed in the line of duty, but nothing similar for suicide
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The spouses of police suicide victims argue their husbands and
wives were killed in the line of duty; it's just that they were the
victims of the strains and conflicts of police work instead of a
violent criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Since her husband's suicide earlier this year, Natalie Windsor
has been dwelling on an incident in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband was part of a team evicting people from an apartment
building. He was the first one in the building, and when he turned
inside the doorway, he saw a man pointing an Uzi automatic weapon
at him. Gary Windsor was not wearing a bulletproof vest. Before he
could draw his weapon, the man pulled the trigger. The weapon
misfired.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is so sad,'' she said, ``is had I lost him eight or nine
years ago, he would have been considered a great American hero.
Now, he is remembered as the guy who committed suicide. It's sad,
because he gave so much time to the department, and on roll call
day his name won't be called.''

DNA TEST MAY REVEAL IDENTITY OF THE `LADY OF THE DUNES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE EBBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVINCETOWN, Mass. _ She had come to be known as ``the lady of
the dunes,'' her mystery a grisly slice of town lore still clinging
to memory at the tip of Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Her body was found in 1974 amid the green pines and dry sand at
Race Point Beach. Her skull was crushed, by someone evidently
intent on taking not just her life but her identity: The killer had
also cut off her hands, leaving no fingerprints and rendering her
forever anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, perhaps. After 24 years in which the victim's name
has remained as elusive as the killer's, police believe they may
finally have a means of confirming her identity.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a decade, they have speculated that the victim may
have been Rory Gene Kesinger, a woman with her own history of
run-ins with the law who had disappeared after escaping from jail
the year before the murder. Recently, they used a private
investigator to track down Kesinger's mother, in the hopes of
verifying whether the victim was her daughter, using DNA testing
unheard of when the case began.
</P>
<P>
   Provincetown Police Detective Warren Tobias, the lead
investigator on the case, would not talk about the latest
developments. ``There are people with feelings in their lives we
have to consider,'' Tobias said. ``Although the case is 24 years
old, it doesn't make it any less painful for the people involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But the private investigator, Phillip E. White Jr., confirmed he
had located Kesinger's mother, and that she agreed to submit to a
blood test that could link her DNA to the victim's.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind,'' said White, ``the ultimate solution to this case
is at hand in the very foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The woman's badly decomposed body was found on July 26, 1974, by
a 13-year-old girl walking her dog. Pathologists thought she had
been dead for a few days, and blamed heat and dune flies for the
decomposition of her body.
</P>
<P>
   Police, searching for clues to the woman's identity, described
her to the media in detail: She was between 25 and 35 years old,
5-foot-6 to 5-foot-8, 140 to 150 pounds, with a long,
reddish-blonde ponytail. She had a size 34 waist, as shown by the
Wrangler jeans left folded beside her naked body. She had a blue
print bandana and was found lying on one side of her beach towel,
looking eerily as if she had been sharing it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their rich depiction, investigators had few clues to
chase. There was no sign of a struggle, leading police to believe
that the woman knew her attacker, and that she may even have been
killed somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   In a gruesome act, her killer tried to sever her head and
succeeded in cutting off her hands, replacing them with small piles
of pine needles gathered at the ends of her arms. Police believe
the mutilation was more crafty than perverse: The victim must have
had a criminal record, they reasoned, and her killer must have
feared that the fingerprints would pave an easy path for police to
pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she was a poor innocent,'' Tobias added. ``I
think she was a bad guy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rory Gene Kesinger, by police accounts, would have fit that
profile.
</P>
<P>
   At 15, she ran away from home _ police won't say where that home
was _ and already had a record in several states when she landed in
Massachusetts. She was allegedly a drug user involved in running
guns and drugs, tied in with bank-robbing accomplices, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was wanted all across the country at that time,'' said
Tobias.
</P>
<P>
   She was only 24, an attractive young woman, when Pembroke Police
Lieutenant Willard Boulter came upon her in January 1973. Boulter
was assisting Stoughton Police in delivering notice of a traffic
violation to a home in Pembroke, when Kesinger and several others
scurried out the back door into the woods.
</P>
<P>
   He caught Kesinger when she tripped and fell. The woman, wearing
only lingerie, claimed she had just been raped, but when Boulter
took her back to the house, she tried to steal his gun.
</P>
<P>
   He pushed her away and led her in the house, and as he called
for help, Kesinger turned off the lights and slipped into another
room. Boulter flicked on the lights to find Kesinger with a gun in
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, but I have to kill you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   He dove for her, pushed the gun to the side, threw her on the
floor, and handcuffed her. ``You would just not think that a
nice-looking girl like that would kill you in a heartbeat,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police took Kesinger to the hospital, where she ended up
stealing another officer's weapon. ``Die, you (expletive) pig,''
she hollered, aiming at the officer. Again, she was thwarted: He
flung up his hand and was able to keep the gun from firing.
</P>
<P>
   She was charged with two counts of assault with intent to murder
and sent to Plymouth County jail, said Sheriff Peter Forman.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't wait for trial. Sometime between the night of May 26,
1973, and the following morning, she escaped, using a hacksaw blade
that someone had smuggled into the jail for her. She went to the
window of the laundry room, tied together sheet after sheet, and
hacked the bar of the window until she could squeeze herself
through. Then she lowered herself to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Someone must have been waiting for her nearby in a car, Forman
said. She was never seen again, but her mark was indelible.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old prison, which is still up, you can still see the
cut marks on the bars where she cut out,'' Forman said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was back in 1989 that former police chief James Meads, who
had been dogging the case for 15 years, began theorizing that
Kesinger could be the lady of the dunes.
</P>
<P>
   By then, so many false starts had gone nowhere. There was an
armed robbery convict in a Maine prison who kept drawing women
without hands, but he died without offering insight. There was the
psychic who told Meads where to find the victim's hands, but the
tip led to a recently excavated site, its potential evidence swept
away. There were the people who would call Meads over the years,
reporting a missing daughter or niece who would later return.
</P>
<P>
   Police had little to go on; there was no DNA testing at the
time, so they had to rely on dental records.
</P>
<P>
   The victim had unusually expensive dental work _ $5,000 to
$7,000 worth of gold crowns. Police had distributed a description
to every dentist in Massachusetts, and contacted another 50 dental
societies, the FBI, the Canadian police, and Interpol for help.
They got nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found so many dentists had passed away or their records
were destroyed,'' Meads added. ``It was extremely frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he learned of Kesinger, who would have been 25 when she
disappeared from prison. Her photographs bore a remarkable
resemblance to a forensic artist's rendering of the victim, her
profile otherwise fit, and she had a criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   For years, though, police have been unable to prove or disprove
that theory. After the latest hope of a DNA link was reported
recently in the Cape Cod Times, investigators have been
tightlipped, saying that they must confirm the victim fits the
general profile before pursuing a costly DNA test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process now is to go back and do some background,'' said
State Police Sergeant Richard Nagle, of the Cold Case Unit, where
the Provincetown murder is the oldest unsolved case.
</P>
<P>
   Before the DNA test, anthropologists are conducting a more
thorough analysis of the victim's remains to verify the age, sex,
and racial makeup. If the information proves consistent with
Kesinger's profile, police will move forward with a DNA test of the
mother. If not, the only real lead in a 24-year-old mystery may
vanish as completely as Kesinger did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor, unfortunate young lady,'' said Meads, the former
chief. ``We put her in the Catholic cemetery as the unknown female.
Maybe if there's some closure, she'll be able to be removed and
brought home someplace.''

U.S. MARSHALS COULD LEARN A LESSON FROM THE LOCALS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The woman wants no more trouble than is
absolutely necessary, so I won't give you her name. But she has
been following this strange, disturbing business with Gary Evans.
She had a story for me.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Evans was the career criminal who'd confessed to five
murders and was facing either life imprisonment or the death
penalty. The district attorney was still mulling over which
alternative seemed more alluring when Evans took the decision out
of his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Evans was being transported in a van by the
U.S. Marshals Service between a courtroom in Albany and his jail
cell. As the van crossed the Troy-Menands Bridge, some 60 feet
above the Hudson River, one or more of these three thoughts popped
into Gary Evans' tiny mind:
</P>
<P>
   _ I can escape.
</P>
<P>
   _ I can save the overburdened taxpayers a ton of money by
killing myself.
</P>
<P>
   _ Duh.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever thought motivated him at the moment, Evans sailed
through the van window onto the bridge roadway. He scrambled up off
the pavement and took a spectacular swan dive off the bridge and
into the Hudson. Unfortunately for Evans, he landed in what turned
out to be less than a foot of water.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of the body showed that Evans had a handcuff key
stuffed up his nose and some other metal gear stashed on his person
that might have been used in an escape attempt. All of which raised
some intriguing questions _ not the least of which was whether the
U.S. Marshals Service is composed of people who, by comparison,
make the late and utterly unlamented Gary Evans seem like a Rhodes
scholar.
</P>
<P>
   For example, why was a guy this deadly in the back seat of a van
all by himself? Why wasn't a screen covering the van window? Why
wasn't somebody with a gun watching Evans, up close and personal?
Finally, is this the way serial killers are always transported? Is
security always so shoddy?
</P>
<P>
   Local and state authorities say it isn't _ that they're much
more careful with evil guys like Evans than the U.S. marshals
apparently were that day. The problem is that we have to take their
word for that. Who would have guessed that the feds would have been
so slipshod with so grim a character as Gary Evans?
</P>
<P>
   To reassure you, I thought you might like to hear the story the
woman told me the other day: She said, ``I'm a spiritual adviser
for young men who are incarcerated. I'm currently dealing with two
young men who are down at Greene County Correctional. A few months
ago, their grandfather had passed away. And they were transported
from Greene County up to Syracuse to attend the wake for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish you could have seen the security involved in that van.
There were two correctional officers in the front seat _ the driver
and a passenger. The boys were then behind them, shackled at the
feet, at the wrists. The wrist shackles were connected to the feet
shackles. And then there was a bar that went through not only the
shackles on the feet but also the handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind them, in the same van, was an armed correctional
officer. Now, these guys are doing four-to-12 on a possession and
sale charge _ certainly a lesser degree of crime than Evans.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy U.S. Marshal David Demmit, who supervises the U.S.
Marshals Service in the Albany area, says that changes in the way
the service does business are likely. Just a thought, but they
might consider doing what the state corrections department was
doing with those drug dealers. They also could attach inmates to
the old ball and chain.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least a boat anchor or two.
</P>

WASHINGTON SECURITY SIGNALS RISING US WARINESS OF TERROR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Security measures have tightened so considerably in
the nation's capital that tourists and area residents are taking
the threat of a terrorist attack seriously in a way they never have
before.
</P>
<P>
   At the Washington Monument, where concrete barriers, more
police, and a new security checkpoint were added this weekend,
Kenny Horseman admitted he felt afraid, especially when his
10-year-old daughter Abby asked if she was going to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to convince her she would be OK,'' said Horseman, a
registered nurse from Herlock, Md. ``It makes you wonder if they
are going to get us, and it makes you worry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared we'd be bombed,'' said Abby, with an embarrassed
shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Since last week's US missile attack on an alleged terrorist
network in Afghanistan and Sudan, which followed twin bombings on
Aug. 7 at US embassies in Africa, fear for basic personal safety is
creeping into the psyche of some visitors, who have long taken
America's geographic isolation as a guarantee of security.
</P>
<P>
   From Union Station and the National Museum of American History
to the Capitol building, more police, more barriers, and more gates
were added as protective measures.
</P>
<P>
   Other monuments, including the Jefferson Memorial, were also
barricaded to prevent a vehicle with explosives from coming within
striking distance. In high-risk areas like CIA headquarters, a
mobile command unit the size of a truck roamed the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Security has been tightened at places like the CIA, the State
Department, and the Pentagon in the wake of the strikes, as the FBI
has sent warnings to all law enforcement agencies, and airports
around the nation took added precautions.
</P>
<P>
   It is slowly dawning on people here that the first salvos in
this war on terrorism may not be the last and the uncertainty of
waging a battle with no clear targets and no clear end seems to be
provoking anxiety, especially among children.
</P>
<P>
   Another fear articulated by psychologists and sociologists is
that this country could become another Ireland or Israel, where
people learn to live with a constant threat of attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really jolts Americans because we've been immune to the
day-to-day psychological vigilance that other countries have
adopted,'' said Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles psychologist who
specializes in trauma and examined the Gulf War's affect on
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's worse for kids, who either exaggerate the threat or
deny it completely and ignore reality,'' he said. ``My son, for
example, asked me the other day if a package that arrived in the
mail had a bomb in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials acknowledged that last week's decision
to launch the air strikes courted the danger of possible reprisals.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright warned that what ``is very
important for the American people to understand is that there may
in fact be retaliatory actions. We are very concerned about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the embassy bombings, Osama bin Laden, the wealthy
Saudi believed to be the mastermind behind those attacks, had
announced: ``We do not differentiate between those dressed in
military uniforms and civilians; they are all targets in this
fatwa.''
</P>
<P>
   And people, who last week had no idea what ``fatwa,'' a death
edict, meant, now appear to be paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things feel out of control, but you can't live in constant
fear,'' said Ream Hasan, a mother and part-time teacher in Fairfax,
Va., touring the Washington Monument. ``These people want to stifle
your sense of security, but if you let them, they've won.''
</P>
<P>
   Another tourist, Mike Cahoon, a roofer from Manchester, N.H.,
said, ``I'm thinking retaliation. Hit and you get hit back. It
could be anybody, anytime. It could be somebody walks by you, and
boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Cahoon, however, said he doubted terrorists would reach into his
corner of New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are they going to do, blow up the granite? They'll hit
here, New York, or California.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaz Jadallah, a physician visiting from Lansing, Mich., simply
said: ``I'm not afraid, just more aware.''
</P>
<P>
   Rona Fields, a Washington-area psychologist and author of
several books on terrorist organizations, who has studied violent
groups such as the Khmer Rouge, said a slow psychological
transformation is under way in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike some of the previous fear syndromes that have
circulated through the populace, this is based in reality,'' said
Fields. ``We're not talking about a neurotic anxiety, but a
response to warnings and the need to mobilize security.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields added: ``These are people who see men, women, and
children as symbolic targets to be snuffed out. Members of
organizations committed to symbolic goals, like bin Laden's total
destruction of the US and everything it represents, are not at all
afraid of taking risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said education and preparation are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give people an expectation that there will be reprisals
and you heighten awareness, then there won't be a shock when
something occurs, and that minimizes fear,'' said a government
behavioral scientist, who asked not to be identified.

SILENT THUNDER 
In the Presence of Elephants 
By Katy Payne 
Simon &AMP; Schuster, 288 pp., Illustrated, $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Katy Payne listens to elephants.
</P>
<P>
   An acoustic biologist at Cornell University, Payne had studied
whale songs for 20 years when she turned her attention from the
largest sea animals to the largest land animals.
</P>
<P>
   Interested in elephant calls, Payne visited the Metro Washington
Park Zoo in Portland, Ore., and unearthed something unexpected.
While spending time near the elephants, she experienced ``a kind of
thrill in the air.'' Remembering the same sensation from a pipe
organ playing in a chapel, she realized she was feeling what she
could not hear. It was a moment of scientific discovery. Payne
concluded that the animals may have been communicating at
frequencies far below the detection of human ears.
</P>
<P>
   And that would make sense. Infrasound's long waves can travel
huge distances and are less diminished than high sounds by
obstacles such as trees. Infrasound is employed by blue whales. If
elephants used it, it would explain something that had puzzled
field biologists for years _ how elephants are able to coordinate
movement, to organize ``silently,'' even when physically far apart.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, Payne was back at the zoo, armed with
recording equipment and heading down a path of scientific inquiry.
The strength of ``Silent Thunder: In the Presence of Elephants'' is
that there are two journeys. One is an action-packed,
anecdote-rich, fact-filled research safari in which we camp out and
study elephants in Kenya, Namibia, and Zimbabwe. The other is a
sort of pilgrimage during which Payne weaves together her magical
farmland upbringing, a Quaker sensibility, the philosophy of the
Shona people she works with in Africa, and her own spiritual
leanings to form a philosophy of wise conservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water tastes of the pipes,'' Payne quotes the Quakers as
saying, ``so you may as well know a few things about the pipes.''
Because no observer is indifferent, she says, she gives us the full
picture of her life.
</P>
<P>
   We come to love the human characters and elephants alike. The
stories of her mother, who ``played the piano modestly and loved
the music of Bach immodestly,'' mingle with those of elephants: the
big strong bull who holds out his tentlike ear to shade a younger
companion from the searing sun; the female so desperate to mother
another's calf that she uses her trunk to steal milk from the
lactating female's teats to daub on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Payne braves the dangers of Africa: She drives down dangerously
steep grades, gets caught in a wild moment of elephant pandemonium,
and spends a night holding still inside a sleeping bag in a
stare-down contest with a drooling lion called Yellow Mane.
</P>
<P>
   But she is driven by this exciting research, which is opening a
new door into the world of elephants. Her projects, using recorded
elephant infrasound to examine reactions in other elephants, and
also radio collars to try to determine whether communications are
between family members appear to confirm that elephants use
infrasound to communicate, particularly with those closest
genetically to them.
</P>
<P>
   But as with all great projects, this one has raised even more
questions about this complex phenomenon. Do elephants employ
infrasound more at the times of day when temperature and other
conditions make the sound waves travel farther _ something like our
long-distance rates going down after 5 p.m.? Is there an elephant
dictionary?
</P>
<P>
   There is still much to study. But amid all this, Payne learns
that several bull elephants from a group she studied in Kenya have
been killed by hunters when they crossed the Tanzanian border, and
that many of her test subjects have been culled in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing what she does of the complex tapestry of elephant
society, the dependence of a group on its experienced matriarch,
and the large presence of elephants in the web of life, Payne makes
an emotional plea and a reasoned argument for new ways of elephant
management.
</P>
<P>
   The Shona people, whom Payne grows to know and love, have a
greeting that illustrates their philosophy: I am well if you are
well. Just like the author's recollection of her tight-knit family,
and like the Shona people who groaned in pain when she was injured
as though they had been struck, her memories of the elephants are
about the connections of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are memories of living elephants who were not dissected
into parts for analysis, but were so deeply a part of their larger
families, and the families so deeply a part of their societies, and
each society so fully embedded in its own land, and each land so
defined by the journeys and bonding calls of elephants, that
nothing less than the whole is real.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Next of Kin,'' Roger Fouts's deeply moving book about
chimpanzees, ``Silent Thunder'' challenges the reader to think
about these majestic animals in fresh ways by covering emotional
and philosophical terrain along with the scientific.

`AIR RAGE' NO LONGER TOLERATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   British Airways, a very civilized way to fly across the
Atlantic, is giving notice it will no longer tolerate ``air rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sept. 1, the airline is warning potential offenders
that they face arrest on landing unless they cease their
unacceptable behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown is triggered by a 400 percent rise in ``air rage''
incidents globally the last three years, and is specifically
targeted at drunk and abusive passengers and those breaking the
airline's worldwide smoking ban.
</P>
<P>
   While the airline said disruptive behavior is still rare among
the 40 million passengers who take 300,000 British Airways flights
every year, the company is standing firmly behind its cabin crews
in dealing with the problem. Last year, there were some 200
incidents, most related to the airline's smoking ban, a policy
British Airways said it has no plans to change.
</P>
<P>
   The airline also noted that disruptive passengers will be liable
for costs if the airline has to divert the flight.
</P>
<P>

Foliage stays
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With foliage season just around the corner, less than a month
away, where to stay becomes an issue for many. Upcountry foliage
season always means lots of sold-out accommodations along popular
routes, so if you haven't booked a room at a favorite inn, try now.
The colors begin in northern Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine
around mid-September and continue in southern New England almost to
November. Columbus Day weekend is traditionally the high point for
foliage and the busiest weekend for leaf viewing. The Globe's
Travel section will have a special foliage issue on Sept. 13. While
many accommodations will be sold out for foliage, lodging can still
be found through local chambers of commerce, and especially at ski
resorts throughout the region.

   Finland, which claims to be the home of the Claus family, is
opening the world's first Santa Claus University this month. The
fact that standards for candidates may not be politically correct
has been defended by Nino de Prado, North American marketing
director of the Finnish Tourist Board, who said, ``The demand that
candidates be size-appropriate, age-appropriate, and sufficiently
multilingual to say at least `Ho, ho, ho' in all major languages,
is dictated by the dreams of children all over the world, not just
by the founders of the world's first university for Santas.'' The
university will be in Rovaniemi, capital of Finish Lapland and the
legendary namesake's hometown. For information on how to arrange a
one-on-one meeting with Santa in Lapland, call the Finnish Tourist
Board at 212-885-9700. Ask also about the opening Nov. 28 of

   Just moments before the town of Assisi, Italy, was shaken by a

photographing the glorious frescoes by Giotto and Cimabue that have
adorned the upper basilica of the Basilica of St. Francis of
Assisi. Now those photographs, along with ones taken immediately
after the earthquake, are captured in ``The Basilica of St. Francis
of Assisi: Glory and Destruction'' (Abrams, $24.95). A description
of the frescoes is also included. Bonnie Burnham, president of the
World Monuments Fund, says she believes the book ``will focus
much-needed attention on the magnitude of the loss as well as the
need for international assistance.''

   Travel agents have been e-mailing tales like these to one
another:
</P>
<P>
   _A caller said she wanted to go to Capetown. The agent started
to explain about passport information when the caller interrupted
with, ``I'm not trying to make you look stupid, but Capetown is in
Massachusetts.'' Without trying to make her look stupid, the agent
explained, ``Cape Cod is in Massachusetts _ Capetown is in
Africa.'' Her response: Click.
</P>
<P>
   _A man phoned his agent to complain that he didn't know which
plane to get on. ``I was told my flight number is 823, but none of
these damn planes have numbers on them!''
</P>
<P>
   _A client asked, ``Would it be cheaper to fly to California and
then take the train to Hawaii?''
</P>
<P>
   _A woman wanted to know: ``Do airlines put your physical
description on your bag so they know whose luggage belongs to
who?'' ``No,'' the agent replied. ``Why?'' She said, ``Well, they
put a tag on my luggage that said FAT, and I'm overweight.'' She
was told the airline code for Fresno is FAT.
</P>

   _A woman said, ``I need to fly to Pepsi-Cola on one of those

<TEXT>
<P>
   VOLUBILIS, Morocco _ We're still speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Four days into our north African adventure, this doesn't
surprise us. But it's certain to amaze our friends back home. As a
sun the color of hot steel sets between the columns of these
ancient Roman ruins, we recall their worries and warnings and have
to laugh. After all, we are here as much to explore our new
relationship as we are to investigate the unfamiliar landscape.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, we have our first fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going on a trip right after I met my last
boyfriend,'' a female friend had volunteered when she heard of our
plans. ``That's how he became my last boyfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh wow, are you guys really that serious?'' a male friend had
asked. ``I'm not sure I could spend two weeks straight with my
wife, and she already knows every lousy thing about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Our parents wisely withheld comment, except to wish us luck.
</P>
<P>
   Now we are having what we hope is only a fatigue-induced fight _
over whose camera has the better timer and would best capture our
happiness on film. The spat ends in seconds, proving our friends
both wrong and right. We're still glad to have two weeks together
in Morocco; we're also aware for the first time that neither of us
has ever seen the other suffer from serious indigestion.
</P>
<P>
   The olives hit hard in the next town, Meknes. Or maybe it is the
daylong smorgasbord: the Moroccan equivalent of an almond milkshake
for breakfast, the Chicken Tangier and couscous for lunch, and the
afternoon snack of sesame paste and pistacchio nuts washed down
with a liter of Orange Crush _ an eating frenzy accompanied by the
smell of freshly slaughtered camel heads hanging in the market.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh oh, I'm going to see Daniel throw up for the first time,''
I think as I grab the bag of green, black, and red olives from him.
Daniel hasn't traveled much, I have, and I can see stomach upset
coming from a mile away. He's going to have it something fierce.
I'm not sure I'm ready for this much closeness after just months of
dating.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the first time I got down on my knees for Lynda it
would be to propose,'' I think as another wave of nausea sends me
to the regrettably thin-walled bathroom. ``If she stays with me
through this, she could stay with me through anything. Still, I
wait for an `I told you so' _ or, better yet, for her to get sick,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough we're back on the road, feeling better, looking
worse but hardly caring because our relationship has so obviously
deepened during the last few days. We have our very own inside joke
now. Unfortunately, it concerns vomit, but still it's ours. We
start putting it on postcards home.
</P>
<P>
   By Fez, the jokes are piling up, and we start to wonder what is
missing from our friends' relationships. We're smug with
self-satisfaction, hardly mentioning that one of us talks too much
first thing in the morning and that the other gets grumpy when she
doesn't get enough sleep even though she refuses to go to bed
before midnight. As we wander the mazelike medina, hunting for
rugs, sipping mint tea, mangling our limited Arabic, and fending
off would-be guides, we develop a rhythm so certain that it starts
to seem like we've known each other forever.
</P>
<P>
   We choose our roles carefully, and we stick to them. In a
variation of the good-cop, bad-cop routine, one of us is the
haggler, one of us pretends to hate shopping. By day's end, one of
us actually does. Actual entries from the separate travel journals
we are keeping as documentation of our idyll:

   ``Today a rug merchant offered me a camel in trade for Lynda.
Apparently I'm more annoyed by her inability to choose a carpet
than the Moroccans. For a full 5 seconds, I wondered how I would
get a camel back to the states.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   ``Starting tomorrow, I'm in charge of carrying the cash. Before
I grabbed the money belt today, Daniel was seriously negotiating
the price of one of those floor-length hooded outfits like Obi-Wan
Kenobi wore in Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next day we decide to take a break from the pungent, often
unidentifiable aromas that fill the outdoor markets known as souks.
We've smelled henna by the handful and inhaled more donkey dung
than imaginable. We've seen the rooftops lined with drying leather
and the backstreets blossoming with fig necklaces for sale. Through
most of it we've managed to hold hands and our tongues. Now we need
a change of scenery and some fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   The guidebook makes Ain-leuh, a tiny Berber village set in a
lush green landscape, sound both romantic and easily reachable.
With gas station bathrooms tending toward the hole-in-the-floor
variety, the less time spent in the car the better. The drive takes
about two hours, and we pass it warding off the evil eye from
disappointed Moroccans standing on the roadside hoping for a ride.
According to local lore, the best way to do this is to extend one
arm, palm out, in the direction of the ill-will. As a backup, there
is always the chameleon trick. Toss one in the fire. If it pops,
you're safe. If not, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the hand works pretty well, too. We arrive in
Ain-leuh &UR;  &LR; on what turns out to be market day, but we don't care if
we miss the most amazing bargains. All we want is to walk and talk
and watch them watching us. The only Americans in town, we know we
stick out. Every time we touch _ sometimes out of necessity, so we
don't lose each other in the crowd, mostly out of affection _
schoolgirls giggle, women frown, and men leer. They're just
jealous, we think.
</P>
<P>
   The day is a perfect blend of warm weather, inviting country
air, and a soft blue sky. Berbers in traditional robes and turbans
keep a respectful distance but happily sit for photographs and
endure our attempts to question them in Arabic. ``How much does
that cost?'' can take two minutes to get across. The slow pace is a
pleasure after frantic Fez, and we hop on a stone fence, lean back
to back, and start writing and drawing in our diaries.
</P>
<P>
   The calm doesn't last long. One of us, entranced by the men
walking their sheep like wheelbarrows, wants to stay. One of us,
having had his fill of farm animals, wants to stick to a previously
determined schedule.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Never travel with someone who's only gone on bus tours of
Europe before,'' I think. What I say is, ``Daniel, honey, a
schedule is just a way of keeping track of the things you'll
inevitably miss.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Never go to farm country with someone who grew up in the
city,'' I think. What I say is, ``Lynda, honey, if you wanted to
look at wool, we could have stayed in Fez and spent the day
shopping for rugs.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We trudge back to the car, a matchbox-size Peugeot that
redundantly has the word ``Jr.'' embossed on its side. We have too
much fun making fun of it to stay mad when we're inside. Plus, we
can't help smiling each time we pass a checkpoint and have to hand
our passports over to the Moroccan version of the highway patrol.
``Do you know Arnold Schwarzenegger?'' one officer asks. ``Brooke
Shields, a friend?'' asks another. We lie both times, saying lam,
or yes, and are waved through without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway to Fez, we see a stand covered in shiny shawls and
beaded blankets, rugs thrown out in welcome. One of us thinks, ``Oh
yeah, shopping opportunity.'' The other thinks, ``Oh no, shopping
opportunity.'' We're both wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The stand is a portable photography studio, specializing in the
sort of dress-up shots normally associated with Old Tucson Studios
or Western theme parks. Of course, in this case the cowboy hats are
felt fezzes, and the six-shooters are, instead, sabers. Parents pay
about $1 for portraits of their babies painted like little dolls.
Newlywed couples who can't afford personal photographers come by to
don traditional wedding garb and act out the big day for the
camera.
</P>
<P>
   We decide to be one of those couples, if only for an afternoon.
In the photos we take away with us, we are draped in robes and
scarves in colors we would never consider at home. We are wearing
headdresses. The glint from the spangles that are on every surface
is reflected in our eyes. We are looking at each other, and in that
instant we could be any of the other dusk-skinned couples who are
so certain they will stick it out that they record their commitment
for the cameras. We look like we are starting to &UR;  &LR; know each other's
secrets.

NOTHING TO DO, AND ENJOYING IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By M.R. MONTGOMERY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN PATRICIO, N.M. _ Sometimes the perfect destination is a
place with nothing to do. There is very little going on in San
Patricio most days. Oh, the occasional polo game on the grassy
field across from the Wyeth-Hurd La Rinconada Gallery will break
the quiet. Sunday Mass. A card game at the Senior Citizens Center.
That's about it.
</P>
<P>
   A small river comes down through the valley here, the Rio
Ruidoso, the Noisy River. It's pretty quiet actually, but this is
so far south and east in New Mexico that any running water is rare.
A river strong enough to make a noise you can hear from a distance
would be very ruidoso indeed, and a pleasant sound, after you
crossed the dry plains that stretch away toward Roswell and off to
the Gulf of Mexico. The Rio Ruidoso doesn't get even to Roswell
before it sinks into the desert and disappears forever.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, if there's a river, there's a mountain to make it,
and the headwaters of the Ruidoso are up in the Mescalero Apache
Reservation on El Capitan mountain. (Most Southwest ranges have an
El Capitan, if there's one peak clearly higher and more
authoritative than any other.) They come up from Texas to Ruidoso
for cold air, horse races, and skiing in the winter. It is natural
air conditioning for the people of the plains.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurd Ranch (home base of the extended family of Hurds
married to Wyeths) has just gone into the guesthouse business,
having a few extra homes on the spread that they could make
available to the traveler. Two are down in the valley, set in
orchards and horse pastures along the Ruidoso, the third is halfway
up the hill with a fine view of absolutely nothing but rangeland,
cottonwoods along the river, and buzzards.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the most exciting thing that happens in San Patricio
on a regular basis is the convention of buzzards that return every
evening from scavenging on the plains down river. They come
silently, first one, then another, and suddenly, on a clear, fair,
evening, a turning gyre, a conical spiral, of wheeling buzzards
that doesn't literally fill the air but does punctuate the
darkening sky with black chevrons of descending birds.
</P>
<P>
   How odd that Hinckley, Ohio, has a buzzard festival, and San
Patricio doesn't. Of course, there isn't much to do in Hinckley,
and the buzzards do arrive on schedule every year on April 19, St.
Joseph's Day. Still, the buzzard roost in Hinckley is just a bunch
of trees a ways off in the distance across some farm fields. Why do
we admire the punctual wild thing, and ignore the more casual
buzzards of San Patricio, who hang around all year? They do return
to roost every day, but not by the clock. They come back when it
gets late enough to make them think about getting home before dark
and before the loss of daylight's sun-heated updrafts of air would
make them flap home instead of soar home.
</P>
<P>
   Plan for the day at the Hurd Ranch: Make breakfast, take a ride
down the highway, come back, crack a beer, light the barbecue
(mesquite and pine logs), watch the buzzards, eat dinner, go to bed
when it gets dark. You could live a long life with a Hurd Ranch
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you could drive to Roswell, less than an hour away, and
visit the UFO Museum and Research Center. It's recently opened in a
new star base on Main Street that's a former movie theater with an
Art Deco canopy that much predates, but eerily resembles, the
flying saucers that brought us the alien beings just after World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   They had the 50th anniversary of the Roswell Incident last
summer. A simple incident: A saucer crashed. Alien bodies were
examined and buried in secret. The government covered it up. You
can believe in flying saucers or you can believe in physics.
</P>
<P>
   Many years ago, shortly after the Roswell Incident, I had a
memorable high school science teacher whose motto was ``Faith in
Physics.'' He was fond of illustrating simple concepts in dramatic
ways. His best demonstration was of the principle of inertia. He
had a 20-pound lead weight hung on a strand of wire from the center
of the lecture room ceiling. One by one, we would sit in a chair on
one side of the room, the 20 pound weight would be brought to us,
we would press it against our foreheads and let it swing. Those who
could sit still in their chair as the weight returned from the far
wall toward our foreheads would get a passing mark, at minimum,
because we had faith in physics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the UFO Museum does center a small array of Alien Being
gift shops. I particularly liked Star Child, where they had
T-shirts with more humor and less preaching. The newest T-shirt
admonishes you to: ``Fly Alien Airlines, Only One Crash in Fifty
Years.'' I'll stick with Qantas.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Alien Beings, you can visit more plausible historical
sites within a few miles of the Hurd Ranch. Just around the corner
is Lincoln, brief and final home of Billy the Kid. The Lincoln
County Wars were all about cattle _ buying them, stealing them,
selling them to the Army post and the Apache Reservation. Billy the
Kid was a bit player who probably killed a few less people than he
boasted about, but enough to get him killed in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln is a particularly sedate little town, now, with art
galleries and a gourmet restaurant in the old Wortley Hotel. The
Wortley, once owned by Sheriff Pat Garrett (``The dirty little
coward,'' as the old song goes, ``who shot Mr. Howard, and laid our
poor Billy in his grave''), has the ultimate in amenities if you
are tired of the 20th century. Nothing in the rooms but period
furniture. No TV. No phone. Certainly no computer work station and
data line. You could have a good rest in the Wortley, which only
lacks a serious buzzard roost in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they haven't had a good gunfight in Lincoln
for almost a hundred years, which tends to disinterest the
buzzards.

ESPN MUSCLES IN ON LITTLE LEAGUERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's just give ESPN the benefit of the doubt, and say that the
cable sports giant, which arguably has become larger than
professional sports, is suffering from growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, no one would have cared what advertisements the
network ran.
</P>
<P>
   Not so today. Because ESPN owns significant pieces of television
rights to professional football, baseball, hockey, college sports,
X Games, fishing, beach volleyball _ did anyone mention
``SportsCenter''? _ what goes on their air matters.
</P>
<P>
   Beer is one thing, but muscle enhancers?
</P>
<P>
   During Monday's Little League playoff game between teams from
Jenison, Mich., and Greenville, N.C., ESPN ran a 30-second spot
bought by the makers of Creatine, an over-the-counter
muscle-builder.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Federal Drug Administration has approved its use as a
nutritional supplement, no one knows whether their are longterm ill
effects from Creatine, especially when to competitive athletes who
may use a variety of substances to improve their performances.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire, for instance, has acknowledged
using Creatine as well as a legal anabolic steroid called
Androstenedoine for the past year. To some, his use of such
substances diminishes his challenge to Roger Maris's home run
record.
</P>
<P>
   Is he live or the product of better chemistry?
</P>
<P>
   The use of Creatine remains an open question. The substance is
produced naturally in the liver and kidneys and is found in meat.
Some athletes call it ``muscle candy'' and argue that it is safer
than steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Creatine has exploded off the health store shelves.
Sales hit $30 million in 1995, $100 million in 1997, and are
expected to reach $180 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of powder.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the American College of Sports Medicine issued a
statement conceding that little was known about the long-term use
of Creatine, but in short-term studies, ``no negative side effects
have been documented in scientific literature.'' But the report
also stated that the ``verdict is still out on the safety of
Creatine supplementation, especially over long periods of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing anecdotal evidence, the ACSM and the American Dietetic
Association reported some health problems, including stomach
cramps, nausea, and higher blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Without any clear answers, individuals are left to make up their
own minds, and in that gray area, the airing of Creatine
commercials by ESPN amounts to tacit approval.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear. Airing the commercial during the Little
League World Series, presumably when young athletes are watching,
is pretty shameful.
</P>
<P>
   There's some money that is just not worth having, and while the
product is legal, showing sculpted bodies enhanced by Creatine is
not the way to encourage the young _ or old _ about sweat equity.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hitting the roof
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The History Channel will have an interesting special on domed
stadiums Thursday from 10-11 p.m. The documentary begins with the
Houston Astrodome and runs through Toronto's SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Dietrich, supervising producer of ``Modern Marvels,'' said
one of the fascinating aspects of the Toronto stadium is its
retractable roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's based very loosely on the lobster shell,'' she said. ``If
you look at the different sections, like the lobster tail, one can
see how it hinges together.''
</P>
<P>
   The show details how the designers of Montreal's domed stadium
did not take into account the weight of snow, which caused its roof
to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Dietrich said that, to some, domed stadiums are shrines, almost
like cathedrals.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the true sports fans, these domed stadiums are every bit
important as Notre Dame.''

 &HT;    LETTER FROM MOSCOW: DEAR MOM, SEND CASH
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International (k) Commentary categories.
 &HT;    For Use Thursday, Aug. 27 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A note to Bill Clinton: On your scheduled trip to
Moscow next week, please bring dollars. The 10,000 American
expatriates in this city, not to mention 10 million or so Russians,
could use them.
</P>
<P>
   We'll write you a check ... honest.
</P>
<P>
   It is grim business for Russia, this main event of faltering
banks, plummeting stocks and the withering ruble -- a financial
crisis called ``Indonesia with nukes'' by some Western bankers.
</P>
<P>
   It has spawned a curious sideshow: Dollars are scarce and people
are spending considerable amounts of time and effort trying to find
them.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of spotting an automatic teller machine (ATM) that will
accept a U.S. bank card and spit out dollars now spread through the
city like news of a UFO sighting.
</P>
<P>
   A woman I know was nearly mobbed on the street the other day as
she pulled a $20 bill out of her wallet on her approach to a
currency-exchange window. The eager Russians around her wanted to
trade their rickety rubles for her bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sort of ironic that we are so used to U.S. dollars being
available everywhere and all of that seems to be over for the time
being,'' said Paul Backer, an American lawyer in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The ruble may be legal tender in Russia, but the dollar is
serious cash. It is illegal to pay in dollars for goods and
services, and unlawful for merchants to accept them. But, well,
let's just say it happens -- often.
</P>
<P>
   In value terms, estimates say there are as many U.S. dollars in
circulation in Russia as there are rubles.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Aug. 17 announcement of devaluation that allows the
ruble to slide against the dollar by as much as 34 percent -- to
9.5 rubles to the dollar compared to its previous value of 6.2 --
dollars were easily accessible at banks, at American Express and
from ATMs in major hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before the announcement, I happened to walk in to the
American Express bank and cashed a U.S. check in order to pay my
telephone bill and other work expenses. They handed over $1,000 in
rubles and $2,000 in U.S. currency without a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, the government devalued the ruble. Twenty
minutes later, an American colleague went to AmEx to pick up $8,000
wired to him by his editors. All banking services were closed. He
is still waiting for his money.
</P>
<P>
   Well-salaried expatriates are cash-starved. An American woman in
search of a working ATM posted a message on a computerized bulletin
board last week. Where can I go to get dollars, she asked. Someone
replied: Try the corner of 52nd and Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   It is no joke. Some Americans are contemplating trips to
Helsinki or Warsaw simply to get dollars wired from America and
bring them back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   As for Russians, most of whom receive their pay in rubles, they
spend what they need to survive and convert the rest to dollars as
a form of cookie-jar savings account.
</P>
<P>
   That's why there are almost as many currency-exchange booths in
Russia as there are places to buy vodka, in other words, on just
about every other street corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dollar is in fact our national currency,'' quipped the
newspaper Sevodnya about last week's ruble devaluation, ``so let it
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the ruble dropping, the price of dollars is going up.
Nervous banks and people are hoarding. Large Western companies
doing business in Russia are getting their dollars for now, but
they fear their corporate wire-transfers eventually could be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper offered a clip-and-save guide for
Russians to cope with the crisis, including tips such as: if you
were waiting to buy that TV or fridge, do it now. And don't
needlessly rush to exchange rubles for dollars as that will only
weaken rubles further.
</P>
<P>
   The advice concluded: ``If your savings are in a strong, hard
currency, you have just wasted your time reading this list.''

SKIP AWAY UP FOR SOME LIGHT WORK AT MONMOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks as if Skip Away, the leading candidate to be Horse of
the Year, will have the closest thing possible to a walkover in
Sunday's $500,000 Iselin Handicap at Monmouth Park. As soon as it
was announced that Skip Away would carry 131 pounds, two
predictable things happened. Trainer Sonny Hine complained about
the weights, and all of Skip Away's legitimate opponents ran away
as fast as they could.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Skip Away was assigned just 1 more pound than he
carried to an easy, track-record victory in the Massachusetts
Handicap at Suffolk Downs May 30, Hine was not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they're just trying to be fair,'' said Hine. ``I said
a long time ago, if you have the fastest car, they give you the
pole. They don't put lead weights on Michael Jordan. Horse racing
is the only sport that tries to get the big champions beat. But we
accept the weight. Sometimes, I question the spread, but I see what
the racing secretary is trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the connections of Silver Charm, Awesome Again, and
Frisk Me Now, the next three highweights, took the first bus out of
town. Bob Baffert, the master of the bob-and-weave who trains
Silver Charm, assigned 125 pounds, has no intention of taking on
Skip Away until he must. Pat Byrne, who trains Awesome Again, given
120, talked bravely until the weights came out; now it looks as if
he'll stay at Saratoga. And Bob Durso, whose Frisk Me Now was
assessed 118, will hold his charge out because of a cough.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm, who has been beaten in his last two starts, worked
6 furlongs in a rapid 1:12 1/5 at Del Mar Sunday. However, Baffert
has not set a schedule for the big gray, who was 3-year-old
champion last year and won the $4 million Dubai World Cup this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea yet where I'm going to run him, but I'm
starting to get him cranked up again,'' said Baffert. ``This was a
really good move for him. He's starting to look a lot better, a lot
fitter. He's getting closer to a race. We might shoot for something
in September or October. I'm playing it by ear. He's coming around
and going forward and that's all I can ask. I'm not ruling out the
Breeders' Cup Classic (Nov. 7 at Churchill Downs) if I can get him
back into top form.''
</P>
<P>
   Awesome Again looked sensational winning the Whitney Handicap at
Saratoga Aug. 8, but Byrne feels an 11-pound weight concession from
Skip Away is not enough. It appears he will race instead in the
$300,000 Saratoga Breeders' Cup, run the same day as the Iselin.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal feeling is to go back to Saratoga because I know
the horse likes the track,'' said Byrne. ``But owner Frank Stronach
is in Austria, and he will make the final decision. We only got 11
pounds from Skip Away. I think we should have gotten 13 or 14, and
I told them that if we got that much, we would definitely come.''
</P>
<P>
   Frisk Me Now is a horse who has danced often, gliding from track
to track, but he'll be a wallflower for the Iselin, even though
he's based in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been coughing since he came back from Saratoga,'' said
Durso. ``I thought he was over it last week, but we had him out on
the track and he started coughing again when he came back. I'm
really disappointed about missing the Iselin. I had planned to give
him some time off but not right now. But I'll give him a rest and
point for the Meadowlands Cup (Oct. 16).''
</P>
<P>
   All of these maneuvers leave lightweights _ literally and
figuratively _ Testafly, at 114 pounds, and Stormin Fever, at 113,
as the main competition in the Iselin for last year's handicap
champion.
</P>
<P>
   So only accident or injury can stop Skip Away from winning his
sixth straight race of the year and remaining undefeated. After the
Iselin, though, come the Woodward Stakes (Sept. 19 at Belmont), the
Jockey Club Gold Cup (Oct. 10, also at Belmont), and the Breeders'
Cup Classic. Those are the races in which Skip Away must prove his
greatness. The Iselin, no matter how worried Sonny Hine claims to
be, is merely a public workout.

   Manistique, who won her first three races in California by a
combined 31 lengths, came into last Saturday's $250,000 Alabama
Stakes at Saratoga touted as perhaps the next Ruffian. Ruffian was
the great, undefeated 3-year-old filly who broke down in a match
race with Kentucky Derby winner Foolish Pleasure at Belmont in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   Bet down to 3-5 by the bedazzled New York crowd even though she
had never run the 1 1/4-mile Alabama distance, Manistique failed,
finishing third behind Banshee Breeze and Lu Ravi, although it was
not all her fault. The big daughter of 1990 Kentucky Derby winner
Unbridled, too large to race at age 2, displaced her palate during
the running of the race, something that was immediately noticed by
jockey Gary Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   ``She relaxed well but then she started making funny noises,''
said Stevens immediately after he dismounted. ``I felt she
displaced something. She just started wilting underneath me. She
came home on class alone. My race was over at the three-eighths
pole. She has all the tools and the talents to do it. Something
went wrong today.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspicions of Stevens were confirmed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Monday``She displaced a little,'' said trainer John Shirreffs.
``Sometimes you can correct the problem with an equipment change,
like a figure-8 bit or a tongue tie; other times it requires
surgery. It's still too early to see which way we're going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Banshee Breeze, also a daughter of Unbridled, is a top filly who
was coming off of a win in the demanding 1 1/2-mile Coaching Club
American Oaks at Belmont. Ridden by Jerry Bailey, Banshee Breeze
won by 6 lengths in the time of 2:03 2/5 and returned $6.70 to win.
Banshee Breeze, who has won five of nine starts (9-5-1-2), is owned
by James Tafel and is the first important horse trainer Carl
Nafzger has had since Unbridled.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was strong at every point,'' said Bailey. ``We tucked in
behind Manistique and then Banshee Breeze really exploded at the
head of the stretch. I didn't have a lot to overcome at any time. I
had a lot of horse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been doing fantastic; I can't say enough about her,''
said Nafzger, who is pointing Banshee Breeze toward the Spinster at
Keeneland (Oct. 17), and then the Breeders' Cup Distaff. ``She's
just a really good filly. She'll close from anywhere. She's learned
to finish, she's matured. She does a lot of things like Unbridled.
They are a lot alike.''

   Puerto Madero, an import from Chile who ran a strong second to

<P>
   Trainer Richard Mandella reported that the 4-year-old, who is a
stout closer, was stiff and sore after the Pacific Classic and may
have wrenched his back.

 &HT;    LETTER FROM MOSCOW: DEAR MOM, SEND CASH
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International (k) Commentary categories.
 &HT;    For Use Thursday, Aug. 27 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A note to Bill Clinton: On your scheduled trip to
Moscow next week, please bring dollars. The 10,000 American
expatriates in this city, not to mention 10 million or so Russians,
could use them.
</P>
<P>
   We'll write you a check ... honest.
</P>
<P>
   It is grim business for Russia, this main event of faltering
banks, plummeting stocks and the withering ruble -- a financial
crisis called ``Indonesia with nukes'' by some Western bankers.
</P>
<P>
   It has spawned a curious sideshow: Dollars are scarce and people
are spending considerable amounts of time and effort trying to find
them.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of spotting an automatic teller machine (ATM) that will
accept a U.S. bank card and spit out dollars now spread through the
city like news of a UFO sighting.
</P>
<P>
   A woman I know was nearly mobbed on the street the other day as
she pulled a $20 bill out of her wallet on her approach to a
currency-exchange window. The eager Russians around her wanted to
trade their rickety rubles for her bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sort of ironic that we are so used to U.S. dollars being
available everywhere and all of that seems to be over for the time
being,'' said Paul Backer, an American lawyer in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The ruble may be legal tender in Russia, but the dollar is
serious cash. It is illegal to pay in dollars for goods and
services, and unlawful for merchants to accept them. But, well,
let's just say it happens -- often.
</P>
<P>
   In value terms, estimates say there are as many U.S. dollars in
circulation in Russia as there are rubles.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Aug. 17 announcement of devaluation that allows the
ruble to slide against the dollar by as much as 34 percent -- to
9.5 rubles to the dollar compared to its previous value of 6.2 --
dollars were easily accessible at banks, at American Express and
from ATMs in major hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before the announcement, I happened to walk in to the
American Express bank and cashed a U.S. check in order to pay my
telephone bill and other work expenses. They handed over $1,000 in
rubles and $2,000 in U.S. currency without a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, the government devalued the ruble. Twenty
minutes later, an American colleague went to AmEx to pick up $8,000
wired to him by his editors. All banking services were closed. He
is still waiting for his money.
</P>
<P>
   Well-salaried expatriates are cash-starved. An American woman in
search of a working ATM posted a message on a computerized bulletin
board last week. Where can I go to get dollars, she asked. Someone
replied: Try the corner of 52nd and Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   It is no joke. Some Americans are contemplating trips to
Helsinki or Warsaw simply to get dollars wired from America and
bring them back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   As for Russians, most of whom receive their pay in rubles, they
spend what they need to survive and convert the rest to dollars as
a form of cookie-jar savings account.
</P>
<P>
   That's why there are almost as many currency-exchange booths in
Russia as there are places to buy vodka, in other words, on just
about every other street corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dollar is in fact our national currency,'' quipped the
newspaper Sevodnya about last week's ruble devaluation, ``so let it
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the ruble dropping, the price of dollars is going up.
Nervous banks and people are hoarding. Large Western companies
doing business in Russia are getting their dollars for now, but
they fear their corporate wire-transfers eventually could be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper offered a clip-and-save guide for
Russians to cope with the crisis, including tips such as: if you
were waiting to buy that TV or fridge, do it now. And don't
needlessly rush to exchange rubles for dollars as that will only
weaken rubles further.
</P>
<P>
   The advice concluded: ``If your savings are in a strong, hard
currency, you have just wasted your time reading this list.''

WASHINGTON SECURITY SIGNALS RISING US WARINESS OF TERROR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Security measures have tightened so considerably in
the nation's capital that tourists and area residents are taking
the threat of a terrorist attack seriously in a way they never have
before.
</P>
<P>
   At the Washington Monument, where concrete barriers, more
police, and a new security checkpoint were added this weekend,
Kenny Horseman admitted he felt afraid, especially when his
10-year-old daughter Abby asked if she was going to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to convince her she would be OK,'' said Horseman, a
registered nurse from Herlock, Md. ``It makes you wonder if they
are going to get us, and it makes you worry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared we'd be bombed,'' said Abby, with an embarrassed
shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Since last week's US missile attack on an alleged terrorist
network in Afghanistan and Sudan, which followed twin bombings on
Aug. 7 at US embassies in Africa, fear for basic personal safety is
creeping into the psyche of some visitors, who have long taken
America's geographic isolation as a guarantee of security.
</P>
<P>
   From Union Station and the National Museum of American History
to the Capitol building, more police, more barriers, and more gates
were added as protective measures.
</P>
<P>
   Other monuments, including the Jefferson Memorial, were also
barricaded to prevent a vehicle with explosives from coming within
striking distance. In high-risk areas like CIA headquarters, a
mobile command unit the size of a truck roamed the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Security has been tightened at places like the CIA, the State
Department, and the Pentagon in the wake of the strikes, as the FBI
has sent warnings to all law enforcement agencies, and airports
around the nation took added precautions.
</P>
<P>
   It is slowly dawning on people here that the first salvos in
this war on terrorism may not be the last and the uncertainty of
waging a battle with no clear targets and no clear end seems to be
provoking anxiety, especially among children.
</P>
<P>
   Another fear articulated by psychologists and sociologists is
that this country could become another Ireland or Israel, where
people learn to live with a constant threat of attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really jolts Americans because we've been immune to the
day-to-day psychological vigilance that other countries have
adopted,'' said Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles psychologist who
specializes in trauma and examined the Gulf War's affect on
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's worse for kids, who either exaggerate the threat or
deny it completely and ignore reality,'' he said. ``My son, for
example, asked me the other day if a package that arrived in the
mail had a bomb in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials acknowledged that last week's decision
to launch the air strikes courted the danger of possible reprisals.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright warned that what ``is very
important for the American people to understand is that there may
in fact be retaliatory actions. We are very concerned about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the embassy bombings, Osama bin Laden, the wealthy
Saudi believed to be the mastermind behind those attacks, had
announced: ``We do not differentiate between those dressed in
military uniforms and civilians; they are all targets in this
fatwa.''
</P>
<P>
   And people, who last week had no idea what ``fatwa,'' a death
edict, meant, now appear to be paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things feel out of control, but you can't live in constant
fear,'' said Ream Hasan, a mother and part-time teacher in Fairfax,
Va., touring the Washington Monument. ``These people want to stifle
your sense of security, but if you let them, they've won.''
</P>
<P>
   Another tourist, Mike Cahoon, a roofer from Manchester, N.H.,
said, ``I'm thinking retaliation. Hit and you get hit back. It
could be anybody, anytime. It could be somebody walks by you, and
boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Cahoon, however, said he doubted terrorists would reach into his
corner of New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are they going to do, blow up the granite? They'll hit
here, New York, or California.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaz Jadallah, a physician visiting from Lansing, Mich., simply
said: ``I'm not afraid, just more aware.''
</P>
<P>
   Rona Fields, a Washington-area psychologist and author of
several books on terrorist organizations, who has studied violent
groups such as the Khmer Rouge, said a slow psychological
transformation is under way in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike some of the previous fear syndromes that have
circulated through the populace, this is based in reality,'' said
Fields. ``We're not talking about a neurotic anxiety, but a
response to warnings and the need to mobilize security.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields added: ``These are people who see men, women, and
children as symbolic targets to be snuffed out. Members of
organizations committed to symbolic goals, like bin Laden's total
destruction of the US and everything it represents, are not at all
afraid of taking risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said education and preparation are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give people an expectation that there will be reprisals
and you heighten awareness, then there won't be a shock when
something occurs, and that minimizes fear,'' said a government
behavioral scientist, who asked not to be identified.

FOR CONGRESS, A WAY OUT OF THE QUAGMIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Trent Lott started it back in March. He got no
bandwagon rolling _ the Senate majority leader rarely does _ but
the idea of Congress officially condemning President Clinton's
behavior, assuming it doesn't include an actual and proved abuse of
his office, such as obstruction of justice, has hung around.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, it is not gaining ground, but it has gained some
attention. It deserves to gain more, as long as various carts are
not placed before various horses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the somewhat increased level of attention for
what shorthand is calling a ``censure'' of Clinton, what I find
most interesting is that the topic is being discussed way up the
president's chain of command. That's far from official, or even an
indication of his own views, but it is plenty interesting and trial
balloons have flown with a lot less helium than that.
</P>
<P>
   From this perspective, censure stinks, if by that is meant a
distinct measure drafted and approved by both houses of Congress.
But there are other ways of skinning the same cat.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the only use of censure on a president in
American history left an aroma that is still around. In 1834, a
Whig-controlled Senate formally censured President Andrew Jackson
for a controversial use of power regarding a giant bone of
contention in those days, the national bank. Jackson rightly
accused his Whig opponents of lacking the guts to impeach him, and
when they lost the Senate two years later, the censure was promptly
withdrawn. No one has seriously attempted such a stunt since.
</P>
<P>
   For another, a motion of censure would set weird, if not bad
precedents. Since the grounds would presumably be an appalling
sexual liaison with a young woman and an effort to keep it secret
that included lying to the public, the question would arise if that
is the standard for such an action Congress means to set. What
about other presidential lies, for example, and what about other
examples of lies with huge public consequences (like the Vietnam
War) that get de facto grandfather status?
</P>
<P>
   There's still a way, however. The independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, is finally on the verge of presenting evidence to the House
of Representatives. Assuming for discussion that there is no
direct, dramatic, and unquestionable proof of obstruction or
subornation of perjury that could overcome the public's
overwhelming antipathy to further proceedings, the Congress (even
though it doesn't have to) could vote to ``accept'' Starr's report.
And in the measure accepting Starr's report, it could include
language condemning the president's behavior. That limits it to
this case.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage is that it would give official voice to genuine
feelings of horror and worse that people have about Clinton's
admitted conduct.
</P>
<P>
   It is still early for this, though not too early to have a few
decent ideas on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the president remains in seclusion with his
family, a delicate and properly private process that must still be
resolved before anything else matters. Clinton may also need a
similar process to see if he can repair relations with his official
and political families.
</P>
<P>
   He also will need to say more to the public than he did last
week to truly deliver the three Cs his chief of staff, Erskine
Bowles, falsely advertised his brief speech as about to deliver _
confession, contrition, and closure.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest short-term casualty of those remarks was the anger
of the very Republicans poised to try to find a way past this mess
_ Orrin Hatch in the Senate, and Judiciary Committee chairman Henry
Hyde himself in the House _ and who have said Congress should not
proceed toward even an inquiry into possible impeachment on the
sole basis of a sex and sex-lies case.
</P>
<P>
   That stance, if maintained, would probably split Republicans,
many of whom insist that the president go or be tossed out of
office. Even those leaders who have no stomach for a sex-based case
_ like Newt Gingrich himself and chairman Gerald Solomon of the
Rules Committee _ talk of expanding a Starr report on the Monica
Lewinsky affair into a reinvestigation of everything the prosecutor
has already investigated in his four-plus year, even if he has
found no evidence of impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Out of respect for the public's views and to avoid that kind of
madness, this may be a matter that cries out for responsible
settlement, unless the pure facts in Starr's report clearly
indicate otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   But first, we all need a signal from the first family. In one of
the least-noticed, most direct sections of his speech, the
president said, ``I must put it right, and I am prepared to do
whatever it takes to do so.''

BLEDSOE GOES BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe's preseason efforts to master Ernie Zampese's
Swiss-watch offense reminds me of watching Rich Gedman and friends
trying to hit under the tutelage of Red Sox hitting coach Walter
Hriniak in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Hriniak was a relentless worker and perfectionist who
recommended (some would say insisted) that hitters swing level
(some would say downward) and release their top hand from the bat
after passing through the hitting zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Hriniak style was awkward. Sox batters sometimes appeared to
be chopping wood. But it made Dwight Evans an offensive star in the
second half of his career, and the Sox annually led the league in
batting when Walter worked the cage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some players never succeeded with the technique and had
to junk it. Who can forget the sight of rookie Mike Greenwell
taking one-handed cuts at curveballs in the dirt during the 1986
World Series? Ellis Burks took the simple route and rejected the
theory from the start.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was poor Gedman, who had his career aborted
because he insisted on sticking with something that didn't work.
Initially, the Hriniak system was magic for Gedman. He hit the ball
as hard as any major leaguer when he was a two-time All-Star. But
then he slumped, and never got his swing back. The harder Gedman
tried, the more he struggled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it looks bad a lot of times,'' Gedman would say. ``But
when you do it right, it's the best way to hit. It works great.''
</P>
<P>
   So now we have the enormously gifted Bledsoe trying to learn the
Zampese system in five exhibition games. Folks in Dallas will tell
you that Troy Aikman struggled to learn the system, hated it at
first, but eventaully found a comfortable groove.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe's performance in Washington Saturday night showed
progress (15 for 26, 153 yards, including one play of 47 yards),
but he still missed badly on a couple of throws, including a sure
touchdown when Terry Glenn faked veteran cornerback Cris Dishman
into the Potomac River. The same thing happened against the Vikings
when Bledsoe overthrew a wide-open Vincent Brisby. Patriot fans are
not a patient lot, and those kinds of mistakes won't fly once the
season starts in (gulp) Denver on Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe has not thrown a touchdown pass in any of the four
exhibition games. Does this bother anyone? It's seems like 10 years
ago, but just last summer Bledsoe threw eight touchdown passes (to
eight different receivers) in the first two regular-season games.
It was then that owner Bob Kraft spoke of Drew being more
``comfortable'' playing for Pete Carroll rather than Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of last season, it looked like New England would
have a monster air attack into the next century. But the Patriots'
passing game has eroded, and even though Bledsoe is in his
(itals)sixth(unitals) season, we're watching him take baby steps
again as he learns a new system.
</P>
<P>
   In four exhibition games, Bledsoe is 34 of 64 for 319 yards, no
touchdowns, and two interceptions. He has been accurate on sideline
passes and throws over the middle but can't connect on the long
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe hasn't made excuses about the overthrows. He never does.
He said he's made poor throws and that he has to do a better job.
On the Glenn overthrow, he actually pulled the trigger too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Yogi said it's tough to hit and think at the same time, which is
precisely why Bledsoe won't be able to faithfully execute the new
offense until he's able to stop thinking so much.
</P>
<P>
   Watching QB-11 in these games makes me long for the days of the
hurry-up offense and ``everybody go long.'' Hasn't Bledsoe always
been most effective when he's working out of the no-huddle, calling
his own plays? Was there ever a better day than Nov. 13, 1994, when
he went 45 of 70 for 426 yards and three touchdowns in a
second-half comeback win against the Vikings?
</P>
<P>
   The guy is a natural quarterback, just as Gedman was a natural
hitter. But now he's working on the timing-oriented offense,
missing Glenn by 15 feet and getting the ball to his receivers too
late.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the ball too long is brave, but it's deadly in a Zampese
offense. And if the Patriots fail to establish a running game,
Bledsoe is going to spend a lot of time picking himself up off the
ground and pulling pieces of turf out of his helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember what Geddy said. When you do it right, it works
great.

CANTY TURNS THE CORNER AFTER A SEASON OF ROOKIE MISTAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Chris Canty can smile and joke about it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more doughnuts,'' he said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   No sir. Canty used to leave a little time in the morning to pick
up a dozen doughnuts at the local coffee shop for the defensive
backs at the morning meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Those duties are over. Canty apparently has arrived. Respect is
finally his.
</P>
<P>
   After a season of being called too short, too slow, too cocky,
too cool, too this, and too that, Canty got the message. He left
behind his Kansas State swagger for life in the big leagues. With
that comes responsibilities and maturity. Canty, a No. 1 draft pick
in 1997 (the 29th player taken), had to take it one step further
this season. He had to go from washout to starter at right
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe he has pulled it off.
</P>
<P>
   Being insulted in the media probably helped. Also motivating him
was the team's drafting of a projected cornerback in the first
round this year. Tebucky Jones might have been Canty's biggest
incentive to get his act together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helped me a little bit,'' said Canty. ``Last year
everybody was on my back, I was the washout player of the year. It
was great to come in and get better. Drafting Tebucky told me,
`You've got to pick up your play.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want competition. There was a lot of competition at
that position in training camp and in the preseason and I just
wanted to step up and prove that I could play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the biggest thing: You always want to prove people
wrong and win the respect of your teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   He apparently has done that. Coach Pete Carroll, an expert on
defensive backs, says nothing but good things about the cornerback
now. Canty's last two games have been very good. Each week, he
seems to rise in status. He has taken no steps backward, but then
again, the regular season has not begun.
</P>
<P>
   When the games are for real, quarterbacks are going to try to
beat Canty deep every week. It's been done to every Patriot
cornerback who has played the right side since Ty Law came into the
league four years ago. Ask Jimmy Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all the confidence factor,'' said Canty. ``If you can go
out there and feel like you can cover anybody and have the
confidence and the skills and knowhow to do it, it's going to get
done. It's a just a matter of executing _ go out and take care of
the deep ball and make some plays.''
</P>
<P>
   He seems to mean it now. He admittedly walked onto this team
last year and acted as if he could rest on his collegiate laurels.
As Robert Edwards and Jones have found out, there's a big
difference between being a conditioned athlete in a big-time
college program and being one at the pro level. The body is
stretched to incredible limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard coming in as a No. 1,'' said Canty. ``You have a lot
of factors that you have to get used to. You have to deal with the
media, you have to deal with financial aspects, and you have to
deal with the football at the pro level. Once you go through it,
man, you see how hard it is and try to get used to everything. It
took me a year to adjust. I know what I want to do and I've set my
goals. Last year I set goals but they weren't anything to write
home about. This year, I'm really going to push myself to get those
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of pressures as a No. 1 pick. If you're not
able to handle them, they can get to you early. You can fall into a
rookie rut where you want to go home and be with your mom and those
types of things. You have to fight through it. It was tough and I
fought through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt, because of what I did in college, that would get me
through my rookie year. Obviously, that didn't get me close to what
I wanted to accomplish. Now I have a year's experience and I'm
watching more film. The coaches are working with me more, giving me
more technique and that type of thing. Now I can go out there and
be comfortable and play my type of game.''
</P>
<P>
   Which used to be a bump-and-run style. Canty got away from that
last year, as Carroll wanted him to learn all phases of the game.
Now he is slowly getting back to it.
</P>
<P>
   As a rookie, he knew he didn't have the respect of his teammates
all the time. But he has gradually won them over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, as a rookie, they want to see what you got and see
why you got drafted No. 1,'' he said. ``Now guys are trying to help
you fit in, trying to get you adjusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Canty says he will never again take his career for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try and take each and every game and each and every practice
to get better,'' he said. ``I'm trying to win the respect of my
teammates, coaches, and the entire organization. If I can start,
that's great. If I'm unable to start, I'm still going to do what I
can for special teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Canty may be on the field more than any other Patriot. In
addition to his starting corner spot, he's a kickoff returner and
plays on cover teams. In camp, the wear and tear was starting to
show, but he has been rejuvenated lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you feel wanted,'' said Canty of his many jobs.
``Special teams is a place for special guys who can do a little bit
more than other guys. It's great to be able to make a play on
special teams on kickoff returns, punt returns. You might get a
block or a big tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year he made a few big plays blitzing out of nickel
coverage but didn't show a great ability to cover. So far in this
exhibition season, he has been covering well and not getting beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to keep it up,'' he said. ``Keep getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he can leave his house a little later in the morning,
knowing the doughnuts will be waiting for him.

MAKING MONEY FROM STOCK-MARKET SLAUGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If good investors like volatility, this should be heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't it feel that way? The Dow and the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 are both off about 8.3 percent since their July peaks, but it
has been much, much worse. The Russell 2000, which tracks small
stocks, offers a better glimpse of reality, down 20 percent. That
is bear market territory.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in that slaughter, there's money to be made. Using
some basic value measures, we went prospecting through the 350
Massachusetts stocks we monitor daily. Our credo: Cheap is good.
</P>
<P>
   We ran the numbers three ways. We looked at price-to-book
ratios, a measure of a company's net worth vs. its share price. We
also ran the price-to-earnings ratio, which shows how much we would
have to pay for a company's profits. And we considered the
price-to-sales ratio, which shows how much we would pay per dollar
of annual sales. There's no fancy footwork here.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of companies popped out of our screens, but we were really
picky. We tossed out any firm with a market capitalization of less
than $250 million and any that is not making money. All our
companies are selling far below the benchmarks for the broad
market.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what looks cheap by the numbers:
</P>
<P>
   _Neiman Marcus Group. The high-end retailer has seen its stock
sag from 43 and change at the start of July to 30 5/16 Monday. But
run the numbers and consider its name and you have to wonder why.
</P>
<P>
   First the basics: Chestnut Hill-based Neiman is selling at a
price-to-book ratio of 2.3, a multiple of 14 times recent earnings
and just 0.64 times sales. The S&AMP;P 500, by comparison, is trading
at a price-to-book ratio of 4.1, a price-earnings multiple of
nearly 26, and a price-to-sales ratio of 1.68.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lodewick, research director of Boston Partners Asset
Management, says Neiman is generating lots of free cash and is
growing earnings at 10 percent a year or more. In addition, Neiman
Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman are marque names, and chief executive
Richard Smith and his team are proven winners.
</P>
<P>
   _Thermo Electron Corp. The ingenious mouse trap that the
brothers Hatsopoulos, George and John, built in Waltham is getting
killed. The stock has been crushed from 44 at the start of the year
to 19 7/8 today.
</P>
<P>
   A whole slew of Thermo spinoffs show up on our value screen, but
Thermo Electron remains the center of the universe. This used to be
a pricey tech stock, but no longer: It is selling at 12 times
recent earnings and 1.4 times book value. Its price-to-sales ratio
is 0.83.
</P>
<P>
   The retrenchment has forced the Hatsopouloses to admit, tacitly
at least, something they have always denied: There are limits to
the strategy of forever spinning out Thermo babies. Just this month
Thermo Electron announced it would reorganize, cutting the number
of subsidiaries to 15 from 23.
</P>
<P>
   This could be a rare opportunity to buy the Hatsopoulos vision
on sale.
</P>
<P>
   _Allmerica Financial Corp. The Worcester insurer went public in
October 1995 at 21 and has been on a run ever since, closing Monday
at 70 5/8. But it remains cheap by many measures. The company sells
at 1.7 times book value, an earnings multiple of 15 times earnings
and 1.2 times sales.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Partners's Lodewick says Allmerica's variable annuity
business is growing fast and it is expecting to cut more costs out
of its property and casualty side. He also thinks Allmerica is a
takeover target in the wake of American International Group's
purchase of SunAmerica. Buyout price: north of $90.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything that looks like a bargain is, of course. Reebok
International, for instance, turned up on lots of people's value
screens, ours included. But a lot of very good investors have been
growing old waiting for Paul Fireman to fix his Stoughton shoe
company.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Whitridge, one of Boston's best investors, is among them.
David L. Babson &AMP; Co., where Whitridge runs the highly successful
Babson Value fund, is among Reebok's largest holders, with about
1.8 million shares. Whit-ridge, a patient sort, hasn't given up,
but admits: ``I'm highly disappointed in Reebok.''

   Ranan Lurie, who is now known internationally as a political
cartoonist and analyst, was a celebrated Israeli army combat major
in the Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   To him it takes hand-to-hand, gutsy commando action to bring
down terrorists, and the idea of firing Tomahawk missiles at a
training camp buried in the mountains is an expensive way of
``saying something you don't really mean.''
</P>
<P>
   In this interview, Lurie addresses the strategy chosen by the
United States to enter into what President Clinton is now calling
``a long, ongoing struggle between freedom and fanaticism, between
the rule of law and terrorism.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE B. MORRISON: How would you assess the U.S. missile
attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the embassy
bombings in Africa?
</P>
<P>
   RANAN LURIE: I believe these cruise missiles were the most
anticipated guests of Osama bin Laden. He is hiding in the
mountains, well prepared for cruise missiles; he is not impressed
by them. President Clinton forgot that the cruise missile is by now
a very known quantity. We have also the problem here of preparing
for the last war _ we shot scores of these missiles in the Persian
Gulf War. Generals always plan the next war on the criteria of the
last war. What I am trying to say is that every terrorist
organization today knows the chances are that 80 percent of U.S.
retaliation will be committed by cruise missiles. The United States
has established itself as a fighting force that wants to rely as
much as possible on technology, while sacrificing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In terms of lives?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, we don't want to report about casualties. The missiles
cost a lot of money, and nothing in American lives. They are
ineffective against terrorism unless all the bad guys, and all
their weapons, are in known, extensive, above-ground headquarters
or camps.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What should we be doing? How can we surprise them? Can we
surprise them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only way to surprise them would be by helicopter attacks,
landing Delta Force-type units, special commando forces that also
are enjoying superb intelligence _ this is where the CIA comes in
very strongly. And they actually clear the area.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, I could envision an attack, with the aid of
Pakistan, of America's very superior helicopters, on that specific
spot, protected by air power, and a unit of about two companies
coming down, knocking on the door and demolishing the whole place,
and hopefully capturing its high command.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It sounds as if you're saying we have the capability of doing
this.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we have, but we don't have the stomach for it. We
don't want to take a chance of losing lives. Let us remember when
President Carter was trying to save the hostages in Iran in 1980.
He sent the helicopters, and there were equipment failures and a
crash in a sandstorm, and men killed, and the mission was aborted.
It caused tremendous damage to Carter, who came out looking like a
very incompetent leader.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, while he approved it, he didn't know the details, so
technically he wasn't responsible, but he was responsible as the
commander in chief. Now, basically, other commanders in chief don't
care to accidentally tread in those footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So when you speak of the stomach to fight, you are referring
to the politicians, not the warriors?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely, yes. You know, a platoon of Navy SEALS has so
much fire power ... and as for the men, once you volunteer to the
Green Berets or the Delta Force or the Navy SEALS, you make a
commitment, a declaration. No one forces them to do it. They go
because of love of country _ or maybe for action and adventure, or
to impress a girlfriend, or to be higher paid. They would like to
serve, because that is what made them a Delta Force.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think we have the adequate intelligence capabilities
for such a mission?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let us take, for instance, the Entebbe raid by the Israelis.
(In 1976, Israeli commandos attacked the airport in Entebbe, Uganda
and freed a hijacked Air France plane full of French tourists
returning from Israel.) At first, the Israelis knew very little
about the whole situation in Entebbe because the hijacking and
hostage-taking happened out of thin air. So there was a tremendous
disadvantage, intelligence-wise, in comparison to the U.S.
advantage, intelligence-wise, appropos Osama bin Laden. We have
known for years that bin Laden is organizing something massive for
terrorist attacks. He has boasted of it on many occasions. So I
should assume this would make him one of the prime intelligence
targets the United States has in the world today. A person like
this is an easy target for a powerful intelligence operation: the
CIA and so forth. It's also in the Pakistani interest to know what
is happening with him, so their agencies are probably working on
it. And all this intelligence would certainly serve our special
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you don't feel the U.S. counterstrike will be an
effective deterrent?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm afraid the cruise missiles were the equivalent of a
military lip service. It was an operation that really could not
solve a problem. On the contrary, that was almost a knee-jerk
reaction because the military is shouting from here to Timbuktu, so
that all the world can hear, `We can't afford losing people.'
</P>
<P>
   And the moment you say you can't afford losing people, the
terrorists gain a tremendous edge because they know they are not
going to suffer direct contact with American forces. They know they
would lose in any kind of contact with our elite troops. No one is
trained as well.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the goal had to be destroying the people who send the
terrorists, and that didn't happen. It re-exposed our superior
technology, which is fine, but it also affirmed our fear of doing
the right thing and investing the right units, the only ones that
can do the job.
</P>
<P>
   I might add that this is exactly why we failed miserably in the
Persian Gulf War. We invested so many troops, I believe about
600,000, on a thing that 150,000 could have handled easily, and in
the end achieved almost nothing. We did free Kuwait, which is
correct, but it was like taking candy from a baby, and we did it
with such drama, and such pompous superiority. Once we realized we
had to bring down Saddam Hussein, we proved to be nothing. And why,
I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you believe in the concept that the terrorist is not
afraid to die?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely. This is the classic Iranian concept, that for the
terrorists who blow themselves up in buses driving toward embassies
or marketplaces in Israel, it is a tremendous honor. It is the
beginning of a new life. For them, losing lives is a way of life.
The fallen terrorists are `shahids,' the Arab word for martyr. As
martyrs they are going to a fantastic world where they are given
dozens of virgins, gorgeous ones, and they will have a life of
terrific riches, a Donald Trump-style life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Apparently his followers view bin Laden as a spiritual
leader, a very principled man, with a belief system that is
unwavering, unflinching ...
</P>
<P>
   A: It's as if you would say that also Hitler was a principled
man. What does it mean? That his principles are that other races
are inferior. Therefore they are execution-prone, and should be
burned in the gas chambers. This is more or less what bin Laden
also thinks: that America is Satan, and therefore we are condemned.
He speaks openly of a fatwah on Americans, and jeers at our
soldiers as `paper tigers.' I believe he would sponsor terrorism on
American soil, without any moral hesitation, and establish himself
as a hero for the next 1,000 years in the extremist world. We have
to compare the stomach of facing a terrible loss of 20 or 30 very
good young warriors to the stomach we'd need to face the loss of
millions in a city of the United States.

leader, a very principled man, with a belief system that is
unwavering, unflinching ...
</P>
<P>
   A: It's as if you would say that also Hitler was a principled
man. What does it mean? That his principles are that other races
are inferior. Therefore they are execution-prone, and should be
burned in the gas chambers. This is more or less what bin Laden
also thinks: that America is Satan, nd therefore we are condemned.
He speaks openly of a fatwah on Americans, and jeers at our
soldiers as `paper tigers.' I believe he would sponsor terrorism on
American soil, without any moral hesitation, and establish himself
as a hero for the next 1,000 years in the extremist world. We have
to compare the stomach of facing a terrible loss of 20 or 30 very
good young warriors to the stomach we'd need to face the loss of
millions in a city of the United States.

SOME PARENTS QUESTION THE PROLIFERATION OF VACCINES FOR KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Byron Nilsson took vaccinations for granted until
his daughter was born in January 1997 in the rural upstate New York
home he shares with his wife, Susan.
</P>
<P>
   He had been doing research on home births when he came across
articles on the Internet and in magazines about the potential
dangers associated with childhood immunizations.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he and his wife have opted against getting their
daughter vaccinated against most childhood diseases, arguing that
the shots pose a greater medical risk than the chance of getting
the illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Consider polio. Today, the only documented cases of polio in the
Western Hemisphere come from the weakened live virus in the oral
polio vaccine, the same vaccine credited for eradicating wild polio
as an epidemic health crisis in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all cases, you're rolling the dice,'' said Nilsson, a
free-lance writer and full-time father. ``What's worse, getting the
disease or getting the vaccine?''
</P>
<P>
   The decision not to fully immunize their daughter puts this
family, and a growing movement of parents across the state and
country, in opposition to the medical establishment and in many
cases, state law.
</P>
<P>
   Their frustration comes as the list of recommended and required
vaccines for children grows beyond the standard polio, mumps,
measles and rubella vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, for example, all kindergarteners entering New York
public schools must be vaccinated against hepatitis B, a viral
disease spread primarily through sexual contact and intravenous
drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents, upset because they don't view their children at
risk of contracting the disease, question why such a vaccine is
routinely given to all newborns before they leave the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents who have never questioned vaccines are in increasing
numbers calling up and complaining bitterly about having to
vaccinate their children against hepatitis B,'' said Barbara Loe
Fisher, co-founder and executive director of the Virginia-based
National Vaccine Information Center, a group of parents and
advocates concerned about vaccine safety.
</P>
<P>
   Many states also are considering adding the chicken pox vaccine
to the list, even though some people question whether that
childhood illness is serious enough to merit another mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccines are the only required medical treatment in this
country. Exemptions for medical or religious reasons are rare in
most states. Those who fail to comply can be denied access to many
schools, colleges, the military and even some jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've felt pretty alone in this,'' Nilsson said. ``It does feel
like we're dropping through a trap door and becoming part of the
underground.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicians and public health officials blame a small group of
parents and skeptics whose children have had a severe reaction to
vaccines for overstating the medical risks.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, vaccinated children are fine, underscoring the
fact that vaccines save millions of children across the world from
potentially debilitating and deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts credit a mandatory vaccination program for
eradicating some of the most dangerous childhood diseases,
including smallpox. In addition, there has been a dramatic drop in
the incidence of diseases for which vaccines have been developed.
</P>
<P>
   That change is evident is statistics compiled by the National
Vaccine Information Center, comparing reported cases of disease in
1945 to 1997. Those numbers show:
</P>
<P>
   _ There were more than 18,000 reported cases of diphtheria in
1945, compared to less than 5 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 13,000 reported cases of polio compared to about 10
last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 133,000 reported cases of pertussis or whooping
cough compared to less than 10,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ And 346 reported cases of smallpox compared to none today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not immunizing everybody, you're not doing your
job,'' said Dr. Elaine Schulte, a pediatrician at the Albany
Medical Center. She said the problem with making vaccines optional
is that a large pool of unvaccinated children can set the stage for
another outbreak of disease.
</P>
<P>
   A national measles outbreak in from 1989 to 1991 sickened 55,000
children across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for parents to understand,'' Schulte said. ``Fifteen
or 20 years ago, it was easier to push immunizations because people
were more familiar with the diseases.''

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The issue goes beyond science, with some parents making the case
that they, and not lawmakers and public health officials, have the
right to decide what's best for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do live in America and people do have an attachment to
personal freedom,'' said Joseph L. Hayes, a physician in Glenville,
N.Y., who says he is hearing from more parents questioning the
safety of vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the concern is new research, published in journals and
magazines such as Epidemiology, Science News, and the New Zealand
Medical Journal, that link vaccines to a host of chronic childhood
illnesses, including asthma, allergies and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Until the recent widespread use of the Internet, most parents
would not have come across these controversial studies. Today, a
few parents are going to their pediatricians' offices armed with
evidence they believe supports a case against all vaccinations or
more often, only some vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are personal and private decisions. I don't think
government has a role for making carte blanche decisions for an
entire population,'' said Monica Miller of Kinderhook, N.Y., a
private lobbyist and patient activist who decided against getting
her two children, now 19 and 13, vaccinated against pertussis,
rubella, mumps and measles.
</P>
<P>
   She ended up having to take significant time off from work on
two occasions when they each came down with whooping cough _ an
option she acknowledges most working parents don't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a second thought,'' she said, explaining how she
believes the illness strengthened her children's immune system and
aided their emotional and physical growth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the federal government acknowledged that vaccines
aren't 100 percent safe when it set up its National Vaccine Injury
Compensation Program. The intent was to compensate families whose
children suffered death or a severe reaction to vaccines, using
money collected through a 75-cent excise tax on the childhood
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception, the program has received 5,274 claims from
parents and paid out an estimated $925.7 million in awards to
injured children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot say to give a vaccination is absolutely safe, but I
think there are a lot of times when we forget that everything we
do, including getting out of bed in the morning, is a risk,'' Hayes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hayes acknowledges, it's a tough pill for some parents to
swallow. ``It's very difficult to tell people with small children
that there are certain risks society demands that you take whether
you think it's worthwhile or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson and his wife are still weighing the risks of the polio
vaccine. Although they've agreed to have their daughter vaccinated
against tetanus and diphtheria because they live on a farm where
her risk of exposure is greater, they've opted against measles,
mumps, rubella and pertussis.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they haven't felt the consequences of their decision.
Lily, now 18 months, is healthy and stays at home with her dad,
rather than go to day care, where vaccinations would be required.
</P>
<P>
   School is also more than three years away, and the family
already is a considering other alternatives, including private
school, to protect their choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm perfectly willing to fight the state,'' Nilsson said.

PLASTIC GIFT CARDS ARE QUICKLY REPLACING PAPER CERTIFICATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Paper or plastic? No, not your grocery bag _
your gift certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers in growing numbers are starting to replace those
seemingly unchanging paper gift vouchers that look like oversized
checks with plastic, credit card-sized gift certificates that
function much like debit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``As strange as it sounds, people associate money more with
plastic than with paper because of the credit environment we're in
now,'' said Roxanne Kosanda, who is in charge of gift cards and
other customer programs for Neiman Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   The high-end, Dallas-based retailer became one of the first
stores to offer a plastic card instead of a paper certificate back
in the fall of 1994. Since then, other stores have picked up on the
idea, some adding various features such as allowing customers to
reload, or add to, the card or turning the cards into collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has virtually made the paper certificate obsolete,''
Kosanda said. ``The old paper certificates were almost like bonds
that you would buy from a stockbroker and keep in your drawers for
years. The cards are much more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster Video, Kmart, Rite-Aid and many other retailers
already have the gift card, and several major stores are planning
the switch soon. Old Navy introduced its gift card at the beginning
of the month, while the Gap and Macy's both plan to offer theirs in
early October.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers say the plastic gift card is more convenient than
paper certificates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly gives us a much more exciting product to market
as opposed to a paper gift certificate,'' said Sheila Field, senior
vice president of marketing and promotions at Macy's. ``It's
credit-card sized, so it's easier for customers to manage in their
wallets. It doesn't get lost or crumpled up.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy's will introduce a single design, non-reloadable card Oct.
6 and later will offer special packaging for the holidays. The card
comes with a toll-free number that customers can use to check the
balance. After Jan. 1, Macy's will start packaging the cards for
other occasions such as birthdays and other holidays.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to convenience, stores say the cards offer shoppers
more options because the amount of purchase is debited at the
register, and the customer can reuse the card, receive cash back
or, in some cases, add money for future purchases. It functions
similar to a debit card but can be used only at that store.
</P>
<P>
   For the Gap, the ability to use and reload the card at any of
its stores nationwide is a big plus. ``If a parent is sending a
child off to college, they may want to make a purchase of a gift
card because they can load it as a parent in Los Angeles for a
student in college in Pennsylvania,'' said Gap spokeswoman Rebecca
Weill.
</P>
<P>
   While no statistics are available showing the number of stores
using gift cards, the National Retail Federation reports the trend
is clearly moving toward plastic. Figures showing the size of the
gift certificate market were also unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been growing in interest as the technology gets
better,'' said Pamela Rucker, spokeswoman for the Washington
D.C.-based trade group. ``We're definitely moving toward a cashless
society, and smart-card technology is a big part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stanley W. Anderson, president of Anderson &AMP; Associates, a
Colorado consulting firm that tracks smart cards, said the cards
have the potential to be used for more than just simple
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, retailers can use their computer systems
to track how the money is spent. ``Once you capture that, the
question is what you do with this information,'' he said. The gift
card is not considered as valuable as discount, or ``loyalty,''
cards, such as those offered by some grocery stores, because they
contain no personal information about the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies that have switched to plastic say cards have
helped increase sales. Though they have no specific figures, they
say the number of gift cards sold has increased, and the card
recipients often spend more than the face value of the card. Many
companies are planning to do away with the paper option.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman Marcus' Kosanda would not say how much gift card sales
had increased in the past four years other than that the percentage
was in the double digits. She attributes much of the cards'
popularity to their design and said people were starting to collect
them much as they do telephone cards.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman Marcus offers about 18 different versions of the cards
each year, including holiday and special occasion cards.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster also is going the collectible route. The
Dallas-based video giant, which started offering gift cards in late
1996, reported that the popularity of the cards had caused gift
certificate sales to double in the fourth quarter of 1997. The
sales are expected to remain strong throughout 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the company introduced a line of cards featuring films
from the American Film Institute's list of the 100 best American
films of all times, but Blockbuster is really banking on the debut
of four ``Titanic'' gift cards timed with the film's video release
Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The cards will be released in limited numbers to maintain their
collectible status, said Blockbuster's Greg Smogard, who is charge
of the gift cards. Smogard said the company constantly plans
different designs and options for the cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've actually stopped most of our paper gift certificates
because there's very little demand now,'' he said.

NLRB CHIEF LEAVES THE FIRING LINE WITH HIS LOVE OF LABOR INTACT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bill Gould IV, great-grandson of a slave, is
returning to Palo Alto, and not a moment too soon. Gould has been
chairman of the National Labor Relations Board since 1994, which is
another way of saying he was a punching bag for House Republicans.
But this punching bag punched back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't accommodate myself to the enemies of my agency and
the National Labor Relations Act,'' Gould, 62, said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes keeping the faith is hard to do while maintaining
one's composure. A onetime autoworkers' union attorney who went on
to become a nationally known arbitrator, Gould is a distinguished
Stanford University law professor who has been named repeatedly to
Ebony magazine's list of the most influential black Americans.
Nevertheless, a few congressmen treated him and his five-member
board as if they were shills for organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to speak of the `Imperial Presidency,' but there are
a number of congressmen who are imperious and swelled up,'' Gould
said. ``This comes through in their conversation with you. You are
in many senses a supplicant _ they control the purse strings.''
</P>
<P>
   There also were Democrats who had problems with Gould. Among
them was Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, a powerful party figure and
ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Committee and
labor subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fall of 1997, he said to me, in a very pugnacious and
bellicose tone, `You don't really know how things are done in
Washington. Perhaps you'd like me to give you less money than what
even the Republicans want to give you. How would you like that?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been talked to like that since I was a laborer in
Longbranch, New Jersey,'' Gould said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd chalk it up to his arrogance and megalomania more than to
racism _ although I think many in Congress were more hostile to me
because of race.''
</P>
<P>
   Obey's office had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite President Clinton's support, the NLRB's authority has
eroded. The agency's $175 million budget hasn't kept pace with
inflation and staff is down from about 3,000 to some 1,800. This
translates into a backlog of unresolved disputes, including the
fate of strikers at the Detroit News and Detroit Free-Press trying
to reclaim jobs and a dispute between a Reno, Nev., contractors'
group and electrical workers.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Congress, Gould said, never have accepted the fact that
the National Labor Relations Act is intended to promote collective
bargaining and freedom of association for workers. Why don't they
repeal the law?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they don't have the votes. They'd rather pursue this
avenue of character assassination. They're reduced to guerrilla
warfare, which takes place through the appropriations process and
oversight hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould's foes, on the other hand, say their problem with him
arose from his abandonment of any pretense of neutrality. And
there's no question Gould has been bold. The U.S. Chamber of
Commerce won't soon forget his vocal opposition to Proposition 226,
the initiative on the California ballot in June that would have
denied unions the right to spend dues on political causes without
the consent of union members. The measure lost.
</P>
<P>
   The picture of Gould that finally emerges, however, is of a man
of ideology too thoughtful and too flexible to be called an
ideologue. ``Bill Gould came in like a lion and went out like a
somewhat older and wiser lion,'' said Frederick Baron, head of the
employment and labor group in the Palo Alto office of the Cooley
Godward law firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was concern when he came in heralded as a pro-union
activist. But if you look at his record, he showed a willingness to
make significant decisions in favor of management. In that sense,
he seemed more like a professor than a politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould may be speaking out again this fall, as the gubernatorial
race in California moves into high gear. He supports Lt. Gov. Gray
Davis, a Democrat, and says he has an interest in serving in state
government.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans two books _ one about government (``I've kept good
notes'') and one about his great-grandfather, also named Bill, who
escaped slavery in North Carolina and served in the Union Army.
That Bill Gould also had a good memory, kept notes and was
determined to speak his mind. It runs in the family.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Confessions of a bleeding-heart liberal
 &HT;    By Harley Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Since I challenged the right-wing hate mongers a
few years ago concerning their character assassinations of all who
disagree with them, I have been deemed by some a ``bleeding-heart
liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   How did I get this way?
</P>
<P>
   When I removed all the ``teaching of men'' as instructed by
Jesus's teaching, and revisited his words, it was obvious. My
social liberalism has developed from the fundamental teaching of
Jesus. Fundamental Christianity, that's what it is.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus taught that we should give to those in need. He did not
qualify their worthiness nor did he qualify or limit the amount or
the frequency of giving and forgiving. He said that there should be
no limits on either.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus said that we should not store up treasures on earth, for
one cannot serve both God and wealth or money. He went on to
emphasize this teaching by adding that it would be easier for a
camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to go
to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus forgave the Samaritan woman who had been married several
times and was living in adultery, even when she did not feel
worthy. He was criticized for socializing and associating with
sinners and tax collectors. He said that they were the ones who
need help, not the righteous. He did not play politics with either
the religious or the political power sources of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus said of marriage, ``... a man will leave his father and
mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one
flesh. ... So they are no longer two but one.'' This fundamental
Christian teaching, in my opinion, put them on equal terms.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus's simple, unadulterated teachings are hard for most
Americans to accept. We have to find a ``church'' or denomination
that will alter them to suit our money- and power-driven society.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus said to be meek, merciful, peacemakers, to give to the
poor. He said do not condemn, do not judge, that all would have to
give account for every careless word spoken. He said to pay taxes
without complaining, and, he said to preach the good news and to
stay out of politics.
</P>
<P>
   If Jesus were on earth today, which church would he attend?
Probably, as in his days on earth, he would go to a synagogue and
teach. After all, he was a Jew, you know.
</P>
<P>
   He would, otherwise, be among ``sinners and tax collectors''
teaching wherever they are.
</P>
<P>
   For macho ``Christians'' who condemn bleeding-heart liberals who
are compassionate, loving and caring, I quote the shortest verse in
the Bible: ``Jesus wept.''

   NAPOLEONS (Undated) _ What you get from today's restaurant chefs
can resemble the conversation at a cocktail party: some of it is
smart and a lot of it is showing off. Consider the ostentatious
trend toward greater and greater height on the plate, food
sculpture that looks impressive until you try to eat it, and it
falls apart. And the trend, which virtually begs restaurant cooks
to build things ever higher, is seen perfectly in the proliferation
of dishes named after the napoleon, the classic dessert that has
become just about anything you can imagine, as long as it comes
stacked high. By Amanda Hesser.

   HOW-TO-EAT-A-NAPOLEON (Undated) _ The napoleon, however
beautiful, poses a serious challenge to the diner: how to attack?
There is a trick to getting a taste of each layer without squishing

</P>
<P>
   NAPOLEON-CHEF (Undated) _ When I was just learning about fine
cooking as a 14-year-old apprentice in an inn in upstate New York,
I was completely fascinated by the dessert cart. I was particularly
taken with the elaborate pastry cream creations like the napoleon.
And as I learned by the time I got to culinary school, the ability
to create those creamy classics was one of the hallmarks of the
professional. By Charlie Palmer.

   WINDOWS-SOMMELIER (New York) _ When Andrea Immer bounds up to a
table at Windows on the World, she faces diners who invariably seem
wary. Dressed in her severe black pantsuit and white blouse, she is
clearly not the waitress. She did not welcome them at the door so
she is neither hostess nor maitre d'. And her greeting is so
relentlessly energetic, there is a fleeting suspicion she might try
recruiting volunteers for the hokey pokey. What almost no one
assumes _ with her brisk demeanor that seems part corporate
executive, part kindergarten teacher _ is that she is the
sommelier, overseeing a cellar that accounts for $5 million in wine
sales per year. Not only that, but she is was judged the best
sommelier in the country last year by the Sommelier Society of
America. By Alex Witchel.

   PURSLANE (Undated) _ These days I seem to encounter purslane
everywhere I go. If you eat in restaurants with any frequency, the
chances are that you do, too. For American chefs are finally
beginning to appreciate the many qualities of purslane, the juicy
little weed so prized by the French. By Ruth Reichl.
</P>
<P>
   NY-SKATE (New York) _ Skate's arrival as a Serious Fish, at
least in New York, can be pinpointed to the day. It was on Jan. 28,

poached with browned butter. By Elaine Louie.

DANGEROUS, BLUE-CHIP BULLS IN DEMAND ON MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR PRO
RODEO CIRCUIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Cody Hart drew a notorious bull named Red
Wolf at a rodeo last year in Alexandria, La. Some 2 1/2 years
before, Red Wolf had fatally stomped Brent Thurman at the 1994
National Finals Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I was, fresh out of high school, just a kid, and I draw
this bull that has a death list,'' said Hart, who was 18 when he
faced the red-horned animal that was named the 1996 Professional
Rodeo Cowboys Association's top bull. ``I was a little scared, but
I knew that nothing tragic would happen to me if I just stayed in
the middle of his back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart, a nationally ranked cowboy who lives in Thackerville,
Okla., stayed on Red Wolf for the mandatory eight seconds that day
and posted a score of 94 out of a possible 100. He survived an
encounter with a growing, flesh-and-blood reality of the sport:
Crowd-pleasing bulls with feisty reputations have become the
marquee attractions on today's multimillion-dollar pro rodeo
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls have become so powerful, and dangerous, that cowboys now
wear flak jackets and helmets. And powerful bulls have become so
valuable that when producer Chris Woodruff put together ``The
Battle of the Bulls'' last weekend in Weatherford, just west of
Fort Worth, he said that he budgeted up to $20,000 to hire six
livestock contractors to bring about 75 top bulls to the
Professional Bull Riders event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make stars out of these bulls,'' Woodruff said.
``They're athletes. They may not understand fan applause or what is
being said. But they have adrenaline, and I know they must feel the
intensity of the bright lights and the hype.''
</P>
<P>
   A BULL MARKET: The growth of bull riding _ the Professional
Rodeo Cowboys Association and Professional Bull Riders each have
year-round schedules _ has created a demand for more blue-chip
bulls than ever before. And it's not as if there's a Red Wolf
waiting in every cow pasture.
</P>
<P>
   Like a pro baseball scout scouring the farm leagues to beef up
his pitching staff, Sammy Andrews is on a constant watch for
blue-chip bucking bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding great bulls is a lot like recruiting baseball
players,'' said Andrews, who raises rodeo livestock. ``We have the
equivalent of Double-A and Triple-A farm systems with junior and
amateur rodeos. When I hear of a potentially great bull, I usually
rely on amateur producers to test them. But like baseball, there's
a few rodeo bulls that immediately are ready for the pros.''
</P>
<P>
   For Andrews, a northeast Texan who trucked his top stock to
Weatherford last weekend, recruiting a blue-chip herd requires
continual consultation with minor-league producers, bidding at
auctions and formulating a breeding program. Only about one bull in
10 becomes a keeper, Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip herds are a mainstay on the Professional Bull Riders
circuit, which awards more than $4 million a year in purses,
including $100,000 to the overall winner at the world championships
in Las Vegas each November.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 40 animals in Andrews' stock pen, including Skat
Kat Skoal, a former top bull at the National Finals Rodeo. Andrews
also owns Bodacious, a two-time PRCA bucking bull of the year who
was retired in 1995 after injuring too many cowboys. Many
competitors sustained facial injuries from colliding with the
massive white beast as they were thrown from his back.
</P>
<P>
   Bodacious is now a breeder.
</P>
<P>
   Just as owning a Triple Crown winner in thoroughbred horse
racing can bring notoriety, producing top bulls such as Bodacious
can earn contracts to high-profile shows and big bucks. This year,
the bull of the year on the Professional Bull Riders circuit is
expected to receive a $25,000 prize, said Cody Lambert, the
association's livestock director.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a top bull can mean instant success.
</P>
<P>
   Stock producer Terry Williams of Carthage spent $31,000 last
year for a prime-time bull named Panhandle Slim. Williams soon
wound up with a $10,000 payoff after Panhandle Slim, a fast
spinner, was named bull of the year at last year's Professional
Bull Riders World Finals in Las Vegas. Williams split the $20,000
prize with the breeder who sold him the bull.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a job,'' said Williams, who also owns Red Wolf. ``I see
stock contractors form a herd of great bulls and then they think
they're set and they quit looking hard. But then after a while, the
quality of their herd goes down. You have to be on the lookout all
of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   A RARE BREED: With the increasing popularity of bull riding,
producers say the odds of acquiring a star bull are the same as
recruiting a Michael Jordan or a Troy Aikman. Bulls, it seems, can
lose confidence when ever-improving riders defeat them in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, when the world's top bull riders competed in PRCA
events, they might face a blue-chip bull four times a month. Today,
with the Professional Bull Riders circuit and its nationally
televised, 24-city Bud Light Cup Tour, riders face and conquer
rampaging bulls two to three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a bull, being ridden for eight seconds is a defeat, the
equivalent of a rider getting thrown off,'' said Morgan Mill's Tuff
Hedeman, president of the Professional Bull Riders and a former
world champion. ``If I were a bull and someone stayed on me nine of
10 times, I probably would lose confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these bulls like Red Wolf are smart. If riders start
staying on them when they spin to the right, after a while they
will get smarter and spin the other direction.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to facing top riders more often, a rodeo bull must
endure challenging road conditions on 1,000-mile trips and
different feed and water in varying parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you put a bull in a truck and blow black smoke on him,
you don't really know how good he is,'' Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, creating top bulls has become more scientific
in recent years. For example, Andrews' Bodacious and Skat Kat Skoal
are registered in a thriving breeding program called Buckers Inc.
that was begun two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews said that he is banking on producing meaner and tougher
animals.
</P>
<P>
   In Weatherford last weekend, only two of 16 finalists in the
two-day event stayed on for the full eight seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the ultimate challenge when you have man vs. beast, which
is the way our world began, and now we still have the same
challenge,'' said Woodruff, the Weatherford producer. ``It's
thrilling to me to see an athlete who weighs in at only 120 pounds
take control of a 2,000-pound bull, then get off and wave his hand
in victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart, now 19, understands the thrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an auto racing driver,'' he said. ``If you're really
serious about it you'll want to drive the highest level of cars,
the NASCARs and Indy cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting on Red Wolf was like racing at Daytona: You know you
have your hands full. And staying on him was like winning Daytona.
You have something to brag about.''

<P>
   Which of the following Princess Diana-related stories is not
true:
</P>
<P>
   A. To mark the first anniversary of Diana's death in an auto
accident, the British ballet superstar Wayne Sleep recently
recreated the dance he performed in 1985 with the princess onstage
at London's Covent Garden. At the end of the tribute dance, he left
a single rose in a spotlight in Diana's memory and exited the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   B. Tubs of butter bearing the official logo of Princess Di's
memorial fund were made available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   C. Donald Trump told reporters he regretted Diana's death
because he, and we quote here, ``never had a chance to ask her
out.''
</P>
<P>
   D. The Odeon Hotel in Paris is offering a ``Diana Tour,'' taking
you through the final hours of her life. For $25 you can ride in a
black Mercedes (just like Di's death car!) from the Ritz Hotel,
where Diana and Dodi had their last meal; to the Pont de l'Alma
tunnel, where the crash occurred; to the Pitie-Salpetriere
Hospital, where Diana was declared dead.
</P>
<P>
   E. While anchoring the live coverage of Diana's funeral, NBC's
Tom Brokaw fell in and out of a fake British accent and said things
like, ``That shan't be too long.''
</P>
<P>
   F. A committee overseeing Princess Di's memorial fund is
considering a number of ways to spend the money _ including a plan
to bankroll a team of student nurses who would specialize in the
care of sick children. The nurses would be known as ``Diana's
Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As you probably guessed, it's a trick question. The answer, of
course, is that all of the above items are TRUE, and they represent
just a small portion of the stupefyingly bizarre ripple effect of
perhaps the most shocking celebrity death we've ever known _ the
auto accident in Paris on Aug. 31, 1997, that claimed the lives of
three people, including the Lady Formerly Known as Princess, Diana
Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of Diana's death, she was elevated to
premature-death pop-sainthood, right there with Elvis and Marilyn,
John Lennon and James Dean.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, given her worldwide popularity before the tragic
accident and the volcano of emotion that erupted following her
death, she may be the queen of them all. She's certainly in a
position to challenge Elvis (whose death-anniversary is Aug. 16,
just 15 days away from Di's) for the crown of most marketable
celebrity, post-mortem category.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund was established to
raise money for some of her favorite charities, including the
Leprosy Mission, the National AIDS Trust and the Royal Marsden NHS
Trust for cancer and organizations benefiting land-mine victims,
and to put some sort of restrictions on the hundreds of
opportunists seeking to market the name and image of Diana.
</P>
<P>
   To date the foundation has raised nearly $100 million. One item
alone _ Elton John's ``Candle in the Wind 1997,'' the top-selling
single of all-time _ has accounted for approximately $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 companies have the endorsement of the fund _ meaning
they can use the official logo of a purple replica of Diana's
signature.
</P>
<P>
   Literally hundreds of other organizations and individuals have
attempted to profit from her demise. Some of these unauthorized
attempts to sell Di merchandise, including the Franklin Mint's line
of dolls, plates and jewelry, have resulted in the fund taking
legal action (which is still pending) in an effort to protect her
image; more obscure efforts have flown under the legal radar.
</P>
<P>
   Available officially or otherwise, Princess Di products number
in the dozens, if not the hundreds. A partial listing:
</P>
<P>
   _ Rose-scented candles.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least five video tributes.
</P>
<P>
   _ A CD of the entire funeral mass. (When exactly would you pop
this in the stereo and listen?
</P>
<P>
   _ The Princess Diana Dollar Bill _ a real $1 bill with the image
of Diana slapped over George Washington's picture.
</P>
<P>
   _ T-shirts, including one with the factually incorrect slogan,
``Born a Princess, Died a Saint.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Soap dishes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coffee mugs.
</P>
<P>
   _ A CD of songs about death and sadness (most of them written
well before Diana's death) recorded by pop artists such as George
Michael, Paul McCartney and Whitney Houston.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 100 books.
</P>
<P>
   _ A cheap-looking ``reproduction'' of Diana's driver's license,
listing her height as 5-11 and her weight as 125. Her supposed
license photo appears to have been snapped at a cocktail party.
</P>
<P>
   _ A number of posters, including one with a doctored photo
purporting to show Diana unzipping her jeans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Souvenir plates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Comic books.
</P>
<P>
   _ Playing cards.
</P>
<P>
   _ A $200, 18-inch ``Queen of Hearts'' porcelain doll, produced
by the Society For the Preservation of History, Inc., whatever that
is.
</P>
<P>
   _ The special edition, purple Beanie Baby bear, which retailed
for $5.99 but routinely sells for more than $300 on the open
market.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key rings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Refrigerator magnets.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Christmas ornament bearing a portrait of Diana on one side
and the inscription ``Princess of the Common People'' on the other
side.
</P>
<P>
   _ Music boxes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Postage stamps from a number of tiny countries you probably
never heard of, such as Togo. Most of the art isn't good enough to
be displayed at flea markets.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere there are people who buy these things _ not as kitsch,
not with a wink-wink, nudge-nudge sense of wicked playfulness, but
with the most serious and sincere intentions of hanging the Di
ornament from their Christmas tree, proudly displaying the
porcelain doll in a place of honor in the living room, and lighting
that scented candle before taking a bar of soap from the Princess
Di soapdish and drawing a bath.
</P>
<P>
   I just don't know where these people are.

   Within days of Diana's death, she was elevated to
premature-death pop-sainthood, right there with Elvis and Marilyn,
John Lennon and James Dean.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, given her worldwide popularity before the tragic
accident and the volcano of emotion that erupted following her
death, she may be the queen of them all. She's certainly in a
position to challenge Elvis (whose death-anniversary is Aug. 16,
just 15 days away from Di's) for the crown of most marketable
celebrity, post-mortem category.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund was established to
raise money for some of her favorite charities, including the
Leprosy Mission, the National AIDS Trust and the Royal Marsden NHS
Trust for cancer and organizations benefiting land-mine victims,
and to put some sort of restrictions on the hundreds of
opportunists seeking to market the name and image of Diana.
</P>
<P>
   To date the foundation has raised nearly $100 million. One item
alone _ Elton John's ``Candle in the Wind 1997,'' the top-selling
single of all-time _ has accounted for approximately $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 companies have the endorsement of the fund _ meaning
they can use the official logo of a purple replica of Diana's
signature.
</P>
<P>
   Literally hundreds of other organizations and individuals have
attempted to profit from her demise. Some of these unauthorized
attempts to sell Di merchandise, including the Franklin Mint's line
of dolls, plates and jewelry, have resulted in the fund taking
legal action (which is still pending) in an effort to protect her
image; more obscure efforts have flown under the legal radar.
</P>
<P>
   Available officially or otherwise, Princess Di products number
in the dozens, if not the hundreds. A partial listing:
</P>
<P>
   _ Rose-scented candles.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least five video tributes.
</P>
<P>
   _ A CD of the entire funeral mass. (When exactly would you pop
this in the stereo and listen?
</P>
<P>
   _ The Princess Diana Dollar Bill _ a real $1 bill with the image
of Diana slapped over George Washington's picture.
</P>
<P>
   _ T-shirts, including one with the factually incorrect slogan,
``Born a Princess, Died a Saint.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Soap dishes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coffee mugs.
</P>
<P>
   _ A CD of songs about death and sadness (most of them written
well before Diana's death) recorded by pop artists such as George
Michael, Paul McCartney and Whitney Houston.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 100 books.
</P>
<P>
   _ A cheap-looking ``reproduction'' of Diana's driver's license,
listing her height as 5-11 and her weight as 125. Her supposed
license photo appears to have been snapped at a cocktail party.
</P>
<P>
   _ A number of posters, including one with a doctored photo
purporting to show Diana unzipping her jeans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Souvenir plates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Comic books.
</P>
<P>
   _ Playing cards.
</P>
<P>
   _ A $200, 18-inch ``Queen of Hearts'' porcelain doll, produced
by the Society For the Preservation of History, Inc., whatever that
is.
</P>
<P>
   _ The special edition, purple Beanie Baby bear, which retailed
for $5.99 but routinely sells for more than $300 on the open
market.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key rings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Refrigerator magnets.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Christmas ornament bearing a portrait of Diana on one side
and the inscription ``Princess of the Common People'' on the other
side.
</P>
<P>
   _ Music boxes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Postage stamps from a number of tiny countries you probably
never heard of, such as Togo. Most of the art isn't good enough to
be displayed at flea markets.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere there are people who buy these things _ not as kitsch,
not with a wink-wink, nudge-nudge sense of wicked playfulness, but
with the most serious and sincere intentions of hanging the Di
ornament from their Christmas tree, proudly displaying the
porcelain doll in a place of honor in the living room, and lighting
that scented candle before taking a bar of soap from the Princess
Di soapdish and drawing a bath.
</P>
<P>
   I just don't know where these people are.

BACKLASH DELAYS SAN FRANCISCO'S MASSAGE PARLOR BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The city's Board of Supervisors has cast aside a
proposal that would ban new massage parlors in the Tenderloin
neighborhood amid opposition from targeted business owners and the
women who work for them.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision to delay a deciding vote on the proposal and
return it to a board committee for consideration came a week after
the supervisors gave initial approval to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the proposed ban say it will help clean up the
Tenderloin, long a hangout for prostitutes, criminals, drug addicts
and drunks. They say the massage parlors help attract the unsavory
elements. But foes say the businesses are legitimate operations
that have a right to exist and provide jobs for mostly poor women.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the board's latest action will doom the
proposal, which has been more than a year in the making. Supervisor
Leland Yee, chief sponsor of the proposed prohibition, said he was
hopeful it eventually would become law. The plan earlier this year
underwent two public hearings where public testimony was
overwhelmingly supportive.
</P>
<P>
   Yee said opponents had lobbied hard over the past week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there was a lot of pressure on the board members from
the sex workers caucus and massage parlor owners who felt they were
not heard before,'' Yee said. ``I feel differently about that, but
I'm going to fight like a dickens to preserve the legislation. I
think the community support is still out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Yee reluctantly agreed to support the delay on a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the debate is a heavy dose of old-fashioned City Hall
politics. Monday's action can be seen as a hard slap at Yee, who is
often at odds with the board majority and Mayor Willie Brown. It
was board President Barbara Kaufman who requested that the
legislation be sent back to committee for further review. The
animosity between the two supervisors is no secret.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he thought the board's vote was aimed at him,
Yee said, ``I think there's a tinge of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman, however, said her intention was to give people with
concerns another chance to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a month's delay is going to make a difference,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal targets adult-oriented businesses in the
Tenderloin, which the police say often serve as fronts for
prostitution and other criminal activity, such as drug dealing and
extortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they want to do is take away a lot of people's property
rights, their livelihood,'' said Candice Nguyen, an attorney
working with the massage parlor proprietors. ``It's also
discriminatory because it's targeting these businesses, and not
others, like liquor stores and strip clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners presented the board with a petition opposing the ban,
signed by more than 100 people who work and live in the Tenderloin
district. But those who favor the ban say they have many more
merchants, residents, social service agencies and the police on
their side _ and public hearing testimony up to this point backs up
that contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is widespread support for this ban,'' said Susan
Phillips, a social worker and Tenderloin resident who serves as
secretary of the North of Market Planning Coalition. ``They bring
in criminal elements, and that's something this neighborhood
doesn't need any more of. Enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood, with some 22 city-sanctioned massage parlors,
has the highest concentration of such enterprises in San Francisco.

   NAPOLEONS (Undated) _ What you get from today's restaurant chefs
can resemble the conversation at a cocktail party: some of it is
smart and a lot of it is showing off. Consider the ostentatious
trend toward greater and greater height on the plate, food
sculpture that looks impressive until you try to eat it, and it
falls apart. And the trend, which virtually begs restaurant cooks
to build things ever higher, is seen perfectly in the proliferation
of dishes named after the napoleon, the classic dessert that has
become just about anything you can imagine, as long as it comes
stacked high. By Amanda Hesser.

<P>
   NAPOLEON-CHEF (Undated) _ When I was just learning about fine
cooking as a 14-year-old apprentice in an inn in upstate New York,
I was completely fascinated by the dessert cart. I was particularly
taken with the elaborate pastry cream creations like the napoleon.
And as I learned by the time I got to culinary school, the ability
to create those creamy classics was one of the hallmarks of the
professional. By Charlie Palmer.

   WINDOWS-SOMMELIER (New York) _ When Andrea Immer bounds up to a
table at Windows on the World, she faces diners who invariably seem
wary. Dressed in her severe black pantsuit and white blouse, she is
clearly not the waitress. She did not welcome them at the door so
she is neither hostess nor maitre d'. And her greeting is so
relentlessly energetic, there is a fleeting suspicion she might try
recruiting volunteers for the hokey pokey. What almost no one
assumes _ with her brisk demeanor that seems part corporate
executive, part kindergarten teacher _ is that she is the
sommelier, overseeing a cellar that accounts for $5 million in wine
sales per year. Not only that, but she is was judged the best
sommelier in the country last year by the Sommelier Society of
America. By Alex Witchel.

<P>
   PURSLANE (Undated) _ These days I seem to encounter purslane
everywhere I go. If you eat in restaurants with any frequency, the
chances are that you do, too. For American chefs are finally
beginning to appreciate the many qualities of purslane, the juicy
little weed so prized by the French. By Ruth Reichl.

POSTAL SERVICE PROBES BOGUS LETTER SEEKING PAYMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The U.S. Postal Service is investigating a
mysterious letter asking hundreds of people to pay a bill they
didn't owe to a company that evidently doesn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the anxious backlash of the letter are San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank and a prominent Northern
California law firm. The phone numbers of both the bank and the law
firm are noted in the letter. But officials for both deny prior
knowledge of the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Postal Service inspectors and the Mill Valley police are
investigating the origin of the letters, which are addressed to
``Dear Valued Customer'' by a company calling itself ADS Collection
Services. The letter tells recipients ``you have a past due bill in
the amount of $76.''
</P>
<P>
   It says the customer could face a ruined credit rating or legal
action if the money isn't paid promptly. The return address given
is in Mill Valley, though no company by that name exists in that
town north of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Many, but not all, recipients of the letter are Wells Fargo
customers. More than 200 _ confused or angry or both _ called the
bank last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know who sent the letter out or how many were sent
out,'' Wells Fargo spokeswoman Lisa Rossi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that they may have been mailed out across the
nation,'' she said. ``The letter is fraudulent, and we are assuring
our customers who are calling in that it will in no way affect
their accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter also suggests that recipients with questions about
the bill call a phone number that turns out to belong to the law
firm of Nielsen, Merksamer, Parinello, Mueller &AMP; Naylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been advising people who call not to write checks, or to
cancel checks if they've written them and call the U.S. postal
inspector,'' said James Parinello, a partner in the firm. ``It's a
scam and really quite outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   The letters were mailed from Sacramento last week and were
stamped, not put through a postage meter, which makes it impossible
for postal inspectors to determine the identity of the sender. Nor
does the Postal Service know exactly how many letters were mailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking into it to see if there was any attempt to
solicit money through the mail by making false representations,''
which is a federal crime, postal inspector Steve Kline said.

RESEARCHERS TO DELVE INTO AMERICAN LIVES VIA THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Americans are far more mobile than their
ancestors were a century ago, and that mobility exacts a
psychological price: loss of ties to one's family, relatives,
friends and hometown.
</P>
<P>
   How are Americans coping with this high-speed, high-tech age,
when ``all that is solid melts into air'' (to borrow a line from
Karl Marx, who watched the Industrial Revolution similarly derail
the lives of 19th-century Europeans)?
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic magazine and social scientists want to find
out, using the ultimate engine of mobility, the World Wide Web, by
which humans can navigate global databases, chat rooms and stock
markets at the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, described Monday at the American Sociological
Association meeting in San Francisco, is one of a number of
fledgling efforts to gather scientific data via the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Sept. 20, the magazine is sponsoring ``Survey 2000,''
an on-line sociological survey of the nation. Those who want to can
go on line and fill out a questionnaire to describe who they are,
what they do for a living, where they come from originally, how
well-connected they feel to both their hometowns and new
communities, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   According to the project director, social scientist James Witte
of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., the study aims to
answer questions such as, ``How does migration affect our sense of
community? How much are cultural tastes (for example, in food and
music) influenced by migration?
</P>
<P>
   ``Is regional variety giving way to homogenized global culture?
Are people replacing geographic communities (such as their
hometowns) with substitutes such as (their) profession, workplace
or the Internet?''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say gathering scientific information through the
Internet allows researchers to contact far more people than is
feasible with telephone surveys or old-fashioned questionnaires
sent by mail.
</P>
<P>
   It also is much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   There are drawbacks, too, Witte acknowledged. For one thing,
those surveyed by the Web aren't likely to be a representative
sample of the U.S. population. But he said scholars can
statistically massage the data to extract useful insights into
modern American society.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie May, managing editor of National Geographic Interactive,
said the magazine hoped to increase participation in the survey by
social groups that don't routinely use the Web. Hence, anyone who
needs assistance in joining the Survey 2000 can phone 800-424-9420,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The questionnaire will be posted from Sept. 20 until Nov. 27 at
the following Web site: http://survey2000.nationalgeographic.com.

RETIRED JUSTICE LEWIS POWELL, VOICE OF MODERATION ON POLORIZED
COURT, 90  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lewis F. Powell Jr., the retired Supreme Court
justice who brought a voice of moderation and civility to an
increasingly polarized court during his 15-year tenure, died
Tuesday at the age of 90. An announcement from the court reported
that Powell, who retired 11 years ago and had been in failing
health, died of pneumonia at his home in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Powell was one of the country's most prominent corporate
lawyers, with practical legal skills polished by decades of
experience, when his nomination to the court by President Nixon in
1972 gave him an unexpected second career. He was 64 years old, an
age at which he said he had expected to start ``tapering off,''
when he took the seat made vacant by the retirement of Associate
Justice Hugo Black.
</P>
<P>
   His role on the court eventually became so central to the
institution's ideological balance that his retirement in 1987
unleashed a furious political battle over the nomination of the
prominent conservative President Reagan named to replace him,
Robert Bork. The nomination was defeated and the seat eventually
went to the more moderate Anthony Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   First in his native Virginia and then on the national scene,
Powell had long since reached the highest ranks of the legal
profession. He had been president of three major legal
organizations, the American Bar Association, the American Bar
Foundation and the American College of Trial Lawyers. He was a
senior partner of one of Virginia's oldest law firms, a trustee and
general counsel of Colonial Williamsburg and a director of 11 major
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Born into the insularity and rigid stratifications of the
post-Reconstruction South, Powell cherished his roots in Richmond
and at the same time transcended them. From a young age, he was
drawn to the wider world while maintaining his ties to home. His
long life in some respects mirrored the journey of the modern South
from the country's fringe to its mainstream. He described his
initial response to the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown vs. Board
of Education, the 1954 decision that segregation in the public
schools was unconstitutional, as one of shock. Yet as a Virginia
civic leader and later as a Supreme Court justice, he stood for
moderation and consensus-building on matters of race.
</P>
<P>
   He played a key role on a court that was marked by sharp
ideological divisions. He was the balancer and compromiser, a
political moderate with an aversion to heated rhetoric and
doctrinal rigidity. Neither his colleagues nor lawyers practicing
before the court could take his vote for granted. He had to be
persuaded by the weight of argument, and his vote was frequently
the decisive one, whether the subject was state aid to parochial
schools, remedies for racial discrimination or the rights of
illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   The most important opinion of his Supreme Court tenure was
probably one in which he wrote only for himself. In the Bakke case,
a landmark affirmative action decision in 1978, he bridged two
competing four-justice blocs to extract a holding that barred the
use of rigid racial quotas but permitted race to be taken into
account in university admissions.
</P>
<P>
   He never lost either his acute sense of the court's great power
or his conviction that the power had to be used sparingly. For him,
judicial restraint was crucial to keeping the balance of power
among the three branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   A concurring opinion he wrote in a 1974 decision, holding that a
taxpayer could not bring a suit challenging the way the Central
Intelligence Agency was financed, expressed as clearly as anything
else Powell's vision of the role of the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be ever mindful,'' he wrote in United States vs.
Richardson, ``of the contradictions that would arise if a democracy
were to permit general oversight of the elected branches of
government by a nonrepresentative, and in large measure, insulated
judicial branch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Repeated and essentially head-on confrontations between the
life-tenured branch and the representative branches of government
will not, in the long run, be beneficial to either,'' he said.
``The public confidence essential to the former and the vitality
critical to the latter may well erode if we do not exercise
self-restraint in the utilization of our power.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Powell did not hesitate to place the court's
weight on the side of those who had nowhere else to turn. In 1982,
he joined the court's liberal bloc in providing the crucial fifth
vote for a decision requiring Texas to give a free public education
to the children of illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not unmindful of what must be the exasperation of
responsible citizens and government authorities'' over the influx
of illegal aliens, he wrote in concurring with the majority opinion
in Plyler vs. Doe. But the fact remained, he said, that
``innocent'' children were being denied an education solely because
of their parents' illegal status, and were thereby ``singled out
for a lifelong penalty and stigma.'' He said that ``it can hardly
be argued rationally that anyone benefits from the creation within
our borders of a subclass of illiterate persons.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Franklin Powell Jr. was born in Suffolk, Va., on Sept. 19,
1907 into a family with deep roots in the region. One of his
father's relatives, although not a direct ancestor, was Nathaniel
Powell, one of the original Jamestown settlers and for a time the
colony's acting governor. Powell's mother, Mary Lewis Gwathmey, was
raised on a Virginia plantation by an uncle who had accompanied
Gen. Robert E. Lee to the surrender of the Confederate forces at
Appomatox.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, when he was 28, Powell married Josephine Pierce Rucker,
the daughter of a prominent Richmond obstetrician. The two had met
years earlier, but Powell first became interested in the doctor's
daughter after hearing that she had set a broad-jump record of 22
feet at Sweet Briar College. Their marriage produced four children:
Josephine Smith; Ann Pendleton Bowen, known as Penny; Molly Sumner;
and Lewis 3d. Mrs. Powell died in 1996. In addition to his
children, Powell is survived by nine grandchildren and one great
grandson.

AUTHOR STRIKES GOLD IN CHRONICLE OF SUNKEN TREASURE SHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of 1989, Gary Kinder received a mysterious
invitation to visit a Victorian house in Columbus, Ohio, that was
the headquarters of a business partnership called Columbus-America
Discovery Group.
</P>
<P>
   When Kinder arrived, he was met by the head of the partnership,
Tommy Thompson, who ushered him into an office and closed the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have something to show you,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Kinder saw that Thompson held a bundle in his hands, something
small but weighty, and wrapped in cloth. Slowly, Thompson pulled
away the material so that Kinder could see what was inside.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bar of solid gold. Kinder blinked, and looked again. It
was a (itals) brick (end itals) of gold. A big brick, as shining
and as wondrous as he ever imagined something like that could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hold one of those things in your hands,'' Kinder says
today, ``you realize that gold fever really does exist, and it's
not silly, not silly at all. Gold is so beautiful. It is (itals) so
beautiful. (end itals) He showed me some gold coins, too, and, let
me tell you, it was pretty magnificent stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea'' (Atlantic, $27.50) is
Kinder's bestselling book about that magnificent stuff, and about
the visionary man who found it. At the time of their meeting,
Kinder already had spent two years following Thompson's efforts to
locate the wreck of the Central America, a paddle steamer that sank
in the Atlantic Ocean in 1857, taking with it hundreds of
passengers and a fortune in gold. Even so, Thompson was secretive,
and wanted to bring Kinder into his confidence slowly. That day in
his office, he told Kinder only that he and his crew had found the
bar and a few coins, and were searching for the rest of the gold.
</P>
<P>
   The truth was that they'd found it all _ hundreds of millions of
dollars' worth of sunken treasure _ and by the end of the summer
would be bringing much of it to the surface. Here, from ``Ship of
Gold,'' is how Thompson described his first glimpse of what lay in
the skeleton of the Central America:
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom was carpeted with gold. Gold everywhere, like a
garden. The more you looked, the more you saw gold growing out of
everything, embedded in all the wood and beams. It was amazing,
clear back in the far distance, bars stacked on the bottom like
brownies, bars stacked like loaves of bread, bars that appear to
have slid into the corner of a room. Some of the bars formed a
bridge, all gold bars spanning one area of treasure over here and
another over here, water underneath, and the decks collapsed
through on both sides. There was a beam with coins stacked on it,
just covered, couldn't see the top of the beam it had so many coins
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a heady image, but it is only a small part of ``Ship of
Gold in the Deep Blue Sea.'' The book begins with a narrative
account of the sinking of the Central America, the tense and
poignant story of a brave captain, his terrified passengers and
crew, and their efforts to survive a raging storm at sea. From
there, the book leaps ahead more than 100 years to the odd group of
men who went searching for the wreck under 8,000 feet of water off
the coast of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the group was Tommy Thompson, a young marine
engineer from Ohio who was insatiably curious, had a genius for
experimentation, and took an eccentric approach to nearly
everything he did. Later, Thompson would show how persuasive he
could be when he convinced a group of Ohio businessmen to finance
his search for a ship that even the most savvy treasure hunters had
been unable to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy was a techno-nerd in many ways, but he had more steel in
him than anyone you can imagine,'' Kinder says. ``People look at
what he did at various stages of this thing and they say, `Boy, was
he ever lucky on that one.' But it wasn't luck. Tommy never sleeps.
He's too busy asking himself what can possibly go wrong, and then
he comes up with six solutions for every problem. Then he asks
himself what could go (itals) right, (end itals) and if it does,
how can he enhance it and make it go even better? He is constantly
thinking in all directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My challenge was to tell the truth but still make Tommy
Thompson believable.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinder, 51, first read about the Central America in a 1987
magazine article on lost treasures. Kinder had a law degree but did
not practice. As a young man he had read Tom Wolfe's 1973
anthology, ``The New Journalism,'' and had wanted ever since to
make his living as a writer. He already had published two books
(``Victim,'' about a Utah crime and its aftermath, and ``Light
Years,'' on UFO contacts). On the lookout for a new subject, he
stumbled onto the search for the Central America.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, there were at least five ``treasure hunters'' (a
term Thompson abhorred, Kinder later learned) looking for the ship
and its gold. Kinder met with a few of them before he heard about
Thompson. He made contact through Thompson's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reception was warm,'' he says. ``I was a legitimate author
and I had a law degree, so I could talk their language. I kept in
touch through the lawyers while Tommy was at sea. By the time I met
him, I had already narrowed it down. I liked those other guys, but
they were cowboys. They were treasure hunters. Tommy saw the gold
as a means to an end, a way to entice investors so that he could
develop technology to work at the bottom of the deep ocean. The
treasure was secondary to him. I was sure that if anybody could
find that ship, he was the one.''
</P>
<P>
   It would take two more years of searching and several trips back
to Thompson's investors for more money. Then, in 1989, Kinder was
summoned to the house in Columbus to hold a bar of gold. A few
months later, he was with Thompson at sea when he announced to the
world that he had found the gold.
</P>
<P>
   With Thompson's triumph, Kinder's work began. He drew from
survivors' accounts for chapters on the sinking of the Central
America, and from Thompson's sonar and at-sea logs for passages on
the search and on confrontations at sea with other men who wanted
the gold for themselves. Kinder also had to describe the
cutting-edge technology Thompson used to recover the gold, and the
legal maneuvers through which he claimed the right to salvage it.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling it all into a readable narrative was a grueling task
that dragged on for years. Publication was delayed again and again.
Kinder's advance _ said to be in excess of $100,000 _ ran out, and
he supported his family by giving writing seminars for other
lawyers. Thompson himself asked for another delay because of legal
battles over the recovered gold. And there were personal problems.
Kinder's father died, his mother suffered a series of strokes, and
he was spending too much time away from his wife and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I really wondered if I was doing the right thing,''
he says. ``There was a long stretch when I was just exhausted. I
felt like I had hit a wall, like a marathon runner. I was on my
knees crawling to the finish line and I just couldn't keep going.
It was a humbling experience, trying to pull together so many
disparate pieces of the story and still keep a job and be a father
and a husband.''
</P>
<P>
   With the project finally finished, there are still questions
Kinder can't or won't answer. Exactly how much gold did Thompson
find on the Central America and what is it worth? And what will
Thompson do with it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy refers to it as the `up' gold and the `down' gold,''
Kinder says. ``The `up' gold is at least 3 tons, and it is in a
vault somewhere in Virginia. I don't have a clue where. And the
`down' gold is still unrecovered or is piled somewhere else or
maybe some of each. I really don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy's been trying to find the very best way to handle the
treasure. He has thought of everything possible and then some, and
he's driving everybody crazy. I don't know what he's going to do
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinder's not sure yet what he'll do with his own success either,
with his place on the bestseller lists and his pile of good
reviews. He says he will keep his day job teaching other lawyers
how to write, but he's not sure he'll ever want to do another book.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all I went through, the good reviews have been
comforting more than anything,'' he says. ``It's relief rather than
exhilaration. That after all those years, we really do have a good
book. That I was up to telling this the way it should be told. I
can stop worrying that the first review is going to say, `This is a
great story. If only Norman Mailer had gotten to it first.' ''

RETIRED JUSTICE LEWIS POWELL, VOICE OF MODERATION ON POLORIZED
COURT, 90  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lewis F. Powell Jr., the retired Supreme Court
justice who brought a voice of moderation and civility to an
increasingly polarized court during his 15-year tenure, died
Tuesday at the age of 90. An announcement from the court reported
that Powell, who retired 11 years ago and had been in failing
health, died of pneumonia at his home in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Powell was one of the country's most prominent corporate
lawyers, with practical legal skills polished by decades of
experience, when his nomination to the court by President Nixon in
1972 gave him an unexpected second career. He was 64 years old, an
age at which he said he had expected to start ``tapering off,''
when he took the seat made vacant by the retirement of Associate
Justice Hugo Black.
</P>
<P>
   His role on the court eventually became so central to the
institution's ideological balance that his retirement in 1987
unleashed a furious political battle over the nomination of the
prominent conservative President Reagan named to replace him,
Robert Bork. The nomination was defeated and the seat eventually
went to the more moderate Anthony Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   First in his native Virginia and then on the national scene,
Powell had long since reached the highest ranks of the legal
profession. He had been president of three major legal
organizations, the American Bar Association, the American Bar
Foundation and the American College of Trial Lawyers. He was a
senior partner of one of Virginia's oldest law firms, a trustee and
general counsel of Colonial Williamsburg and a director of 11 major
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Born into the insularity and rigid stratifications of the
post-Reconstruction South, Powell cherished his roots in Richmond
and at the same time transcended them. From a young age, he was
drawn to the wider world while maintaining his ties to home. His
long life in some respects mirrored the journey of the modern South
from the country's fringe to its mainstream. He described his
initial response to the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown vs. Board
of Education, the 1954 decision that segregation in the public
schools was unconstitutional, as one of shock. Yet as a Virginia
civic leader and later as a Supreme Court justice, he stood for
moderation and consensus-building on matters of race.
</P>
<P>
   He played a key role on a court that was marked by sharp
ideological divisions. He was the balancer and compromiser, a
political moderate with an aversion to heated rhetoric and
doctrinal rigidity. Neither his colleagues nor lawyers practicing
before the court could take his vote for granted. He had to be
persuaded by the weight of argument, and his vote was frequently
the decisive one, whether the subject was state aid to parochial
schools, remedies for racial discrimination or the rights of
illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   The most important opinion of his Supreme Court tenure was
probably one in which he wrote only for himself. In the Bakke case,
a landmark affirmative action decision in 1978, he bridged two
competing four-justice blocs to extract a holding that barred the
use of rigid racial quotas but permitted race to be taken into
account in university admissions.
</P>
<P>
   He never lost either his acute sense of the court's great power
or his conviction that the power had to be used sparingly. For him,
judicial restraint was crucial to keeping the balance of power
among the three branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   A concurring opinion he wrote in a 1974 decision, holding that a
taxpayer could not bring a suit challenging the way the Central
Intelligence Agency was financed, expressed as clearly as anything
else Powell's vision of the role of the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be ever mindful,'' he wrote in United States vs.
Richardson, ``of the contradictions that would arise if a democracy
were to permit general oversight of the elected branches of
government by a nonrepresentative, and in large measure, insulated
judicial branch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Repeated and essentially head-on confrontations between the
life-tenured branch and the representative branches of government
will not, in the long run, be beneficial to either,'' he said.
``The public confidence essential to the former and the vitality
critical to the latter may well erode if we do not exercise
self-restraint in the utilization of our power.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Powell did not hesitate to place the court's
weight on the side of those who had nowhere else to turn. In 1982,
he joined the court's liberal bloc in providing the crucial fifth
vote for a decision requiring Texas to give a free public education
to the children of illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not unmindful of what must be the exasperation of
responsible citizens and government authorities'' over the influx
of illegal aliens, he wrote in concurring with the majority opinion
in Plyler vs. Doe. But the fact remained, he said, that
``innocent'' children were being denied an education solely because
of their parents' illegal status, and were thereby ``singled out
for a lifelong penalty and stigma.'' He said that ``it can hardly
be argued rationally that anyone benefits from the creation within
our borders of a subclass of illiterate persons.''
</P>
<P>
   If in his professional career Lewis Powell seemed to epitomize
the legal establishment, his courtly demeanor and soft Tidewater
drawl made him the image of the classic Southern gentleman. Almost
ascetically thin, he was so unassuming that he often appeared to
melt into the background. In crepe-soled shoes, he strolled the
court's corridors and grounds unrecognized by tourists.
</P>
<P>
   His questions from the bench during oral argument were few and
were posed in a voice barely above a whisper. But they were precise
and potentially devastating to the argument of any lawyer who did
not have the answer. His soft manner did not hide the quick and
tough mind that had served him both as a lawyer and as head of the
Richmond school board in the 1950s, a troubled decade during which
he argued successfully against the ``massive resistance'' campaign
that some white city leaders advocated in defiance of the Supreme
Court's desegregation mandates.
</P>
<P>
   According to his biographer, Prof. John Jeffries Jr. of the
University of Virginia Law School, a burning ambition and desire to
excel drove Powell as a young lawyer into positions of leadership
in his law firm, his profession, and his community; ability to win
the confidence of clients and colleagues made his success possible.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Franklin Powell Jr. was born in Suffolk, Va., on Sept. 19,
1907 into a family with deep roots in the region. One of his
father's relatives, although not a direct ancestor, was Nathaniel
Powell, one of the original Jamestown settlers and for a time the
colony's acting governor. Powell's mother, Mary Lewis Gwathmey, was
raised on a Virginia plantation by an uncle who had accompanied
Gen. Robert E. Lee to the surrender of the Confederate forces at
Appomatox.
</P>
<P>
   The family's proud history was no guarantee of lasting
prosperity. Powell's father, raised on a modest farm with little
formal education, finally achieved a hard-won financial security as
manager of a Richmond company that manufactured boxes and
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Jr. was the oldest of four children. Growing up in a
near-rural area of Richmond known as Forest Hill, he attended a
local private academy that aimed at preparing boys for the
University of Virginia. But he engaged in a gentle form of
rebellion and struck out instead for Washington and Lee University
in Lexington, Va., where he achieved both academic and social
success and began to expand his horizons.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the student body, he attended a student
leadership conference in California and met Edward R. Murrow, a
student leader from the state of Washington. The young Southerner
and the future television journalist became close friends,
travelling in Europe together after a student conference in
Brussels in 1930 and visiting together again in London during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Powell was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and received his
undergraduate degree in 1929 with a major in commerce. By counting
some undergraduate courses toward a law degree, he was able to
graduate two years later from Washington and Lee's law school,
where he was first in his class. Throughout his life, he kept
strong ties to Washington and Lee, to which he gave his personal
and Supreme Court papers, now housed in the Lewis F. Powell Jr.
Archives on the Lexington, Va. campus.
</P>
<P>
   After law school, Powell ventured north and earned a graduate
law degree from Harvard Law School. One of his classes was an
administrative law seminar taught by Felix Frankfurter, who later
served on the Supreme Court and who impressed the young lawyer with
a pragmatic approach to legal issues that was very different from
the more formal and unskeptical approach of the professors at
Washington and Lee.
</P>
<P>
   After turning down an offer of a job at a prestigious Wall
Street law firm, Davis, Polk &AMP; Wardwell, Powell returned to
Richmond in 1932, moved back with his parents, and began his legal
career as an associate in a small firm. Soon he moved to a bigger
firm and by 1938 had become its 10th partner. Except for his
service during World War II, he stayed at that firm, known for many
years as Hunton, Williams, Gay, Powell &AMP; Gibson, until he took his
seat on the Supreme Court. He played a leading role in the
evolution of the firm, later known as Hunton &AMP; Williams, beyond its
regional roots to a corporate law practice that was national in
scope.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, when he was 28, Powell married Josephine Pierce Rucker,
the daughter of a prominent Richmond obstetrician. The two had met
years earlier, but Powell first became interested in the doctor's
daughter after hearing that she had set a broad-jump record of 22
feet at Sweet Briar College. Their marriage was a lifelong love
affair that produced four children: Josephine Smith; Ann Pendleton
Bowen, known as Penny; Molly Sumner; and Lewis 3d. Mrs. Powell died
in 1996. In addition to his children, Powell is survived by nine
grandchildren and one great grandson.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He volunteered for military service in World War II, spending
more than three years in Europe and North Africa as a combat and
staff intelligence officer with the Army Air Forces.He rose in rank
from first lieutenant to colonel, earning the Legion of Merit,
Bronze Star and Croix de Guerre. He spent the last half of his tour
in a military intelligence unit known as the Special Branch,
helping to analyze decoded German messages. He presented daily
briefings to senior officers, including at times General Dwight D.
Eisenhower who used the top-secret information to select Allied
bombing targets. Colonel Powell ended his assignment with several
dozen officers under his command, and his return to peacetime law
practice was something of an anticlimax.
</P>
<P>
   He had been active in the American Bar Association early in his
career; he served a term as its president from mid-1964 to
mid-1965. He used that position as a platform to lobby for an
increased federal role in providing legal services to the poor and
helped shape the legal services program of the Office of Economic
Opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Although he never held elective office, he was a leading figure
in Virginia public affairs as head of the Richmond school board
from 1952 to 1961. He was a member of the Virginia State Board of
Education from 1961 to 1969, serving as its president for the
1968-69 term.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia at that time was dominated by the Democratic machine of
Sen. Harry F. Byrd, who advocated stiff resistance to the Supreme
Court's 1954 desegregation decision. Powell believed that such
resistance would be deeply destructive. Under his leadership the
Richmond schools did not defy the court. On the other hand,
integration was very slow in coming to Richmond as elsewhere. When
Powell left the school board in the spring of 1961, only two of
23,000 black students in the Richmond public schools were attending
school with white children.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, the Congressional Black Caucus opposed his
nomination to the court, arguing that he should have done more from
his position as a community leader to fight segregation and its
legacy. Liberal Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee came to
his defense, however. When the committee approved his nomination,
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and three other Democratic members issued a
concurring report that praised Powell's record. ``Lewis Powell was
one of the courageous men in Virginia who was determined to obey
the law of the land,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Virginia inaugurated as its governor L. Douglas Wilder,
the first black person in the country to be elected governor of a
state. Wilder invited Powell, who was retired by then, to
administer the oath. As John C. Jeffries Jr. recounted the scene in
his book, ``Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr.'' (Scribners, 1994), Powell
called out above the applause that followed the swearing-in: ``It's
a great day for Virginia!''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffries wrote: ``For the sea of young black faces raised in
pride and triumph, the good wishes of a frail old white man may
have meant very little, but to those with long memories, it was a
gracious benediction from the best of the old order.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon announced Powell's nomination to the Supreme Court, along
with that of William Rehnquist to fill a second vacancy, to a
nationwide television audience on Oct. 21, 1971. The announcement
came barely 24 hours after the American Bar Association's judicial
fitness committee refused to endorse two Nixon candidates who had
been considered the front-runners for the seats. Powell had turned
down an earlier offer of a seat on the court from the Nixon
administration, and rebuffed Attorney General John Mitchell's
attempt to interest him in the new vacancy. He finally accepted
with a deep reluctance that was overcome only by a direct appeal
from Nixon, who said it was Powell's patriotic duty to serve.
</P>
<P>
   The bar association gave its former president its highest
possible rating, and the nomination was well received in legal
circles. He was confirmed by the full Senate on Dec. 6, 1971, and
he and Rehnquist were sworn in as the 99th and 100th members of the
court on Jan. 7, 1972.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Powell approached his new job without any great relish. He
regretted leaving Richmond and the law practice that he loved.
Midway through his first year, he told members of the Virginia Bar
Association that he was not particularly enjoying the burdens,
constraints and isolation of his new status. ``The truth is that
I'd rather be a lawyer than a judge,'' he told his former
colleagues. ``I really prefer to be competitive rather than
neutral, detached and disinterested.'' Nevertheless, he said, he
had no doubt that if he had it to do over he would still accept the
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to Washington, Powell maintained strong ties to
Richmond. He and his wife, Josephine, kept their Richmond house, a
colonial mansion that had belonged to Mrs. Powell's parents, and
returned there every summer. He also kept an office in the federal
courthouse in Richmond. In Washington, the couple lived in an
apartment in the southwest section of the capital, near the Potomac
River.
</P>
<P>
   But the court, when it was in session, was Powell's real home.
He told a group of lawyers and judges in a 1983 speech that except
for the summer recess, he worked 60 hours a week, ``considerably
more than my chargeable hours ever were at the peak of a large and
demanding law practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell's role as the court's master of compromise and coalition-
building was nowhere brought into sharper focus than in the 1978
case of Allan Bakke. That case, in which the court was asked to
rule on the legality of a state medical school admissions program
that set aside a fixed number of places for black and other
minority- group applicants, sparked a vigorous national debate over
affirmative action that continued for years.
</P>
<P>
   With the court split 4 to 4, Powell extracted a controlling
opinion from the deadlock by joining first one four-member bloc and
then the other. He agreed with one group of justices that the
challenged program was unlawful because it totally excluded whites
from any consideration for the 16 places. But he then joined the
other four members of the court to conclude that a university could
properly consider race and ethnic origin as a ``plus'' factor among
other factors to achieve a diverse student body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The State has a substantial interest that legitimately may be
served by a properly devised admissions program involving the
competitive consideration of race and ethnic origin,'' Powell said
in his solitary opinion. The concept of affirmative action was
preserved and the debate, at least in the short run, defused.
</P>
<P>
   Powell also played a key role in numerous Supreme Court cases
that defined the constitutional boundary between church and state.
Cases challenging various programs of state aide to parochial
schools reached the court with regularity, and Powell's vote was
often decisive in upholding or striking down a particular program.
In that role, the former school board president was keenly aware of
the potentially inflammatory nature of the debate over the
relationship of religion and government. He believed that, apart
from doctrinal niceties, it was vital for the court to avoid
fueling those fires.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1977 he joined a fragmented majority that upheld
an Ohio parochial aid law. In his concurring opinion in Wolman vs.
Walter, he noted that ``at this point in the 20th century,'' the
risk of ``deep political division along religious lines'' was
``remote.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1985, with the political debate over church and state at
a peak, Powell provided the fifth vote striking down parochial aid
programs in New York City and Grand Rapids, Mich. His concurring
opinion in Aguilar vs. Felton, the New York case, cited the
``continuing risk of continuing political strife,'' noting that
``the potential for such divisiveness is a strong additional
reason'' for finding the programs unconstitutional. In the 30
religion cases in which he participated _ many of them decided by
closely divided votes _ he was never on the losing side. The court
itself eventually adopted a different approach to questions of
church and state, overruling the Aguilar case in a 1997 decision
called Agostini vs. Felton.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, Powell voted with the conservatives in
cases dealing with criminal law. He believed that prison inmates
and their lawyers abused their right of access to the federal
courts by filing frivolous lawsuits, and he joined a majority of
the court in the mid-1980s in invoking new procedures for avoiding
protracted appeals in death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   He voted to uphold the death penalty in numerous cases,
including a notable case that asked the court to examine
allegations that application of the death penalty was infected by
racism. Challengers to the death penalty in Georgia presented
statistics killers of whites were more likely to be sentenced to
die than those whose victims were black. Writing for the court in a
5-to-4 opinion, McCleskey vs. Kemp, Powell said that the
statistical study did not ``demonstrate a constitutionally
significant risk of racial bias'' sufficient to invalidate the
death penalty in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty was one of two subjects on which Powell
changed his mind after he left the court. He told his biographer in
a 1991 interview that he regretted his vote in the McCleskey case
and other death penalty cases. ``I have come to think that capital
punishment should be abolished,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He described his view as based on pragmatic concerns rather than
on questions about the morality or constitutionality of the death
penalty itself. Doubts about the death penalty could never be
resolved and would inevitably bring the judicial system itself into
disrepute, the justice said. Jeffries detected a deeper source of
disquiet in the retired justice. ``After 15 years of capital cases,
Powell knew firsthand their deadly hold on the judge's peace of
mind,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Powell was a member of the majority in Roe vs. Wade, the 1973
decision that gave women the constitutional right to obtain
abortions, and he did not waiver in his support of that principle.
He wrote the court's opinion in a 1983 case striking down
restrictions on abortion imposed by the city of Akron, Ohio. His
opinion acknowledged and rebuffed the efforts of antiabortion
forces to persuade the court to overrule Roe vs. Wade. The argument
was settled, Powell wrote; the doctrine of adherence to precedent
``is a doctrine that demands respect in a society governed by the
rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Co. after his
retirement, Powell described a long-ago incident at his law firm
that had shaped his views on the desirability of legalized abortion
in the years before Roe vs. Wade. A 19-year-old messenger for the
firm had called him at home early one morning with a desperate
request for help. His girlfriend had died while trying, with the
messenger's help, to abort a pregnancy. The messenger could have
been charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Powell said he visited the city prosecutor on
the young man's behalf. ``To make a long story short, no
prosecution was ever brought,'' he said, adding: ``So I was in full
agreement with the decision of the court in Roe. I thought a woman
ought to have the right, and I still think so.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the question for the court was whether the
constitutional right to privacy recognized in Roe vs. Wade should
also apply to consensual sex between homosexual adults. In a 5-to-4
decision, Bowers vs. Hardwick, the court rejected that analysis of
the right to privacy. Powell joined Justice Byron White's majority
opinion that described as ``at best, facetious'' the argument that
there was constitutional protection for homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, in a question-and-answer session after a
speech to students at New York University Law School, Powell said
he had originally voted the other way but had changed his mind at
the last minute. He now regretted his vote and had concluded that
the dissent ``had the better of the arguments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He announced his retirement on the last day of the Supreme Court
in June, 1987, giving health problems as the reason. Two years
earlier, he had nearly died of uncontrolled bleeding following
surgery for prostate cancer and had not regained his energy. He was
79 years old, reed-thin and frail in appearance. But he had an
active and productive retirement. Until 1996, when his health
declined sharply, he sat regularly as an appeals court judge _ an
available but little-used prerogative of retired justices _ on the
4th U.S. Court of Appeals, in Richmond. He gave speeches, gently
but pointedly reminding his former colleagues of the importance of
civility and adherence to precedent. On January 7 of last year, 25
years to the day after taking the oath as a Supreme Court justice,
he closed the office he had kept at the court and returned to live
full time at his home in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   He offered no comment, however, on the political firestorm that
followed his retirement. President Ronald Reagan nominated Robert
Bork, a federal appeals court judge and leading conservative legal
scholar who had made no secret of his view that much of modern
constitutional law, from the criminal procedure rulings of the
Warren Court to the abortion decision in Roe vs. Wade, was
profoundly misguided. The Democratic-controlled Senate defeated the
nomination after a nearly four-month battle. A second nomination
for the vacancy, that of Judge Douglas Ginsburg, was withdrawn.
Reagan's third choice, Anthony Kennedy, a federal appeals court
judge from Sacramento, Calif., was eventually confirmed and took
Powell's seat on Feb. 18, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton paid tribute to Powell on Tuesday, saying:
``For over 15 years on the Supreme Court, he approached each case
without an ideological agenda, carefully applying the Constitution,
the law and Supreme Court precedent regardless of his own personal
views about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``His opinions were a model of balance and judiciousness. As a
result, he was the decisive voice on the court in addressing some
of the most important issues of our day.''

WOMEN EVALUATED MORE SLOWLY THAN MEN FOR STROKE TREATMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Women stroke sufferers arrive at the hospital later
and are evaluated more slowly than their male counterparts _ even
though their death rate in Texas is higher than that of men, a
University of Texas Medical School at Houston researcher said.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in getting women to the hospital means that fewer of
them are candidates for treatment with tissue plasminogen
activator, a clot-busting drug that reduces the injury that strokes
can cause, said Dr. Lewis Morgenstern, an UT assistant professor of
neurology.
</P>
<P>
   He published his study in the current issue of Neurology, the
scientific journal of the American Academy of Neurology.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment with tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, must start
within three hours of the onset of stroke symptoms, Morgenstern
said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenstern's study of 241 stroke patients admitted to Hermann
Hospital in Houston showed that it took women 46 percent longer to
get to the hospital after stroke symptoms were recognized. Once
they were at the hospital, it took 49 percent longer to be seen by
a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenstern said he began the study when he discovered that 61
percent of the people who die from stroke in Texas are women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you asked physicians and community members who is
more likely to die of stroke, they would say it was men,'' he said.
``Vascular disease is seen as a disease of men. But a clear
majority of the people dying from stroke in Texas is women.''
</P>
<P>
   A stroke is deadly, and it is the No. 1 cause of disability in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing the disabilities associated with stroke is one reason
the TPA treatment is so important, Morgenstern said.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier study at Hermann showed that the No. 1 reason people
do not get the treatment is that they arrive at the hospital too
late, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in getting women to the hospital could have
sociological dimensions, he said. Because women live longer than
men, they are often alone in their older years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delay may be that they are alone when they have a stroke
and cannot call 911 quickly,'' Morgenstern said. ``But that doesn't
explain the majority of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As for why doctors see women more slowly, he does not have an
answer. ``The best thing we can do is to get the message out that
it is happening. We should tell people about these numbers and see
if it improves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing you can do when you or a loved one has a stroke
is call 911, Morgenstern said. His study showed that patients who
arrive at the hospital by ambulance are seen more quickly than
those who went by private vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting aspect of the study was whether having a primary
care doctor helped patients get treatment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found in this study is that having a primary care
physician slowed you from getting to the hospital by 63 percent,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a stroke, if you call your doctor, you have to
wait for him or her to be paged. Then he or she calls you back and
you go to the office or the hospital. If we have only three hours
to treat the patient, that can be catastrophic,'' Morgenstern said.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnicity also can be a factor in speed of getting to the
hospital, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four percent of non-Hispanic whites were able to get to
the hospital within three hours of their stroke symptoms, he said.
But only 28 percent of African-Americans and 18 percent of
Hispanics managed to get to the hospital in time to receive
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenstern said more education about the signs and symptoms of
stroke is crucial to increasing the numbers of all people who get
to the hospital on time.
</P>
<P>
   Warning signs for stroke include the sudden onset of the
following:
</P>
<P>
   Weakness, numbness or paralysis on one side of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Blurry vision or loss of vision.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden difficulty speaking or understanding speech.
</P>
<P>
   Dizziness or loss of balance or coordination.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden, severe headache.

EATING WELL: IRRADIATED? READ THE LABEL (IF YOU CAN) 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In little-noticed actions, the Food and Drug Administration has
given the food industry more leeway in two controversial areas: the
use of antibiotics in animals and the labeling of irradiated food.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many consumers would like type large enough to be
read without a magnifying glass on foods that have been irradiated,
the FDA has decided that the same size type that is used to list
ingredients is large enough. The type size usually depends on
package dimensions. The ruling took place earlier this month, and
new labels will begin appearing whenever old stocks have been used
up.
</P>
<P>
   The National Food Processors Association had sought a reduction
in the size of the type, and according to a news release from the
association, the FDA's action on irradiation ``will help advance
the use of this important safety tool.''
</P>
<P>
   But Caroline Smith DeWaal, the director of food safety for the
Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer-advocacy
group, expressed concern over the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``When consumers were surveyed two years ago, the biggest thing
on their minds was notification of irradiation,'' she said. ``If
irradiation is as good as the food industry says it is, they should
put big banner labels on the food that has been irradiated rather
than hide it from consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the industry association is moving beyond small type:
it has petitioned the FDA to eliminate the requirement for any
irradiation labeling at all.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of antibiotics, the FDA has increased the
allowable level for residues of tetracycline in milk from 140 parts
per billion to 300 parts per billion. The agency says it
established higher levels after re-evaluating the data. Antibiotic
resistance was the subject of a recently released report from the
National Academy of Sciences, which found that humans can contract
antibiotic-resistant infections from food animals. The new standard
is already in effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are already too many antibiotics used on the farm,''
said Patricia Lieberman, a scientist at the Center for Science in
the Public Interest. ``Increasing the tolerance for them seems to
be moving in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   In another action, the FDA approved the use of the antibiotic
fluoroquinolone in livestock, beginning Aug. 5. It has produced
drug resistance in campylobacter in chickens, and according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
fluoroquinolone-resistant salmonella are also beginning to appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we use antibiotics on the farm, the more likely
antibiotics that doctors want to use to treat people will not be
effective,'' Ms. Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA approved the use of the antibiotic with the
understanding that its maker, Bayer, would voluntarily limit or
stop its sale if the agency determines that its use in cattle leads
to antibiotic resistance in bacteria that cause human disease.

FOOD Q&AMP;A: THE LEMON CURD TRICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My lemon curd often turns out lumpy, even when I stir
constantly. What am I doing wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A: You might have the heat turned up too high.
</P>
<P>
   There is a trick to making a smooth, silky lemon curd, a sort of
custard that is used to fill tarts or cakes: heat the mixture to
just the point when the eggs bind and thicken it, but don't let it
boil, which will scramble the eggs into tough little lumps. The
ideal temperature is 180 to 200 degrees; if you don't have a
thermometer, you can recognize this point when the mixture has the
texture of a rich cream sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to guard against lumps is to stir the eggs and sugar
together thoroughly before adding the lemon juice (citric acid, or
any other acid, will curdle eggs unless they are protected by the
addition of sugar).
</P>
<P>
   You can also try cooking the mixture in a double boiler over
simmering water, or in a thick, heavy saucepan over very low heat.
Whatever method you use, be sure to stir the curd constantly with a
wooden spoon or spatula, and make sure to stir around the bottom
and edges of the pan.
</P>
<P>
   If the curd accidentally comes to a boil, all is not lost; you
can remove the lumps by immediately passing the curd through a fine
sieve. Actually, it's generally a good idea to strain lemon curd
and other custards after cooking, since this insures a lumpless
cream (if the recipe calls for lemon zest, add it after straining).
</P>
<P>
   In many professional kitchens, custards are purposely brought to
a boil, then strained to remove the lumps. While this works as a
shortcut, the result will never be as satiny as a slowly cooked
lemon curd.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon curd keeps for about a week in the refrigerator. Besides
filling cakes and tarts, it can also be used as a sprightly topping
for fresh fruit or berries and folded into whipped cream to make an
instant lemon mousse.

   Steele Pinot Noir 1996 Carneros, Sonoma County, Calif. About
$19.
</P>
<P>
   Jed Steele seems to turn out more different pinot noirs in the
course of a year than Ridge Vineyards does zinfandels. And they're
always worth investigating. In 1996, for example, he produced two
that I know of from the Carneros region. One comes from grapes from
the Sangiacomo Vineyard, the other _ this one _ from both
Sangiacomo and the Durell Vineyard. Sangiacomo is down on San Pablo
Bay; Durell is up in the hills. Combining the cherrylike fruit from
Sangiacomo with the deeper, plumlike grapes from Durell makes for a
beautifully balanced wine, a classic pinot noir. It was aged about
10 months in French oak, has a lovely bouquet and is ready for
drinking now.

   It was impossible to stand outside Diana's death. People who
went to bed on Saturday night thinking, if they thought about her
at all, that she was a foolish and inconsequential woman, woke up
on Sunday morning to find themselves ambushed by their own sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The emotions which overwhelmed the country were large but they
were never simple. It was never just a national outpouring of
grief. Sorrow is more intense when compounded of guilt and ours was
a guilty sorrow. We all had a hand in making the myths which killed
her.
</P>
<P>
   When we mourned her death, we mourned our own. People wept for
their own mothers and fathers, for lost children, as if all the
unconsoled losses of private life had been suddenly allowed to seek
public consolation. The people who placed bouquets on the railings
of Kensington Palace might have been decorating their own family
graves.
</P>
<P>
   One lesson of her death is how much unexpressed sadness and loss
there has been in our midst, how much ache and loneliness. The
churches do not seem to help. The therapists do not help. We talk
and talk. It does not help. In millions of us there seems to be a
vast amount of unmastered grief.
</P>
<P>
   Her death became the catalyst for these suppressed emotions
because we knew she had felt them herself. Her often confused
expressiveness gave us permission to break the Windsor code of
stoic reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly genuine sorrow was mixed with mawkishness and
self-pity. An older generation wondered whether the British had
lost their proverbial self-control. But by and large the grief was
restrained by a determination to honor her life and dignify her
death.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for a people's funeral for a people's princess
became a great popular uprising, not just against the royal family
but against the indignity of dying and the impoverishment of our
memorial rituals. The public wanted something grand for her because
they want something better for themselves than hospital deaths and
dry-eyed cremations. The popular uprising which forced an unwilling
monarch to pay public tribute to Diana was actually demanding the
right to define the protocols of public mourning.
</P>
<P>
   The native British genius for the invention of tradition crafted
her the kind of funeral which honors us all. For one hour life
stood still in homage to life. Now that the gun-carriage and the
lilies are gone, and the last electrifying notes of Taverner's
Alleluia have faded away, we have had the catharsis which only
great public ritual can provide. But by now we are also back where
we started, with the reality of her death, and the eventual fact of
our own.
</P>
<P>
   Had she died as the wife of the prince of Wales, her death would
have occasioned only discreet and manageable sorrow. But Diana was
never a safe and manageable figure. She was a scandal in life and
in death, a woman who had died in the company of her lover, a
defrocked royal princess who both embodied the aura of royalty and
incarnated its failure as an institution.
</P>
<P>
   Because she was unique, no one knew how she should be honored,
and a mighty struggle took place for the symbolic appropriation of
her memory.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of it all, three great families _ the Spencers,
the Windsors and the Fayeds _ duelled in public over the ownership
of her symbolic remains. The ``blood family'' claimed her; her
putative adoptive family, the Fayeds, sought to convince us that
she had almost been theirs; and the Windsors, baffled and battered,
struggled lamely to say that they mourned her like the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   While the three families struggled to control her legacy, two
institutions _ the modern media and the monarchy _ fought to save
their reputations from the stain of her death, and a third, the
Labor Party government, discreetly maneuvered to capitalize on the
discomfiture of the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Watching this struggle was a force _ the British public _ which
at the week's beginning hardly sensed its power and by week's end
had swept all before it.
</P>
<P>
   In Earl Spencer's thrilling defense of the claim of the ``blood
family'' in Westminster Abbey, a very British process of social
alchemy took place. In life, Diana had shed the strangled accents
of her class of origin for the idiom of stardom. In the brother's
eulogy, she was reclaimed by her clan and simultaneously offered
back to the world as their ``classless'' princess.
</P>
<P>
   When the earl sat down, it was clear from the applause which
began among the crowd outside and then spread through the Abbey _
to include the younger members of the royal family itself _ that
his words had succeeded beyond any imagining. The elder Windsors
could only stare at the floor in silence, knowing that the Spencers
had taken their revenge.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the public anger directed at Prince Charles waned as
reality returned and people recalled that divorce is too sad a
business to be a matter of easy blame.
</P>
<P>
   This struggle between the families to appropriate Diana's
meaning was soon caught up in a real battle of institutions. The
finger of blame was pointed at the press and shifted to the royal
family. In turn the royal family was forced, in this ruthless
struggle for legitimacy, to make humiliating ritual gestures.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that the public required the queen to give a
clipped eulogy to her former daughter-in-law, but the media,
battling to salvage its own reputation, forced her into it to save
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily _ and most unexpectedly _ a third institution, Tony
Blair's Labor government, intervened on the monarchy's side. At
first, it did not appear to be doing so. When Prime Minister Blair
appeared on camera to praise the achievements of the ``people's
princess,'' his choice of words suggested that he sided with the
people against the hard-faced family who had turned her out.
</P>
<P>
   But in insisting on a large public funeral, in urging the royal
family to make a public show of their grief, he loaned them the
formidable public-relations skills which had won him the election.
In the process, he managed the difficult feat of becoming a
national rather than a political figure, so that no one _ save a
few resentful Conservatives _ found it objectionable that a party
political figure should be seen on television reading the lesson
from Corinthians.
</P>
<P>
   In managing the monarchy's counterattack, while simultaneously
promoting himself as a national leader, and accomplishing all this
without appearing to profit from national distress, Blair may have
guaranteed himself the kind of power which Margaret Thatcher
enjoyed in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, from the first morning, when cameramen found young black
men weeping openly in front of Buckingham Palace, the public's
reaction set the pace at which other institutions, the media
included, reacted. Certainly the media sought to take control of
the popular mood, with headlines demanding that the queen show
herself to her suffering people.
</P>
<P>
   But the public saw through the media's attempt to turn the focus
of attention away from themselves to the failings of the monarchy.
Which is why, in the end, the public allowed the monarchy to regain
the initiative, and why, just possibly, a repentant public may
force a humbled press to respect the privacy of the grieving
princes.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who stood among the crowds will long remember the quiet
but dignified sense that the moment belonged to them.
</P>
<P>
   Such moments are quickly thrown away and the energies released
are easily squandered. But if someone has the wisdom to put the
people's sense of empowerment to productive use, the effects may
last long beyond that extraordinary week.

ENGLISH ALIVE AND WELL DESPITE IMMIGRATION, STUDY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Waves of immigrants don't threaten the dominance
of English as America's main language because most youthful
newcomers prefer speaking it rather than their native tongue,
research shows.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys of recent immigrant families show that as their children
age, acquiring friends and activities outside the home, the
offsprings' preference for English soars.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-eight percent of immigrant children surveyed prefer to
speak English, according to a study by Michigan State University's
Children of Immigrant Longitudinal Study, or CILS. Six years ago,
the percentage was 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has been called a (foreign) language
graveyard ... What is being eliminated rapidly is these childrens'
ability to maintain fluency in the parents' native language,''
Ruben G. Rumbaut, a professor of sociology at Michigan State, told
the American Sociological Association meeting in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``English is not being threatened in the United States any more
than it is being threatened in the Milky Way galaxy,'' he said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   English-speaking Americans shouldn't gloat over these results,
Rumbaut said. The loss of bilingual skills among immigrants
``implies a significant loss of scarce and valuable bilingual
resources not only for the individual but for the United States in
an increasingly global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumbaut said his surveys showed that ``the force of linguistic
assimilation was incontrovertible,'' even among the group that
clings to its native tongue the longest: Mexican-born youngsters
who live near the U.S.-Mexico border in towns with large
Spanish-speaking populations and many Spanish radio and television
stations.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 survey, Rumbaut and his colleagues found that 61
percent of those Mexican children expressed a preference for
speaking English. That was far higher than in 1992, when 32 percent
said they preferred speaking English.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican immigrant youngsters appear to learn English well, even
better than Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``When CILS children were asked to evaluate their ability to
speak, understand, read, and write in both English and their
non-English mother tongue, over three-fourths of the total sample
in both 1992 and 1995-96 reported speaking English `very well,'''
Rumbaut said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ``only about a third ... reported an equivalent
level of spoken fluency in the non-English language.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend, he said, repeats one seen throughout American
history: While first-generation immigrants may continue to speak
their native language, their children eagerly switch to English.
And in all likelihood, their grandchildren will know virtually
nothing of their ancestral tongue.
</P>
<P>
   It is, Rumbaut said, an ``age-old pattern in American history
... The grandchildren may learn a few foreign words and phrases as
a quaint vestige of their ancestry, but they will most likely grow
up speaking English only.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumbaut criticized as ``misguided'' efforts to restrict
bilingual education.

WINE TALK: ITALY'S 1997 VINTAGE _ POISED FOR GREATNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trouble is that you want to believe. That this will be the
year the home team makes it to the Superbowl. That this diet is
going to do the trick. That (fill in the year) is going to be the
vintage of the century in (fill in the country).
</P>
<P>
   Italian winemakers are sure that the 1997 vintage was the best
ever. Just listen to what Piero Antinori, probably Italy's
best-known grower and producer, had to say about it: ``I have never
seen a vintage like this and I have been making wine for 30
years.'' He added, ``I have never seen the grapes in such perfect
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   But how many times have we heard that claim before? OK, the
Italians' euphoria is understandable: after some pretty mediocre
years in the northern regions, they have a very fine vintage and
reason to celebrate. But the vintage of the century? So many things
can happen to fine wine during the long months it spends maturing
in barrels, during the bottling process and even while it is
traveling from the winemaker's cellar to the consumer's table.
Let's wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   Problems, after all, can be deceptive. For example, to visitors,
Italy may seem like a perpetually sunny place where crops like
grapes grow easily. In fact, Chianti and the other Tuscan wines
have been plagued again and again in the last decade by excess
rain. Italy's last truly great year for wine was 1990, and before
that, 1985. The Piedmont region had good years in 1996 and in 1989;
neither was especially outstanding in Tuscany.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, the weather gave winemakers a break. Late winter
and spring were mild and dry, and in most Tuscan vineyards, the
vines started to bud 10 days early, giving them a longer growing
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one and a half months, crucial months, with not one
inch of rain,'' Antinori said of the growing season. Even though
the harvest was earlier than usual, the grapes had unusually high
sugar concentrations, and this made for higher quality wines.
</P>
<P>
   Antinori sent along a bottle of his 1997 Santa Cristina, a red
wine from his Tuscan vineyards that he positions just below his
Chiantis and sells for under $10. Normally considered a ``little''
wine, of good quality but no particular elegance, this Santa
Cristina, made from sangiovese with about 10 percent merlot, had
depth and flavor one might expect from bottles at twice the price.
</P>
<P>
   The more expensive Tuscan wines in his collection, like the
Chiantis Villa Antinori, Tenute Marchesi Antinori and Badia a
Passignano, and the Super-Tuscans like Tignanello, Solaia, and the
newest, Guado al Tasso, from the seaside vineyards at Bolgheri,
will be released over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   Jacopo Biondi-Santi, the best-known producer of Brunello di
Montalcino, concurred with Antinori, predicting that 1997 will be
better than 1990. ``It's one of the best vintages in 40 years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuela Stucchi-Prunetti, whose family owns Badia a Coltibuono,
a major estate in southeast Tuscany, was cautiously enthusiastic.
``It was certainly a good year,'' she said, ``but high sugars and
consequent high acid levels can cause problems in the cellars.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Piedmont region, 1996 and 1997, both excellent vintages,
are a replay of 1989 and 1990, said Leonardo Locascio, who imports
wines from all over Italy under the Winebow name. ``The 1997's are
extremely pretty wines,'' he said. ``They are beautifully colored
and perfumed wines, many of them almost ready to drink when they
are released. The 1996's are more structured, less approachable
early on. They are the wines to put away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it was with 1989 and 1990,'' he added, ``the
'89s were the wines to keep, the 1990s, with lower acid and higher
alcohol, were more attractive at the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Locascio said that, unlike some previous years, 1997 was
``uniformly great'' throughout Italy. ``It is going to be just as
strong a vintage in Umbria and Central Italy as in the north,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Piedmont,'' he continued, ``the most important grape is
the nebbiolo. Normally, the young nebbiolo wines resemble the pinot
noir; they are light in color, almost pinkish at times. In 1997,
the grapes were dark and the young wine is almost purple. It will
age into really remarkable wines.''
</P>
<P>
   Fausto Maculan, a prominent winemaker in the Veneto region,
hailed 1997 as ``the equal of 1990, if not better.'' The region's
Valpolicella producers, who had a mediocre year in 1996, are
especially encouraged. Producers like Allegrini, Bolla and Masi are
predicting great things, particularly for amarone, which has become
one of Italy's most popular wines. Amarone is a rich red wine made
partially from intensely flavored, dehydrated grapes.
</P>
<P>
   So, can American wine fans taste these Italians for themselves?
The best 1997 Tuscan wines _ Chiantis, brunellos and the
Super-Tuscans _ will not be released for another year. But there
are many lesser lights from the vintage already on the market.
Particularly noteworthy are the whites: pinot grigio, vernaccia,
Orvieto and even chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's reputation for turning out forgettable white wine is,
unfortunately, not exaggerated. Well, 1997 could change all that.
Across the board, the 1997 Italian whites are richer, deeper
colored and more flavorful than anyone might expect. And their
prices, for the most part, are still reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   If, when they begin to arrive next year, the big Italian reds
show the same quality level as the whites, fans of Italian wines
will have some truly exceptional bottles to add to their cellars.
Whether these, too, will be priced reasonably is another matter.

   NEW YORK _ Skate's arrival as a Serious Fish, at least in New
York, can be pinpointed to the day. It was on Jan. 28, 1986, the
day Le Bernardin opened: skate was there on the menu, poached with
browned butter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gilbert introduced it as a fancy fish,'' said Eric Ripert, Le
Bernardin's executive chef, referring to the restaurant's founding
chef, the late Gilbert LeCoze. ``In the beginning, customers said:
`What? Skate? It will never work in such a nice restaurant.'''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ripert figures he sells at least 30 skate dishes a day.
And while customers may ask about its preparation _ he sautees it
in goose fat and serves it with caramelized onions, artichokes and
fennel with squab broth _ no one is questioning its place on the
menu.
</P>
<P>
   It's getting hard, in fact, to find a restaurant that doesn't
serve skate in some form. Downtown at Gramercy Tavern, Tom
Colicchio sautees skate, then briefly braises it in a
lemon-rosemary vinaigrette. At Pearl Oyster Bar, a sliver of a
restaurant on Cornelia Street, Rebecca Charles fries skate until it
is crisp and golden and dots it with a tiny dice of fried potato.
It's plainer but no less delicate or sweet, with the springy
texture of lobster.
</P>
<P>
   Skate is actually related to the ray, and is found year-round
and worldwide _ in the Gulf of Maine (the source of much of New
York's skate), as well as the Pacific, the Atlantic, the
Mediterranean and the Arctic Ocean, among other bodies of water.
</P>
<P>
   The fish's flat, diamond shape yields two edible wings.
Fan-shaped, with a ribbed texture, skate fillets look like
pearlescent angel wings, pristinely white with occasional tinges of
pink.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bowman, purchasing director at Browne Trading Co., in
Portland, Maine, a fish distributor, said that in 1996, the company
sold 35,000 pounds of skate, and in 1997, 50,000 pounds. ``It's
getting more exposure in the high-end restaurants,'' he said, ``and
some of the midsize restaurants are using it in Boston, New York,
Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, New Yorkers are taking the cue and tossing the wings
into their saute pans as they would flounder, trout or sole. In the
last year, Citarella's two stores have been selling 300 pounds of
skate a week. In 1996, they were selling only 200 pounds. And at
$6.99 a pound, skate is about $3 a pound less than salmon steak or
flounder fillets.
</P>
<P>
   What a customer sees at a fish market is a skinned and cleaned
wing, usually on the cartilage. To cook skate on or off the
cartilage is a question of flavor, just like cooking meat on the
bone. Chefs sometimes cook the fish on the cartilage, and then
serve it as a fillet. Or for the sake of efficiency, they will cook
it already filleted. (Home cooks may prefer it filleted; to remove
it from the cartilage after it is cooked is tricky and often causes
the wing to fall apart.)
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, skate was a culinary gift of the French.
``The French have always eaten it, because it's a good quality
fish,'' said Jacques Pepin, a chef and the dean of studies at the
French Culinary Institute in Manhattan. ``It's very meaty, has a
very mild taste, a nutty taste. It's very soft and gentle to eat,
and it's difficult to overcook it.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled recipes for skate in La Varenne's ``Le Cuisinier
Francais,'' a 17th-century cookbook. ``When I was an apprentice, 50
years ago, we were using it,'' he said. But what the French ate,
and served in French restaurants, the Americans threw away.
</P>
<P>
   Pepin remembers going fishing with other chefs on Long Island
Sound 20 years ago. ``All the fishermen kept was the sole, the
striped bass,'' he said, ``and all the rest, they threw back into
the water. We filled up the basket with sea trout, monkfish, skate,
of course, and even the bluefish _ all that people didn't use.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, people can't use them enough.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Revsin, the author of ``Great Fish, Quick'' (Doubleday,
1997), likes skate as an easy late summer dish with tomatoes and
basil. The trick, she says, is to cook filleted skate just until it
turns white, which is about a minute or two on each side.
</P>
<P>
   But what finally persuades people to try skate may be its own
pretty self. ``If one of them flies by, past one person to another
person,'' Ms. Charles of the Pearl Oyster Bar said, ``they see this
crispy, golden fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapeliness is always a plus _ even in a fish.

DEATH IN A CAR CRASH IN PARIS.
</P>
<P>
   To mark this day, NBC is airing a documentary by British film
veteran Richard Attenborough, Diana's friend for 15 years. In an
interview with New York Times reporter Sarah Lyall, Attenborough
discusses his friend and why he chose to make the movie. The
1200-word feature is available for one-shot purchase from The New
York Times Syndicate. (FOR PURCHASE INFORMATION, SEE BELOW.)
</P>
<P>
   Attenborough admits he did not want to present a saint, a martyr
or an icon. For example, he talked to several people who knew her,
including her childhood nanny, who described how Diana had
terrorized earlier nannies by throwing their clothes on the roof or
locking them in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we've demonstrated her ability to laugh at herself,''
he says. ``She wouldn't want to be idolized, she wouldn't want
people to pay homage to her. She would want the people who loved
her to say, `Come on, let's get on with what has to be done.'''

<P>
   After the death of Princess Diana, Richard Attenborough found
himself besieged, as so many of her friends and acquaintances were,
by people begging him to speak and write about her.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a brief article in The Times of London, he turned
down all the requests. But about six months after Diana's death, he
was approached by the producer Robert Halmi Sr., who has worked on
several big-budget television films, about making a documentary
about Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Attenborough, having had time to reflect on her death, began to
think about how he would depict the life of someone he knew well
for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent telephone interview, Attenborough said he wanted his
film to reflect the many things he saw in her _ warmth, charisma,
compassion, sense of humor, star quality, intuitiveness, the
crippling lack of confidence that she worked so hard to overcome _
and to explore the effect she had on others.
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't want it to do was present her as a saint, a
martyr or an icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great difficulty in not lionizing her,'' he says.
``We don't stick her on a pedestal saying that she was a goddess.
We say she was a very perceptive, courageous, revolutionary young
woman who used her good looks and her style and her ultimate
confidence to beat paths into areas which the Establishment would,
in large measures, have avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Diana,'' a two-hour program on NBC at 8 p.m. on
Aug. 31, the one-year anniversary of Diana's death. In making the
film, Attenborough sought a new perspective on a well-trod story by
combining his own reminiscences with footage and photographs from
Diana's well-documented life and interviews with four dozen people,
including some of her closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, he convinced Lucia Flecha de Lima, the wife
of the Brazilian Ambassador to the United States, and one of
Diana's best friends, to speak publicly about Diana, something she
rarely does.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a nod to his audience _ ``Diana'' was made for NBC _
Attenborough's film relies heavily on interviews with Americans,
including First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Washington
Post Publisher Katharine Graham. Attenborough also spoke to a
number of people who were quietly helped by Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Among these were a woman with cystic fibrosis whom Diana
regularly visited in the hospital, and a young woman who is a
quadriplegic and who tells the camera in her soft, labored voice
that Diana ``made me feel that even though I can't use my arms or
my legs, I could do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But other sides of Diana are also presented. Attenborough
interviewed Mary Clarke, who worked as a nanny for Diana and her
siblings when they were little and who described how Diana
regularly terrorized earlier nannies by throwing their clothes on
the roof or locking them in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   He showed Diana returning to her old school and reminiscing
about having to spend Saturdays weeding the grounds as punishment
for various misdeeds. He interviewed the makeup artist who, in the
early days of Diana's marriage, unsuccessfully tried to get her to
stop using blue eyeliner.
</P>
<P>
   And he spoke with Mary Robertson, the American whose son Diana
was looking after when she began dating Prince Charles. There were
times, Robertson related, when Diana would be so daunted by the
journalists camped outside her door that she would stay home,
leaving her without child care and forcing her to stay home from
work, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson's co-workers didn't care, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought it was terribly exciting that my baby sitter was
dating their future king,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Attenborough says: ``Diana had a wonderful sense of humor about
herself and I hope we've put that into the program. I hope we've
demonstrated her ability to laugh at herself and the fact that she
was always very conscious of what she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was divorced, for instance, up went the skirt, up
went the heels, and on went the best clothes you've ever seen in
your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Attenborough met the princess at the behest of Prince Charles,
whom he knew slightly and who asked him to help his new bride
overcome her crippling stage fright.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that she would have to do a certain amount of public
speaking and that she just dried up and got terrible nerves, and
could I come and talk to her about it,'' Attenborough relates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a question of giving her confidence. She felt that she
was not going to be able to do the job, that she had already made
great bloopers, and that the Establishment didn't seem to be able
to help her and point her in the right direction,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``She felt isolated, and most of the times when there were
problems they emanated from this sense of inadequacy,''
Attenborough says.
</P>
<P>
   The film tries to show how Diana rose above that self-image and
literally reinvented herself. Attenborough says that he and his
wife, Sheila, loved ``this young woman who might have been a very
ordinary young woman, but who because she was gutsy and courageous
knocked down barriers that had been in place for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I wanted to talk to were the people who had
witnessed this,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The film does not dwell on Diana's romantic life, except
peripherally: Attenborough tells the camera that when Diana
telephoned him not long before she died to tell him about her
romance with Dodi al-Fayed, he had ``never heard so much fun and
love and happiness in her voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the focus is on her work with charities, especially
those dealing with AIDS and with land mines, a particular interest
of Attenborough's. He plans to donate the proceeds from the film to
the Princess of Wales Memorial Fund, and NBC is setting up a
toll-free number through which viewers may pledge money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I've done this is in no small measure to support
the work to which she was committed,'' Attenborough says.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wouldn't want to be idolized, she wouldn't want people to
pay homage to her. She would want the people who loved her to say,
`Come on, let's get on with what has to be done. Let's get on with
it.'''

<P>
   After the death of Princess Diana, Richard Attenborough found
himself besieged, as so many of her friends and acquaintances were,
by people begging him to speak and write about her.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a brief article in The Times of London, he turned
down all the requests. But about six months after Diana's death, he
was approached by the producer Robert Halmi Sr., who has worked on
several big-budget television films, about making a documentary
about Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Attenborough, having had time to reflect on her death, began to
think about how he would depict the life of someone he knew well
for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent telephone interview, Attenborough said he wanted his
film to reflect the many things he saw in her _ warmth, charisma,
compassion, sense of humor, star quality, intuitiveness, the
crippling lack of confidence that she worked so hard to overcome _
and to explore the effect she had on others.

LIST IGNORES NOTED AUTHORS WHO EEKED INTO 20TH CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In selecting both judiciously and capriciously those works that
would be anointed as the 100 best novels published in English in
the 20th century, the editorial board members of the Modern Library
made certain that Henry James would be aboard.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that Henry Junior of the elegant James clan is a
19th-century figure whose greatest works _ ``The Portrait of a
Lady,'' ``The Bostonians,'' ``Washington Square,'' ``Daisy
Miller,'' ``The Spoils of Poynton,'' the novella ``The Turn of the
Screw'' _ all appeared in print before the century's turn. But the
master lived on until 1916; and ``The Wings of the Dove,'' ``The
Ambassadors'' and ``The Golden Bowl'' are authentic 20th-century
productions.
</P>
<P>
   They're good books, too. Certainly they're superior to some of
the entries on the now-rather-infamous list, and the balloteers may
feel cleansed because Henry James wasn't forgotten. But a protest
may be in order because other notable 19th-century folk who wrote
into the 20th century were rudely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain, for one. ``The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg'' was
published in 1900; and whether that was the last year of one
century or the first year in another, it's the same year that saw
publication of Theodore Dreiser's ``Sister Carrie,'' which made the
list.
</P>
<P>
   There's also ``The Mysterious Stranger,'' issued in 1916, six
years after Twain's death. It's an abrasive fable, and like
``Hadleyburg'' is a product of the pessimism that darkened Sam
Clemens' later years. Perhaps they weren't considered because they
fell short of what may be deemed standard length for a novel. (That
line of thought may also have deprived Edith Wharton's ``Ethan
Frome'' of residence on the list.)
</P>
<P>
   Herman Melville died in 1891, but regardless of when ``Billy
Budd'' was actually written, it was not published until 1924; and
the Modern Library people specified ``published in'' rather than
``written in.'' ``Billy Budd'' is a supreme ironic tragedy at full
length. One wonders whether it was considered at all.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Crane died in 1900 at age 28. Frank Norris died in 1902
at age 32. Crane's ``Maggie: A Girl of the Streets'' and ``The Red
Badge of Courage'' belong to the 19th century's final decade, and
Norris' great novel ``McTeague'' _ the source of Erich von
Stroheim's silent-film classic ``Greed'' _ arrived in the fall of
1899, six months ahead of ``Sister Carrie.'' Yet both Crane and
Norris could have made the 20th-century roll call, and I would have
had them on it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Crane's ``Whilomville Stories,'' published in the late
spring of 1900, only a few days before the author's death on June
5. It's a collection of short stories _ united, however, by setting
and characters, in the manner of Sherwood Anderson's ``Winesburg,
Ohio,'' which made the list and now has fragile identity as a
novel.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Norris has the better claim. His ambitious ``Epic of the
Wheat'' was projected as a trilogy. The first installment, ``The
Octopus,'' arrived in 1901 as a subject for critical acclaim; even
today, some rate it above ``McTeague.'' Norris completed ``The
Pit'' before his death, and in 1903 it was a resounding success
both critically and commercially. But ``The Wolf'' was only
outlined and left unwritten; had the trilogy been completed, Norris
would be a household name today. No matter, ``The Octopus'' should
be on that infernal list.
</P>
<P>
   Both Crane and Norris received early encouragement from Mark
Twain's great champion, who was William Dean Howells. Living long
enough (1837-1920) to become a has-been in his own lifetime,
Howells nonetheless is the prophet of realism and a figure of
lasting historical importance in American literature. I would
include his last novel _ ``The Leatherwood God'' (1916) _ among the
century's great novels, just to get him on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Have I read it? No. That doesn't deter the Modern Library gang,
so let me be as whimsical.

WHAT A WAY TO GET YOUR GROOVE BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days, everybody is talking about Ms. Stella and her
missing groove. Stella is the main character in Terry McMillan's
bestseller ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.'' The book, which was
published in 1996, was made into a recently released movie produced
by the author and starring the phenomenal actress Angela Bassett.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, for the terminally uncool, your ``groove'' is like
your joie de vivre: a delight in being alive or carefree enjoyment
of living.
</P>
<P>
   The movie synopsis: Stella Payne is 42, divorced, a high-powered
investment analyst, mother of 11-year-old Quincy _ and she does it
all. In fact, if she doesn't do it, it doesn't get done, from
Little League car-pool duty to analyzing portfolios to folding the
laundry and bringing home the bacon. She does it all well, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Stella is tired and stressed out so she takes an impromptu
trip to Jamaica, where she meets Winston Shakespeare, a ``tall,
lean, soft-spoken, Jamaican, (who) smells of citrus and the ocean -
and is half her age.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just the introduction to the book. Now, toss in a big
movie screen, a 40-year-old superstar actress with the body of a
25-year-old and a young, virile actor with a megawatt smile and a
body so chiseled that you could play jacks on it. Honey child, if
you're still wondering why women are flocking to see this movie,
you might need to check on your own groove.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, I'm not a movie critic so I am under no
obligation to evaluate the artistic merits of this screenplay. I
loved it and I'm going to see it again because Stella's best
friend, played by Whoopi Goldberg, was so funny that I missed half
of the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's sort of nice to see the tables turned for a
change. All summer long, we've been bombarded with movies starring
middle-aged men with women who could be their daughters. Where are
Sally Field and Meryl Streep, anyway? Was I the only one who
enjoyed ``The Bridges of Madison County''?
</P>
<P>
   One critic I read said that Stella was ``unrealistic.'' Hello!
That's why I go to the movies, to escape reality. If I want the
real world, I'll go over to my cousin's house and listen to her
sweet, but colicky baby scream for two hours while she cooks chili
with too many beans in it. As for my movies, I want beautiful
people, in beautiful places, doing incredible things that will
never happen to me in a million years.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Stella was happy, the audience applauded, and all
the women rushed home to work out so that they could have a body
like Angela Bassett. Yeah, I know, fat chance, but what did we say
about reality?

THE WEED THAT WOWED NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By RUTH REICHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I learned from my two years' experience, that it
would cost incredibly little to obtain one's necessary food, even
in this latitude; that a man may use as simple a diet as the
animals and yet retain health and strength,'' Thoreau wrote. ``I
have made a satisfactory dinner, satisfactory on several accounts,
simply off a dish of purslane, which I gathered in my cornfield,
boiled and salted.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, if I had been there on Walden Pond, I'd have
preferred mine with a little butter. Or maybe blanched and pureed
in a cucumber-yogurt sauce. I like purslane in soup, too, because
it is such a hardy green that it retains its texture even after it
has been subjected to boiling broth.
</P>
<P>
   Thoreau was missing something else as well: Raw purslane is a
treat. It makes a sprightly garnish for rich dishes like pate of
foie gras. It is wonderful set down next to shrimp, where it adds a
bracing counterpoint _ citric, piquant and juicy. And nothing
tastes better atop a quiche or on a potato gratin than a few crisp,
juicy pieces of purslane. As for salad _ if you suddenly come upon
a small green leaf with a great deal of crunch and a refreshingly
acid tang, it is probably Thoreau's old friend purslane.
</P>
<P>
   These days, I encounter purslane everywhere. If you eat in
restaurants with any frequency, the chances are that you do, too.
For American chefs are finally beginning to appreciate the many
qualities of the juicy little weed the French prize as
``pourpier.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Telepan, the chef at Judson Grill, tosses purslane into his
green salad mixture, tops his market vegetable salad with the
little leaves and adds them to his beet salad dressed with
buttermilk. ``It has a nice lemony punch, and it adds a different
taste to the mixture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Forley, at Verbena, likes purslane for its hardiness and
its healthiness. ``It stands up to cooking,'' she said, which is
why she adds it to soup and serves it with her foie gras with
nectarines.
</P>
<P>
   Rocco Dispirito, at Union Pacific, likes the way purslane
retains its acid flavor and its texture when it is cooked. He
pickles it, fries it with bacon as a topping and chops it into
sauces and mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   I have also found purslane on pate at Balthazar, on shrimp at
the Greek restaurant Estiatorio Milos and on potato tarte at
Patisserie Payard. It was on the menu at Daniel the week the
restaurant closed.
</P>
<P>
   Thoreau would undoubtedly be pleased to know that his favorite
weed has become a star in fancy restaurants all over New York. I
suspect he would be even more pleased to learn that most chefs
prefer the wild variety _ which grows in sandy soil, home gardens
(from which it is routinely ripped out) and even in thin, newly
seeded turf grass _ to its cultivated cousin. For purslane has
become so popular that it is now being grown in shades of pink and
gold.
</P>
<P>
   Does this impress the chefs? Not really. They concede that the
more colorful leaves are very pretty, that the smaller leaves are
more refined. Still, they say, there is no substitute for the wild
stuff. It may be common, but it has character.

   It might seem a case of typical British hypocrisy to be
canonizing Diana, when we could not get enough of reading about her
blunders when she was alive. But to call this hypocrisy is to miss
an important point about the celebrity cult.
</P>
<P>
   By now we know Elvis Presley was a drug addict, yet he is
worshipped. Marilyn Monroe was a depressive with a knack for
choosing the wrong lovers, yet she is still worshipped. The more
celebrities show their flaws, the more we love them after they die.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities live out their lives in public, to feed our
fantasies of glamor, but also to display our own weaknesses, so we
can feel better about ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   We can't blame the paparazzi for its excesses. Paparazzi may not
be edifying individuals, but we cannot blame them for our
appetites. Just as there is never a shortage of women willing to
serve in brothels, people queue up to be celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a difference between a media celebrity and a
prostitute: A prostitute offers her body, a celebrity has to sell
his or her life. Celebrities must ``share'' their anguish with us,
confess their latest sins, tell us everything they think, and above
all, feel. That is the deal, the Faustian pact: They can have fame
and fortune, but the public has the right to ``know.'' The
celebrity can have dinner at the Ritz every night, but only with
paparazzi in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The modern cult of celebrity is different from the traditional
deference paid to royal families. Monarchies depend on secrecy to
preserve mystique. The most traditional, and certainly the most
secretive, monarchy today is probably the Japanese. The lives of
its senior members are hidden behind a thick screen of courtiers.
The closest thing to a showbiz monarchy is Monaco's.
</P>
<P>
   The British royal family is in a halfway house. It is still a
secretive institution. When the queen allowed the BBC to film the
family's private moments some years ago, astonishingly, the Rubicon
was crossed.
</P>
<P>
   Diana had no special talent. But she was unique in that her
status was based on the royal mystique, which she used to become a
modern superstar. She rebelled against the royal family, but
insisted on her royal titles and privileges. She was an insider and
an outsider. This gave millions of British people the opportunity
to support her rebellion against the House of Windsor, without
becoming ``revolutionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a chauvinistic side to this too. Writing in The
Guardian, Julie Burchill contrasted Diana's ``fresh, unpretentious
breath of roll-up-your-sleeves, best-foot-forward Englishness'' to
the ``Gothic gloom'' of the ``dysfunctional Graeco-Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   There was an atmosphere of protest in the silent crowds waiting
for seven hours or more to pay their respects to Diana. I was
reminded of the Chinese crowds paying homage to Zhou Enlai in
Tiananmen Square, after his death in 1976. Defying official orders,
they came en masse to lay flowers and wreaths. They were not
revolutionaries, but their gesture was a silent rebuke to the Gang
of Four who still ruled China. The mood among the mourners for
Diana was summed up for me by a semiliterate letter on a bunch of
flowers laid on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   It began: ``You was a rose in a garden of weads.'' The message
to the House of Windsor was clear: She was one of us, and we will
never love you, the way we loved her.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who hope that the monarchy can be saved by
following Diana's example, by becoming more successful celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   It is too late for the fidgety, middle-aged Prince Charles to
become a superstar. His son, William, might have the necessary
qualities. He certainly has the looks. But apart from the cruelty
of making someone into a celebrity who might not wish it, there is
something wrong with a celebrity-king. A king is born. A celebrity
could be anyone. If we cannot get rid of celebrities, we might at
least get rid of kings.

BLURRING FACT AND FICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are sad days for fictionalized journalism.
</P>
<P>
   First Janet Cooke, then Patricia Smith, then Stephen Glass and
now Mike Barnicle have lost their jobs for making up stuff and
passing it off as truth.
</P>
<P>
   This seems to me a terrible hypocrisy as newspapers print
fiction all the time (Blondie, the weather report, presidential
denials, etc.) and nobody gets upset, let alone loses his or her
job.
</P>
<P>
   In my opinion, newspapers need to be running more fiction, not
less, as reality is much too hard to digest over one's morning
coffee. My favorite newspaper is Weekly World News, which prints
nothing but fiction disguised as fact. The Weekly World News is the
media source that I turn to when I want to find out which
congresspeople are under the control of aliens (Newt Gingrich,
Trent Lott and Barney Frank, to name a few), the location of the
latest Elvis sighting (a Blockbuster Video in Columbia, Md.), the
latest, updated date of the End Of The World (Nov. 13, 2003) and
the Bigfoot Diet (apples, romaine lettuce and human brains).
</P>
<P>
   Weekly World News, needless to say, is wildly popular. It has
more readers in a week than The New Republic has in a year. The
paper's writers are not fired for making stuff up. In fact, they
are richly rewarded. (Presumably, if the writers tried to pass off
fact disguised as fiction, they would be fired. After all, that is
the province of the ``mainstream'' press.)
</P>
<P>
   The Weekly World News is also fun to read, whereas mainstream
papers print articles that run the gamut between upsetting and
depressing. (See Monica Lewinsky, Northern Ireland, the NBA, et
al.)
</P>
<P>
   Mob journalism, such as what you see at schoolyard shootings and
presidential sex testimonies, is an ugly sight and plays a large
part in lowering the public esteem of journalists to a station
usually reserved for serial killers and used car salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction writers, however, want no part of the pack mentality.
They can ``research'' their stories just as capably while lounging
next to the pool or watching television. Fiction writers don't
shove microphones into a murder victim's mother's face and ask her
how she ``feels.'' They don't stand there like ninnies in the
middle of the South Lawn with their toupees flapping in the breeze,
shouting dumb questions at the president while he boards his
helicopter for Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction writers may not hew to all the ``rules'' of traditional
journalism, but they have a dignity and class that is often missing
from their fact-addicted counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas traditional news reporters tend to be disheveled and
distracted, fiction writers are the picture of calm and
sophistication. While traditional news reporters are chasing after
plane crashes and stained dresses, fiction writers are gazing out
the window in quiet contemplation or perhaps curling up for a
mid-afternoon nap.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction writers do not need to worry about misquoting people or
misspelling names, because all the quotes and names are made up.
</P>
<P>
   There is little threat of a libel suit either as fictional
people almost never sue.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking down the news is an expensive, time-consuming business
requiring lots of long-distance telephone calls, plane tickets and
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction writers need only a pad and a pencil, and maybe a
comfortable couch on which to recline during those occasional
lapses in inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Since most people hate journalists and don't believe what they
read in the newspaper anyway, it is doubtful that the public's
faith in journalism will be damaged by replacing fact with fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, it will keep a lot of columnists like myself off the
welfare rolls and make breakfast for all of us a lot easier to
digest.

HILLARY'S ANGER 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Naturally we noticed the deliberate way that Hillary Clinton
avoided body contact with her husband as they got on the plane for
Martha's Vineyard. And how when they arrived she took off in a
different direction and he seemed to momentarily misplace her.
</P>
<P>
   She was as gracious as ever to the crowd but still allowed a
hint of cold shoulder to the man who did her wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In that way she didn't disappoint. We wanted her to show at
least a trace of legitimate anger.
</P>
<P>
   But what else was going on behind those dark glasses?
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson said Hillary Clinton felt humiliated. Spokeswoman
Marsha Berry suggested she was angry.
</P>
<P>
   But was she furious? Was she feeling like a chump? Did she wince
when greeted with open arms by Vernon Jordan, the friend who helped
the other woman get a job? Was she wishing she could back up the
ramp and fly on to Nantucket?
</P>
<P>
   And what are we hard-core Hillary fans, who wavered on Bill
through these tawdry times but remained steadfast to Hillary,
supposed to think now?
</P>
<P>
   We said if it's okay with Hillary, it's okay with us. Maybe they
had an arrangement. But at the same time we got mad on her behalf
and felt sick for her. Even before he went on TV and admitted to
the relationship with Monica Lewinsky, we wondered how Hillary
could stand all the snickering. As much as she's protested her
husband's innocence we wished she had a lamp to throw or a string
of lovers to give her comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night Hillary fans, like everyone else, tuned into every
breathless update on late night TV. We railed at Bill Clinton for
being so stupid and wished Hillary could be doing the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   She has lots of friends and fans, but who is her confidante? At
a time like this you need more than the ghost of Eleanor Roosevelt
to confide in. You need a friend who will pour you a glass of
brandy, pass you a box of Kleenex and let you rip.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton has made a lot of sacrifices for the sake of the
presidency. At times it seemed she was the greater patriot,
considering what she is willing to give up for her country.
</P>
<P>
   To satisfy public opinion and presidential advisers she's been
remodeled, re-coiffed, muffled and silenced. She's had to edit her
opinions, reign in her intelligence, quiet her influence and stifle
her emotions.
</P>
<P>
   She's been mocked and burned in effigy and told to butt out of
public life. At the same time her personal life has been dragged
through the streets.
</P>
<P>
   She has willingly changed her image to keep her husband popular.
She's worn warm colors and pushed her hair into a headband and
refrained from being uppity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she hasn't backed off to the point of being ineffectual and
has continued to speak out on women's rights. In all the advances
to women credited to the Clinton presidency no one doubts her
significance. Fans enjoyed the romance of the Clinton marriage,
too. For all the skepticism that theirs was a political
arrangement, the two came across as a couple very much in love.
Here was a modern marriage between two equals, who respected each
other and cuddled too. Then he had to wreck it.
</P>
<P>
   So what role does Hillary play now? She has been the adoring
wife and the loyal wife but she's never played the sappy
long-suffering wife.
</P>
<P>
   It must gall her to know that some people who didn't like her
when she was strong now give her high approval because they feel
sorry for her.
</P>
<P>
   The other night a TV commentator said Bill Clinton must now
realize how much his forgiving wife loves him and you wanted to
shout back, ``That isn't the question.''
</P>
<P>
   However, even a loyalist has to wonder if Hillary really was the
last to know.
</P>
<P>
   How do you find out one day that your husband has been lying to
you and over the weekend help him write his apology?
</P>
<P>
   For how long has she been walking across the White House lawn,
holding the presidential hand and looking cozy while digging her
fingernails in deep?
</P>
<P>
   She's an intelligent and savvy woman and has known her husband
from past infidelities. Would she have let him lie this long to
her? And continue to lie to the country?
</P>
<P>
   With all that's happened, we don't want to be disappointed by
Hillary, too. We don't want to hear her say some day that she knew
about it all along, and she lied to us to protect her husband and
her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   We want to stick by her, share the pain, withhold the pity and
hope she finds an isolated beach where she can kick sand and scream
into the wind.

NATION'S TOP PARTY SCHOOL ISN'T TOASTING DESIGNATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE HUREWITZ  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A national survey released Monday has rated the
State University of New York at Albany the top party school in the
country. But there were no chants of ``We're Number One'' from
administrators or students.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 edition of the Princeton Review Guide awarded the
dubious honor in its seventh annual ``unscientific index of campus
life and customer satisfaction'' based on responses to
questionnaires by 56,000 students at 311 of the nation's top
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Many at the school felt it was getting a bum rap, as they did
last year when the review _ which has no connection to Princeton
University _ had the school ranked No. 3 in the nation. Last year's
No. 1 party school, according to the guide, was West Virginia
University, which is now ranked No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think we're the number-one party school,'' said
Albany spokeswoman Mary Fiess. ``We think our students and parents
of our students know about our quality academic programs, but we
are concerned about prospective students who might be misled by
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiess conceded the school has problems with alcohol abuse, but
they are no different than the widely reported problems of binge
drinking on campuses throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   She said the institution has a ``zero-tolerance policy''
regarding substance abuse and strict policies for violations by
campus organizations. In the last year, for example, the university
severely sanctioned a fraternity found guilty of hazing.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Custard, author of the guide, said the party list always
sparks the most controversy but said it shouldn't be taken
seriously. He said it is based on an unscientific survey of several
hundred students at each campus and makes no claims to be
statistically accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing this mostly for fun,'' Custard said. ``We
strongly encourage people not to jump to conclusions about things
like a party-school list. For example, if you look at the schools
on the top of that list _ Albany, Wisconsin, the University of
Florida _ those are great schools, there's no question about that.
All we're pointing out is these are places where they are having a
lot of pretty exuberant fun. Hopefully, they are doing it
responsibly.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the spirit in which Albany senior Katie Martyn took the
findings. The 22-year-old human-biology major works as a waitress
at The Washington Tavern, itself rated in a magazine survey last
summer as one of the top 100 college bars in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a party school, because I know that people who
come to visit me from other schools cannot get over how late the
bars are open or how many people are out or how many parties are
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   She has spent so much time partying that it will take her
another year to get her degree, she said, but she has both enjoyed
her time at school and is getting a good education. But she
recognizes that some people will be uncomfortable with a
party-school label.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was almost universally glum from the students
interviewed for this story.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Shatz, a senior and political-science major, said the
reputation is not at all accurate and the designation is harmful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's detrimental to the reputation of the students when they
come out of here,'' Shatz, 20, said.
</P>
<P>
   She worked for telemarketing efforts by the school and said last
year's survey label hampered fund-raising. ``Every time you call
and ask for money, parents or people in the community say, `I'm not
going to contribute to a school like that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Franzoso, 21, a senior and psychology major, said when her
parents heard about the ranking last year they expressed their
concern that their tuition money was being wasted.
</P>
<P>
   Another student said she got a call from her grandmother in
Ohio, who learned about last year's ranking from news media.
</P>
<P>
   Brigid Bergin, 20, a senior and vice president of the Student
Association, said the label is unjustified and a result of flawed
methodology.
</P>
<P>
   And then she offered some rankings of her own: ``We're here for
academics. We're here because we have the number-five public policy
department in the nation, because we have the number-one criminal
justice department ... because our business school is competitive
with business schools at Ivy Leagues. We're just smarter because
we're saving a lot of money in our education.''

   _  &UR; (Diana was loved for her beauty not her charity, and the more
unhappy she was the better she looked.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The day that Diana died was like Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Day, one can be out walking and pass a stranger
and, although perhaps no greetings are exchanged, there is a shared
knowledge of the significance of the date. As I walked past others
to the newsstand last Aug. 31 I wondered: Does the man behind the
counter care? Does the woman in line in front of me care? And how
much?
</P>
<P>
   Diana's story is a tug-of-war between words and pictures in
which pictures win every time. Verbal portraits of her have always
tended to be feeble _ especially her own. Words were not her thing.
Many published interviews with her were unsatisfactory, partly for
this reason. When she spoke, what she had to say was often
lackluster. Her best argument was her image.
</P>
<P>
   Her pictures did more than tell stories, they were a substitute
for them. Now her story has to go on without pictures. Once the
photographs of the crash are all published, there will be no more.
Newspapers have fallen ravenously on old photographs and made
themselves fat with them. But the glut of portraits of Diana since
her death has been disagreeable.
</P>
<P>
   It is more than melancholy to look at these portfolios, this
picture pile-up of a life. The photographs themselves seem suddenly
dead. Their greatest charge was always that they were of a living
princess, a continuing story.
</P>
<P>
   Now more than ever Diana's story is in the keeping of
journalists and what we are being told about her has swerved into
an unconvincing Florence Nightingale narrative. But her charitable
heart would have counted for little without her beauty. She was
loved for her beauty and because of her unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
   And, for women, there was the special fascination and amazement
of observing that the more unhappy Diana was, the better she
looked.
</P>
<P>
   She was the only member of the royal family who looked royal,
the only female member not to look like a luminous frump. And so it
is no surprise that since her death there have been elegies for her
wardrobe, prolonged sartorial laments.
</P>
<P>
   It is as though the clothes had to stand in for character, each
dress a quality. Each dress had its moment: the blue one that Diana
wore in Sydney, just after her marriage to Charles, and the white
one that she wore a little later, alive with crystals. It was the
white dress that seemed to mark her transformation from cygnet to
swan.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if Diana's life had been handed over to a novelist who
produced a tragic ending for his own convenience. And if you were
reading the novel, you would say that the author (who clearly had
no interest in comedies of manners) had a failure of nerve, did not
dare see Di and Dodi into their future.
</P>
<P>
   The other possible author for this tragic narrative is an angry
child. Children cheer themselves up, when others have treated them
unfairly, by thinking: You'd be sorry if I was dead, and then
imagining their own funerals where their enemies shed tears.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if this is what has happened in a larger than life way
to Diana. And her critics are one-by-one coming around, or else
having to stay silent and watch the devoted legions mourn.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Andrea Immer bounds up to a table at Windows on
the World, she faces diners who invariably seem wary. Dressed in
her severe black pants suit and white blouse, she is clearly not
the waitress. She did not welcome them at the door, so she is
neither hostess nor maitre d'. And her greeting is so relentlessly
energetic, there is a fleeting suspicion that she might try
recruiting volunteers for the hokeypokey.
</P>
<P>
   What almost no one assumes _ with her brisk demeanor that seems
part corporate executive, part kindergarten teacher _ is that she
is the sommelier, overseeing one of the city's most respected
cellars, one that accounts for $5 million in wine sales a year. Not
only that, but she holds the title of BEST sommelier in the
country, as she was judged last year by the Sommelier Society of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Immer, who is 31 and stands all of 5 feet 2 inches, looks as
if she couldn't buy a beer without being carded. But make no
mistake. She not only is intimately acquainted with all 870 wines
in the restaurant's cellar, but also spent a year studying
thousands more to represent the United States in the Sommelier
World Championship, held earlier this summer in Vienna. Though she
did not win (the representative from Germany did), she was one of
only two women among 30 contestants.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening at Windows, she approached a table of four _
three women and a man. ``We're going to defer to the gentleman,''
one of the women said, when asked about wine. ``That's nice for a
change of pace,'' Ms. Immer shot back. They all laughed. The man
did not. Instead, he began a rapid-fire quiz of vineyards and
vintages, all of which she parried expertly.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he asked sulkily, ``How's the Araujo drinking?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' she said. He nodded, as she took off for the cellar to
retrieve the $140 bottle of cabernet sauvignon, one of the most
sought-after boutique wines from the Napa Valley. ``Awesome
choice,'' she concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Her next stop was a private dining room where four men in
suspenders barely acknowledged her. One managed to break away from
the conversation long enough to bark, ``White.''
</P>
<P>
   She surveyed their food order. ``They're having steak and
lobster,'' she said, ``so we'll do something big and brawny. The
Girard chardonnay is drinking so great now. I know they'll be super
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   How can she muster so much perkiness in the face of so much
rudeness?
</P>
<P>
   She shrugged. ``It's a great challenge particularly with men,''
she said. ``You need a different game face. There's a huge
clientele that wants to play around with you, but that's part of
what the restaurant business is. What's nice about it is that the
business is also extremely personal, an opportunity to try to
share, to make the experience much more than a drink. If you get
people in the right frame of mind, you can get them in this sharing
thing with wine that's so personal. It's why chefs cook for people.
It's a total thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   The job description for a sommelier, Ms. Immer said, is someone
who needs ``an encyclopedic palate, a keen sense of diplomacy and
empathy table-side _ hopefully also a sense of humor.'' All of
which is at odds with the caricature of the traditional sommelier,
a portly, older gentleman bearing a silver tasting cup and a
permanent air of condescension.
</P>
<P>
   She decanted the bottle of Araujo, holding it over a candle to
illuminate the sediment, then pinched out the flame with her
fingers. ``You can't blow in the dining room, it's like sneezing,''
she explained. She poured a tiny bit into a glass, swirled it and
sniffed. ``Mmm, pretty,'' she said, adding, ``We don't use doilies
and coasters here because we want to reduce the paraphernalia
table-side. It's less imposing.''
</P>
<P>
   She darted from one table to another like a firefly. Not all
customers had the expertise of the man at the first table, and
after Ms. Immer gently guided them _ asking about their food and
the wines they liked _ they seemed to leave having learned a new
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   A waiter went by with a tray holding a bright green drink. It is
the restaurant's version of iced tea, which in her dual capacity as
beverage director, Ms. Immer created. ``It's brewed green tea and
spearmint leaves, sweetened with kiwi syrup and pineapple juice,''
she said. ``Delicious.''
</P>
<P>
   How does she have the time to run such an enormous cellar and
invent cocktails as well? ``Cocktails are job security,'' she said.
``People drink a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Glancing at her watch, she took off for her office to call her
4-year-old son, Lucas, to say goodnight. Then it was back to the
restaurant, where she had a few more hours to go to meet her
regular 11-hour day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 22 years of great wine and great wine history
here,'' she said. ``I don't want to blow it.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't seem likely.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Grand Forks, N.D., as Andrea McKinster, she said: ``I'm
Scotch-Irish with a little Cherokee Indian thrown in. It's the only
exotic thing I can lay claim to.'' She and her older brother grew
up in Florida, Texas and Indiana; her father was a much-transferred
manager for Pillsbury. ``We ate a lot of slice-and-bake cookies
when we were little,'' Ms. Immer said.
</P>
<P>
   She graduated from Southern Methodist University in 1988 and
spent a year in the financial analyst program at Morgan Stanley.
``I could see all too clearly the proscribed path of that career
track,'' she said. ``I didn't like the idea that life could be so
pedestrian. I tried to think of a new way to spin it.''
</P>
<P>
   While still employed there, she volunteered at the International
Wine Center and the Windows on the World Wine School, pouring for
wine classes. ``At first it was learning for fun,'' she said. ``But
the more I did it, it became a different type of learning _ like
opera or orchids, a culture. I was intrigued by the sheer hedonism
of the experience combined with the absolute certainty that I could
never master it. I could go on forever and always have the thrill
of a neophyte.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She moved on to an importing company to do public relations,
then called Kevin Zraly, the director of the wine school at
Windows, who advised her to spend time in Europe. She bought a
Eurailpass and a youth hostel card and took off, alone, for five
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I left, typical me, I sent faxes, letters or postcards
to every place listed in the Wine Spectator,'' she said.
``Sometimes when I showed up, people said, `Who the hell are you?'
but most of the time they showed me the vineyards _ as soon as they
saw how absolutely gung-ho I was. Wine people are so incredibly
giving and sharing.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the States in the fall of '90, she returned to the
International Wine Center, where she ran tastings, taught some
introductory classes and honed her abiding passion for pinot noirs,
especially those from the Russian River Valley in Northern
California. ``To me it's the perfect grape,'' she said. ``The
flavor is intense, but it has a silky almost ethereal texture, so
it goes great with almost any food.''
</P>
<P>
   The following January, Zraly hired her to run the wine school at
Windows. At night she worked in the cellar to learn the wines, and
gradually she trained in the restaurant with the sommelier before
working her own shifts. Two years later when the cellar master
left, she got the job, the first woman at Windows to do so.
</P>
<P>
   She was thrilled. ``The cellar master buys the wine, works the
floor, trains the staff,'' she said. Three months later the World
Trade Center was bombed, and she was out of a job. She became
pregnant that spring, and after her son was born she worked as the
maitre d'hotel and sommelier in the dining room at the Hilton Hotel
in Short Hills, N.J. Less than a year later she became the beverage
director at Restaurant Associates, but once Windows on the World
was scheduled to reopen, she returned.
</P>
<P>
   Her career ascension has been dizzying, to say the least. Last
year she became a co-host of ``Quench,'' a talk show on the Food
Network. She seems to do it all. ``I've always been the kind of
person who could think about a fantasy in a rather calculated
way,'' she said, ``which is strange sounding, but when I saw the
possibilities about the industry I had fallen in love with, I could
see what I needed to do to gain a mastery of the field. It became
obvious I had to immerse myself, make a serious commitment of time
to taste and read and learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Most other wine professionals applaud her despite her unorthodox
background. The traditional route to becoming a sommelier is either
through spending a longer time in a restaurant setting or working
for a wine retailer or buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has excellent taste and an excellent comprehension of
wine,'' said Daniel Johnnes, the wine director for Montrachet and
the Myriad Restaurant Group. ``She's doing a great service for
people who want to get into the industry, especially women. She
changed careers to follow a passion and reached a pinnacle.''
</P>
<P>
   The support is not unanimous, however. There is some sniping
within the industry about what is perceived as Ms. Immer's talent
for self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Zraly insisted. ``Andrea has a tremendous passion for
wine,'' he said. ``She tastes like 20 wines a day, and I think she
deserves all the credit she gets. It bothers me to hear a charge of
self-promotion. But it must be part of being on top. People go
after you.''
</P>
<P>
   Later this fall, Ms. Immer will help reopen Cellar in the Sky,
the wine restaurant at Windows on the World, which closed in
February. Its original concept of a $125 prix-fixe tasting menu
paired with wines dating to 1977 did not succeed. ``More people
know what they want now,'' she said. ``The Cellar will be an a la
carte restaurant with a simple market-driven menu heavily reliant
on wine.''
</P>
<P>
   When she's not working, she is at home in Glen Rock, N.J., with
Lucas and her husband, Bob Immer, who consults on wine for
educational programs and corporate events.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Immer's parents, who have settled in Charlotte, N.C.,
did not drink wine when she was growing up, they do now. Like many
Americans, she says, they drink bag-in-box wine. ``It's a five- or
eight-liter container with a plastic spigot you keep in the fridge
so it disperses into the glass,'' she said. ``Gallo, Inglenook,
Almaden all make them.''
</P>
<P>
   Can she say they are good with a straight face? She nodded
earnestly. ``Generally, I would say the table wine standard in this
country is decent,'' she said. ``I would like it if they traded up,
because they would enjoy it. But for heaven's sake, they're
drinking wine. They don't expect to be judged on their selection.
That would be mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Her democracy extends past wine, to the tequila tasting she ran
recently at Windows as part of a series that included sessions on
Cognac and Armagnac. More than 50 people crammed behind place
settings boasting three types of tequila. The room smelled like a
bad headache.
</P>
<P>
   ``I included tequila in the seminars on a dare,'' she told her
class. ``I guess anytime you drink tequila it's on a dare.'' They
laughed appreciatively.
</P>
<P>
   As the progression of tastings went on, Ms. Immer held up the
bottle the class was savoring, a Sauza Tres Generaciones. ``See
that the shape is the same as a Cognac bottle,'' she said, ``which
means `Compare me to Cognac, the bottles are the same.'''
</P>
<P>
   Someone groaned out loud. Ms. Immer drew herself up to her full
height, and her smile dimmed. ``Don't be a snob,'' she instructed. &QL;

`STALINGRAD': AN AVALANCHE OF DEATH THAT REDIRECTED A WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the world talking about ``Saving Private Ryan'' and the
horrors of combat, it is useful to remember that the most terrible
battle of World War II came not with the D-Day landings but with
the savage four-month German-Soviet battle of Stalingrad.
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way: The Normandy landings resulted in some 10,000
Allied battle deaths. During the nightmarish months of total war at
Stalingrad, the combined battle deaths exceeded 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   One Soviet general, Vasily Chuikov, liked to point out that the
42nd Russian Guards Regiment alone killed more enemy soldiers than
the Germans lost in the capture of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The colossal scale of Stalingrad _ the megalomania, the utter
absurdity, the sheer magnitude of the carnage in what many military
historians see as the turning point in the war _ are marvelously
captured in Antony Beevor's new history, ``Stalingrad.''
</P>
<P>
   Beevor, a former British army officer and the author of several
other studies of war, provides a vivid and detailed account of the
Stalingrad conflagration, beginning with Operation Barbarossa, the
1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union, and ending with the
surrender of German generals on the Volga River a year and a half
later.
</P>
<P>
   But Beevor has also compiled a vivid record of the interior
nature of the battle, from the slang expressions used by the
soldiers to the Russian cult of the sniper and the German
fascination with suicide rather than surrender.
</P>
<P>
   If there are weaknesses in Beevor's account, they stem from the
enormity of Stalingrad itself, the size of the operations, the
staggering number of individual events that made up the battle.
Unless readers constantly shift back and forth between Beevor's
text and the few maps that illustrate it, it is easy to get lost in
the multiplicity of place names and unit numbers that make up the
narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Beevor describes a number of key commanders _ most important
perhaps the commander of the German 6th Army, Field Marshal
Frederich Paulus _ and he sketches in the divisions among the
aristocratic German officers, some of whom were slavishly devoted
to Hitler while others yearned ineffectually to save Germany by
deposing him.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, though, the dramatis personae of Beevor's tale remain
somewhat faceless, colorless, their individual features overwhelmed
by the surrounding chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Stalingrad'' is a formidable military history, informed
by Beevor's keen strategic sense and his appreciation of the
complexities of battle. At the apex of his story are the two most
preoccupying tyrants of 20th-century history, each of whose utter
disregard for the sacrifice of his population emerged with full
force in the Stalingrad saga.
</P>
<P>
   In Beevor's view, Hitler was the worse of the two dictators as a
military leader. Stalin, rigid and murderously awful as he was,
nonetheless listened finally to his field commanders and approved
of the grand strategy that eventually prevailed at Stalingrad.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler, by contrast, was a meddling fantasist incapable of
seeing facts that ran contrary to his vision. Hitler's imagined
enemies before had been Jews and communists, who were treated with
the usual methodical Nazi brutality during the invasion of the
Soviet Union; now the enemy was the aristocratic German officer
corps, which allowed itself to be defeated by cowardice and
caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lived in a fantasy world of maps and flags,'' wrote Winrich
Behr, a panzer division captain dispatched to the fuehrer's
headquarters to convince Hitler that the encircled, starving,
desertion-depleted 6th Army was about to be defeated, unless the
order to retreat was given. But Hitler thought only about a
brilliant counterstroke. ``It was the end of all my illusions about
Hitler,'' Behr wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, like France under Napoleon, was defeated by a
combination of factors: the vastness of the Russian terrain, the
length of the supply lines, the mud, the cold, the grit that
spoiled tank engines. But as is well-known, what most foiled the
German plan was the willingness of the Russians to fight on until
they died. Beevor does not mythologize here. He provides examples
of Russian cowardice, the desertions, the German ranks filled in
with Hilfswillige, or volunteer helpers who had come over from the
Soviet side. But he gives the Russians due credit for a fanatical
heroism in battle, and a discipline that was at least in part a
product of the Soviet system.
</P>
<P>
   ``That the Soviet regime was almost as unforgiving toward its
own soldiers as toward the enemy is demonstrated by the total
figure of 13,500 executions, both summary and judicial, during the
battle of Stalingrad.'' Beevor writes. Red Army soldiers were shot
if they deserted. They were also executed ``if they failed to shoot
immediately at any comrades seen trying to desert or to surrender
to the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in these senses that Stalingrad represented what Beevor
calls ``a new form of warfare.'' He uses that phrase when he speaks
of the conditions of the battle of Stalingrad, specifically that
the battle there was ``concentrated in the ruins of civilian
life.'' The very rubble created by the massive German bombardment
created the conditions in which house-to-house fighting became so
fearful and costly for the Nazi invaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Stalingrad could also be seen not just as an illustration of
total war but as the ultimate in totalitarian war as well. It was
warfare waged under the ideology that the utopian state is the
highest value, one for which no sacrifice is too great; hence
neither side tried to limit civilian casualties or to spare the
lives of troops when possible. The Germans used the technique of
carpet bombing pioneered at Guernica during the Spanish Civil War.
They deported some 60,000 civilians from Stalingrad to Germany for
slave labor. Of the 10,000 men in the Russians' 13th Guards Rifle
Division, only 320 were still alive at the end of the four-month
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Stalingrad is, in short, a fantastic and sobering story, and it
has been fully and authoritatively told in Beevor's book.

DEFLATING THE WORLD OF WINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With ``The Wine Avenger'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $11), Willie
Gluckstern establishes himself as the bleacher bum of wine writers.
Gluckstern, a wine teacher and the wine buyer for Nancy's Wines in
Manhattan, looks at a bottle of wine the same way the
sun-and-beer-addled guy in the center field seats looks at the
heart of the Marlins lineup: These guys call themselves baseball
players? They make how much? You've got to be kidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wine Avenger,'' a slim paperback, promises to transform
the reader into ``a wine-food genius'' in one hour. It doesn't.
What it does is deliver, in a highly entertaining way, randomly
clustered opinions, tips, observations and explanations.
</P>
<P>
   Gluckstern doesn't have likes and dislikes. He has mad love
affairs and Balkan-style blood feuds.
</P>
<P>
   Gluckstern hates chardonnay. It is, in his view, overhyped,
overpriced and overoaked. Only Chablis escapes his wrath. As for
merlot, don't get him started. American sauvignon blanc he
dismisses as ``acid-deficient and aromatically bizarre.''
Australian sauvignon blanc ``is for mutants.'' He likes sulfites
and heaps contumely on the super-Tuscans.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the wines. Gluckstern regards wine writers,
winemakers, wine merchants and restaurant owners as an oppressor
class with their jackboots firmly poised on the throat of the
customer. He doesn't have a very high opinion of most customers
either, come to think of it. They're idiots for not recognizing the
sublime perfection of Riesling, the world's greatest grape.
</P>
<P>
   Gluckstern, who excels at concise, vivid sensory descriptions _
wine aromas, he writes, can range from ``nectar-dripping orchids in
a Tahitian paradise to the feral stink of a sun-warmed manure
pile'' _ mounts a convincing case for his favorites. He does tend
to go on about Riesling, but he argues brilliantly for the virtues
of a crisp, acidic, citrusy chenin blanc from the Loire, with its
``earthy, green-leaf flavor,'' over almost any chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other wine writers, Gluckstern cannot think about
wine without thinking about food, and his general policy on
matching the two is firm. The big bruisers that win the big prizes
at wine competitions he regards as the natural enemies of all but
the richest foods. For the meals that most mortals eat most of the
time, he puts his money on high-acid, medium-bodied wines like
sauvignon blanc (from France and New Zealand only, please),
cabernet franc, barbera, gamay and pinot noir.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ``sharp crack of acidity,'' he argues, that gets the
salivary glands working and brings flavors on the plate alive. ``I
have come to believe that a well-made $10 or $12 Saumur-Champigny _
with its medium weight, ripe piquant fruit and delicate herbal
finish _ must be, dollar for dollar, the best of all possible red
wines for food,'' he writes. A hefty section of the book is devoted
to matching wines and cuisines.
</P>
<P>
   Some of ``The Wine Avenger'' is useless filler. Is there a human
left on the planet who does not know that a wine glass should be
held by the stem or base, and not the bowl? And why insist that
readers learn to call pinot noir ``pinot'' if they want to pass as
experts? No one cares.
</P>
<P>
   The real point of ``The Wine Avenger'' is the opinions, and
Gluckstern is full of them. If you don't agree, tough. You're
probably just the kind of ``palate-dead homunculus'' who would like
a chardonnay ``Dengue Vineyard'' Reserve Lot 3 Cuvee Louise
Shmenge.  &QL;

USING FENNEL STALKS AS A GRILL BED FOR FISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cooks with access to perfectly fresh fish make a fetish of
cooking it simply, largely because the subtle flavor is easily
lost, especially if the fish is of a delicate, white-fleshed
variety. It doesn't matter much where you go or whom you talk to:
When fishermen, chefs or home cooks are proud of their fish, they
do not fuss with it.
</P>
<P>
   One extremely simple preparation, common throughout the
Mediterranean, is fish grilled on a bed of fennel stalks. The
technique solves a couple of problems at once: It seasons the fish
subtly and without effort, and it helps prevent the fish from
sticking to the grill and falling apart. In fact, this method
allows you to grill even relatively delicate fillets like cod,
usually among the most challenging because of their tendency to
fall apart as they get close to being done.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping for this dish may take you longer than cooking it. You
must start with a beautiful piece of fish, of course. Moreover,
fennel stalks _ or those from dill, which are nearly as good _ are
almost always discarded by grocers.
</P>
<P>
   When you buy a bulb of fennel, you're buying the bottom, trimmed
of its long stalks; when you buy a bunch of dill, you're buying the
feathery tops, trimmed of the stalks that support them. Because
this recipe requires those stalks, you will probably have to speak
directly to a produce manager, visit a farm stand or a friend's
garden, or simply get lucky. (With truly good fortune, you'll find
a market or garden with bronze fennel, also called wild fennel; its
stalks are not only beautiful, but also have the best flavor.)
</P>
<P>
   I like this dish best with halibut, and good Alaskan halibut is
plentiful and relatively inexpensive right now. It is worth it to
spend the few minutes it takes to convert a single halibut steak
into fillets (a good fishmonger will do this for you, but it is as
easy as removing the skin from a piece of chicken). Just use a
sharp, thin-bladed knife and cut straight down along the outline of
the bone, which sits in the center of the steak and radiates out in
four directions; this will produce four fillets.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy a piece of fish one and a half to two inches thick,
each fillet will be the perfect serving size. Alternatively, use
striped bass (preferably skin-on and scaled), monkfish, cod (also
best with skin) or any other fillet with some substance. Do not
attempt to grill flounder.
</P>
<P>
   The preparation is really just one step: Lay the fennel on the
grill, lay the fish on the fennel and cook. I like to finish the
fish with a tiny sprinkling of fennel seeds, decorate it with lemon
slices and moisten it with a little lemon juice and olive oil. For
an absolutely minimalist preparation, consider all of this
optional. Given the simplicity of this dish, it is also best to
keep side dishes modest: I like it with no more than bread and
salad.
</P>
<P>
   FISH GRILLED ON FENNEL OR DILL
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 fennel or dill stalks, each at least 6 inches long
</P>
<P>
   4 6-ounce halibut fillets or 1 1/2 pounds of any white fish
fillet like striped bass, monkfish or cod
</P>
<P>
   Salt and cayenne pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fennel or dill seeds
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat a charcoal or gas grill (for broiling instructions,
see the variation below). The fire should be quite hot and the
grill rack should be about 4 inches from the heat source.
</P>
<P>
   2. When the grill is ready, make a bed of the fennel or dill
stalks. Sprinkle the fish lightly with salt and pepper, and lay it
(skin side down, if there is a skin side) directly onto the fennel
or dill. Close the grill if possible, and cook, without turning,
until the fish is done; it will be just about opaque all the way
through and offer no resistance to a thin-bladed knife in about 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. While the fish is cooking, mince or grind the fennel seeds.
Cut about 1 inch off each end of the lemon, and juice those pieces;
slice the remaining lemon thinly.
</P>
<P>
   4. When the fish is done, remove it from the grill, leaving as
much of the stalks behind as possible (some of the burned fronds
will adhere to the fish; they are fine to eat in tiny quantities).
Sprinkle it with the fennel or dill seeds, then decorate it with
the lemon slices. Drizzle with lemon juice and olive oil, and
serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Variation: If using a broiler, preheat it and place the rack as
close to the heat source as possible. Put a half-inch of water in
the bottom of a roasting pan, and lay the fennel or dill stalks in
it. Sprinkle the fish lightly with salt and pepper, and lay it
(skin side down, if there is a skin side) directly onto the fennel
or dill. Broil until the fish is lightly browned on top and opaque
throughout, about 10 minutes. (If at any time the fish is browning
too quickly, move the broiler rack down a notch.) Finish as above.

A GUIDE TO PERSPIRATION, FROM ECCRINE GLANDS TO LOVE APPLES TO
OZONE HOLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's probably a fair assumption that you're sweating more than
usual this summer. In honor of this much-maligned physical
function, we offer the following information as our Ode to Sweat.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCIENCE OF SWEAT: Sweating is good for you! Sweating
regulates body temperature by cooling the blood. Human skin houses
up to 4 million sweat glands; backs, chests and foreheads have the
highest concentration, but the glands in the armpits are the most
active. Eccrine glands _ in the palms and soles, for instance _
respond to raised body temperature by secreting a colorless sweat
that is mostly water. Apocrine glands _ most numerous in the
armpits, groin and nipple area _ produce the stinky sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Sweat doesn't inherently smell. It takes an hour for bacteria on
the skin's surface to break down the sugars and fats in apocrine
sweat before people are asking you to leave the room. Deodorants
kill the bacteria; antiperspirants work by preventing sweat from
reaching the skin's surface.
</P>
<P>
   The other downside of sweating is dehydration. Sweat contains
sodium, chloride and potassium _ the much-ballyhooed
``electrolytes'' lost along with water when we perspire.
Electrolytes function as the electric currents that allow nerves
and muscles to talk to one another. Lose too much sweat, and you're
in for muscle spasms, cramping and fatigue, says Craig Horswill, a
research scientist with Gatorade's Sports Science Institute in
Barrington, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   At room temperature, most of us produce 200 milligrams of
underarm sweat an hour. Multiply that by three when you're sitting
in 100-degree temps. And Horswill reports that a quart of sweat
(try not to picture that) contains from 460 to 1,380 milligrams of
sodium.
</P>
<P>
   A HISTORY OF DEODORANTS: Prior to the 19th century, Westerners
disguised body odor with perfumes or not at all; they didn't really
care much. Then scientists discovered sweat glands, and women began
rubbing their underarms with ammonia and water.
</P>
<P>
   In 1888, the first trademarked commercial deodorant _ Mum _
appeared in cream form. An early 20th-century product, Everdry, not
only stung the skin but also ate right through clothing. Roll-ons
debuted in the middle of the century, according to Proctor &AMP;
Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   The first aerosol hit the shelves in 1959, and by the early '70s
aerosols accounted for more than 80 percent of the market. But a
mid-'70s ban on CFCs and on the use of aluminum zirconium in
aerosols put the kibosh on those sprays. Dress shields also became
a popular method among women for absorbing sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the companies say their most effective products are the
clear gels and ``soft solid'' antiperspirants _ the ones that don't
leave those annoying white marks on your clothes.
</P>
<P>
   DRY, GOOD. WET, BAD: Americans don't like to sweat. That's
evident in the $1.6 billion we spend a year on sticks, roll-ons,
powders, creams and sprays. Men generally sweat more than women,
but women have more apocrine glands (the ones that produce body
odor) and use more antiperspirants or deodorants than men (95
percent compared with 91 percent), according to the Gillette Co.
</P>
<P>
   Savvy business people have developed all sorts of products to
combat sweat: sprays for hat rims and shirts, and clothing that
wicks sweat away from the body or absorbs it. Scientists have yet
to conclusively link the aluminum in deodorants to Alzheimer's
disease, but alternative, ``natural'' products abound.
</P>
<P>
   THE CULTURE OF SWEAT: Not everyone in the world is as
embarrassed by sweat as Americans are. Members of a New Guinea
tribe take leave of one another by placing their hands under each
other's arm pits and rubbing themselves with the other's scent.
</P>
<P>
   Smelling au naturel was de rigueur in Elizabethan times, when
women would present their beaus with ``love apples,'' notes a 1996
National Geographic article. The women held peeled apples under
their arms long enough to absorb their odor, then gave the fruit to
their lovers to inhale while they were apart.
</P>
<P>
   Sweat as an aphrodisiac has some scientific backing. Through our
underarm sweat, we emit pheromones. Humans can't smell these
chemicals, but our bodies register and react to them. Researchers
have determined that women's ovulation cycles are lengthened and
shortened by exposure to different pheromones.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a shvitz for health has a long history. In Native
American cultures, sweat lodges have long been places of physical
and spiritual purification. Indians compare lodges to a mother's
womb and say they emerge ``feeling like a newborn baby.'' In
Finland, saunas are nearly as universal as bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   HOW NOT TO SWEAT: For people afflicted with hyperhidrosis
(excessive sweating), everyday social and professional duties can
be a nightmare. But science has developed several treatments for
the sweatiest among us. Doctors often prescribe Drysol, a roll-on
product, to staunch underarm sweating, says Dr. Raymond Garcia, an
Irving, Texas, dermatologist.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively new procedure involves making a small incision
under each armpit and inserting an instrument and fiber-optic
camera into the chest cavity. The surgeons then sever the nerve
that controls sweating.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure, mainly to control profuse sweating of the palms,
has a ``99 percent immediate success rate,'' says Dr. David Sekons,
a general surgeon at Beth Israel Hospital in New York City who
regularly performs the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The traditional approach
</P>
<P>
   Aerosols: The mid-'70s saw a couple of crises for aerosol
deodorants, which had captured 80 percent of the market. The
government banned the use of CFCs in reaction to ozone depletion.
Safety concerns about aluminum zirconium led to a ban of that
ingredient in aerosols.
</P>
<P>
   Roll-ons: Ultra-popular substitute for the aerosol. Debuted in
the '40s when, finally, customers could discreetly choose their
deodorants from store shelves instead of having to ask the grocer
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Clear gels: Consumers assume their deodorant will work these
days; now they're concerned about how it looks when it goes on.
Enter the clear category. Clear antiperspirants promise no annoying
white stains on clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Soft solids: Look opaque but go on clear. Tres cutting-edge.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>

   The organic approach
</P>
<P>
   If you're more concerned about chemicals than perspiration, an
alternative deodorant might be up your alley. Your
``Star-Telegram'' tester tried four, and they all worked equally
well at keeping said tester smelling perfectly unoffensive (at
least, no one complained to my face).
</P>
<P>
   Remember, these are not antiperspirants; be prepared to sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal: Our favorite of the
alternatives. Looks like a big crystal and goes on like a roll-on.
You have to wet it to use it, but it dries immediately. The company
claims the crystal will last up to a year. No scent. $6.95.
</P>
<P>
   Now Long-Lasting Deodorant Cream: Has to be smeared on, which is
pretty messy. Also, smelled strongly medicinal. $5.95.
</P>
<P>
   Natural Crystal Deodorant Spray: Went on uncomfortably wet and
stayed that way for a while. No scent. $4.35.
</P>
<P>
   Tom's of Maine Natural Gentle Deodorant: Also went on wet and
sort of sticky, but the earthy Woodspice scent was pleasant enough.
$5.55.

IN A SOCIAL MIRROR, THE FACES OF APES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., August 30)  
 (JT)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early in ``Planet of the Apes,'' the 1968 science-fiction film
that spawned four sequels, two television series and all manner of
gimcrackery through the 1970s, a tall, lithe astronaut named Taylor
corrects the misimpression of two intellectual chimpanzees who are
trying to determine who this supposedly primitive human is and
where he fits into the cosmic puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not the missing link,'' he informs them. Having
crashed-landed a spaceship on an unknown planet he believes to be
320 light years from Earth, Taylor, portrayed with abrasive
strength by Charlton Heston, and a cowering band of mutant humans
have been rounded up by ferocious gorilla cavalrymen and tossed in
a cage as if they were _ well, gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout all five films, the species are at each other's
throats, with all sorts of ethnic overtones hanging out.
Interestingly, though, this culture clashing had no negative effect
on the films' popularity as family entertainment. Critics hold that
the science-fiction settings gave the ``Planet'' movies latitude to
confront dicey social situations in ways that may have turned off
audiences of more conventional movies. Whatever the case, watched
end to end in a new set of videos from Fox, together with a highly
informative documentary, ``Behind the Planet of the Apes,'' the
films reflect an extraordinary accommodation of messages burning to
be dramatized in the era of Vietnam protest and violent racial
unrest, on one hand, and the restraints and sweeteners required for
a family movie on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from the novel by Pierre Boulle and written by Rod
Serling and Michael Wilson, who had been blacklisted in 1951 for
supposed Communist connections, ``Planet of the Apes'' was
relentlessly promoted from the time it was just a concept by the
producer Arthur Jacobs. Hollywood, however, found the idea of
costumed apes uncomfortably close to Saturday-morning cartoons.
Only Richard Zanuck, the head of 20th Century Fox, was willing to
make the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We chose it strictly for its entertainment value,'' he said
recently. ``It was something that we'd never seen before.'' Zanuck
oversaw ``Planet of the Apes,'' which was directed by Franklin
Schaffner, and its first sequel, ``Beneath the Planet of the Apes''
(1970), before he moved on from Fox. ``I didn't read any kind of
message,'' he said. ``I saw it as an interesting, unique piece. The
later films got into message, but I wasn't trying to make a
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   With writers like Serling and Wilson, message was inevitable. In
``Planet of the Apes,'' by far the best film of the series, humans
are the primitive, speechless primates; the apes, neatly
compartmentalized in their own social classes (gorillas do the
fighting, chimpanzees are the intellectuals and orangutans are
political leaders) and busily engaged in all the power games humans
play, defensively rule the roost. Taylor, a smart, tough, can-do
kind of fellow from an order of humans developed eons earlier,
electrifies his highly prejudiced captors with his first words:
``Take your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty ape.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not much of an icebreaker, especially with paranoid
creatures who, like myopic humans on any number of issues, have a
hard time with the notion that a breed they consider to be beasts
may be vastly more advanced than they are. From that point the
slyly amusing screenplay has some fun with the role reversal.
``Wonder how he'd score on a Hopkins dexterity test,'' the
chimpanzee scientist Zira (Kim Hunter) wonders about Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The films' popular appeal was certainly aided by the wonderfully
mobile ape masks, called appliances, developed by John Chambers. By
exaggerating their expressions, those who wore them _ Ms. Hunter,
for example, and Roddy McDowall as her husband, Cornelius, and
Maurice Evans as the orangutan Dr. Zaius _ were able to project
reactions and emotions through a thick layer of foam rubber.
</P>
<P>
   But always there are deadly matters at hand. A harsh, bitter
man, Taylor is a refugee from a human society he suspects has long
ago destroyed itself with hate and nuclear warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a misanthrope,'' Heston said in an interview. ``He's
disgusted with life and the human race.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the film he addresses a question to a world now
700 years behind him. ``Tell me,'' he says, ``does man still keep
his neighbor's children starving?'' In a famous scene at the film's
end, a half-buried Statue of Liberty not only reveals what planet
Taylor has crashed on but what fate it suffered hundreds of years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The sequels grow darker. In ``Beneath the Planet of the Apes,''
the gorilla army ignores antiwar protesters and marches on human
mutants living in an underground Forbidden Zone (a blitzed New York
City). The humans are praying to their god. ``Glory be to the bomb
and to the holy fallout as it was in the beginning,'' intones a
priest.
</P>
<P>
   By the second sequel, ``Escape From the Planet of the Apes''
(1971), humans again have the upper hand. The engaging chimpanzees
Cornelius and Zira are refugees on earth, having escaped nuclear
destruction in the spaceship Taylor rode in on in the first film.
As the apes were with Taylor, humans are startled to learn that
Zira can talk (``I loathe bananas''). Later it is discovered that
Zira is pregnant, and she and Cornelius are hunted down and killed
by humans who fear the onset of an ape baby boom. Their child,
later named Caesar (also portrayed by McDowall), survives.
</P>
<P>
   In the third sequel, ``Conquest of the Planet of the Apes''
(1972), the apes are trained as slaves. After much provocation,
Caesar organizes his species and stages a revolution. In keeping
with the rising tide of violence in American movies in the early
'70s, pitched battles are fought in the streets of Los Angeles,
with destruction reminiscent of the Watts riots.
</P>
<P>
   At test screenings, women gathered up their children and ran for
the exits. The studio was alarmed. With family appeal threatened,
the violence was toned down in ``Battle for the Planet of the
Apes'' (1973), the final film of the series. At the end, ape and
human children mingle in a hopeful sign of harmony. But from first
film to last, the ``Planet'' series seemed to know better.
</P>
<P>
   In the documentary, Heston recalls lunch breaks during the
filming of ``Planet of the Apes.'' Unable to remove their masks and
get them back on in time for the afternoon shoot, actors ate with
their appliances on, watching themselves in mirrors so they
wouldn't spear themselves with forks and smoking cigarettes with
long holders so they wouldn't set their heads on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Even off duty there was no break from segregation and the class
struggle. ``There'd be a kind of self-segregation,'' Heston says.
``The gorillas would all eat at one table, the chimpanzees at
another, the orangutans at another.''

 &HT;    DESPITE PUBLIC WEARINESS, SCANDALS WILL CONTINUE, EXPERTS SAY
 &HT;    By BOB DART

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Polls show Americans are weary of White House
scandals and wish investigations of President Clinton would just go
away, but that's not going to happen during his presidency,
political and legal analysts predicted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``will remain a presidential litigant for his remaining
time in office,'' said Jonathan Turley, a George Washington
University law professor and frequent legal commentator on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, it's not going to end as quickly as the public
would like,'' agreed Thomas Mann, director of government studies
for the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the stories of scandal probably wouldn't end even if
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr were to unexpectedly report to
Congress that he found no wrongdoing in his investigations into
Whitewater and Clinton's relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   There are other headlines on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno is considering whether to call for a
new independent counsel to investigate allegations of illegal
campaign finance abuses in the 1996 presidential race. If she does
so, that probe could last into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   And an appeals court is considering reinstating Paula Jones'
sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton that was dismissed
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion surveys indicate most Americans will not welcome
this news. A Los Angeles Times Poll conducted Aug. 22 found that 63
percent of respondents wished the whole Starr investigation could
simply be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   However, the independent counsel is required by federal law to
report any evidence of impeachable offenses to Congress and all
findings to the three-judge panel that appointed him. With an
election looming in November and a busy legislative agenda to
complete before the scheduled Oct. 9 adjournment, Congress is
unlikely to act quickly on any report from Starr or even to decide
if impeachment hearings are warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at all sure that you can get to that this year, and
I'm not at all sure that it's a smart idea to try to get to that
this year,'' House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., told The
Washington Post this week.
</P>
<P>
   The process is complex, Mann explained. First, Starr must
complete what is expected to be a massive report to Congress and
submit it to Gingrich. Even when the report has been sent, Starr
may continue to investigate or indict other people and ``chip away
at Clinton through surrogates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress has the report, the House Judiciary Committee
could deal with it in executive session, with leaks keeping the
scandal alive. If formal impeachment hearings convene, they could
last many months. And if the House voted for impeachment, there
would be a trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   With this long road to travel, amid uncertainty how impeachment
proceedings would play politically, ``we're unlikely to have any
action before the election,'' said Mann.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clinton acceded to critics' demand that he resign and
spare the country more turmoil, the scandal headlines are unlikely
to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is reasonably likely'' that Reno will appoint an
independent counsel to investigate campaign finance charges, said
William Schneider, a political analyst for CNN and the American
Enterprise Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans are demanding the appointment after it
was recommended by both FBI Director Louis Freeh and federal
prosecutor Charles La Bella, whom Reno had appointed to lead the
Justice Department investigation of the charges. And last week, a
1995 White House memo surfaced raising new questions about the role
of Vice President Al Gore in the fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   A new independent counsel would pose problems for both Clinton
and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A probe of campaign fund-raising abuses ``would have what
critics say Starr is missing in the Lewinsky investigation'' _
substance, said Turley. It would deal with charges of official
misconduct, an illegal cover-up and illegal foreign contributions
that affect national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could occupy the remainder of the president's term,''
said Turley.
</P>
<P>
   It would also affect the 2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``it would hang over Al Gore immediately,'' said Schneider.
``It's hard to run for president with independent counsel
investigating you. It would instantly tie him into Clinton's
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters would be asked, ``Do you want to elect another president
with an independent counsel already there?'' said Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any independent counsel investigation into 1996 campaign
finances is virtually guaranteed to last into the 2000 campaign
season,'' said Mann. ``That would be a disaster for Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Paula Jones case may also come back to haunt
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   There was a ``shaky legal foundation for dismissal,'' said
Turley. A conservative Arkansas judge applied a narrow
interpretation of the law _ ruling that even if Clinton did
everything he was accused of doing, it would not amount to sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that ruling were to stand up, it would be a setback for
women in the workplace,'' said Turley. He said a Supreme Court
ruling since the Jones case dismissal creates a much broader
concept of sexual harassment and could apply on the appeal by
Jones.

<TEXT>
<P>
   What you get from chefs in restaurants today can resemble the
conversation at a cocktail party: some of it smart and a lot of it
showing off. Consider the ostentatious trend toward greater and
greater height on the plate, food sculpture that looks impressive
until you try to eat it, and it falls to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   This trend, which drives chefs to build dishes ever higher, can
be seen perfectly in the proliferation of dishes named after the
napoleon, the classic dessert that has become just about anything
you can imagine, as long as it comes stacked high.
</P>
<P>
   It took pastry chefs more than a century of toiling in the
kitchen to perfect and popularize the napoleon, a prim rectangle of
alternating layers of flaky, buttery puff pastry and
vanilla-scented pastry cream.
</P>
<P>
   Then today's aspiring Napoleons of cuisine got hold of it. Some
of them saw an opportunity to juxtapose contrasting flavors and
textures in imaginative ways; others approached the task like
construction workers, brick and mortar layered ever higher. In
little more than a decade, they have completely changed the
napoleon, often disastrously, sometimes triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, Alfred Portale, the chef at Gotham Bar and Grill,
who is often credited with changing food presentation in New York
restaurants by making things like lamb chops stand up straight on a
plate, is critical of the modern napoleon. ``I don't think it's
neat or fun to build,'' he said. ``There's too much attention paid
to presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick for the diner is to develop an eye for the triumphs
from a mere menu description: the eggplant napoleon at Gramercy
Tavern qualifies. Thin crisp disks of fried eggplant sandwich a
silky eggplant caviar, which melts like butter on the palate.
</P>
<P>
   The clue here is a crisp layer and a soft, creamy layer. If you
can imagine the ingredients coming together to form a layered,
texturally contrasting dish, in the spirit of the original
napoleon, you will probably have found a good variation on the
theme.
</P>
<P>
   Versions in which similar textures are layered together, like
the tiresome roasted vegetable napoleon, should raise suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Without the contrast of textures, and a subtle interplay of
flavors, the napoleon becomes something slightly crude _ a prosaic
stack of raw materials. Why not just add bread and make a sandwich?
</P>
<P>
   Assembling a great napoleon has to be much more than just
slapping ingredients on top of one another. ``You want diners to
feel the contrast,'' said Eric Ripert, the chef at Le Bernardin.
``You want to build different layers with different flavors, but at
the same time you want to keep the dish in harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   The crab napoleon at Le Bernardin may be utterly wild-looking,
but it succeeds in doing just that. It is a postmodern design with
long jagged chards of rice flour wafers, which alternate with
levels of curried peekytoe crab and apple salad. Each bite is
tender, crunchy, moist and dry. Oh, and by the way, intensely
flavored.
</P>
<P>
   Another remarkable version is the smoked salmon and mango
napoleon at La Caravelle. Delicately thin slices of sweet mango and
salmon are tightly layered with creme fraiche, so that the texture
is uniformly silky and unctuous. The dish drips with elegance.
</P>
<P>
   But a pork-and-eggplant napoleon at 27 Standard is the kind of
mess you made as a child when you piled together meat loaf, mashed
potatoes and peas. You get a taste of pork, potato and eggplant in
every mushy bite. Others have structural problems, with ingredients
peeling off like bricks from a Manhattan building.
</P>
<P>
   At Nougatine, paper-thin chocolate disks droop under the weight
of bland raspberries, causing a few to plunge into a bed of diced
raspberry jello. (Remember Lesson 1: If it doesn't sound like a
napoleon, there's no telling what it will taste like.)
</P>
<P>
   With so many interpretations, the word itself is on the verge of
dissolving into meaninglessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like risottos that have nothing to do with arborio rice
or lasagnas that are made with vegetables and no pasta,'' said
Leslie Brennan, a culinary historian from Brooklyn. Which is the
only way to explain why a napoleon can be a pile of yellow, green
and red tomatoes with a green goddess dressing at Lobster Club, a
buttery potato puree braced between thick potato chips and a
truffle sauce at Park Avenue Cafe or a short square of roasted
shrimp sandwiched between thin strips of zucchini at San Domenico.
</P>
<P>
   Where the napoleon is going, as it turns out, is easier to pin
down than its origin. The word ``napoleon'' appears to be a
corruption of ``napolitain'' (Neapolitan), the name of an old
French dessert, which is a layering of butter cookies and jam iced
with fondant. The napoleon dessert as Americans know it, however,
more closely resembles the French pastry called a millefeuille
(thousand-leaf) _ the familiar layering of puff pastry and pastry
cream _ which was created sometime in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The millefeuillelike pastry was introduced to the United States
around the turn of this century. But the word ``millefeuille''
never stuck. Napoleon did.
</P>
<P>
   Designing dishes that use the napoleon construction, Ms. Brennan
said, is a way for chefs to anchor their creative zest to some form
of tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives them a safe place to experiment in a more measured
way,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even dessert napoleons are rarely left in peace. At Chanterelle,
Michael Klug, the pastry chef, has created a huckleberry napoleon
with such gorgeous shades of purple that it could make Martha
Stewart weep. Each layer is a variation on the fruit: a compote, a
creamy mousse and a tangy sorbet scented with lavender. Neat
triangles of phyllo dough, lacquered with sugar, separate the
layers and are angled so that they form a star.
</P>
<P>
   The strawberry napoleon at Windows on the World is _ naturally
enough in the current craziness _ filled with layers of coconut
creme brulee and towers above a pool of Thai basil sauce and muscat
ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   But what of the traditional version? Is it gone? Not quite. The
grand old napoleon, whose fragile pastry explodes at the touch of a
fork, may be down, but it is not yet out. It still lurks _ and
often sags _ in the pastry cases of French and Italian pastry shops
across the city. Payard Patisserie offers a lovely plain one with
pastry cream, or one with raspberries. The traditional Argentine
napoleon, called mil hojas, is served at Chimichurri Grill. The
puff pastry, a fat, flaky pillow, sandwiches a thick smear of dulce
de leche, the rich, Latin version of caramel, which is
``lightened'' with whipped cream. There are also chefs who wander
only a few steps from tradition, like Terrance Brennan, the chef at
Picholine, who makes a napoleon with lemon curd.
</P>
<P>
   No matter whether the napoleon succeeds or fails, it almost
always presents one obstacle: it is devilishly hard to eat. It is
inclined to flatten on contact _ or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the thing is too hard, if it really requires a solid blow,
if it flies off the table,'' said Wayne Nish, the chef at March,
``obviously it hasn't been successful.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, hurricane warnings were issued from the Carolinas to
Middle Atlantic coast, even as Hurricane Bonnie was still located
nearly 400 miles from shore. Wednesday, tropical storm force winds
exceeding 39 miles an hour along the North Carolina coast will
increase to hurricane force Wednesday morning as Hurricane Bonnie
nears the Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Winds gusting past 100 miles an hour will buffet a large area
exposed to the eastern side of the hurricane, though the strongest
winds will likely stay offshore. However, hurricane force winds
will only occur in a very narrow band to the west of the
hurricane's center. Tropical squalls will penetrate 75 to 100 miles
inland, though winds will struggle to reach 50 miles an hour away
from the coast. Winds and squalls will increase over the Delmarva
Peninsula and lower Chesapeake Bay Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Outer rainbands from the hurricane will spread up the coast
during the day. Large swells will continue to build from the New
Jersey coast to southern New England, though wind speeds will
remain below 20 miles an hour through Wednesday evening. Hurricane
Bonnie will make its closest approach to these areas late Wednesday
night and on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the remnants moisture from Tropical Storm Charley
will continue to sponsor downpours over parts of central and
southern Texas. Another disturbance will prompt some thundershowers
in the southern Plains near a stalled front. Scattered storms are
expected elsewhere in the Plains and Rocky mountain states. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Focus: East Side, West Side &LR;
</P>
<P>
   All sides of a hurricane are not created equal. Given that most
of the hurricanes that affect the East Coast move parallel to the
shoreline, it is the eastern side of the storm that becomes most
dangerous. Here, winds from the south couple with a northward bound
hurricane's forward velocity to produce an enhancement of the
surface wind speed. On the hurricane's western flank, where the
wind blows from the northeast, the opposite occurs. The storm's
northward motion reduces the effective surface wind speed, thereby
sparing the coast from the brunt of an offshore hurricane.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you know your New York bakeries, you might guess
that the Maury of Maury's All-Natural Cookie Dough, now making its
debut at D'Agostino's stores in Manhattan, is Maury Rubin, owner of
City Bakery, 22 E. 17th St. Unlike other chilled slice-and-bake
cookie doughs, the flour and many of the other ingredients are
organic, and it's made with things a home cook might use. In other
words, no preservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The dough comes in three classic flavors: chocolate chip,
oatmeal-raisin and peanut butter. All make very good cookies. But
it's important to use a heavy knife to slice through those
chocolate chips, and to allow the somewhat fragile peanut butter
cookies to cool completely before trying to remove them from the
pan. And be sure to use a nonstick pan as directed on the package.
The 18-ounce roll of dough, which sells for $4.99, makes 15 to 24
cookies, depending on the thickness.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who live outside New York, the dough is also
available at Kings Super Markets in New Jersey and Fresh Fields
markets in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding Delicacies
</P>
<P>
   For months, the expansion of Agata &AMP; Valentina, 1505 First Ave.
(79th Street), has been a work in progress. It's now virtually
complete, with the new design allowing for more generous displays
of produce, cheese, bread, pastry, meat, smoked fish, and hot and
cold prepared foods. The enlarged seafood counter, which has a
lobster tank, offers a somewhat limited but high-quality selection
of fish and shellfish, including such hard-to-find items as sea
scallops with roe ($17.95 a pound) and langoustines ($18.95 a
pound).
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson Valley, in Type
</P>
<P>
   The Valley Table, a quarterly magazine covering the food and
wine scene in the Hudson Valley, has made its debut with a 36-page
issue. Featured are an article about farmers' markets, with a
directory of them; an interview with John Novi of the DePuy Canal
House, and a useful essay, with recipes, about locally grown
hard-neck garlic, which is often preferred by chefs.
</P>
<P>
   Contributors include Peter Rose, a food historian, and Steven
Kolpan, a wine expert. The Valley Table is distributed free in many
shops and restaurants in the region, some locations in Westchester
County and at the Union Square Greenmarket. Subscriptions are $20 a
year. Information: (914) 361-2436.

`INTO THE RISING SUN': SAILING IN THE WAKE OF PORTUGAL'S
NAVIGATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)  
 (bl)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 15th-century voyages of Portuguese navigators and crews,
among the greatest exploits of Europe's great age of exploration,
stir more appreciation than excitement in the four-part documentary
that begins Wednesday night on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   The hero among heroes of ``Into the Rising Sun'' is Vasco da
Gama, whose journey to India is being celebrated on its 500th
anniversary, but he does not make an appearance until the third
week. First comes an introduction that combines dashes of
15th-century history with a present-day travelogue of stops along
the sea route from Lisbon to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's opener, ``The Barrier of Fear,'' begins with
the religious and commercial zeal of Prince Henry the Navigator
(who never raised a sail or handled a tiller) and the pressures on
a country squeezed between Spain and the sea. From Lisbon, the
sailing ships ventured across the Strait of Gibraltar to Ceuta in
North Africa for the first Christian attack on the Moors. It seemed
to one chronicler of the time that ``God and greed worked in
perfect harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   Rounding Cape Bojador on the northwestern African coast, dreaded
by sailors for its heavy seas populated by fearsome monsters, the
explorers found evidence of life and ventured further down the West
African coast. By the end of the first hour, they have touched on
the Western Sahara, Senegal and the Bijagos Islands, where they
made their first contacts with the native peoples.
</P>
<P>
   In the second hour, next Wednesday, the exploring continues
around the southern tip of Africa, renamed by the upbeat Henry from
the dire Cape of Storms to the Cape of Good Hope. But European
hyperbole did not improve the lot of Africans who were thrown into
the developing slave trade. Then comes da Gama.
</P>
<P>
   The summary is more exciting than the pictures, which fall into
a routine travelogue mode, featuring the faces of Portuguese
commuters and crews on shiny sailing ships and ferry boats and
glimpses of African villages.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the series, you can travel the Malay Peninsula
from Singapore to Bangkok aboard the Eastern &AMP; Oriental Express,
catch a look at Macau and watch a re-enactment of the Portuguese
arrival in Japan, with guns.
</P>
<P>
   It's a respectfully conventional documentary, stocked with
information and scenery, but the daring Portuguese deserve
something more exhilarating.

SUMMER RECIPES ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By SHELLY BELZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; FLAVORS OF THE CARIBBEAN IN THE AIR (AND ON THE WEB) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the summertime, when the tropics try to migrate to Hudson
Bay, the Caribbean seems awfully close to these northern latitudes.
And just now the flavors of the West Indies _ a medley of fruits,
spices, grains, roots and tubers _ are much in the air. If the
motto ``When in the tropics, cook like the tropics'' appeals to
you, help is at hand on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   An extremely well-stocked site is Recipes From Guyana and the
Caribbean, run by Wayne Moses of Guyana
(www3.nbnet.nb.ca/wmoses/recipes.html). He offers recipes for
island classics like callaloo jumble (salt fish, bacon, beef or
pork, shrimp, the spinachlike callaloo and a few other good things,
all served on rice); mango fly (a drink); banana fritters, and
curried hassars a la Courantyne, which calls for four wirri-wirri
peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Moses thoughtfully supplies a great deal of necessary
information: Just click on Frequently Asked Questions. You can
learn there that a hassar is a black catfish about six to eight
inches long with a tough shell, and that wirri-wirri peppers are
edible cherry bombs, like habaneros but less incendiary.
</P>
<P>
   Spiciness is a fact of Caribbean cookery, with its curried
dishes and the omnipresent habanero, or Scotch bonnet, the world's
hottest pepper, which is native to the region. But why do hot
countries favor hot foods? The most widely accepted answer is that
they set off the body's own refrigeration system: A curry
legendarily isn't hot enough until it makes you break out in a cold
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Another site, West Indian Recipes
(www.chrisevelyn.com/WIrecipes.htm), is part of the unofficial
Internet voice of St. Kitts and Nevis and was founded last year by
Christopher Evelyn. The recipes section has a grilled jerk chicken
that calls for 10 pureed Scotch bonnets (serves four); curried
goat, but also a vegetarian curry; banana bread, and black cake, a
Christmas specialty, made with a cup of rum. (``For best results,''
the directions say, ``let the cake remain in the pan while you are
sprinkling it with rum for three days.'')
</P>
<P>
   Windows on Haiti (www.geocities.com/Heartland/Pointe/5200), run
by Guy Antoine, is the hub of an online Haitian cultural center,
with pages on art, books and songs of Haiti. Click on recipes for
dishes like Ti-Malice sauce, a hot sauce that accompanies many
Haitian fish and meat dishes, and pain patate, a potato bread made
from sweet potatoes. There are also chicken with peas (poulet pois
France), and beans and rice, both staples of the Haitian diet.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes on these sites come from many experienced cooks, who
are by and large not professional cookbook writers. They usually
assume that anyone who will cook from their recipes knows in
advance what the dishes are. Some of the directions can be sketchy
or might reflect the conditions of island life. For instance, a
recipe might ask you to grate a coconut for coconut milk, instead
of suggesting you buy a can.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEARY OF SUMMER? THINK COLD SOUP &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Soup of the Evening, Beautiful Soup is a Web site that owes its
mellifluous name to the Mock Turtle's song in ``Alice's Adventures
in Wonderland'' (www.geocities.com/NapaValley/6188/hpsoup.html).
Nor do its literary associations end there; at this site, it's
possible by clicking on Food Tales to learn, for instance, what
Samuel Johnson thought of cucumbers (not much).
</P>
<P>
   But for the main reason to know about this site as summer
clings, click on Cold Soups. The menu of tempting recipes includes
vichyssoise, of course, but also Czech blueberry soup (it calls for
1{ cups sour cream, but substituting yogurt would make it lighter);
lime-cucumber soup with a kick (from tequila); golden gazpacho
(made with cantaloupe, yellow peppers and yogurt), and strawberry
balsamic soup (it includes a quart of strawberries, orange and
lemon zest, Grand Marnier and balsamic vinegar).
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, when you call up this site with Netscape, a pesky
rectangular window of advertisements pops up with it. Just swat it
on the X in its upper right-hand corner. Whatever you do, don't
minimize it, or it will fall to your tool bar and multiply.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SPA CAN BE CREATIVE, TOO  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Many people who try the spa experience find it transformative,
teaching them to slow down, appreciate nature and eat more
healthfully. The Web site of Spa Finders magazine
(www.spafinders.com) makes the immodest claim that spa chefs have
changed the way Americans eat (click on magazine) by bringing
dishes low in both fat and calories into the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   To see what all the crowing is about, there's a recipe section
compiled by the International Spa and Fitness Association (click on
spa cuisine and then recipes). The bill of fare includes pesto
risotto di mare; red lentil chili, and grilled mahi-mahi with
herbed couscous and three-bean salad with orange vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating these recipes, Margaret Pierpont, the co-author with
Diane Tegmeyer of ``The Spa Life at Home'' (Longstreet Press,
1997), commented by e-mail: ``Spa chefs create meals that are
highly nutritious, which is why there are many creative ways of
serving fruit and vegetables, beans and whole grains in this
collection.'' She also noted that when meat, fish or poultry is
included, the amounts are small.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are generally for tablefuls of diners and need to be
scaled down. Ms. Pierpont, who collected and tested recipes from
spas all over the country for her book, also faced this problem.
For soups, chilis and breads particularly, she recommends making
the amount called for and refrigerating or freezing the rest.

THE CHEF: FROM SCRATCH (ALMOST), A PASTRY CLASSIC MADE SIMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHARLIE PALMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was just learning about fine cooking as a 14-year-old
apprentice at an inn in upstate New York, I was fascinated by the
dessert cart, as any kid (prospective cook or not) would be. I was
particularly taken with the elaborate pastry cream creations like
the napoleon. And as I learned by the time I got to culinary
school, the ability to create those creamy classics was a hallmark
of the professional.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as rich desserts fell out of favor, I began
experimenting, like many of my contemporaries, with savory
alternatives: doing crisp potato or other vegetable napoleons as
side dishes to accompany meat or game. All of them were fine, as
far as they went, but I missed the old ways.
</P>
<P>
   And just recently, I had the urge to revisit the tantalizing
traditional French dessert cart. But this time I could see no
reason at all to make the napoleon some kind of test of chefhood.
Experience brings with it the confidence to take it easy every now
and then. So I made a few changes, the most significant being the
replacement of the time-consuming, delicate puff pastry with
easy-to-use frozen strudel dough, a more than adequate commercial
product.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the most obvious benefit _ avoiding the
make-it-from-scratch madness of puff pastry _ frozen strudel dough
adds character to the dessert. It is, for instance, much richer in
taste than the also frozen phyllo dough. Once baked, the strudel
dough has a nutty taste that I like a lot. And working with the
frozen dough, you don't have to make a sheet-pan full of desserts,
as I was trained to do; it's much easier to make individual
napoleons.
</P>
<P>
   Then for the cream: I added a bit of gelatin, which gives extra
body. The touch of gelatin insures that the cream will stay set and
not ooze out of the edges of the napoleon. It's more attractive
that way, I think.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, instead of the top glaze, I use a dusting of
confectioners' sugar and a refreshing raspberry-citrus sauce.
Although I chose raspberries in this recipe, there is no reason
that any other ripe berry, fruit or even toasted nuts couldn't be
used as well. (Just remember that with fruits, seasonal is best,
and if you do choose a juicy fruit like peaches or very ripe
strawberries, make sure you allow them to drain well on a triple
layer of paper towels so that they don't make the cream runny.)
</P>
<P>
   The light dusting of confectioners' sugar that replaces the
traditional fondant glaze not only allows the crisp golden dough to
shine through, but also adds an accent to the flavors of the dough,
cream and fruit. To me, the sweetness of the usual glaze often
detracts from these flavors and makes the dessert too heavy.
</P>
<P>
   I know, it sounds as if I've done a lot of cheating here. But I
haven't, really, if the test is in the results. This is a terrific
dessert. It's a direct descendant of the classic napoleon, if
somewhat lighter, and it's in my restaurant repertory now.
Actually, its preparation is so lacking in intimidation that it can
be in anybody's repertory. But if you try it, just don't let on how
easy it is. It still looks difficult.

DIVERSITY PROGRAMS MISSING IN ACTION AT MANY COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) One-fourth of America's Fortune 500 companies and
two-thirds of smaller U.S. companies have no diversity program in
place.
</P>
<P>
   In a decade of heightened attention to sexual, racial, age and
religious discrimination, a survey by the Society for Human
Resource Management found that many workplaces had no formal
employee training program to encourage diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons given for not having diversity programs were ``lack of
time,'' ``no need'' or ``low priority level.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller companies also said they didn't need such a program
because of their size or because they dealt with diversity issues
on an informal basis.
</P>
<P>
   Formal diversity programs typically include staff education
about anti-discrimination and anti-harassment laws plus exercises
that build mutual understanding and respect among workers of varied
backgrounds and values.
</P>
<P>
   Such programs frequently include hiring, promotion and retention
goals to help managers build and keep a diverse staff.
</P>
<P>
   In companies with formal programs, three-fourths of the human
resource officers rated their diversity efforts as very effective,
effective or somewhat effective.
</P>
<P>
   The human resource society noted in its workplace diversity
newsletter that diversity was not a universally accepted goal.
</P>
<P>
   In a Q &AMP; A column by Lee Gardenswartz and Anita Rowe, the
authors wrote that there were ``inevitable demands'' from
``employees who object to homosexuality on religious and personal
grounds,'' for example.
</P>
<P>
   Gardenswartz and Rowe said companies needed to know about and
explain to employees what legal protections are granted certain
groups. Companies also should focus training on tolerance, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees need to be assured that dealing with diversity will
not require them to change their beliefs and values,'' they wrote.
``History shows us that people fight and die to hold on to deeply
held beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, employees do need to be held accountable for
following guidelines regarding nondiscriminatory and respectful
treatment of others on the job. Jokes and slurs about any group,
whether gay-bashing or religion-bashing (or gender, race,
ethnicity, or any other group bashing), are off limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Good diversity programs, they said, make it clear that work
colleagues often have widely different values but can work well
together when everyone shows mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   Complete diversity survey results cost $30 for Society for Human
Resource Management members and $40 for nonmembers. Copies are
available by calling the society at {800-444-5006}.
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter listed several other publications dealing with
diversity issues, such as recruiting and retaining older workers,
dealing with religion in the workplace, and providing
domestic-partner benefits. All publications may be purchased by
calling the above phone number.
</P>
<P>
   The society is sponsoring a seminar on workplace diversity Oct.
26-28 in Washington, D.C. Information on the seminar is available
by calling {800-283-SHRM (800-283-7476)}.

 Women must take responsibility for promoting themselves in the
workplace  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Businesses are beginning to recognize the value of diversity,
but the task of hiring and retaining talented women and minorities
isn't as easy as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Good intentions aren't enough. It takes time, money and
commitment to build and retain a diverse work force. It also
requires women to take responsibility by making ourselves more
visible.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is GE Appliances in Louisville, Ky. Top
management is committed to diversity. They know it's not just the
right thing to do, it makes economic sense because 80 percent of
purchase decisions are made by women.
</P>
<P>
   So this summer GE began an effort to recruit several hundred
women to fill entry- and midlevel engineering positions in
Louisville. The prospect sounds thrilling but it's a daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are lots of women with the right credentials, but
reaching them and persuading them to relocate isn't that easy. To
its credit, GE has done many of the right things, according to
Linda Cooper Kee, president of LGC &AMP; Associates, a Kansas City,
Mo., firm that specializes in diversity management training,
consulting and recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   GE is advertising in publications, visiting schools and hiring
external recruiters who specialize in attracting women.
</P>
<P>
   But even before a firm begins to interview prospective
candidates, it should evaluate its corporate culture to ensure that
it values diversity, said Kee. Employees may not express problems
until they are directly asked.
</P>
<P>
   Managers, Kee said, need to understand why diversity is valuable
to their company. If new hires don't feel comfortable and valued,
they will leave and your time and money spent recruiting them will
be wasted.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, women need to take greater responsibility for
their careers. Many of us naively believe that if we work hard and
do a good job, employers will recognize our hard work.
</P>
<P>
   As impossible as it sounds, it's crucial that women take the
time to network and belong to professional organizations, said
Andrea Hall, the first woman senior vice president at the Midwest
Research Institute in Kansas City, a position she still holds.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's career exemplifies the importance of networking. She said
she found all her jobs through contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also encouraged other women to speak with a headhunter if
one calls. Explain your short- and long-term goals because even if
you're not interested in the current opening, something might turn
up a few years from now.
</P>
<P>
   And in the meantime, you might be able to help a company like GE
by telling the headhunter about a friend who would make a fantastic
engineer.

$7.3 MILLION GIFT RESCUES HOUSTON SYMPHONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In a philanthropic gesture unusual in its size and
purpose, two local foundations have come to the rescue of the
Houston Symphony Orchestra, donating a total of $7.3 million, which
will wipe out its accumulated budget deficit, the symphony
announced today.
</P>
<P>
   The two donors, the Wortham Foundation, which has been the
symphony's most significant benefactor, and the Houston Endowment,
the largest grant-making foundation in the state, each gave $3.65
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I endorsed one of the checks yesterday,'' said symphony
executive director David Wax in an interview with a relieved laugh.
``It's a big hunk of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The gifts, which will save the symphony some $500,000 in annual
interest payments, testify to the straits into which the symphony
had fallen. In a report to the orchestra's board in May, Henry
Fogel, the president of the Chicago Symphony, who has served as a
consultant here for the last year, wrote that optimism was in
order, but added: ``To be fair, recent history of the orchestra
would be able to make even the most optimistic person a
pessimist.''
</P>
<P>
   Wortham Foundation spokeswoman Barbara Snyder said the
foundation would have no comment on the gift. But asked if the
donations amounted to a bailout, Houston Endowment president H. Joe
Nelson III said, ``You could call it that, yes.'' He added that the
symphony was `` too important to this city for it to be allowed to
lose its prominence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gifts to arts institutions for deficit reduction _ ``paying for
the sins of the past,'' in Wax's phrase _ are the rarest sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foundations certainly don't like to give for this purpose,''
said Stacy Palmer, the editor of the Chronicle of Philanthropy.
``They'd much rather create new programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Foundation Center, a New York-based organization that tracks
gift-giving by private and corporate foundations, reports that in
1996, the last year for which figures are available, just $14.5
million of the $900 million in arts grants awarded by 1,000
American foundations was earmarked for debt reduction. And that
$14.5 million was the total for 25 separate grants.
</P>
<P>
   The symphony gifts, said Steven Lawrence, the Center's director
of research, ``will rank among the largest arts grants of any kind
for 1998, and they are certainly among the largest we've ever seen
in this field, particularly for debt reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra, founded in 1913, has been on unsound financial
footing for many years, relying on deficit spending almost annually
since 1971 and using fund-raising to try to close the gap. The
shortfall has increased over the past 11 years, as the symphony,
under the musical direction of Christoph Eschenbach, embarked on an
ambitious program to raise its quality and visibility, increasing
its recording and, for the first time, touring in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, no one questions the orchestra's quality. ``It is
one of America's finest and most important orchestras,'' Fogel
wrote. But fund-raising, particularly among individual donors, has
lagged, and marketing has been lackadaisical, resulting in poor
renewal rates for all of its subscription series.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Eschenbach spoke angrily of the financing problems
and threatened to leave if they did not improve; late last year he
said the next season would be his last, and the orchestra is
seeking a replacement, although Eschenbach will make occasional
appearances. The resident conductor, Stephen Stein, resigned
recently to attend rabbinical school.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising and ticket sales have been particularly hindered in
the last two years by long and sometimes bitter negotiations with
the musicians' union over a new contract. The airing of that
dispute, along with the finances, were cited specifically in
Fogel's report. Having spoken to corporate, foundation and
individual donors, he wrote that `` ``one of the things that is
keeping support down is the belief that the organization does not
operate in a fiscally sound manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundations made their gift contingent on ending the salary
dispute, which was resolved last week. The new contract calls for
modest salary increases and improvements in pension and health
insurance. Most important for management, it runs through Oct. 5,
2002, which management hopes will be enough time to institute a
sound fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
   The gift was also contingent on a promise to maintain a balanced
budget. The foundations placed restrictions on the orchestra's
short-term borrowing and on drawing from its endowment, which is
just over $40 million.

   The napoleon, however beautiful, poses a serious challenge to
the diner: how to attack? There is a trick to getting a taste of
each layer without squishing the whole. Resist the temptation to
use the side of the fork. Instead, plunge the fork boldly in near a
corner, tines down, with a single stroke. It should go all the way
through without crushing the layers. Repeat at a sharp angle to the
first stroke, then pull away the bite. The remaining napoleon
should remain unscathed.

TAX EVASION A WAY OF LIFE IN POOR ECUADOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: A tilde is needed over second n in El Nino) 
 
By JOHN OTIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ When the Finance Ministry recently compiled a
list of the 200 Ecuadorean corporations with the highest earnings,
hard-working citizens were startled to learn that half of these
firms paid no income taxes last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador needs all the tax revenues it can get from the affluent.
Nearly 60 percent of the country's 12 million people live in
poverty. The nation lacks schools, health clinics, roads and
housing. And this year, it faces huge cleanup bills from damage
caused by El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   Yet analysts say Ecuador may have the highest rate of tax
evasion in Latin America. You are considered foolish if you don't
evade taxes, said an investigator with Ecuador's independent
Anti-Corruption Commission.
</P>
<P>
   That's no small feat, because for many wealthy Latin Americans,
cheating on taxes is a time-honored tradition. Annual tax revenues
in Latin America amount to just 16 percent of gross domestic
product, according to the Washington-based Inter-American
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the average tax revenues as a percent of the total
goods and services produced in economies in the United States and
Europe are between 30 and 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is especially alarming in Ecuador, where taxes
make up just 6.6 percent of the GDP, according to the Finance
Ministry. For decades, Latin American governments backed off tough
tax enforcement because they feared rigid taxation would hurt the
private sector and drive away foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   They relied on state-run oil firms, airlines and utilities as
cash cows. Now, however, they are starting to crack down.
</P>
<P>
   They've had to.
</P>
<P>
   Industries have been privatized _ so the government no longer
can claim their profits. As prices for many of the region's exports
stagnate or fall, and the number of people living in poverty rises,
better tax collection is one of the only ways to cover budget
deficits and fund desperately needed social welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing can be done in Latin America without a major overhaul
of the tax system,'' writes Mexican political analyst Jorge
Castaneda in his book ``Utopia Unarmed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fundamental,'' added Manuel Castilla, a tax expert at
the development bank in Washington. ``The only alternative (to more
tax revenues) is more loans, but then the foreign debt gets
bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the development bank, the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund have a mutual understanding with Latin
American governments that they must improve tax collection to
remain eligible for assistance, Castilla said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Ecuador has shown no sign of falling in line. Recent
tax-reform bills in Ecuador have foundered because many congressmen
and their supporters run businesses that benefit from tax shields.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts say that newly elected President Jamil Mahuad,
who campaigned on an anti-corruption platform and promised to
attract billions of dollars in foreign investment, also will be
forced to increase tax revenues now that he's in office.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad will inherit a 5 percent fiscal deficit. What's more,
fresh income is needed to rebuild roads, housing and other
infrastructure on the Pacific coast that were washed away by the El
Nino weather pattern. Total damage is estimated at nearly $2
billion. But increasing tax revenues requires a reputable tax
collector, which Ecuador lacks. A branch of Ecuador's tax
collection agency was disbanded earlier this year following
accusations of bribe-taking.
</P>
<P>
   And the few tax cheats who are actually caught pay a small fine
and are never sent to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the United States, there is no accepted covenant between
citizens and government of contributing through taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.S., most people believe that (taxes) are the price
that you pay for the benefits of citizenship,'' said one
Quito-based diplomat. ``Here ... there is no sense of civic duty.
People say: `Why should I pay if no one else does?'''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of forking over taxes so the government can repair the
streets, the rich would rather buy sport utility vehicles to drive
over the potholes, said Santiago Espinosa, a journalist with
Vistazo, a weekly newsmagazine in Quito.
</P>
<P>
   The poor, as well as workers in Ecuador's substantial informal
economy, contribute no income taxes, but everyone pays a 10 percent
value-added tax as well as a handful of other consumer tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that there is little incentive to pay taxes because
the government squanders the money. The corruption often starts at
the top. Exiled former President Abdala Bucaram, who was ousted by
the Congress last year, was charged by the Supreme Court with
stealing $88 million during his abbreviated term.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows where the tax money goes,'' said Xavier
Ribadeneira, a partner at the Quito office of the international
accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche. ``People never see any public
works. Conditions don't improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporations, in turn, take advantage of myriad tax shields put
into place decades ago to protect local industries from foreign
competition. The purchase of government bonds or machinery, for
example, is tax deductible
</P>
<P>
   As a result, oil companies, shrimp exporters, textile firms and
more than two dozen banks legally paid no income taxes last year,
according to Finance Ministry records.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fiscal shields are subsidies for big business,'' said
Fabian Corral, a Quito lawyer who advises foreign investors.
``Unless the laws are changed, there is no way to increase tax
collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Peru is proof that tax reform is possible. In the past seven
years, President Alberto Fujimori's government has raised tax
revenues from 4.9 percent of GDP to 14 percent. It did so by
simplifying the tax code and reducing the number of taxes from 180
to five. Salaries for tax collectors were increased to discourage
corruption, and mobile taxpayer assistance centers were set up in
cities and villages.
</P>
<P>
   More than 11,000 businesses were closed for tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, where the influx of contraband liquor, appliances
and clothing is a huge problem, economists estimate that the
treasury loses about $3 billion annually in unpaid taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The incoming government of President-elect Andres Pastrana in
Colombia would like to collect some of that money to pay for
agrarian reform and other costly social projects to help left-wing
guerrillas integrate into civilian life should they eventually sign
a peace treaty to end the 34-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want peace, you should begin by complying with your tax
obligations,'' said Juan Camilo Restrepo, who became Finance
Minister when Pastrana took office earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the peace accords that ended Guatemala's 36-year-old

   BLACKS-COLLEGE _ WASHINGTON _ Decades of desegregation and
affirmative action have failed to bring college enrollment by black
students in line with the percentage of blacks in the general
population, suggesting that money may be the biggest barrier to
higher education, according to a report released Tuesday.
``Contrary to popular belief, the gap between blacks and whites for
opportunity and achievement is not being closed,'' said Elridge W.
McMillan, president of the Atlanta-based Southern Education
Foundation Inc., which produced the report, ``Miles to Go: A Report
on Black Students and Postsecondary Education in the South.''The
report examines enrollment, graduation and family income in 19
mostly Southern states that previously segregated blacks and whites
in colleges and universities. (Harlan, Cox News Service).

   POLLS-CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's favorable
ratings in the polls depend on how the questions are asked,
according to pollsters. Two recent testings by ABC-News illustrate
that, as the president's favorable rating went from 54 percent down
to 39 percent in three days, after the order of questions was
changed. So what do the polls really mean? (Malone, Cox News
Service).

<P>
   CLINTON-SCANDALS _ WASHINGTON _ To Americans who are weary of
endless stories about White House scandals and wish the topic would
just go away, experts offer this prediction: fat chance. House
Speaker Newt Gingrich's statement this week that Congress must look
beyond sexual misconduct to other allegations of wrongdoing is a
sign that hearings _ and perhaps further independent probes and
private lawsuits _ will likely be making headlines for years to
come. (Dart, Cox News Service).

Wednesday. In South Carolina, Gov. David Beasley issued a voluntary
evacuation order for Conway and Horry counties. The National Park
Service has evacuated 200 campsites on Ocracoke Island. Landfall is

   CARPOOL-SCOFFLAWS _ ATLANTA _ Single-driver scofflaws who
violate carpool-lane restrictions might be faced with a high-tech
version of ``Candid Camera.'' Frustrated by virtual waves of
single-occupancy HOV violators, the state Department of
Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration asked Georgia
Tech scientists to focus on the problem. They are experimenting

   ATLANTALEGION _ ATLANTA _ A generous gift made more than 70
years ago by a grateful city to its battle-weary sons may cost
Atlanta nearly $1 million. In 1926, Atlanta officials sold a parcel
of land adjacent to Piedmont Park to the American Legion's Post No.
1 as a site for a meeting hall. The nearly two-thirds acre at 1071
Piedmont Ave. went for the token price of $100, but the deed
restricted use of the land for ``the purpose of erecting a home''
for the Argonne Post of the American Legion, as Post No. 1 was
known at the time. In 1939, for an additional $1, the city
relinquished all restrictions on the property and turned it over to
the veterans' group by ``unrestricted title.'' Today that land is
on the block. The American Legion is negotiating with Piedmont Park
Conservancy to sell the property. (Saunders, Atlanta

   BLACKLAG _ ATLANTA _ While attempts have been made over the past
20 years to close the gap between blacks and whites in higher
education, a report released Tuesday says little has been done to
actually desegregate public schools in 19 Southern states. The
Southern Education Foundation, a private nonprofit agency concerned
with equity in public education, stated that while piecemeal
efforts are being offered by states, efforts to desegregate higher
education in the South has made little, if any progress, since the
1970s. Georgia, however, was listed, along with Maryland, as two
states that have made some progress. (Suggs, Atlanta

`GOODFELLAS' ON CBS: FOR MATURE AUDIENCES  
 CONAN O'BRIEN'S ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL IS BUMPED

   `THAT '70s SHOW' HAVING A NICE START  
 (bl)

   Cleaner Act for Wise Guys
</P>
<P>
   For nearly six years, Warner Brothers has been trying to get
Martin Scorsese's Oscar-winning film ``Goodfellas'' onto network
television screens. But the film's graphic violence and profanity,
even after Scorsese had edited it for television, made that seem
impossible _ especially in the last few years, with the national
debate over sex and violence on television and the need for a
content ratings system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, ABC bought the rights to the film, based on Nicholas
Pileggi's true story about a gangster named Henry Hill, and owned
it for three years, but never showed it. Since 1996, Warner
Brothers has been trying to sell it again.
</P>
<P>
   Now CBS is taking a chance. And, as Steven Spielberg's
``Schindler's List'' did last February, ``Goodfellas'' will carry a
TV-MA rating (for mature audiences only) when it finally makes its
broadcast television debut on Sunday night, Sept. 13 _ opposite the
annual Emmy Awards show on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this really much different from NBC running `Schindler's
List'?'' asked Edward Bleier, president of pay-television, cable
and network features for Warner Brothers. ``And Marty made far more
changes in this than Spielberg did in `Schindler's List,''' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Scorsese has also recorded a prologue running about 45 seconds
that will caution viewers that even though the film has been edited
for television, it is still a violent story. Enough violence
remains, he says in the prologue, ``so that viewers will not
misinterpret the underlying brutality of the mobsters as
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Scorsese continues, ``I did not want to remove all the violence
because I did not want to give the impression that this film
depicts a remotely glamorous life style.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the scheduling, on a night when other networks by
tradition try not to detract from the Emmy broadcast, a CBS
spokeswoman pointed out that relatively few men watch the Emmys,
and CBS only hopes to attract ``an audience that is available and
has decided not to watch the Emmys.''
</P>

<P>
   O'Brien Bumped
</P>
<P>
   Television executives spend endless hours examining coming
prime-time schedules; they apparently spend almost no time
examining upcoming political schedules.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, that prime-time special to celebrate Conan
O'Brien's fifth-year as host of NBC's ``Late Night'' will not be on
Tuesday, Sept. 15, as previously announced. Instead it will be
moved to Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? NBC suddenly discovered that New York and seven
other states are holding major political primaries on the 15th,
which would lead to numerous big cities' pre-empting at least part
of O'Brien's special Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   This ``discovery'' was only made on Friday; the O'Brien special
had been announced in July. NBC's top entertainment executives in
Los Angeles, Don Ohlmeyer and Warren Littlefield, told Jeff Ross,
the executive producer of ``Late Night,'' that he had the option of
moving the special to Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ross discussed the situation with Mr. O'Brien and they decided
that with a significant number of areas likely to be cutting into
the show on Tuesday, Wednesday night would be the better option.
</P>
<P>
   To fill the gap on Tuesday, NBC will, as usual, turn to
``Dateline NBC,'' whose executive producer, Neal Shapiro, said
Tuesday he would have no trouble adding one more edition of that
series on short notice. O'Brien's special will still be taped Sept.
10. ``At least we get an extra day to edit the show,'' Ross joked.
This will be the first time O'Brien's show appears in prime time.
For the special only, it will move to the larger NBC studio 8-H,
which is the regular home for ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   No guests have yet been booked for the special, Mr. Ross said,
which will mainly consist of taped clip highlights from the last
five years of ``Late Night.''

<P>
   Is It the Bell Bottoms?
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives are celebrating the ratings news from Sunday,
when a new comedy, ``That '70s Show,'' got off to an especially
promising start.
</P>
<P>
   The show wound up the highest-rated show last week among the
audience Fox covets most, viewers between the ages of 18 and 49. No
premiere of any Fox show had ever before finished in first place in
that category.
</P>
<P>
   ``That '70s Show'' even managed to beat the rating for its
lead-in ``The Simpsons,'' which broadcast a new episode last
Sunday. No new Fox series slotted after ``The Simpsons'' had ever
done better than that animated hit.
</P>
<P>
   One big reason for the early success of ``That '70s Show'' was
its appeal to men. It finished first across the board with men in
every age group.
</P>
<P>
   It also did well with teen-agers, who might have seemed its
natural constituency because the show is about a group of Wisconsin
teens in the 1970s.

POP LIFE: BLACK BOX RECORDER, PRINCE, HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``I stopped talking when I was 6 years old. I
didn't want anything more to do with the outside world.'' So begins
one of the most macabre singles of the year, ``Child Psychology,''
by Black Box Recorder, a new English band. The song's verses are
spoken by a disaffected deadpan female vocalist, who chronicles her
privileged upbringing as a series of disillusions and
disappointments in the hands of adults baffled by her complete
apathy.
</P>
<P>
   The song's kicker is the chorus, signaled by a sudden tempo
change attended by a muted drumbeat and sharply strummed guitar. A
male voice joins the woman's, soft and just as jaded, singing the
chorus' only lyric as beautifully and methodically as possible:
``Life is unfair/Kill yourself or get over it.'' Perhaps the
closest comparison to ``Child Psychology'' is Leiber and Stoller's
``Is That All There Is?,'' in which Peggy Lee sang about what life
had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   The root of the protagonist's sociopathy in ``Child Psychology''
is answered in the title song of Black Box Recorder's debut album,
``England Made Me.'' The singer, Sarah Nixey, spends the first
verse describing how as a child she captured a spider underneath a
glass and then watched it slowly die. Her motivation, she explains
in the chorus, is simply that ``England made me.''
</P>
<P>
   Black Box Recorder consists of Luke Haines, the morbid mind
behind the group the Auteurs; John Moore, the former drummer for
the Jesus and Mary Chain, and Ms. Nixey, a newcomer. Singing mostly
lyrics written by her male collaborators, Ms. Nixey is the perfect
front woman for this album-length critique of middle-class Britain,
with lyrics approaching the dry wit and incisiveness of Ray Davies
of the Kinks. In fact, the band explores some of the same
microscopic themes as Davies, like the way people take photographs
to prove that they really have done something exciting in their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nixey has the voice of an angel but delivers the lyrics of a
damned soul (usually those of the tragedy-obsessed Haines). Her
character evokes the innocent-looking but murderous girl with blond
pigtails in the film ``The Bad Seed'' (or, for that matter, any of
the malevolent pre-adolescent girls portrayed in the songs of Nick
Cave and the Bad Seeds).
</P>
<P>
   In various songs on the album, Ms. Nixey sings beautifully of
stealing cars, killing strangers and watching schools burn down.
Backed by crystal-clear production and restrained, well-arranged
chimes, keyboards, guitar and soft percussion, her voice can bring
chills. In a phrase, she can tear apart a relationship (``Every
caress is some cul de sac we've already been down''), her
upbringing (``I traveled all my life, but never got away'') or
existence itself (``It's only the end of the world, not a death in
the family'').
</P>
<P>
   ``England Made Me'' is available as an import on the English
label Chrysalis. The company said it had no current plans to
release the album on an American label.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets, Please
</P>
<P>
   On a tour he pledges won't end until the last day of 1999, the
artist formerly known as Prince returns to New York to perform at
Madison Square Garden on Sept. 25. Tickets, from a cleverly priced
$19.99 to a steeply priced $125, will be on sale Monday at 9 a.m.
through Ticketmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for Canada's jokey, folky Barenaked Ladies, who are to
perform at the Theater at Madison Square Garden on Oct. 7, go on
sale on Friday at 9 a.m.; all seats are $32.
</P>
<P>
   Words of Love
</P>
<P>
   Hunting for puns that will make you groan? Look no further than
the new Hole record, due out on Geffen Records on Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the record's many references to skin, the makeup
on top of skin and the vulnerability hidden below, the band's
leader, Courtney Love, dreams up a bevy of sly self-references. In
``Reasons to Be Beautiful,'' she begins, ``Love hangs herself,''
and a verse later screams, ``Love hates you.'' In ``Dying,'' she
moans that ``Love is dead.'' And in ``Malibu,'' she shows off her
pun pedigree with the line ``Love will tear you apart,'' a
reference not just to herself but to the Joy Division song ``Love
Will Tear Us Apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the lyric ``My sweet tooth has burned a hole'' is
an allusion to the band's name is open to interpretation, though a
clue supporting that is a similar subsequent line, ``My love burns
through everything.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As a UCLA freshman in 1994, Anna McDivit arrived
on campus thinking a computer wasn't that vital for her pre-med
studies. An uncle's ancient Apple II was enough to pound out term
papers but little else.
</P>
<P>
   Now, four years later and a quarter away from graduation, the
Brentwood student thinks differently. On her Toshiba laptop, she
runs spreadsheets on biology experiments, databases for contact
lists, a Web browser for research online and e-mail to keep in
touch with friends, family and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The campus has) definitely become more computer literate,''
McDivit said. ``It's a good way to educate you on the importance of
computers, and it makes information way more readily accessible.
It's made a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Her personal revolution matches that of UCLA, the Internet's
birthplace and now site of a far-reaching effort to transform
education with technology.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA ranked 23rd among the ``100 Most Wired Campuses'' in the
country and second in the area only to seventh-ranked California
Institute of Technology in a recent study by the magazine Yahoo!
Internet Life.
</P>
<P>
   All 3,000 of UCLA's classes now have World Wide Web sites, each
with at least a syllabus and general reference links, said Brian
Copenhaver, provost of UCLA's College of Letters and Science.
</P>
<P>
   The most sophisticated sites have far more: class readings, book
lists, links to educational software, additional assignments and
even discussion areas, Copenhaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Each student gets a lengthy personal Web site with that
quarter's course schedule and areas devoted to add/drop requests
and status, scheduling for academic counseling and exams, links to
many basic reference sites and campus organizations, online
subscriptions to publications such as the Daily Bruin and much
more, Copenhaver said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital technology, Web-based communications, are very
important for us to understand as a very powerful supplement to the
core educational experience,'' Copenhaver said. ``It can in many,
many ways improve what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA may be one of the most ambitious but is far from the only
area college diving into Information Age technology for education,
spurred by the Internet explosion of the past few years, said
Kenneth Green of the Campus Computing Project, which surveys
computerization by about 650 colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students have access to rich content on the Web,'' said Green.
``It's making for some very striking and even significant changes
in education.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, college officials report, their students are
arriving on campus with a computer in hand, or at least the skills
to use the machines most schools make available in labs, libraries
and student unions.
</P>
<P>
   Green said nationwide about half of all students now come to
campus owning a computer. And for those without machines, schools
are putting millions of dollars into outfitting computer labs for
campus have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students are expecting these things now,'' Green said.
``They're coming to campuses not just to learn about technology but
to learn with it. You don't have to be a geek to use it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Most schools give students an e-mail account, allowing them to
swap messages with professors (many of whom hold online office
hours), each other and the outside world. And most provide some
sort of access to campus library collections and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In some places, the schools are forcing computer skills on
students.
</P>
<P>
   At Woodbury University in Burbank, all freshmen must lease from
the school laptop computers, Internet access and a package of basic
software, said academic vice president Zelda Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   Older students don't face the same requirements but will be
forced onto computers to get more and more class information and
assignments, Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Southern California, about three-fourths of
students have their own computers, said Phil Reese, executive
director of the school's information infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, the school's computer labs are busier than ever,
as students pop in to check e-mail, write or use the computers'
fast modems and phone lines to do quick research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students are much more wired than we think they are,'' Reese
said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, USC bought a campus-wide document system based on
Lotus Notes software that is designed to ease professors' efforts
to put their information online, Reese said.
</P>
<P>
   The computerization efforts aren't quite as far along at smaller
or poorer schools such as Pepperdine University and California
State University, Northridge. Nonetheless, even those schools
report big investments and decent progress.
</P>
<P>
   At CSUN, just-hired chief information officer David Liu is
surveying what computer resources the school has, so he can decide
where to further invest precious dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to what UCLA has, we're not there,'' Liu said. ``We
want to be there, but it's a matter of time and energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The school is focusing on classroom and lab computer access,
because so many of its students live off campus, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine is wiring dorms and outfitting computer labs but
wants to better connect students at its satellite campuses, said
Danita Leese, director of educational technology for the
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it does is expand the learning hours beyond the
classroom,'' Leese said.

LIKE ANY MAJOR PURCHASE, THIS ONE INVOLVES HOMEWORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Before you ever walk into a store to buy a
computer for your college student, you have to answer several basic
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Do these first, and you'll save a lot of headaches and regrets
later _ and maybe even some money, too.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, find out what the college recommends. Many
schools have a minimum configuration, and even certain
manufacturers they may suggest, based on compatibility with campus
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Contacting the school is particularly important if your child is
going to be connecting an Ethernet card to the school's high-speed
data network, say from his or her dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   You can save a lot of troubleshooting grief later (like on the
night before a big paper is due) by ensuring the school's
networking administrators are familiar with the kind of card you
buy.
</P>
<P>
   Figure out what you can afford to spend. It doesn't have to be a
lot of money: More-than-adequate machines and a printer can be
bought for comfortably less than $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   You should think about what your child will be studying, and how
that affects your child's computer needs. For instance, a would-be
artist will need a better graphics-oriented machine _ with far more
memory and maybe a removable storage peripheral like Iomega's Zip
drive _ than will a history or business student.
</P>
<P>
   With a freshman in any area of study, however, you may want to
start with a cheap, simple machine that has room for lots of
upgrades as technology improves and needs increase.
</P>
<P>
   Such a machine will allow your student to write papers, use the
Internet and campus networks easily and do simple analysis with
spreadsheets and database programs. When the student moves into
more demanding classwork in a couple of years, you can upgrade the
machine accordingly, with a more powerful processor, more memory,
or other improvements.
</P>
<P>
   If you can, buy the computer through the school's bookstore or
on-campus computer store. Machines and particularly software are
often deeply discounted for those with school IDs, while deals are
minimal in the retail sale of low-end hardware. But the bookstores
can save you hundreds of dollars in software, which is often deeply
discounted.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also need to decide whether you want to buy a
Windows-based PC or an Apple Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Macs are far easier to set up and use, an important
consideration particularly if your baby is far from home and
customer support. Also, many students have worked on Macintoshes
throughout school and know those machines well, which is a real
plus.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's just-released iMacs are particularly attractive
all-in-one machines with great power for about $1,300. The
cool-looking, luggable machines aren't meant to be carried around
campus but come with built-in networking capability and are perfect
for a wired dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, Macintoshes remain somewhat more expensive than
roughly comparable name-brand PCs. Brave consumers can still get
the best deals if they buy a no-name PC, especially if they build
their own or have someone knowledgeable put it together for them.
</P>
<P>
   But even some of the best-known PC companies are now offering
adequate machines that cost less than $1,000. Their products
provide most of the basics any starting student would need and come
with the security of a prominent brand name's warranty.
</P>
<P>
   PCs also have far more software available, particularly in areas
such as games (though your student would never be interested in
simply playing on his or her computer, right?).
</P>
<P>
   Macintosh developers have written around 17,000 programs,
including all the basics a student needs to write papers, analyze
business and math problems and access the Internet. But there are
tens of thousands of other programs that run only on PCs.
Macintoshes require an emulator program to run those same programs,
and they do it slowly.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also have to decide whether you want a laptop or desktop
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Laptops are great to carry to the library and on road trips,
providing wonderful flexibility that's particularly appealing to
footloose students who like to study far from their home base.
</P>
<P>
   But laptops have a bad habit of getting stolen, cost much more
for the same level of power, and are more limited in their
upgradability, a consideration for a machine your student will
probably use through most of his or her college career.
</P>
<P>
   If your student prefers to hole up in his or her dorm room for
hours at a time to study, a desktop machine might be the better
option. As a philosopher once said, to each his own.
</P>

BASIC PC CAN MEET STUDENT'S NEEDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BlOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So you're finally ready to shop for a computer.
You've figured out where your student's living, what he or she
needs for networking, whether it will be a desktop or laptop
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to go into the store. Thankfully, the computer
business is going through a vicious cost-cutting cycle, with
terrific, very capable machines available for less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, those inexpensive machines are more than enough
for most young students' needs. Beware what you buy, however,
because some cheap machines offer more than others.
</P>
<P>
   You need to get a machine that minimally has:
</P>
<P>
   A Pentium processor for PCs, or a PowerPC chip for Macintoshes.
</P>
<P>
   In the PC world, Intel competitors such as AMD and Cyrix have
created inexpensive alternatives to Pentiums that work quite well,
with few or no compatibility problems. AMD's K6 chip, for instance,
is found in many less-expensive machines and is a capable
alternative to Intel's low-end Celeron or Pentium chips.
</P>
<P>
   RAM, or random-access memory, of 32 megabytes. Given the low
prices for memory, the bloat of many software programs and the huge
improvement in usability you get from extra memory, go ahead and
get more if you can. It's the single biggest improvement per dollar
that you can make to a simple system.
</P>
<P>
   A minimum 2-gigabyte hard drive for storage of all the research,
term papers, spreadsheets, Web pages and Quake scenarios your
little student will be pumping out. Larger is better.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-inch monitor, with at least a .28mm dot pitch. The dot
pitch measures the screen's clarity, and smaller dot pitch means a
sharper screen.
</P>
<P>
   A 56K bps, V.90 modem or a good-quality Ethernet card. If your
student is living off-campus, or has a dorm room that's not
directly wired to the campus network, a fast modem will allow them
to dial in and surf the Internet, contact their teacher, even write
you an e-mail asking for more money. Faster is better when it comes
to speed, and prices for modems are dirt cheap. Here more than
anywhere, speed makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   A basic software package, such as ClarisWorks (called AppleWorks
in a bundle with Apple's new iMac) for the Macintosh, or Microsoft
Office (more expensive, but featuring more fully functional
programs for Macs and PCs), will cover the basic needs of most
students.
</P>
<P>
   These packages come with a solid word processor and spreadsheet,
database and presentation capabilities. They also come with
programs that allow a student to dial into a campus' mainframe
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Internet access programs, such as a World Wide Web browser like
Netscape's Communicator or Microsoft's Explorer, typically come
free with every machine. Those browsers also include built-in
e-mail capability and the ability to create simple pages for the
World Wide Web.

`WONDERLAND' STAR NO STRANGER TO GOING IT ALONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's a wrenching moment near the end of the
wonderful new modern romance, ``Next Stop Wonderland,'' that
signals the emergence of Hope Davis as a film actress to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Davis plays Erin, a single nurse who must endure countless bad
dates because of a personal ad her mother placed in a Boston
newspaper. Erin has just finished her graveyard shift and is
enjoying a meal and a bottle of wine with a handsome Brazilian (not
an ad respondent) who has designs on her heart. When he leaves for
more wine, Erin looks around the restaurant and notices all the
lonely people around her. And she just loses it in a heartbreaking
display of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who spends an unusual amount of time alone playing Erin
in ``Wonderland,'' says the scene still gets to her when she
watches it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of my favorite things about the movie,'' the
31-year-old actress says. ``(Writer-director) Brad Anderson so
captures that feeling that you can be content by yourself, but then
you go out in a crowd, look around at couples or maybe see tired,
hurting people by themselves, and this feeling of loneliness just
overwhelms you.''
</P>
<P>
   As for all that screen time by herself, Davis says she loved it,
coming as it did after being relatively under-used in the past in
movies such as ``The Myth of Fingerprints,'' ``Kiss of Death'' and
``Home Alone.'' She's probably best known to audiences who saw her
delightful turn in the modest indie hit ``The Daytrippers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good challenge but kind of a lonely one,'' Davis says
of her ``Wonderland'' solo work. ``I just wanted to make those
scenes interesting and not have Erin slumped by the refrigerator
waiting for the phone to ring. She's melancholy, but she's
comfortable with herself, too. I think single people will be able
to relate to this movie because it embodies that truism of how the
search for love has to start with learning to be alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says he was looking for an actress who wasn't ditzy or
too cutesy or too much of a glamour girl. Davis, an intelligent and
attractive (but not unrealistically so) blonde with expressive
brown eyes, fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope has this quality where she's a little bit detached yet
also soulful, melancholy but also radiant,'' Anderson says. ``We
also wanted someone a little unconventional. The fact that she had
done a lot of stage work prior to her films helped because I shoot
kind of off-the-cuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson made ``Next Stop Wonderland'' (named for a stop along
the Boston subway line) in 22 days nearly two years ago. If Davis
seems convincing while inhabiting her character's gray-filled
world, it's no accident. Her marriage was coming to an end while
she made the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most unhappy time of my life,'' says Davis, who had
known her ex-husband since she was 18. ``I see myself in the movie,
and I just look terrible. It shows. The movie is hard to watch in a
way because it brings back such a bad time in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   She's moved on _ personally and professionally. Davis has a new
boyfriend (an actor), starred in Chekhov's ``Ivanov'' with Kevin
Kline on Broadway and landed meaty roles in two upcoming movies.
Davis will co-star with Jeff Bridges in ``Arlington Road,'' a
political thriller about domestic terrorism, and recently wrapped a
part in director Lawrence Kasdan's next film, ``Mumford.'' She also
can be seen this fall in Stanley Tucci's ``Big Night'' follow-up,
``The Impostors.''
</P>
<P>
   For Davis, her resume is going to end there _ for now. She's
going to hole up in her Greenwich Village apartment, which is
devoid of televisions and answering machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just bookcases, food, sea kayaks (she just got back from an
ocean kayaking trip to Mount Desert Island in Maine) and blueberry
pie,'' Davis says dreamily.

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; One of the last places to find radio industry
news is on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the first stop is Don Barrett's Web site devoted to
local broadcasting. The Internet site (www.laradio.com) was
initially launched last summer to promote Barrett's self-published
book, ``Los Angeles Radio People Vol. 2 (1957-97),'' a useful A to
Z chronicle of City of Angels broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to update the site on a regular basis to keep up with
what was occurring, because there was this whole raft of events
taking place,'' Barrett said of the site's early days.
</P>
<P>
   The site is updated daily and has become a must-read for both
broadcasters and local listeners each morning.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, for example, published the full text of an unusual
late-night on-air apology offered by KFI-AM (640) officials last
week after talk host Tammy Bruce was suspended for comments she
made regarding the Cosby family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a daily radio industry convention on the Web,''
said Barrett, a Burbank motion-picture consultant who spent 10
years in radio and launched now-defunct KIQQ-FM in the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the latest news, Barrett's site offers a listing of
e-mail addresses for broadcasters past and present. Saturdays, he
posts letters from the site's many visitors, which Barrett
estimates at an average of about 4,000 daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are fans of radio who are just passionate about what
they listen to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NOW HEARD ON CABLE: After three decades at Glendale's KIEV-AM
(870), affable evening host Gregg Hunter has moved to the Cable
Radio Network (CRN), which broadcasts on cable TV systems
throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's ``Nightside L.A.'' can be heard at 10 p.m. Saturdays
and 9 p.m. Sundays on such local systems as Century, TCI and Media
One.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome all of Gregg's listeners, which he calls his
call-in cousins,'' said Paul Stern, CRN's program director. ``We're
very proud to have Gregg on staff.''
</P>
<P>
   CRN, which is based in Sunland, is available in about 13 million
homes worldwide through cable TV, satellite and the Internet, Stern
said.
</P>
<P>
   The local number to call into Hunter's program is (818)
353-1276.
</P>
<P>
   LATIN ROCK SHOW: Members of the KROQ-FM (106.7) staff will be on
hand at 11:30 a.m. Sept. 2 when Latin-rockers Ozomatli perform a
free show at the Sierra Quad on the campus of California State
University, Northridge.

 &HT;    Tracking the storm : The Weather Channel hunkers down
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTAMeteorologist Bill Keneely has been plucked, literally,
from the Weather Channel's newsroom by his producer, Lauren
Chambliss. She's grabbed him by the back of his polo shirt to get
him out of a conversation, then trotted him down a hall to the
company van, dubbed ``White Lightning,'' that would take them to
Hartsfield International Airport for a flight to Hurricane Bonnie's
expected landfall in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   So goes the deployment of troops at the Weather Channel, where a
hurricane approaching the East Coast coast gets the same blowout
treatment as CNN gives to a presidential address.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, thousands of metro Atlantans drive right by the
Weather Channel's headquarters next to I-75 near Windy Hill Road,
passing another nondescript concrete-and-smoked-glass Perimeter
office building. No big sign announces its presence.
</P>
<P>
   Its metro location is ``a well-kept secret,'' says CEO Michael
Eckert, because the cable channel is small (about 600 Atlanta
employees) and not set up to handle drop-in visitors and tours. But
that relative anonymity works against it as well, because the world
identifies Atlanta with CNN and the rest of Time Warner and Ted
Turner's TV empire.
</P>
<P>
   With Hurricane Bonnie approaching, interest in the Weather
Channel will spike again, and viewership could explode tenfold,
from 200,000 to more than 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Keneely, who'll be reporting from North Carolina today, is one
of the volunteers who go to where the bad weather is for live
reports. They're not as foolhardy as the storm chasers in the movie
``Twister,'' although the Weather Channel does have a few workers
who stalk tornadoes on their own vacation time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problem with volunteers,'' says Eckert. ``We do
tell them don't get too close, or you won't go next time.'' Despite
such admonitions, there's still admiring talk in the newsroom about
Dennis Smith, the meteorologist who lashed his belt to a hotel
balcony in Coral Gables, Fla., to keep from being blown away during
a live report on Hurricane Andrew in 1992.

   An approaching hurricane sends the Weather Channel into what
Eckert calls ``clear-the-decks mode.'' Catered barbecue is brought
in for the staff working extra hours. The dress code for the
newsroom would probably be relaxed if it could be, but it can't,
because the Weather Channel scarcely has a dress code. Casual
Fridays morphed into casual every day a couple of years ago, and so
Eckert, the big boss, wears a golf shirt and slacks into the
office, and assignment editor Patrick Walsh, who runs the live
coverage, is dressed in khaki shorts and untucked polo shirt. Only
the on-air people _ ``on-camera meteorologists,'' as the cable
network calls them _ wear ties or chic outfits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude is if the weather is going to keep us here, let's
be comfortable,'' on-camera meteorologist Lisa Mozer says during a
break from the TelePrompTer. On a bulletin board behind her, out of
camera range, someone has posted an article from the supermarket
tabloid The Sun, screaming about a ``Weather Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   But their attitude toward their work is anything but casual or
tongue-in-cheek. ``Our mission is to get the word out and help
people prepare,'' says Joe Conboy, vice president of program
operations.
</P>
<P>
   That's the attitude of Steve Lyons, the channel's ``tropical
specialist'' since May, when he replaced long-time hurricane expert
John Hope. Lyons, bald and authoritative with a Ph.D. in
meteorology from the University of Hawaii, is the Weather Channel's
go-to guy for Hurricane Bonnie, the channel's equivalent of CNN's
Christiane Amanpour when the shooting starts in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just breaking in here,'' says Lyons, who is crisp and calm
on the air even though he admits to worrying about how he will do
if his equipment breaks down.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons got started with weather forecasting when he was a surfing
high school student in Southern California. ``I wondered where the
waves came from,'' he says, so he built a small weather hutch to
gather information. He's taught meteorology at Texas A&AMP;M University
and was manager of the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch of the
National Hurricane Center in Miami before joining the Weather
Channel three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The cable channel began in 1982, two years after CNN's start-up,
and met with similar derision by so-called experts. ``Who's gonna
watch a 24-hour weather channel?'' is how CEO Eckert, who's been
with the channel since the beginning, recalls the initial reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the Weather Channel achieved a recognition level
that amazes even those who work there. A study last year by
advertising firm Young &AMP; Rubicam polled people on their awareness
of, and opinion of, TV channels. Fox finished first, the Discovery
Channel second and the Weather Channel third, ahead of CNN, NBC,
CBS and ABC.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out even the Weather Channel is surprised by who
watches. TV sets at the Vortex restaurant-bars in Little Five
Points and Midtown are frequently tuned in.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our owners (Suzanne Benoit) is an avid motorcycle rider
and she always has it on to see what the weather's going to be,''
says Vortex manager Kevin Jones. ``And if it's going to be hot and
humid, there goes my patio (business).''
</P>
<P>
   Also watching, according to the Weather Channel's market
research: gamblers, who want to know if horse racing tracks and
football fields are going to be wet or dry; golfers (the golf
portion of the channel's Web pages is its most popular section);
business travelers, pilots, farmers, commodities traders,
construction workers who won't get to work if it's raining; and
some ``weather enthusiasts,'' as Eckert calls them, who sometimes
have the channel on for four straight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons is the first to admit that predicting the path of a
hurricane is very difficult. Different computer models with
acronyms such as GFDL (for geophysical fluid dynamics) suggest
different tracks. And getting it right is potentially a matter of
life and death, a far cry from the jolly weather forecasts favored
in much of TV news. These days, the atmosphere is anything but
jolly inside the Weather Channel.

 &HT;    The sky's the limit as rocket center in Huntsville takes
visitors to final frontier
 &HT;    By Nick Tate
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Ala._In the final seconds before the crash, the
voice from the flight tower shifted from cool military tones to an
urgent warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're coming in too low,'' the controller's voice crackled
over the ground-to-air radio. ``We show you drifting off the flight
path.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ease back on the stick _ now!''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later the aircraft plunged with explosive force into the
grassy fields just short of the runway. There were no survivors ...
and no casualties either, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oops,'' whispered my 4-year-old son, Josh, releasing the
joystick of the ``Land the Shuttle'' flight simulator we had so
cluelessly piloted together. Then, after collecting himself: ``This
is just so cool, Daddy. Wanna try it again?''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, we don't have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   It's just another day at the U.S. Space &AMP; Rocket Center, in the
Alabama city that produced the rocket boosters that put men on the
moon.
</P>
<P>
   This Huntsville attraction boldly goes where no other science
and history museum has gone before. It's a place where ``Star
Wars'' film fantasy mingles with real-world Star Wars missile
technology. Where kids can take a virtual-reality ride to Jupiter _
and get a close look at the real Apollo 15 module that took men to
the moon, then fell back to Earth in a blaze of heat and glory 26
years ago. And where families can spend the morning walking through
a rocket graveyard of retired NASA boosters, military aircraft and
test missiles, and the afternoon watching an IMAX film shot by
astronauts aboard the Russian Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the rocket center spans the distance between sci-fi
space fantasy and sophisticated NASA reality, with more than 60
interactive exhibits and 1,500 pieces of space hardware.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the center has more to offer than ever: An $800,000
makeover completed in the spring adds a children's play area and
new exhibits, including a full-scale mock-up of Mir's core module
and a meteorite display. In addition, the center is drawing up
plans for an expansion that would cost $50 million to $100 million
and quadruple the size of the north Alabama attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Lofty plans are nothing new for Huntsville, which has been
something of a company town for the space program since the 1950s.
That's when Wernher von Braun arrived with a team of American and
German scientists to test and build the rockets that would hoist
Americans into space.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, the center stands as a terrific monument to von
Braun's vision and America's pioneering instincts. It's also a
family-friendly weekend destination.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Rocket City
</P>
<P>
   Our trip to Rocket City could not have been more tailor-made for
our two sons. Danny, 7, is deep into the ``Star Wars'' trilogy, an
enthusiasm that fuels a pretty sophisticated knowledge of the solar
system, NASA missions and astronomy. Josh, 4, loves anything
involving locomotion _ trains, planes, cars, rockets and other
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Even before we'd pulled into the Rocket Center parking lot, the
two were out of their seat belts and clamoring to get out of the
car. The center's large rocket park is visible from the road, its
retired rockets and aircraft towering into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, pictures and memorabilia from NASA's 40-year history
provide an interesting introduction to the space program. A mock-up
of the space shuttle docking with Mir anchors a corner of the
lobby. And, everywhere, photos and small-scale models of lunar
vehicles, space-suited astronauts and Apollo spacecraft fill
displays.
</P>
<P>
   First stop: a movie theater, where a five-minute film boils down
50 years of space research, rocket testing and Huntsville's role in
NASA's lofty plans. The movie is part nostalgia, part futuristic
vision and hails Huntsville's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fitting warm-up to the series of exhibits and interactive
programs that follow.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo exhibits
</P>
<P>
   For space buffs, the first display, ``Rocket City Legacy,'' is
the most compelling. In a series of interlocking rooms, relics from
the dawn of the space program through NASA's most shining moment _
the Apollo missions to the moon _ are preserved under glass.
</P>
<P>
   They range from the intriguing to the bizarre. Film loops and
black-and-white photographs show sketchy images of the first rocket
tests by 19th-century European scientists Konstantin Tsiolkovsky
and Hermann Oberth. A replica of von Braun's office fills one wall,
complete with personal items and space memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Model replicas of the first monkeys in space _ on display in
their odd uniforms _ stare out perpetually at visitors. The Apollo
artifacts include everything from astronaut training uniforms to
cameras, radio transmitters, diaries, shovels used to scoop up moon
rocks and even the ``purging'' underwear worn by orbiting
astronauts (known in characteristic NASA-speak as the ``Urine
Collection Transfer Assembly'').
</P>
<P>
   Games and gizmos
</P>
<P>
   The center wisely alternates hardware exhibits with areas
featuring children's games and science-museum-style gizmos that
youngsters can manipulate. Once through the Apollo exhibits, for
instance, kids can try their hands at the ``Land the Shuttle''
flight simulator, which is equal parts science and video game, or
pilot a virtual lunar lander's descent to the surface of the moon.
They can find out what it feels like for shuttle astronauts to
operate a remote-controlled cargo arm in space. And they can weigh
themselves on a scale that compares their earthbound weight to
their weights on Mars and the moon.
</P>
<P>
   In a cavernous central lobby, artifacts of the space program
stand side by side with mock-ups and re-created scenes. A test
module and lunar rover used by Apollo astronauts sit atop a
realistic moonscape. A few feet away, visitors can almost touch the
actual scorched Apollo 16 command module _ nicknamed ``Casper'' _
that carried astronauts John Young, Thomas Mattingly and Charles
Duke to the moon and back in April 1972.
</P>
<P>
   A full-scale, walk-through replica of parts of Skylab, the
world's first orbiting space laboratory, sits next to a fragment of
the real Skylab, recovered after the vessel crashed to Earth in the
1970s. Behind it stands the quarantine trailer from which Neil
Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins spoke to President Nixon
after their historic return from the moon in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   There are also artifacts from the earlier Gemini missions,
including a training capsule used by the astronauts, a
3.3-billion-year-old moon rock brought back by Apollo 12, and
engraved champagne bottles commemorating every space shuttle
launching, including that of Challenger, which exploded in 1986
killing all aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Journey to Jupiter
</P>
<P>
   Some exhibits use a bit of old-fashioned stagecraft. A science
fiction gallery, featuring replicas of vessels from ``Star Wars,''
``Star Trek'' and sci-fi movies of the 1950s, leads to a
virtual-reality simulator that takes visitors on a fictional trip
to Jupiter, the largest planet. Hardly a mall ride, ``Journey to
Jupiter'' sprinkles in bits of real-world detail about the
International Space Station, now under construction.
</P>
<P>
   For a look at real spaceflight, the center's Spacedome IMAX
theater offers ``Mission to Mir,'' a new film that chronicles
American astronaut Shannon Lucid's historic shuttle mission to the
space station.
</P>
<P>
   After touring the center, visitors can walk the grounds behind
it for a close-up experience with nearly a dozen rockets that dot
the landscape like so many massive memorials. ``Rocket Park,''
which U.S. senator and former (and future) astronaut John Glenn has
called ``the finest rocket collection in the world,'' includes a
363-foot, three-stage Saturn V rocket, a full-scale mock-up of the
space shuttle and its huge booster rockets, and other NASA and
military craft.
</P>
<P>
   New this year is the park's ``Kids' Cosmos Energy-Depletion
Zone,'' a covered play area featuring child-friendly games,
climbing structures and rides, including the popular ``Lunar
Lander,'' which simulates a landing on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   For older children, the ``Space Shot'' ride launches 12
strapped-in riders straight up a 180-foot tower in three seconds _
approximating the 4-G acceleration of a real shuttle launch _ then
free-falls back to Earth, providing several stomach-tingling
seconds of weightlessness. (Hint: Do not try this after a large
lunch. The same goes for the ``Centrifuge,'' which spins visitors
at a velocity three times the force of gravity.)
</P>
<P>
   The museum admission fee also covers the cost of a 90-minute
guided bus trip and tour to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center,
where engineers and laborers in hangar-sized buildings are busy
building components of the International Space Station. The first
pieces of the station are scheduled to be lofted into orbit later
this year by the space shuttle. The remaining sections are to be
ferried up and assembled in space, like giant Tinkertoys, over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Lasting impressions
</P>
<P>
   For the record, some of the center's exhibits appear not to have
been updated since Armstrong uttered his famous ``one small step
... one giant leap'' quote from the moon in 1969. There's also a
heavy dose of patriotic boosterism that seems to hark back, however
sweetly, to the 1950s. And parents should steady themselves for the
gift shops that beckon at virtually every entrance and exit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is an odd charm to the place, even for visitors who
aren't especially intrigued by science or the space program. Staff
members and tour guides, dressed in orange-and-blue NASA jumpsuits,
are helpful and knowledgable.
</P>
<P>
   As we left the center after a long, exhausting day, it was clear
that the visit had left a lasting impression on my sons. ``Can we
come back here for my birthday?'' Danny asked as we pulled out of
the parking lot. Then, strapping himself into his seat belt with a
flourish: ``Let's pretend we're on the space shuttle. You can be
the pilot, all right?''
</P>
<P>
   No problem, Houston. No problem at all.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   -- Getting there: A 3.5-hour drive from Atlanta, heading north
on I-75 to Chattanooga, west on I-24, then west on U.S. 72 to I-565
in Huntsville. The center is located at Exit 15 on I-565.
</P>
<P>
   -- Hours, admission: Open 9 a.m.-6 p.m. daily. Center admission
($14.95 adults, $10.95 children 3-12) includes IMAX shows about
space and a guided bus tour of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center.
</P>
<P>
   -- Space Camp: For those children who can't get enough in a
single weekend visit, the center's Space Camp offers a week of
training exercises and education on the rigors of spaceflight.
Participants can strap themselves into rotating chairs like the
Mercury astronauts used to experience G-forces, practice
maneuvering in an underwater training tank, and climb into the
cockpit of a space shuttle model to fly simulated missions.
Five-day camps are geared toward grades four through six; Space
Academy is a five-day program for grades six through eight;
advanced camps are offered for high school students and adults.
Tuition is $675 to $875, including meals and lodging. For
information, call 1-800-637-7223 or visit the center's World Wide
Web site at http://www.ussrc.com.
</P>
<P>
   -- Lodging: Downtown Huntsville has a variety of moderately
priced hotels close to the center, including the Radisson Suite
Hotel (205-882-9400), several Holiday Inns (1-800-826-9563),
Hilton, Marriott and Ramada. Many offer suites and family specials,
with separate bedrooms for children and parents, for $80 to $120
per night.
</P>
<P>
   -- Food: The center's Galaxy Food Court serves up fine,
moderately priced hamburgers, grilled chicken sandwiches and other
American foods. A family of four can graze for $20 and still have
some change for a couple of cups of ``space dots'' ice cream or ice
slush drinks, served in towering ``green alien'' cups. Downtown
Huntsville is dotted with chain restaurants: Outback makes an extra
effort to welcome families, and the Hilton (205-533-1400) has a
fine Sunday breakfast buffet for $7.95 (half-price for children
under 12; those 4 and under eat free) and a lavish Sunday brunch
($14.95 for adults, $7.95 for children under 8).

 &HT;    Hospital boutique caters to the needs of women
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _A woman's place is no longer just in the home. It can
also be at Northside Hospital's new boutique called ``A Woman's
Place.''
</P>
<P>
   The boutique, which has its grand opening on Thursday,
specializes in clothing and products relating to oncology,
maternity and incontinence. The 1,000-square-foot shop is decorated
in gold and burgundy and will stock motivational, educational and
inspirational books and tapes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to health-care products, the boutique will have
personnel on hand to answer questions about products, help with
fittings and to listen to health-care concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's women caring for women,'' says manager Beth Allen, who
spearheaded the two-year effort to open the boutique. Allen, an
obstetrics nurse, helped develop the Perinatal and Lactation Center
in Northside Hospital after discovering that many women needed help
with breast-feeding techniques.
</P>
<P>
   But Allen had bigger ideas. She wanted a place to house products
and services in one convenient location for women in their
childbearing years through menopause and beyond. Allen says her
goal was to create a warm environment where women could feel
comfortable and safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want women to feel pretty while going through treatments,''
she says. ``That's why we have a line of jewelry as well as scarves
and hats.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the clothing and products will be covered by a woman's
insurance carrier. Prices are comparable to those in retail stores.
For example, nursing bras range from $25 to $35; wigs $130-$220;
reusable incontinent undergarments $12-$15; jewelry $8-$30;
compression hosiery $12-$80.
</P>
<P>
   Next May, ``A Woman's Place'' will move to the new five-story
Northside Hospital's Women's Center on Hollis Cobb Drive in
Atlanta. Another boutique is planned for late 1999 in Alpharetta,
in the Northside/Alpharetta Medical Office Building which will
offer out-patient services.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Woman's Place'' will be open 9 a.m. -5 p.m. Mondays-Fridays;
by appointment Saturdays. 980 Johnson Ferry Road, Atlanta.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PUERTO ASIS, Colombia _ Just hours after Nestor Hernandez was
sworn in as mayor of this jungle town in southern Colombia, he was
abducted by leftist guerrillas, dragged across the border to
Ecuador and tied to a tree.
</P>
<P>
   That was his comeuppance for defying a rebel order banning newly
elected municipal officials from taking office last January. The
guerrillas released Hernandez after 11 days, but his troubles were
just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   In February, he earned the wrath of the Colombian army when he
accused officers of collaborating with right-wing paramilitary
death squads. A few days later, two grenades exploded in front of
his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I represent a very high risk of danger,'' said Hernandez, who
took refuge in a friend's apartment after the attack. ``No one
wants to rent to me. No one wants to be my neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   With rebels, paramilitaries and the army all fighting for power
in Colombia's remote towns and villages, Hernandez and other mayors
have found themselves in the line of fire.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years, 29 mayors have been assassinated,
mainly by rebels. Hundreds of town council members have also been
killed, kidnapped or threatened, and many have been forced to
resign. In the run-up to nationwide municipal elections last
October, nearly 40 candidates were shot dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a mayor here, you have to really love your community,''
said Gilberto Toro, executive director of the Colombian Federation
of Municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, 40, says he took the mayoral job with hopes of ending
the violence and bringing jobs to Puerto Asis.
</P>
<P>
   But he acts more like a desperate fugitive than a city hall
power broker. During a recent interview, he wiped the sweat from
his face and kept an eye on the street in front of his friend's
apartment in case any strangers came calling.
</P>
<P>
   He spends half of his $1,500 monthly salary on bodyguards. To
fool would-be assassins, he rents a variety of cars and pickups and
constantly sends his driver on decoy trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never go to social events,'' he said. ``The bodyguards scare
people.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his determination, Hernandez lacks a broad popular
mandate to carry on his mayoral duties. Due to guerrilla threats,
nearly all of Puerto Asis' 17,000 eligible voters stayed home
during last October's election. Hernandez won with 102 votes. The
loser received 55.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible,'' Hernandez said of the election. ``The
guerrillas were everywhere. People who voted risked their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez first learned about political struggle as a university
student in Poland. He earned a scholarship to study oceanography in
the Baltic port city of Gdansk _ the birthplace of the Solidarity
labor union, which led the protests against Poland's Communist
government in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   With a degree and a Polish wife, Hernandez returned to Colombia
in 1987. But the only jobs in oceanography were in the Navy, which
rejected Hernandez because he had studied in the former Eastern
bloc. Even today, people call him ``the Pole.''
</P>
<P>
   To make ends meet, Hernandez sold fertilizer and pesticides in
Puerto Asis, 335 miles southwest of the capital of Bogota in the
impoverished state of Putumayo. The region's main cash crop is
coca, the raw material for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez advised farmers how to use the chemicals to grow more
coca leaves. ``If I sold the product, I had to prove to them that
it worked,`` he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Hernandez turned to politics, he developed a more
critical view of the drug trade. ``None of the profits stay here in
the region. What stays are the problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Asis' reputation as a regional cocaine center attracted
the country's largest guerrilla organization _ the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, known by its Spanish initials, FARC. The
rebels have financed their 34-year war against the state, in part,
by taxing coca farmers and providing protection to drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC and the smaller National Liberation Army, or ELN, are a
dominating power in about 200 of Colombia's 1,074 municipalities,
according to Camilo Echandia, an adviser to the Colombian
government's peace commission. In these zones, the guerrillas often
dictate how city revenues should be spent; they decide who will be
hired for municipal jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In Puerto Asis, local politics became even more complex with the
arrival of the paramilitaries, who are trying to dislodge the
rebels. In January and February, paramilitaries killed 38 suspected
guerrilla supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a list of people and just began killing,'' said Diego
Orozco, the local director of a government program that funds
alternative crop projects for coca growers.
</P>
<P>
   With the body count rising, Hernandez traveled to Bogota to
denounce the killings before the Interior Minister and the national
media. Citing eyewitness accounts from Puerto Asis residents,
Hernandez accused the army of providing helicopter support for the
paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Top army commanders sued Hernandez for slander. But the
eyewitnesses, many of whom feared for their lives, would not agree
to testify in court. Hernandez was forced to publicly retract his
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Puerto Asis, someone tossed two grenades at Hernandez's
house, seriously injuring a night watchman.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers suspect that Hernandez agreed to speak out
against the paramilitaries when he was in guerrilla custody. But
Hernandez denies that he cut any deals.
</P>
<P>
   He insists that his survival strategy involves denouncing human
rights abuses on all sides and focusing national and international
attention on his predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they kill me, it would have a huge political cost,'' he
says. ``That is my own security.''

UAW LEADERS ASSAIL GM, HINTING THAT TENSIONS PERSIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Leaders of the United Automobile Workers strongly
criticized General Motors Corp. on Tuesday, a sign that this
summer's strikes in Flint, Mich. did not produce a reconciliation
and that next year's national contract talks between GM and the UAW
will be contentious.
</P>
<P>
   UAW president Stephen Yokich condemned GM's Aug. 3 announcement
of plans to spin off its auto parts subsidiary. Asked at a news
conference in Detroit on Tuesday what the UAW planned to do about
GM's plans, Yokich said that another strike was always possible,
although he added that the union might not do anything until Sept.
14, 1999. That is when the UAW's current national agreements with
GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. are all scheduled to expire.
</P>
<P>
   GM and the UAW had also agreed at the end of the nearly
eight-week-long Flint strikes to begin holding regular, top-level
meetings to prevent future confrontations. But Richard Shoemaker,
the UAW's vice president for GM issues, said Tuesday that there had
been few discussions with GM since then.
</P>
<P>
   GM spokesman Gerald Holmes acknowledged that few meetings had
been held since the end of the strike, but attributed it to
vacations. ``We are serious about improving the relationship and
making this process work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GM executives contended during the strike that the company must
reduce its labor costs to start earning a competitive return on its
shareholders' investment.
</P>
<P>
   Yokich and Shoemaker spoke at their first news conference since
they announced July 28 an agreement to end the strikes. Since then,
GM has announced several initiatives to try to make the company
more competitive: spin off the auto parts subsidiary, consolidate
its marketing staffs and build new assembly plants in North America
that would require fewer workers.
</P>
<P>
   Both UAW leaders offered a few small hints Tuesday of a
willingness to compromise. Yokich, for example, was cautious in
discussing GM's plans for new assembly plants.
</P>
<P>
   The new factories would employ fewer workers by relying on
outside suppliers to deliver large chunks of vehicles, like
complete dashboards, instead of bolting every part together on the
assembly line. Some union advocates worry about GM's plans because
four out of every five auto supplier factories in the United States
are not unionized.
</P>
<P>
   Yokich said in a conversation with several reporters after the
news conference that the union had already won considerable job
security for its members and that some changes in production
processes were inevitable. The union will put greater emphasis on
outside suppliers being in the United States, than being unionized,
he said, although the union will still try to organize these
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Even if jobs are created at nonunion supplier factories in the
United States, he said, ``It's still an American job, isn't it?''

BOND MARKET STABLE AS DOLLAR RISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bonds were firm Tuesday as overseas financial markets
stabilized and as the dollar's rise against the Japanese yen and
the German mark gave them a lift.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up 16/32, to a price
of 101 3/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction,
ticked lower to 5.43 percent, from 5.46 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in keeping the bond market firm was that consumer
confidence as measured by the Conference Board, a private research
group, fell to an index reading of 133.1 in August from 137.2 in
July. It was the first consecutive decline in the series since
September-October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Chan, a managing director and chief economist at Banc
One Investment Advisors Corp. in Columbus, Ohio, said the reading
implied that the second half of the year would produce a
less-threatening pace of growth in consumption spending.
</P>
<P>
   However, investors' enthusiasm was tempered, he said, by a
second report that existing home sales increased 4 percent in July
to a monthly record 4.93 million units at an annualized rate. That
report provided a snapshot of the resiliency of the United States
economy. ``As a result, many market bulls were forced to admit that
they would need to see an even more extensive global market crisis
to justify significantly lower interest rates,'' Chan said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Treasury will auction $15 billion of a new
two-year note, and in when-issued trading Tuesday, the securities
were being offered at a price to yield 5.14 percent. On Thursday,
the government plans to sell $40 billion of 15-day cash management
bills.

`CONCERT OF WILLS': THE ART OF COMPROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ah, for the life of the brilliant visionary artist:
the thrill of grand conception, the exhilaration of feverish
creation, the profound satisfaction of realization. Then accolades
and immortality.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast!
</P>
<P>
   If the documentary ``Concert of Wills: Making the Getty Center''
is any guide, the process of creation is prolonged and dogged by
frustration and conflict. In the end, no matter what the visible
result or how heady the plaudits, the art that may have done most
to shape the outcome is the art of compromise and collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concert of Wills,'' opening Wednesday at the Film Forum, 209
W. Houston St., is itself a fine and painstaking work of art. It
tracks the 14 years leading to the realization of the plans
conceived by the architect Richard Meier for the six-building,
million-square-foot hillside complex that is the Getty Center in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Behind ``Concert of Wills'' stand three filmmakers accustomed to
acclaim for their documentaries: Susan Froemke, whose credits
include ``Letting Go: A Hospice Journey''; Bob Eisenhardt, whose
credits include ``Vladimir Horowitz: A Reminiscence'' and
``Soldiers of Music: Rostropovich Returns to Russia,'' and Albert
Maysles, who with his brother David blazed the trail into direct
cinema, the American version of the French cinema verite, with
films like ``Salesman,'' ``Gimme Shelter,'' ``Grey Gardens,''
``Christo's Valley Curtain'' and ``Vladimir Horowitz: The Last
Romantic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Getty Trust commissioned Maysles Films to document the
process of bringing the billion-dollar project to fruition. And the
filmmakers' access permitted them to record the arduous, often
contentious events that led to the opening of the Getty Center last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Meier, noted for his spare white enameled modernist buildings,
was, from the outset, up against the local residents and a
conditional use permit with more than 100 provisions, including one
that insisted that the exteriors of the center be constructed
primarily of stone.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Meier was also pitted against John Walsh, the
director of the J. Paul Getty Museum, and Walsh's traditionalist
focus on an interior design that would best display the center's
collections. Toward the end, the Getty Trust, with Harold Williams
as its president and chief executive and Stephen Rountree as its
vice president, turned to Thierry Despont, an architect who
concerned himself with the interiors, and Robert Irwin, an artist
charged with landscaping the center's central gardens _ a man who
clearly vexed Meier, usually seen maintaining a rather cheerful if
long-suffering demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concert of Wills'' also records meetings of the center's
design advisory committee and city planning commission sessions,
visits the Italian quarry that produced the travertine used for the
buildings' exteriors, and shows the transformation of the hillside
from scrubland to the glowing site of the completed project.
</P>
<P>
   If the cameras are never quite present when some of the
seemingly ceaseless differences over grand design and tiny detail
are resolved, ``Concert of Wills'' nevertheless conveys the tension
and drama of creation. Throughout, Meier struggles to realize a
conception that no end of meetings and drawings and scale models
seem ever to make visible in full subtlety and glory to anyone but
himself. Ever, that is, until the very end.
</P>
<P>

CONCERT REVIEW: IT'S HANSON ALONG WITH EXCITED FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Little girls started screaming as the stage crew set up the
opening act, and they didn't stop until Hanson sang its last encore
on Monday night at the Continental Airlines Arena in East
Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing Hanson T-shirts, they waved homemade signs announcing
``Hanson We Love U'' or singling out one of the three Hanson
brothers _ Zachary, 12, Taylor, 15, and Isaac, 17 _ for particular
devotion.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the pandemonium, the three cute blond brothers pretended
they were playing an ordinary rock concert. They barely flirted
with the audience, and limited their stage banter to lines like
``You guys ready to rock?'' The stage set was minimal; they didn't
surround themselves with special effects. Hanson wants to be a
band, not a novelty act.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson understands that kiddie idols have a short commercial
life span, and it has capitalized on its pop moment. Since the
release in 1997 of its major-label debut album, ``Middle of
Nowhere'' (Mercury), with its irresistible single, ``MMMBop,''
Hanson has reissued its home-recorded second album, ``Three-Car
Garage'' (Mercury), as well as a home video commemorating its first
promotional tour. The band has gone on to play concert tours, and
plans to release a live album in October. At the arena, a man with
a video camera shared the stage with the band, perhaps gathering
material for the next video clip.
</P>
<P>
   But releasing a live album is Hanson's way of saying that it's
not like most groups little girls squeal for, which tend to be
studio confections chosen more for looks than for musicianship. The
brothers write their own songs, though sometimes with adult
collaborators. They all play instruments: Zachary on drums, Taylor
on keyboards, Isaac on guitar. And they trade lead and harmony
vocals, with Taylor and Isaac emoting like younger versions of
Gregg Allman while Zachary pipes up with a touch of Michael
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, they had help: a guitarist, keyboardist and bassist
stood in the shadows behind Zachary's drum setup. But Hanson's own
instruments and voices were in the foreground.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Hanson's songs are standard-issue pop for teenyboppers.
Little girls use kiddie-pop stars as the romantic equivalent of
training bras; they provide an introduction to adult desires and
abilities before they arrive. Kissing a photo of Leonardo DiCaprio
or screaming ``I want you!'' at a distant Hanson brother is a safe
test run for later relationships.
</P>
<P>
   For their side of the exchange, teenypop songs say the things
that real teen-age boyfriends probably won't: ``No matter what I
do, no matter where I go, I'll be thinking of you,'' Hanson
promises. Other Hanson songs pine for a lost girlfriend or try to
patch things up after a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, Hanson finds another topic: ``Man From
Milwaukee'' is a goofy fantasy, and ``Soldier'' is the kind of
story a child might make up about a favorite toy.
</P>
<P>
   And ``MMMBop,'' Hanson's one genuinely inspired song, is about
something else entirely: impermanence and the fragility of life, as
the brothers joyfully sing, ``In an mmmbop they're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Between its own songs, Hanson played 1960s songs hinting at
lustier liaisons, like Cream's ``Sunshine of Your Love'' and the
Young Rascals' ``Good Lovin'.'' And it had one brilliant choice of
an oldie: ``Summertime Blues,'' ideal for a band whose members are
too young to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Hanson onstage made nearly every song sound the
same: a midtempo, steady-strumming three-chord tune that could have
been a Doobie Brothers outtake circa 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Zachary is a sure, solid drummer, but Isaac is better off
playing rhythm guitar than revealing his elementary lead-guitar
skills. To hear Hanson perform live is to appreciate the producers
of ``Middle of Nowhere,'' who gave the songs dynamics, sonic
variety and a gimmick or two; on its own, Hanson rolls out its
songs like so many lengths of shag carpet.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, the band's limitations are drowned out
by the screams.

CULTURE NOTES: DIXIE CARTER'S NEW ROLE; ANNE FRANK DIARY; DOS
PASSOS PAINTINGS; STUDIO 54 POLL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dixie Carter, last seen on Broadway as Maria Callas
in Terrence McNally's Tony Award-winning play ``Master Class,'' is
headed for Washington. She will lead a cast of 17 in the
Shakespeare Theater production of the Oscar Wilde comedy ``A Woman
of No Importance,'' directed by Michael Kahn, the theater's
artistic director. Carter plays the title character, Mrs.
Arbuthnot, who seeks to protect her illegitimate son from the
corrupting influence of dandies and social climbers. The show opens
Tuesday and runs through Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ANNE FRANK DIARY
</P>
<P>
   A former employee of the Anne Frank Foundation says he will
return five missing pages from Anne Frank's original diary only if
his fellow Dutch scholars promote his Holocaust research in the
United States. The demand of the former employee, Cor Suijk,
prompted the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation to
say yesterday that a lawyer may be needed to resolve the matter.
Suijk maintains that Otto Frank, Anne's father, gave him the pages
before his death in 1980 on condition that they would not be
published until the entire family had died. The institute, hoping
to include the pages in the next edition of the diary, maintains
that Otto Frank never intended them to be a gift to Suijk. The
pages are said to contain Anne's severe assessment of her parents'
marriage. Suijk said their contents would be disclosed on Sept. 14
in a Dutch documentary about Anne's years of hiding during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   DOS PASSOS PAINTINGS
</P>
<P>
   To mention John Dos Passos is to bring to mind fiction like
``Three Soldiers,'' ``Manhattan Transfer'' and the ``U.S.A.''
trilogy. But Dos Passos was also an artist of another sort _ a
modernist whose earliest works were drawn in the trenches during
World War I, when he drove ambulances in Italy for the Red Cross.
In the 1920s, his watercolors were shown in New York with works by
Matisse and Picasso, and he painted sets in Paris for the Ballets
Russe with Leger and Natalia Gontcharova. In the '30s, George Grosz
was a friend and influence. Over more than half a century, Dos
Passos created more than 600 works. Beginning on Sept. 9, under the
curatorship of Richard Layman, a Dos Passos scholar, 32 works will
be exhibited through Oct. 8 under the title ``Colors That Will Not
Fade'' at Century Association in Manhattan.

POLL SHOWS GROWING SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC AID FOR PRIVATE EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is growing public support for the use of tax
money to pay for private school education but no consensus on how
much tax money should be used, according to a poll released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted by the Gallup Organization, was sponsored by
Phi Delta Kappa International, a Bloomington, Ind.-based
professional group promoting public education, and by the Center on
Education Policy, a Washington-based organization that advocates
public education. The survey of 1,500 adults was conducted in June.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell C. Rose, executive director emeritus of Phi Delta Kappa
and co-author of a report summarizing the polls, said 44 percent of
the poll respondents supported using tax funds to send students to
private schools. A similar poll in 1993 showed only 24 percent of
respondents favored that concept.
</P>
<P>
   While the poll shows growing support for the use of tax money to
pay for private education, the survey also found that respondents
were divided over how much tax money should go to private
education, Rose told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed more support for government funding that only
paid part of private tuition than programs that would pay full
tuition.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also asked people about two different kinds of
funding. One approach, the voucher system, would give parents
government-issued notes that pay for tuition. The other approach
would reimburse parents for tuition payments through tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   For tax credits, the partial reimbursement plan won more favor
among poll respondents, regardless of the answer about public
funding for private education. Partial reimbursement won support
from 66 percent of respondents, while a full refund was approved by
56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For vouchers, government help for part of the tuition was also
favored over full tuition, with 52 percent of people in support of
partial vouchers; 48 percent said they would favor full vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents could indicate support of either option or both
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The findings appear to guarantee that the issue of public
funding for church-related schools will be a battleground for the
foreseeable future,'' Rose noted.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed that the public wants private schools that
accept any public funding to be held accountable to the state just
as public schools are. This idea ``may be unacceptable to private
school advocates,'' the report warned.
</P>
<P>
   The poll's main conclusion was criticized by the National
Education Association _ the largest teachers union in the nation
and a leading advocate of public schools. The NEA issued a
statement saying Americans ``demand accountability for their public
education dollars, and that's impossible if we give public tax
dollars to private and religious schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Congress approved legislation that would
create tax-free savings accounts capped at $2,000 per year if used
for elementary and secondary education expenses including private
schools. The measure, sponsored by Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., was
vetoed by President Clinton on July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings from the report:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fifty percent of those polled believe that any state budget
surplus should be used for public schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ More parents fear for their child's safety at school.
Thirty-six percent say they are afraid in 1998 compared to 25
percent in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   _ More people think it is important to improve inner-city
school, with 86 percent of those polled supporting that goal, up
from 74 percent in 1989. Sixty-six percent said they would be
willing to pay more taxes to help improve those schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ The biggest problem facing local schools is
fighting/violence/gangs, according to 15 percent of the poll
respondents. Lack of discipline comes in second at 14 percent.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The theater is Jose Quintero's lifeline. ``It is not
a mere profession,'' he said. ``It helps me to clarify the process
of living. I know my way around this ground. It's like reading
Braille.'' He was standing in front of the stage at the
Provincetown Playhouse in Greenwich Village and facing a group of
theater students, teachers and professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here to open doors,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   The doors are to the plays of Eugene O'Neill. For nearly 50
years, Quintero has been the pre-eminent director of O'Neill and
the artist most responsible for re-establishing the reputation of
the Nobel Prize-winning playwright.
</P>
<P>
   This month Quintero is back in New York (from his home in
Sarasota, Fla.) for a series of public forums, a feature of the
Playwrights Theater's festival of O'Neill. The festival's inaugural
program, early O'Neill one-acts, runs through Sept. 11 at the
Provincetown, and over the next seven years the company plans to
present all 49 of O'Neill's plays.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, when throat cancer took away his normal power of
speech, Quintero has spoken with the aid of a Servox, a
microphonelike instrument that he holds firmly to his neck.
Speaking slowly and precisely, he sounds like a robot in an echo
chamber. But listeners can attune themselves to his voice, and when
he talks it is with his customary passion, especially when the
subject is O'Neill and in this case ``Long Day's Journey Into
Night.''
</P>
<P>
   In this opening session, he spoke for two hours about his long
relationship with the work of O'Neill and with the playwright's
widow, Carlotta Monterey O'Neill. Relating his own life to ``Long
Day's Journey,'' he took his audience step by step through the
text. In subsequent forums, actors joined him onstage and acted out
scenes from the works being analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his handicap, the director has created a new career as a
lecturer and university professor. He teaches directing and acting,
dividing his year between the University of Houston and Florida
State University.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking spasmodically with long pauses, he said, ``I love the
theater,'' and patted the Provincetown stage as if it were an old
friend. In the early part of this century, before Quintero was
born, the Provincetown was the setting for O'Neill's first plays.
The newly renovated theater is now owned by New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Martin, who produced ``A Moon for the Misbegotten'' and
other O'Neill plays staged by Quintero, was in the audience for the
first forum. Later he commented on the director's strength and
energy, how he has repeatedly ``bounced back,'' adding, ``He is a
mesmerizing character, one of the great directors of our century.''
The two of them have talked about doing a new production of ``Long
Day's Journey Into Night.''
</P>
<P>
   In his roller-coaster career, Quintero has moved from euphoria
to despair and back again. He has battled alcoholism and other
private demons while repeatedly revitalizing himself. In the 1950s,
together with Theodore Mann at Circle in the Square, he reclaimed
the careers of Tennessee Williams and O'Neill with his historic
revivals of ``Summer and Smoke'' and ``The Iceman Cometh,'' which
made stars of Geraldine Page and Jason Robards.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Broadway with ``Long Day's Journey Into Night'' and
other plays, but by the early 1970s, after a series of crises, the
offers ended and he found himself emotionally and artistically
destitute. Then, with his 1973 Broadway revival of ``A Moon for the
Misbegotten'' (starring Robards and Colleen Dewhurst), he performed
another theatrical miracle. Because he and his actors had to
overcome grave personal problems, they called themselves the
Resurrection Company. At the time he said: ``Life is a series of
deaths and resurrections. I suppose O'Neill taught me that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a borrowed Manhattan apartment, he looked back on his
bout with cancer. ``I marvel that I'm still here,'' he said. ``As
you may imagine, when I was told I was to lose my voice, it was a
terrible shock. Although the doctor gave me a very slim chance of
survival, I never thought about dying. My main preoccupation was
how I was going to earn my living. My whole life had been
communication.''
</P>
<P>
   After his operation, he learned esophageal speech and how to use
the battery-operated device, but he remained self-conscious about
his voice. After weeks of practicing at home, he finally went out.
While speaking to a department store clerk, he realized that a
child was staring at him, ``not in horror but with a look of
rapture.'' The child followed him to another counter and was
emboldened to ask, ``Are you from another planet?'' Quintero said
he was, and the youngster's evident admiration ``erased all my
fear.''
</P>
<P>
   After several similar encounters, he returned to an active
theatrical life. He conducted workshops in California. Then Sidney
Berger, a former student of his and the director of the School of
Theater at the University of Houston, invited him to teach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great gift,'' said Berger, who attends all the
director's classes. ``One of the students said that going to Jose's
classes is like going to church. He gives you not just technique
but the spiritual justification for being in the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally Quintero has returned to directing, most recently
in 1996, when he did ``The Long Voyage Home'' in Provincetown,
Mass., but teaching has become almost a full-time occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on his past, he said that ``A Moon for the
Misbegotten'' was one play he would never do again because it was
impossible for him to see it without thinking of his actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never regarded as a great play,'' he said. ``Then with
Colleen and Jason and myself and Ed Flanders, something happened,
and the play came into full bloom. Many times I went to see it and
there was a line of luminosity.'' That production, he said, ``will
live in my imagination as long as I live _ and in the imagination
of those who saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could possibly explain the magic of that production,
he said, ``As O'Neill says, the mystery is an answer to the
mystery. We worked with such ease and trust. I didn't set out with
a vision. It just grew to its own level.''
</P>
<P>
   Every time he looks at or rereads an O'Neill, he finds a new
dimension. Studying ``Long Day's Journey'' in preparation for the
forum, he realized, ``I know these characters and yet there is so
much more to know.'' As always, he finds connections with his own
life. For example, he associates his brother with the character of
Jamie Tyrone, although his brother was not a drinker or a
philanderer. ``He became a tragic figure because all the hopes of
the family were upon him. I was given the freedom of having been
declared a failure very early. Therefore I could leave home.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that one reason for his success with O'Neill is that he
never thought of him as a realistic playwright. One model for his
version of ``Moon'' was van Gogh's ``Starry Night.'' The day before
the interview he had gone to the Museum of Modern Art to look at
the painting again. ``You wouldn't call that a realistic
painting,'' he said, ``and yet he really caught the magnificent
drunken feeling of moonlight and stars swirling in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   His second production of ``Long Day's Journey'' (in 1988) was,
he said, even more bare than the first, and were he to do the play
again, he would probably eliminate the windows and much of the
furniture and do it on a platform, as if it were a Greek drama,
closer to the approach taken by Ingmar Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from ``Moon,'' he does not feel so possessive about the
other O'Neill plays he has done. When he was in London recently, he
saw Kevin Spacey do ``The Iceman Cometh,'' and, he said, ``it
reassured me what a magnificent piece of theater it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on his life, he said the happiest times were at the
beginning of Circle in the Square, when the excitement of discovery
was in the air every day. He said one regret was not being able to
sustain a theater and a company of actors outside the mainstream.
For all his success on Broadway, he has always considered himself
an off-Broadway director. As he recalled those days, his enthusiasm
increased and his words took on renewed clarity. He began talking
about his landmark production of ``The Iceman Cometh.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1956 he decided to revive the play, which had been a
disappointment in its original Broadway run in 1946. Robards had
acted for him once, and Quintero wanted him for the small role of
Jimmy Tomorrow. The actor, who was driving a taxicab to make a
living, came to see him. ``Very timidly,'' Quintero remembered,
``he said he would like a crack at Hickey,'' the central role of
the play and at that point not yet cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason looked like the opposite of the description by O'Neill.
He was so thin and his eyes were so haunting. He seemed like the
last person you would think of casting as Hickey.'' Nevertheless,
Quintero agreed to let him read the role.
</P>
<P>
   Before an audience of one, Robards started Hickey's monologue,
his long aria of culpability, and Quintero was astonished.
``Suddenly my understanding of the depths of the play began to
emerge,'' he said. ``He knew more about O'Neill than I did. He
added texture, and I could almost feel it in my hands. I could
certainly feel it resonating inside me. Not since `Crime and
Punishment' had guilt been so tangible to me. He went on like a man
possessed. He began to sweat _ rivers of sweat _ and I did too.
Finally I said, `That's enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   He explained, ``From the moment he began to talk, the part
belonged to him. He was Hickey. It was one of those illuminating
moments _ almost an epiphany. I knew Jason was a good actor. I
didn't know he was a great actor.'' That evening, he telephoned
Robards and said, ``The part is yours.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening, the ecstatic reviews, the acclamation, the careers
all followed, but it was that reading that made everything
possible. As Quintero said, ``There in one afternoon that seemed
like any afternoon, this was taking place, and it changed three
people's lives'' _ the actor, the director and the playwright. He
added, ``Not only three people's lives.''

LEWIS F. POWELL JR., 90; CONSERVATIVE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lewis F. Powell Jr., whose tempered conservatism on the bench
made him a crucial swing vote during his 15 years as a Supreme
Court justice, died in his sleep from pneumonia Tuesday at his home
in Richmond, Va. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the respect shown by liberals and conservatives
alike, President Clinton Tuesday called Powell ``one of our most
thoughtful and consciencious justices,'' and said ``his opinions
were a model of balance and judiciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the greatest tribute to Justice Powell came four
years after he was named to the court. When President Gerald R.
Ford was looking to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of
Justice William O. Douglas, he confined his instructions to
Attorney General Edward Levi to a single sentence: ``Find me
another Lewis Powell.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a mark of just how quickly _ and thoroughly _ Justice
Powell had established a reputation for ability, diligence and
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Powell was named to the court by President Richard M.
Nixon and served as an associate justice from 1972 to 1987, a
tenure largely coinciding with that of Chief Justice Warren Burger.
The Burger Court marked a transitional period in US jurisprudence,
coming as it did between the judicial activism of the Warren Court
and the rightward shift of the Rehnquist Court. Lacking a dominant
judicial philosophy, the Burger Court was an opportune setting for
Justice Powell's centrism. Further enhancing his sway with his
colleagues was a personal manner of unfailing civility and
graciousness _ Justice Powell's ``humanizing influence,'' as
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor once termed it. Judicial historian
Bernard Schwartz has gone so far as to suggest that the Burger
Court might be more accurately known as ``the Powell Court,'' as
Justice Powell was ``probably its single most influential member.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Powell considered his most important opinion to be
University of California Regents v. Bakke. Bakke, the landmark 1978
ruling on the constitutionality of affirmative action, was perhaps
the court's most charged racial case since Brown v. Board of
Education, the 1954 decision ending school segregation. It was
Justice Powell who determined its outcome, an outcome exemplifying
his gift for compromise and moderation.
</P>
<P>
   Four justices voted to uphold, and four justices voted to
overturn a California Supreme Court ruling which had banned race as
a factor in admissions to all the state's schools and ordered the
admission of the plaintiff into medical school. (Allan Bakke was
white, and the school that had rejected him reserved 16 percent of
its spaces for minority applicants.)
</P>
<P>
   Justice Powell, in effect, sided with both. He voted to reverse
the quota _ but to affirm the overall principle of taking race into
account. ``Race or ethnic background may be deemed a `plus' in a
particular applicant's file,'' he wrote, ``yet it does not insulate
the individual from comparison with all other candidates for the
available seats.''
</P>
<P>
   That affirmative action should receive its constitutional
justification from an aristocratic Virginian who initially had
mixed feelings (at best) about the Brown ruling was but one of
several ironies attending the career of Lewis Franklin Powell Jr.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Suffolk, Va., on Sept. 19, 1907, the son of Lewis
Franklin Powell and Mary Lewis (Gwathmey) Powell. On his father's
side, Justice Powell was descended from one of the original
Jamestown colonists.
</P>
<P>
   He earned undergraduate and law degrees from Washington and Lee
University in Lexington, Va., and then spent a year getting a
master of laws degree at Harvard University. Among his teachers
there were future Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter and the
legendary Harvard Law School dean Roscoe Pound.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Powell returned to Richmond, where he had grown up and
would practice law for the next 40 years. During World War II, he
served in the US Army Air Force, rising to the rank of colonel.
Justice Powell worked as a US liaison officer with British
intelligence's top-secret Ultra project, which had decrypted German
codes. He was awarded the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star and the
French Croix de Guerre.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Justice Powell became a leading civic figure in
Richmond and Virginia. He served as chairman of the Colonial
Williamsburg Foundation, the Richmond School Board and Virginia
State Board of Education. In the latter two positions, he worked
behind the scenes to oppose the state's ``massive resistance
policy'' to desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Powell's firm, Hunton, Williams, Gay, Powell &AMP; Gibson,
was one of the region's most prestigious, and he used it as a
springboard to leadership in the legal profession. President
Johnson appointed him to the President's Commission on Law
Enforcement and the Administration of Justice, and he served as
president of the American Bar Association, the American Bar
Foundation, the American College of Trial Lawyers and as vice
president of the National Legal Aid and Defender Association.
</P>
<P>
   As both that last position and his role in desegregating
Virginia schools might have indicated, Justice Powell was not quite
the dyed-in-the-cotton Southern conservative Nixon might have
assumed. By 1969, Justice Powell had earned a national reputation
as a ``lawyer's lawyer,'' and it was only natural that Nixon should
turn to him when the Senate rejected the nomination of Judge
Clement Haynsworth to the court. Justice Powell refused, however,
citing his age and frail health.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, when Justice Hugo Black died, Nixon again
turned to Powell. Again Powell said no. Then, after finally saying
yes, he had second thoughts and tried to withdraw. It was too late.
Within hours Nixon was telling reporters, ``Some said he was told
old, but 10 years of him is worth 30 years of most.''
</P>
<P>
   The reluctant justice soon came to relish his position on the
nation's highest court. Yet the irony of the preface to his court
career was exceeded by that of its postscript. To succeed Justice
Powell, the epitome of consensus and comity, President Ronald
Reagan nominated Judge Robert H. Bork. Naming such an ideologically
charged candidate set off one of the most rancorous confirmation
battles in Senate history. It ended in Bork's rejection _ and
ushered in an era of politicization of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Such politicization stood far removed from what Justice Powell
stood for, and he lamented it. It was one of the few regrets he had
concerning the court. Two others were his having provided the
deciding vote in Bowers v. Hardwick, which in 1986 dismayed civil
libertarians by upholding a Georgia anti-sodomy law, and his
support of the death penalty. In 1991, he said that he now believed
that capital punishment should be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   Powell was hospitalized in 1991 for a fainting spell and
irregular heartbeat; he also had hip-replacement surgery that year.
A year earlier, he had said his health was holding up better than
he expected, but added, ``Let's face it, I've outlived my
generation. Most of the friends I have held dear through my life
are dead now.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked once to account for his spectacular success, Justice
Powell gave a characteristically modest reply: ``I worked hard,
some others didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell's wife, Josephine, died in 1996. He is survived by his
four children, two of whom are lawyers, nine grandchildren and one
great grandson.

 &HT;    BLACK STUDENTS STILL SCARCE AT MAJOR COLLEGES, STUDY FINDS
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite decades of desegregation and affirmative
action, black students continue to fill only a fraction of the
freshman classes at flagship universities in states that once
deliberately segregated black and and white students, according to
a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most states, there are still two systems'' of higher
education, said Claire V. Handley, co-author of ``Miles to Go: A
Report on Black Students and Postsecondary Education in the
South.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, produced by the Atlanta-based Southern Education
Foundation Inc., examines enrollment, family income and graduation
rates in 19 states that previously operated separate systems of
higher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to popular belief, the gap between blacks and whites
for opportunity and achievement is not being closed,'' said
foundation president Elridge W. McMillan. The report ``challenges
the belief that blacks are making real progress'' in higher
education, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 19 states, blacks made up an average of 20 percent of
the college-age population in 1996 and 17 percent of the first-year
students at all universities, including two-year colleges. At
flagship universities, however, blacks represented only 8.6 percent
of the freshman class in 1996, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditionally white universities remain predominantly
white,'' Handley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to the misinformation ... blacks do not have an
unfair advantage in admissions policies,'' said Norman C. Francis,
president of Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans and a
member of the advisory panel that reviewed the report.
</P>
<P>
   Francis said he is disturbed by the numbers of black students
who do not finish college after starting _ ``this is a devastating
loss of human and economic potential for this nation'' _ and
attributed much of the problem to money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial aid, or the lack thereof, continues to be a major
factor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report examined the average tuition of four-year, public
universities in the 19 states and found that tuition consumes a
higher percentage of the income of black families than white
families.

MEMORIES OF DIANA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A friend who recently returned from London reports
that our British cousins think our national obsession with Monica
Lewinsky and her pathetic sexual interlude with President Clinton
reflects a sorry case of collective sophomoric madness.
</P>
<P>
   Ha. So how do the British explain their own compulsion, as the
first anniversary of Princess Diana's death approaches, to pay
overwrought tribute to her and find exaggerated meaning in her
memory?
</P>
<P>
   During this entire week Great Britain is indulging in an orgy of
emotion with a rash of special events commemorating the life of
beautiful princess of Wales, who died in an automobile crash last
Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The public hysteria and blind adulation that immediately
followed Diana's death are now supplemented by a frenzied rush of
books, television specials, opinion polls, magazine articles,
tourist attractions and public pronouncements. Nexis, the American
computer research system, lists 243 stories about Diana since the
beginning of the month.
</P>
<P>
   This is in addition to the regular Diana stuff available, for a
price, all during the past year, _ magazine cover stories, charity
concerts, tourist gimmicks, small tubs of margarine with her photo
on them, the lot.
</P>
<P>
   Even the French have gotten into the act, scheduling a
candlelight vigil at the Paris site of the fatal car crash and
telling pollsters they want a street to be named after her.
</P>
<P>
   A French survey reported, in all seriousness, that Diana was the
woman who most deeply marked the 20th century, followed only by
Jacqueline Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe. The French apparently never
heard of Queen Elizabeth, Indira Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher, Eleanor
Roosevelt or Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Diana is as controversial in death as she was
in life, despite the flattering fascination with her complicated
personality, her charitable activities, her alienation from the
royal family and even her dresses. British newspapers that
conducted polls to try to assess the impact of her death produced
contradictory, inconclusive results.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by the tabloid Mirror found that 77 percent of women and
56 percent of men surveyed were ``still grieving'' for Diana.
Another poll said 52 percent of the people believe that she
inspired the country to become more spiritually aware and giving.
</P>
<P>
   But a poll for the Independent newspaper reported that 80
percent of those surveyed said her death had not permanently
affected them and that 53 percent did not want the anniversary to
be officially observed each year.
</P>
<P>
   According to a poll by the Mail on Sunday, 62 percent of those
surveyed said they would do nothing to commemorate her death and 50
percent said public grieving after the accident had gone overboard.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant development since her death appears to be a
softening of public attitudes toward Prince Charles and the rest of
the royal family. The message here for President Clinton may be
that it is unwise to react too hastily to predictions of doom. The
passage of time and a good public relations campaign, it seems,
lessen public pressure for radical political punishment for bad
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve months have certainly reduced the animosity the British
public felt toward the royals for their rude treatment of Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Before her death Charles was widely seen as a cold-hearted,
foolish adulterer who should never be king. There were even
whispers about getting rid of the monarchy altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But a new Sunday Times poll says 62 percent of those surveyed
now want Queen Elizabeth to remain on the throne for life, 58
percent think Charles is fit to be king and 57 percent say the
monarchy is ``more in touch with the people'' these days. Not total
adoration, but a big improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The real test of the royals' rehabilitation, however, is whether
Charles' longtime mistress Camilla Parker Bowles will become
socially acceptable. Shortly after Diana's death, 55 percent told
the pollsters they disapproved of the idea that Charles would marry
her. Now only 46 percent feel that way, while 42 percent say they
should stay together and publicly admit their relationship and 38
percent believe they should marry.
</P>
<P>
   This growing sense of forgiveness encouraged Charles not long
ago to introduce his elder son William at last to Parker Bowles.
The meeting reportedly went okay.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, she will never generate the excitement of the young
bride who married the most eligible bachelor in the world in
Westminster Abbey at a fairy-tale wedding before a television
audience of 8 million viewers. Diana's fame is singular.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean her reputation is secure. Lord Coggan, the
former archbishop of Canterbury, had the bad taste to attack her
last weekend as ``a false goddess'' with ``pretty loose morals.''
Two Sunday school teachers told their pupils that Diana was in hell
because of her sins. A charity-sponsored walk along the route of
her funeral cortege that had expected 15,000 paid participants last
Sunday was a bust. Only 300 people turned out, and the organizers
lost money.
</P>
<P>
   The first anniversary of her death will pass amid tribute and
turmoil. She will always be a commodity, good for sales and
publicity. But the sentimentality is already fading, and so will
the schmaltz. And then everyone will have to discover a new
goddess.

ILIE DEFEATS SQUILLARI, 6-4, 6-2 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Andrew Ilie isn't the hardest player to
recognize on a tennis court. He's the guy wearing the Air Jordans,
usually seen on a basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since his return to the ATP circuit last November, the
Australian's new attire and renewed skills have served him well.
Take Tuesday's first-round victory over Franco Squillari in the MFS
Pro Championships at Longwood Cricket Club.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-4, 6-2 score only begins to suggest Ilie's domination. His
overall court game was excellent, not surprising as he was once
ranked along with countrymate Mark Philippoussis as a junior.
</P>
<P>
   Now 22, Ilie thinks there is enough left in his game to compete
with the best. He has recovered from nagging back problems but
knows he has to prove himself again in the eyes of his peers. To
that end, he has played in about 25 tournaments, including
satellite events.
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday's victory, he is 14-8 on the ATP tour, his lone
tournament victory coming in May at Coral Springs, Fla., where he
breezed through four players and beat Davide Sanguinetti in the
final, 7-5, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Ilie made the third round of the French Open before losing, and
stops in Italy, Washington, Montreal, and Cincinnati reflect his
desire to reach the upper rankings. Since Jan. 19, when he reached
the third round of the Australian Open, Ilie's ranking has moved
from No. 282 to No. 51. Some think he could be a sleeper in the US
Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment,'' said Ilie, ``all the Aussies are playing
good. Pat Rafter has been unbelievable. Philippoussis has been
playing good himself and will probably do well at the US Open.
Right now, I'm ranked about six or seven in Australia. I feel like
I'm playing pretty good tennis. I'm looking forward to the US Open,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Jordans worn by Ilie are low cut and resemble shoes worn
by a boxer or wrestler. ``But they're lighter than tennis shoes and
help my movement,'' said Ilie. ``The only problem I have is that
they're sold out a lot and hard to find.''
</P>
<P>
   His shoes are just another reflection of Ilie's ability to put a
little fun in his game. He is superstitious, romances the crowd,
fumes occasionally at umpires, and wears a red bandanna under his
cap.
</P>
<P>
   His reward for winning Tuesdayis a second-round date with No. 3
seed Cedric Pioline.
</P>
<P>
   Ilie, who was born in Romania, has done things a little
differently during most of his brief career. He first caught the
attention of Australian tennis officials in his country's 1994
Junior Open, losing in the finals. Later that year, he won the
Canada and US junior opens and finished No. 8 in the world rankings
at the age of 17.
</P>
<P>
   But then his career took a twist, partially because of his
success. After a Davis Cup apprenticeship in South Africa, Ilie
reportedly went AWOL on a tour sponsored by the Australian
Institute of Sport. According to a May 29 report in the Melbourne
Age, Ilie flew to Bucharest in chase of a sponsorship deal. He had
dealings with a Romanian businessman and he was seen at the
Austrian training camp of coach Gunther Bosch. Ilie appeared on the
verge of a major career change.
</P>
<P>
   But the change was not what he thought. When Ilie returned home
at the end of the 1995 season, it was without promised financial
backing of those who had urged him to jump. Once back, he had
fences to mend with Tennis Australia, and apparently has done so in
recent months. His life because even more complicated by a back
problem in 1996 that took him out of circulation for 18 months.
Now, he'd like a shot at representing Australia in the Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was in 1995,'' said Ilie in a recent article,
``was that people got the wrong idea. They sort of waiting for me
to not feel at home. The Romanians didn't like me because I'm
Australian. The Australians tried to pull the Romanian thing on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to cool down. I'm Australian and more than happy to
play for Australia, if I'm needed. But that should be the end of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   How bad can he be? He is fifth in the ATP rankings among
Australians behind Patrick Rafter (3), Philippoussis (21), Richard
Fromberg (30), Jason Stoltenberg (38).
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're all good players,'' said Ilie. ``But I think I
can hold my own.''

BOEING BYPASSED AS BRITISH AIR GIVES BIG CONTRACT TO AIRBUS
INDUSTRIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a setback to Boeing Co., British Airways awarded the European
aircraft consortium Airbus Industrie a major contract Tuesday,
ordering as many as 188 of its short-haul, single-aisle jets, worth
$8.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The order for the planes, which will be outfitted with engines
built by a consortium headed by the Rolls-Royce aviation company of
Britain, is expected to assure jobs for 38,000 people at factories
of Rolls-Royce and British Aerospace, one of the four partners in
the Airbus group.
</P>
<P>
   Still, until now, British Airways, Europe's largest airline, had
relied on Boeing as its supplier. As it ordered the Airbus planes
Tuesday, the carrier announced that it would purchase 16 new Boeing
777-200 jets, with an option for 16 more, at a total list price of
$4.8 billion. The twin-engine planes have a 256-seat capacity. But
British Air said it was canceling previous orders for 5 of 15
larger and more expensive Boeing 747-400s, as well as options to
buy a further seven 747s.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to put the best face on the matter, Ron Woodard,
president of Boeing's commercial airplane group, praised British
Airways as a ``longtime valued Boeing customer and our largest
customer outside the United States.'' He added that Boeing was
delighted that the carrier chose the 777 to meet ``increasing
demand they are experiencing for frequent point-to-point service in
the long-haul market.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, British Air executives said they were seeking
bids from both Airbus and Boeing, for short-haul jets on domestic
British and European routes, to replace Boeing 737s now in service,
as well as for long-haul aircraft on intercontinental routes.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus order was announced at a news conference in Toulouse,
France, the Airbus headquarters, that was attended by British Prime
Minister Tony Blair. Monday, managers at one of the companies had
suggested the Airbus order would be larger than it turned out to
be, with up to 259 firm orders and options.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, however, British Airways is ordering 39 Airbus A319s,
carrying as many as 126 passengers, and 20 A320s, with up to 156
passengers. It has options to order an additional 129 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   By placing the order with Airbus and choosing Rolls-Royce
engines, British Airways insures that much of the work will be done
in Britain. Parts of the new A320 planes, like the wings, are built
by British Aerospace, which holds a 20 percent stake in Airbus.
Also, Rolls-Royce has a one-third stake in International Aero
Engines, the jet engine maker that also includes Pratt &AMP; Whitney
and MTU Motoren- und Turbinen-Union of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways chief executive Robert Ayling insisted that the
choice of Airbus was made on the basis of cost alone. The offer by
Airbus and Rolls-Royce, he said at the news conference, ``was a
better value offer than the competitive offer. If it had not been,
we would not be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayling said Boeing would remain British Airways' sole provider
of long-haul planes. The airline now flies 18 of the twin-engine
777s, equipped with General Electric engines, and the new orders
signaled a clear shift away from the older, larger 747s.

OPPOSITION TO SCHOOL VOUCHERS SOFTENING, POLL FINDS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Public opposition to taxpayer support for private and religious
schooling, which was clear-cut several years ago, is softening,
with Americans closely divided on the use of vouchers to pay
tuition at private or church-sponsored schools, according to a poll
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A small majority of Americans now favor allowing parents to send
their children to any public, private or church-related school if
government pays all or part of the tuition, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted in June by the Gallup Organization for Phi
Delta Kappa, a professional association of educators, found that 51
percent favored such support and 45 percent opposed it, a reversal
of opinion since 1996, when 43 percent favored it and 54 percent
opposed it. In 1997 the results were almost evenly divided, 49
percent in favor and 48 percent opposed. The poll has a margin of
sampling error of about four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the poll began addressing the issue, in
1993, the word ``vouchers'' was introduced into the questions to
reflect the growing prominence of the idea of using
government-issued notes to pay for tuition at private or
church-sponsored schools.
</P>
<P>
   When asked specifically about vouchers to pay for all of the
tuition, 48 percent were in favor and 46 percent opposed. When
asked about partial tuition, the public supported the idea, 52
percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There has been considerable political and legal controversy over
the use of vouchers, especially in church-related schools, and the
issue may well be headed for the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians and teachers unions, in particular, have
opposed the use of vouchers in religious schools, saying it
violates the separation of church and state and will deprive the
public school system of an essential part.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of voucher plans say public schools will benefit from
the competition, which will also serve inner-city students by
offering them schools with higher standards.

 &HT;    CLINTON POLLING POINTS TO UNSETTLED PUBLIC
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, buoyed by a good economy but
weighed down by scandal, is testing the skills of pollsters. Does
the public love him or love him not?
</P>
<P>
   In perplexing results from surveys taken by ABC News since
Clinton admitted to having an improper relationship with a former
White House intern, the president's favorable ratings sagged to 39
percent on Aug. 19, roared back to 56 percent two days later, and
then leveled off at 45 percent by last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   What gives?
</P>
<P>
   The order of questions asked during the surveys made the
difference, ABC pollster Gary Langer said in an interview after the
erratic numbers were featured in the electronic daily newsletter,
The Hotline.
</P>
<P>
   Langer said that when poll takers ask about Clinton's
professional job performance first, the answers tend to be
positive, leading to higher ratings on the more general
``favorable'' rating, as well. But if the scandal was mentioned
first, the favorable rating dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, there's not a huge difference between job
performance and favorable ratings, so it doesn't much matter,''
Langer said. ``But in this unique case of President Clinton today,
there is an enormous difference between the two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean the polls are wacky or contradictory,'' said
Langer, who instead attributed the results to the public's complex
view of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is looking at two Bill Clintons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That view is echoed by other public opinion experts. ``More than
usual, subtle changes in the questions and the order of questions
may have more of an impact'' on survey results, said Frank Newport,
editor in chief at the Gallup Poll. ``People have complex portraits
of Bill Clinton in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Gallup organization continues to track Clinton's
support, as it has other presidents, by asking first the job
performance question, followed by the more general favorability
question. The results has yielded consistent and relatively high
favorable ratings of between 50 and 53 percent for the president
since mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   But the seesaw results in the ABC poll could be a more accurate
depiction of the unsettled public perception of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it tells me is that the public has not given its final
word on this topic,'' said Darrell West, political science
professor and polling expert at Brown University, ``It just means
that the game is going to go on until we actually get all of the
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Added West: ``The Starr report (expected next month from
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr) is the big shoe waiting to fall,
and when that comes out, it probably will have a major effect on
public opinion, just because it will provide a level of detail that
we haven't heard yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were sitting in the White House, I'd be very nervous
about these surveys and their suggestion of a possible downside in
the public reaction as the public learns more.''

   LONDON _ Far from uniting Britain, responses to the death of
Diana, Princess of Wales, seem to have divided us, especially along
the traditional battle lines of sex and class.
</P>
<P>
   Women are more likely than men to say that her death last August
``changed the way they think about life,'' with 21 percent saying
it had, compared with only 14 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
   Women are also more likely than men to think that the royal
family has become ``more in touch with the people'' as a result of
Diana's death, with 48 percent of women saying so as opposed to 40
percent of men.
</P>
<P>
   Again, class differences are marked, with middle-class
respondents more supportive of the royal family while the
working-classes are more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas 50 percent of middle-class respondents said the monarchy
was ``more in touch,'' 6 percent said ``less in touch,'' only 40
percent of the working-classes said ``more'' and 10 percent said
``less.''
</P>
<P>
   Women and men also differ in their attitudes to reform of the
monarchy and the effect of Diana's death on the media.
</P>
<P>
   While more men think modernization of the monarchy should be
``speeded up'' (42 percent), than think the present pace of reform
is ``about right'' (41 percent), women tend to be happy with the
present speed of change _ supported by 47 percent against 37
percent who want faster reform.
</P>
<P>
   Men are also more cynical about journalists, with only 17
percent thinking the media has showed ``more respect'' for the
privacy of the famous since Diana's death, against 25 percent of
women. &QL;

   The brutal Romanian dictator  &UR; Nicolae Ceausescu &LR;  and his wife,
the fur-loving &UR; Elena &LR; , were executed by unfriendly citizens in
1989, but the palaces and villas in which they lived still have
that special glow. Come next spring, the government of Romania will
offer tourists the chance to stay chez Ceausescu for $3,000 to
$4,000 a night.
</P>

   Sojourns will include the opportunity to sleep in a bed once
occupied by Mr. Big and his Mrs., and to engage in such frolics as
hunting or swimming in their mosaic-lined pool.

   Nineteen teenage members of the Crossroads Touring Company of

``A Chorus Line'' in drug rehab centers, retirement homes, recovery
facilities and children's centers, all clients of Bread &AMP; Roses.
</P>

an individualized concert, he lifted the lid off the grand and gave
a gala performance of selections by Chopin and other classical
composers.

   &UR; HOW TO WRITE A SONG &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; Jimmy Webb &LR; 's forthcoming book, ``Tunesmith,'' the
songwriter describes the process of choosing ``a title or a hook
line,'' in which he looks for a ``key word that offers the greatest
number of rhyming possibilities.'' In the course of writing ``Just
for Now,'' he says, in an excerpt published in Musician magazine,
he considered about 44 rhymes, including:
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow (``usable, but not a very attractive word and definitely
overused''); brow (``nobody really says `brow' anymore, they say
`forehead' ''); dhow (``arcane, perhaps might find a home in
special material''); disallow (``smacks of the IRS''); disavow
(``legalese''); frau (``she's not German''); Hangkow (``in
China''); hoosegow (``it's not a Western either''); plough, plow
(``a rough word, distinctly out of place in a romantic song'');
pow-wow (``unusable''); slough (``a mass of dead tissue separating
from an ulcer''); vow (``Dudley Do-Right, smells moldy'').
</P>
<P>
   When he realized that only five were usable, he decided to call
the song ``Just for Today,'' which had 258 rhyming possibilities.

for Now,'' he says, in an excerpt published in Musician magazine,
he considered about 44 rhymes, including:
</P>

   Anyhow (``usable, but not a very attractive word and definitely
overused''); brow (``nobody really says `brow' anymore, they say
`forehead' ''); dhow (``arcane, perhaps might find a home in
special material''); disallow (``smacks of the IRS''); disavow
(``legalese''); frau (``she's not German''); Hangkow (``in
China''); hoosegow (``it's not a Western either''); plough, plow
(``a rough word, distinctly out of place in a romantic song'');
pow-wow (``unusable''); slough (``a mass of dead tissue separating
from an ulcer''); vow (``Dudley Do-Right, smells moldy'').
</P>
<P>
   When he realized that only five were usable, he decided to call
the song ``Just for Today,'' which had 258 rhyming possibilities.

   LONDON _ Few people think Princess Diana's death a year ago had
a lasting effect either on themselves or on the nation as a whole,
according to a Harris poll for The Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Only one in seven, 14 percent, thinks Britain is a ``better
country'' as a result of her death. This is twice as many as the 7
percent who think Britain is a ``worse country.'' The majority, 75
percent, think the nation is ``no different.''
</P>
<P>
   On a personal level, only 17 percent said Diana's death, a year
ago next Monday, had ``changed the way I think about life,''
whereas 80 percent said it had not changed them.
</P>
<P>
   The poll suggests, meanwhile, that people are evenly divided on
whether Diana's death has had any effect on ``The Firm'' with which
she saw herself at war while she was alive: 44 percent think the
royal family is ``more in touch with the people'' as a result of
her death, while 44 percent think it has made no difference. Eight
percent think the royal family is ``less in touch'' as a result.
</P>
<P>
   People are also divided over whether Prince Charles' plans to
modernize the monarchy go far enough. The ``Way Ahead'' group of
senior royals is working on a series of reforms.
</P>
<P>
   While 44 percent said the ``pace of reforms of the monarchy''
was ``about right,'' nearly as many, 39 percent, thought it should
be ``speeded up.''
</P>
<P>
   People also doubt whether Diana's death had any effect on the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Research interviewed 1,064 people face-to-face in their
homes between Aug. 7 and 11 and weighted the results to match the
profile of the adult population. &QL;

<P>
   She had ``pretty loose morals'' and has become a ``false
goddess,'' says the former archbishop of Canterbury. Up to a point,
Lord Coggan. It is not for a secular newspaper to lecture the
retired boss of the Church of England on theology, but isn't he
missing something important about the Christian message?
</P>
<P>
   Diana, Princess of Wales, was never going to qualify as a saint
in the colloquial sense _ someone whose personal morals are above
reproach _ but did Jesus not find the spirit of love and
forgiveness in all sorts of people?
</P>
<P>
   It seems a bit rich, too, for a leading churchman to speak ill
of the dead, when it could be argued that Diana communicated the
message of compassion more effectively than the established church
has for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is too much idolatry about, and we should be
clear about where it comes from and who is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The build-up to the anniversary of her fatal car crash in Paris
has begun embarrassingly early. Many Sunday newspapers Sunday
contained full-color commemorative supplements. Newsnight had its
anniversary discussion long ago, and the television schedules are
already packed with Dianaphernalia. Yet there is still nearly a
week to go to Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   It is too easy to blame the media as if it were a single
corporate conspiracy. There are, after all, the commemorative plate
makers, margarine manufacturers and even the prime minister himself
seeking to cash in on the cult of Diana.
</P>
<P>
   But primary responsibility for stoking the emotional overkill
must lie with the press and broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   We hope that this week's Independent/ Harris opinion poll on the
subject of Diana will help wind down rather than contribute to this
process. It suggests that the British public are healthily downbeat
about her legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional defense of media obsessions is that readers and
viewers demand them; not in this case, according to our survey.
About two-fifths of the population think the anniversary of Diana's
death should be ``specially marked'' in some way, but a majority,
53 percent, disagree.
</P>
<P>
   As for her legacy itself, large majorities say that her death _
and people's response to it _ has not changed us, either as a
country or as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, for a minority her death was highly significant. For
them, her life stood as a shining example of how they could be more
compassionate themselves, and her death offered the nation the
chance to rededicate itself to caring values.
</P>
<P>
   An even smaller minority reacted violently against what they saw
as the mawkishness of public sentiment. But for most people the
Princess's death was less highly charged, beyond the usual
intimation of mortality: devastating for her sons, bleakly
beneficial to her former husband's campaign to restore his
miserable public standing, and a valuable chance to consider the
good causes that she espoused.
</P>
<P>
   She was, sadly, never the ``queen of people's hearts'' to which
she aspired, and she was only the ``people's princess'' in the
sense that she stood against those aspects of the monarchy that
most people want reformed: the stuffiness, the protocol and the
anti-democratic pretensions.
</P>
<P>
   The public display of emotion that followed her death was
acclaimed as a touchy-feely revolution in national sensibility,
which it was not.
</P>
<P>
   There have been near-universal displays of public grief before,
but the form of this mourning was different from, for example, the
hundreds of thousands filing past Winston Churchill's coffin.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers and weeping in public were, however, less her legacy
than a marker of trends underway for some time, especially that of
the growing emotional literacy of men.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next week, then, let us hope we can keep in perspective
what is valuable about Diana's legacy, while all around the media
lose their heads. &QL;

BLAIR TO RECALL PARLIAMENT TO BEEF UP ANTI-TERROR LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Prime Minister Tony Blair announced Tuesday that he was
calling Parliament back into session from its summer recess next
week to toughen anti-terrorism laws.
</P>
<P>
   Similar measures are being contemplated by the Irish Republic
after the bombing in Omagh, in the British province of Northern
Ireland, that took 28 lives and wounded 220 people.
</P>
<P>
   Blair made the widely expected announcement when he visited
Omagh on Tuesday. British officials said he might ask Parliament
either to tighten existing laws or to seek ``draconian''
legislation to obtain convictions against members of banned
terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Conservative opposition, William Hague, said
he expected Parliament to convene next Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The car bombing in Omagh, the deadliest attack in 29 years of
conflict over Northern Ireland, has brought calls across both
Ireland and Britain for tougher measures against political
violence. The British and Irish governments appear to be moving in
sync to reassure the public that they are serious in their resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Republic's Prime Minister Bertie Ahern has already
announced plans to tighten anti-terrorism legislation and has
recalled the Irish Parliament for next week to consider the
measures.
</P>
<P>
   In Omagh om Tuesday, Blair found the town still in shock 10 days
after a 500-pound car bomb tore apart a commercial street, killing
and wounding weekend shoppers. He met relatives of the victims and
medical personnel who cared for them. His next stop was Belfast, to
meet with leaders of Northern Ireland's main political parties.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last week Blair, who was vacationing in France, signified his
intent by speaking of increased cooperation with the Irish
government so that there would be little opportunity for violent
groups to operate in either country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will bring in similar measures to those proposed by the
Irish government, so we will then have the toughest anti-terrorist
measures for the whole of the island of Ireland, the Republic and
Northern Ireland, that we have ever seen,'' Blair said last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While Blair did not elaborate, the measures are likely to
include a provision for reinstating ``internment'' _ the power to
hold terrorism suspects for several days without bringing charges.
He is also expected to propose tightening bail conditions for those
accused of crimes and narrowing the scope of their right to silence
under questioning.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman in Blair's office confirmed Tuesday that the
objective of any new laws would be to take action against any
terror organizations and their members before they act.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensitive issue expected to be on the agenda would be
internment. The Blair government abolished internment last year,
and Catholics fear the measure could be used arbitrarily to round
up political activists as well as potential terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the British Parliament was recalled was in 1990,
when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher obtained its agreement to
dispatch British forces to the Persian Gulf after Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait. Parliament has been recalled from summer recess 14 times
since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Whether new laws will in fact be necessary is not clear. Several
British officials said last week that laws to toughen government
measures were already largely in place, needing only refinements in
their application. Officials emphasized, however, that Britain
would do whatever was necessary to enable security forces to act
quickly and decisively.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread support was expected for any new measures enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Mackay, who oversees the Northern Ireland policies of the
opposition Conservatives, said Monday that his party would fully
cooperate to bring ``evil psychopaths'' to justice and to insure
swift passage of measures to crack down on terrorist activities.
``I believe our security forces must be able to tackle terrorism
with every tool available,'' Mackay said .
</P>
<P>
   Last week Blair's Northern Ireland minister, Paul Murphy, said
Britain was working hand in hand with Ireland to track down those
responsible for the Omagh attack and to insure that other groups
could be stopped before they act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of all this, of course,'' he said, ``is to catch
these people, to insure they are caught as quickly as possible,
that they are arrested, that they are convicted and put into
prison.''

ARTS ABROAD: A SPIRIT LIVES ON, AS MAGICAL MASKS GUARD INDIAN
TRADITIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ The European settlers who came to
this region more than a century ago struck up an oddly conflicted
relationship with the native peoples. They suppressed what they saw
as the Indians' backward religious beliefs, but eagerly embraced
the most visible expression of their intensely spiritual culture,
the esthetically powerful masks used in many ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   From the time Capt. James Cook made his famous voyage here in
the 18th century and well into this century, the graphically
sophisticated ceremonial masks of the Pacific Northwest Coast
Indians have been highly prized in the art world, and purchased by
connoisseurs and museums from Canada to Vienna and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The collecting itself has had a fascinating legacy, as a
striking new exhibition here at the Vancouver Art Gallery
demonstrates. While it commercialized this once-sacred art as early
as the 1820s, transforming it into an export industry, it also did
much to preserve the mask-making tradition _ and, by extension, the
vivid imagery of the Indians' spiritual world _ while some other
elements of the native culture withered.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, ``Down From the Shimmering Sky: Masks of the
Northwest Coast,'' a huge compilation of pieces from collections in
North America and Europe that runs through Oct. 12, is one of the
most heavily attended shows ever at the Vancouver Art Gallery, the
principal public art museum of Western Canada. It is scheduled to
travel next year to museums in Portland, Ore., and Tulsa, Okla.
Negotiations are under way as well for a show at the end of 1999 at
the National Museum of the American Indian in New York, which owns
some of the masks in the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The 179 painted masks on display, representing everything from
killer whales and bears to supernatural beings, the sun and
ancestors, are penetrating and at times emotionally intense
representations of the spiritual world of the Northwest Coast
Indians. But the show is noteworthy as well because it places
150-year-old masterpieces side by side with contemporary masks,
underscoring the sense of an artistic continuum rather than the
melancholy of a lost tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Joseph, a hereditary chief of the Kwakwaka'wakw tribe and
one of the show's curators, emphasized the significance of
exhibiting the masks in the Vancouver, a gallery of the Canadian
establishment normally devoted to contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made a statement about our history and our place here,''
Joseph said. ``These masks continue to have meaning and continue to
have a purpose for our communities, and I think that comes across
here very strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   The show has helped open up some of the innermost recesses of
Indian culture to the world, an achievement that has stirred some
controversy within the native communities of British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The opening ceremony for the exhibition last month in the court
in front of the gallery, for example, included a dance that had
previously been performed only on ceremonial occasions before an
Indian audience. Some of the masks in the show, particularly those
of mythical cannibal beings, are regarded as so sacred by some
Indians of the region _ tribes like the Haida, Nuxalk, Tsimshian,
Tlingit and Heiltsuk _ that they argue they should not be put on
public display at all.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph acknowledged the dissent, but said the show served the
important goals of building understanding of Indian culture as it
tries to modernize and function alongside society's mainstream and
of fostering pride within the Indian communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a little boy, we got together with the old chief
and closed the door and let no outsiders in the Big House,'' said
Joseph. ``No cameras, no recorders. But those doors have opened
somewhat to outsiders, as long as they are respectful.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``How will people respect us if we don't tell them
about who we are?''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Macnair, another of the show's curators, said the
exhibition was important partly because it returns to their
homeland many masks that were taken away by Indian agents,
collectors and dealers more than a century ago. An enormous amount
of research went into locating and identifying important masks,
including some taken away by Captain Cook and some that were
captured in photographs before they were whisked away to
collections elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a homecoming, Macnair said, strengthened the show
and underscored the sense of a strong and living tradition with
deep roots in the Indian imagination and local trade.
</P>
<P>
   One result of the research done for the show is that it includes
a number of examples of what became known as Jenna Cass masks,
among the first known examples believed to have been carved
specifically for sale. Previously the masks had been made for use
in the dance dramas that are a critical part of the potlatch, a
huge ceremony that is a central part of Northwest Coast Indian
society and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Macnair said that the name used by the Europeans, Jenna Cass,
was probably a vulgarization of Djilakons, the Indian term for the
god on whom the mask is modeled. One of the earliest such examples,
a handsome mask painted in blue and red, was made before 1828.
</P>
<P>
   Later Europeans were fascinated by the native women's practice
of wearing a wooden disk, or labret, inserted into a slot cut into
the lower lip. So Indian artisans began to carve masks in which the
figures wore labrets, apparently to make their masks more
marketable.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some tribes, the art had just about faded away, but then
they started making masks again, around 1970 or so, when they
realized how much money could be made,'' said Macnair. ``The
commercial tradition bridged the gap.''
</P>
<P>
   The artistry can be stunning. Carved mostly from cedar, the
masks tend to be roughly realistic, with heavy eyebrows, open
mouths and open eyes. Most were painted with dynamic geometric
patterns in red, blue, turquoise and black.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more powerful exhibits are the transformation masks,
in which folding parts open up to reveal a different character or
being within another. In one example, on loan from a collection in
Stuttgart, a bird opens up into the sun in a sort of panorama.
</P>
<P>
   The mask used as the symbol for the exhibition, on loan from the
American Museum of Natural History in New York, is also a
representation of the sun, a large circular image highlighted with
vermilion paint and surrounded by a pattern of hand prints.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the masks were meant to be worn in dances that were
``owned'' by specific families or clans and that could only be
performed with the masks.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition includes some photographs from the 1940s of
dances held out of sight of the authorities in which Joseph
appears, as just a boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potlatch is our central constitution. It emphasizes our
ties to the spirit world,'' Joseph said. ``They had to be done
underground for years. The only thing that kept us really strong
for a while was our art. It maintained a focus for us.''

FIVE CHARGED WITH ORGANIZED CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IN HAM SCAM  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TERRY KLIEWER 
Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRENHAM, Texas _ This little piggy went to market, or at least
he was supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   But a certain piggy shown at the Washington County fairgrounds
earlier this year never quite made it to market. And therein lies a
twisty tale of swine crime, according to a county grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Charles Sebesta says the grand jury in Brenham
charged five people with third-degree organized criminal activity
after their scheme to beat statewide livestock exhibition rules
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Brenham, a city of 14,000, is about 75 miles northwest of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Freed on bonds Tuesday after being charged in the ham scam are
Cammy Jean Cornelius, 17, a high school senior from Agua Dulce, a
small town west of Corpus Christi, and her father, Scott Warren
Cornelius, 51, of the same address.
</P>
<P>
   Also charged are Hollis Dean Harris, 33, a Cornelius relative
from Friona, in the Panhandle west of Amarillo; Randy Ray Campbell,
46, also from Friona; and Jay Lynn McCormick, 20, a college student
in Canyon, south of Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Corneliuses, they posted $10,000 bonds, Sebesta said. A
third-degree felony is punishable by two to 10 years in prison and
a fine of up to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say the teen-ager showed a barrow, a castrated
pig, here in February in the annual swine ``sift'' for the Houston
Livestock Show and Rodeo, but it wound up one of 2,900 animals not
chosen for the big show. The Houston event is one of the largest
livestock shows and rodeos in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Houston show rules call for the also-rans to be taken by the
official slaughter contractor to a local stockyard for sorting and,
shortly thereafter, a quick final trip to the bacon factory.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say the contractor bought the hogs at a set
per-pound price somewhere below $100 each and hauled them away, but
that McCormick and Campbell went to the stockyard pens, found the
Cornelius' animal and stole it back.
</P>
<P>
   Sebesta said the hog was the property of the contractor, who had
paid for it, and its theft is the offense central to the case.
</P>
<P>
   He said the elaborate scheme also included multiple drivers and
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   According to investigators, McCormick and Campbell turned the
stolen hog over to Harris, who hauled it to Victoria, where another
man, who wasn't charged, took over for transport back home to Agua
Dulce.
</P>
<P>
   Sebesta said the fugitive hog then was shown two weeks later by
Cammy Jean Cornelius at a San Angelo livestock show, where it
claimed a blue ribbon as grand champion and was sold again, this
time for $4,000. It has since been butchered.
</P>
<P>
   Sebesta said rumors about irregularities in the Cornelius entry
were circulating at the San Angelo show and raised officials'
suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the blue ribbon might have been the worst thing that
could've happened,'' Sebesta observed.
</P>
<P>
   Judges uncovered the alleged ruse by checking registration
numbers required by major Texas shows to be tattooed on the ears of
swine entries.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Eric Perkins of Corpus Christi, who represents the
Corneliuses, said: ``It's our position that no crime was committed
_ or if there was a crime, my clients were unaware of it.'' He
declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, a cousin to Cammy Jean Cornelius, teaches high school
agricultural science in Friona, according to investigators. He,
McCormick and Campbell are acquainted from livestock-related
dealings in the Panhandle, Sebesta said.

   CAMPAIGN-RICK-WHITE (Seattle) Facing opponents on the left and
the right, fallout from his highly-publicized divorce and the
permanent uncertainty attached to his swing district, Rick White is
anxiously trying to put together a coalition that will send him
back to D.C. for a third term. His people have quietly been trying
to shore up his right flank against the Bruce Craswell threat,
recruiting Ellen Craswell's precinct leaders to his team and
persuading Steve Largent, whose pro-life credentials are impeccable
and who cut an ad for Craswell in 96, to campaign for White (he has
already sent a letter touting White's anti-gay, anti-abortion
record and plans to appear in person in October). And White goes on
TV this weekend with ads aimed at the general public, even as he is
predicting that he will lose to Jay Inslee in the primary but
recoup by the general.

CLINTON, INTERRUPTING VACATION, TO SPEAK ON SCHOOL SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ President Clinton, interrupting his summer
vacation once again, plans to venture off Martha's Vineyard
tomorrow and travel to Worcester, where he will deliver a speech on
school safety at an event designed to restore a presidential aura
to a president who has appeared shamed since his Monica Lewinsky
confession.
</P>
<P>
   The hastily planned morning trip will mark Clinton's first
significant public appearance since the Aug. 17 address in which he
admitted an inappopriate relationship with Lewinsky, the former
White House intern, and lashed back at independent counsel Kenneth
Starr. The president can reasonably expect to bask in partisan
warmth in Worcester, a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans
by nearly four to one.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was cobbled together so quickly that by late Tuesday
afternoon, White House aides did not know the site or the time of
the event, though spokesman Barry Toiv did say it would be
``important to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   In private, White House officials believed the event could be
crucial to restoring a sense of dignity to Clinton, who has become
the punchline of lewd jokes and the object of some disappointment
and disgust for the last nine days. The officials also wanted to
allow Clinton to shake hands and speak to an admiring public _ a
tonic to him in his most beleaguered times.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Clinton aides said they were responding to a
longstanding invitation to speak in the district from freshmen
Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern, who is involved in a reelection
campaign against Republican state Sen. Matthew Amorello.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern, in a telephone interview Tuesday, said the residents
of his congressional district were eager to talk about issues
rather than the president's adulterous ways, and he predicted they
would ``welcome him with open arms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people give him high marks for job performance because
they agree with the policies he is advocating,'' said McGovern.
``People care deeply about job security and Medicare and education.
I've been traveling around my district from Princeton to Dartmouth,
and I hear the same thing from Republicans and Democrats: Enough is
enough. Let's get on to the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But asked his assessment of Clinton's speech, McGovern replied,
``People don't condone his behavior. They are disappointed and I
was disappointed. But we have to decide if we are going to continue
to dwell on this or talk about other issues. At least people should
call a moratorium on this until Ken Starr issues his report.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his senior advisers seem to agree heartily with that
sentiment. While at least one television network briefly broadcast
a report this week that Clinton might give a second address on the
Lewinsky relationship with an explicit public apology that was
lacking in his first speech, aides have adamantly disputed that
notion, saying Clinton will not likely raise the issue or respond
to questions for at least the remainder of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``No plans,'' Toiv said in response to a question on whether
another address was anticipated. He added: ``We all assume that he
will be getting questions about this in the future, and presumably
he will answer them.''
</P>
<P>
   As poll numbers show the public's trust in Clinton at a
remarkable low, the president set sail Tuesday with former CBS News
anchorman and Vineyard summer resident Walter Cronkite, who, in his
broadcast prime, was often called the most trusted man in America.
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite, his wife Betsy, his grandson, Clinton, Mrs. Clinton
and Chelsea Clinton sailed out of Edgartown Harbor Tuesday
afternoon on Cronkite's majestic ketch, the Wyntje, as residents
and tourists lining the shore offered their applause. It marked the
first time during the vacation that the entire first family has
been seen together in public.
</P>
<P>
   As the boat motored through the harbor, Cronkite stood at the
helm beside Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea. Clinton, wearing a blue polo
shirt and sunglasses, stood in the back of the boat, alone, waving
at the gathered crowd.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton relaxed, his aides seemed to be scrambling to put
together his off-island policy event. Quizzed on the specifics of
the site and the speech, Toiv told reporters, ``I don't have those
details. It's two days away. That's a long time for us, for
planning.''
</P>
<P>
   At the event, Clinton will likely be met by a supportive crowd.
He won the Third Congressional District overwhelmingly in 1996,
garnering 60 percent of the vote compared to 29 percent for
Republican Bob Dole and 9 percent for billionaire businessman Ross
Perot. Worcester itself has 37,643 Democrats in 1996, compared to
9,646 Republicans and 29,307 independents.
</P>
<P>
   One possible caveat to the plans: Storm warnings emanating from
Hurricane Bonnie, which could follow a track up the eastern
seaboard and impair Clinton's ability to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter Tuesday if the White House might change the
speech subject from school safety to storm safety, Toiv responded:
``We're flexible.''

RUSSIAN RUBLE SHEDS 10 PERCENT OF ITS VALUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Russian ruble suffered its steepest plunge Tuesday in nearly
four years, shedding 10 percent of its value against the US dollar
and defying the new government's efforts to stave off a burgeoning
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The decline intensifies Moscow's woes, which acquired a
political dimension over the weekend when President Boris N.
Yeltsin unexpectedly reshuffled his reformist cabinet for the
second time in five months and reinstalled Victor S. Chernomyrdin,
a powerful Soviet-era manager, as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The slide brings the battered currency precipitously close to
the lower part of its new trading range, set last week when Moscow
effectively devalued the ruble by 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The drop has also spilled over to Russia's largely insolvent
banking sector. In a sign that banks may finally undergo a
long-needed shakeout, three rivals _ Uneximbank, Menatep, and Most
Bank _ said they would merge to shore up their limited cash.
</P>
<P>
   On the debt front, Chernomyrdin and Yeltsin signed an
anxiously-awaited deal restructuring $40 billion in defaulted
government paper, a quarter of it owned by foreigners. The
agreement sent the Russian Trading System benchmark stock index up
2.3 percent to close at 88.38. Russia's once high-flying stock
market has lost 80 percent of its value so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is battling some its its most serious troubles since the
1991 Soviet collapse. Asia's problems and low world oil prices have
scared investors away and sliced into much-needed hard-currency
export earnings. At home, ailing factories locked in a cycle of
barter and nonpayments have become what some economists
disparagingly term a ``virtual economy.'' The ruble, stable for
nearly four years until recently, has shed nearly one quarter of
its value since Moscow devalued it Aug. 17 in a bid to shore up its
finances.
</P>
<P>
   The events have set alarms ringing among inflation-fearing
citizens. Analysts say Russia's financial quandary is not likely to
be resolved soon.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who visits Moscow next week for a summit with
Kremlin leaders, telephoned Yeltsin to urge him to stick to
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruble slide came after the Central Bank lowered its
minimum reserves requirement for the country's 1,600 commercial
banks. The move sent legions of bankers with freed-up rubles into
the marketplace in search of hard currency, pressuring the ruble
down to 7.86 per US dollar on the local interbank currency exchange
from 7.14. At exchange kiosks across the city, the currency fell as
low as 8.3 to the dollar, Moscow analysts said _ close to its floor
of 9.5.
</P>
<P>
   The drop was the biggest since October 1994, when the ruble lost
more than one quarter of its value as a liquidity crisis, fuelled
by inept Central Bank policies, hit commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's turbulence, coming only two months after the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank signed an additional
$22.6 billion bailout for Moscow, may swell under Chernomyrdin,
whose five-year tenure as prime minister before his sacking in
March was marked by a fondness for helping sick industries with tax
breaks and credits. More such moves, combined with a weak ruble,
could spark inflation, which could lead to social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, who had helped Western oil companies working in
Russia but carries few reformist credentials, is likely to alter
some of the reforms attempted by his predecessor, Sergei V.
Kiriyenko. The Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper quoted Chernomyrdin,
60, as saying social welfare and aid to ailing industries were top
priorities, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   That contrasts with the austerity measures promoted by Kiriyenko
but only half-heartedly implemented by the opposition-dominated
State Duma, the lower parliament house. In search of cash to
support government finances, Kiriyenko, 36, had campaigned against
tax debtors, mostly domestic oil and gas companies close to
Chernomyrdin, and encouraged tax reform.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chernomyrdin, now the Kremlin's candidate in the
presidential poll in 2000, Russia's search for cash could take an
inflationary form. ``One scenario being discussed is that the
Central Bank would print rubles,'' said Jeffrey M. Robbins, an
economist at MFK Renaissance in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bank sold over $2 billion in hard currency and
precious metals over the second and third weeks of August to defend
the ruble before caving in to devaluation. Its reserves were down
to $15.1 billion as of Aug. 20, Reuters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a loss of a sense of reality in Russia,'' said Joshua
G. Feuerman, head of emerging markets at State Street Global
Advisers in Boston. ``Russia is in danger of falling into the
Indonesian model.''

GOVERNMENT ADMITS SOME BLAME AS CHINA REELS FROM FLOOD DAMAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Charges are mounting here that bad policies and
official neglect have worsened this summer's disastrous flooding in
China, and the government has made the unusual admission that its
land use mistakes are partly to blame and announced sweeping policy
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have clearly been shocked by the vast scale of damage
in southern and northeastern China, where severe flooding persists.
This year's rains have been torrential, but not as great as in some
years when the extent of flooding and the damages were less.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, the official press has carried
increasingly sharp articles and editorials on the harmful effects
of clear-cutting timber along the upper reaches of the Yangtze
River, for example, and the human invasion of vital wetlands along
the river's course.
</P>
<P>
   In private, some experts are making more pointed charges that,
despite repeated warnings, the upkeep of important dikes along
China's flood-prone rivers has been badly neglected.
</P>
<P>
   At a government news conference on the floods Tuesday, Zhao
Qizheng, chief of the State Council Information Office, said the
government had decided to shut down logging activities in the upper
catchments of the Yangtze River. The deforestation has led to more
rapid runoff of rain waters and increased silting of river and lake
beds. He said all cleared areas would be replanted in a long-term
strategy of ecological restoration.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that large areas of lakes and wetlands in the
Yangtze flood plain, which have been drained to make farmland,
would be restored to their natural condition.
</P>
<P>
   These areas formerly absorbed huge volumes of water during flood
periods. Now, instead of easing the problem, these lands claimed
from the water are being desperately protected by soldiers stacking
sandbags to make crude dikes. They are exhorted by the official
slogan ``Fight to the Death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have asked a lot of nature, and now we are returning what
we have acquired,'' Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
   How effectively these new policies can be carried out remains a
big question, because the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of
poor people will be affected, including loggers upstream and
farmers in the middle and lower reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
   While critics of the government are saying they welcome the new
attention to ecology, they make more specific charges of official
lapses. Many water experts are also calling for fundamental changes
in the approach to flood control, reflecting a debate over strategy
that has continued in China for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Lu Qinkan, a retired government hydrologist and flood prevention
expert, said that in 1980 an important report by the Ministry of
Water Resources laid out plans for reinforcing and raising the main
dikes along the Yangtze. But by 1987, only $48 million of the $1.2
billion that was called for had been spent on the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighteen years have passed,'' Lu said in an interview, ``but
the main dikes are in a state of disrepair, leading to breaches
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The neglect of downstream dikes, Lu and other critics say,
reflects a bias toward building dams and reservoirs to battle
floods despite their inherently limited capacity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though the topic is too politically sensitive for the official
news media to explore, this year's floods have revived private
debate about the giant Three Gorges Dam under construction along
the upper reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
   On television and in newspaper interviews, officials involved in
the project have tried to capitalize on the crisis, contending that
the dam will greatly reduce _ if not eliminate _ flooding like this
year's.
</P>
<P>
   Lu, who was involved in feasibility studies for the Three Gorges
Dam but who refused to sign the recommendation to proceed, said its
effect could only be small. In 1954, he said, in the last great
flood comparable to this year's, water flowing into the dam site
totaled about 79,293 billion gallons. But the flood-retention
capacity of the dam is only 5,804 billion gallons, he said. And
another 94,830 billion gallons of water flowed into the river below
the dam site.
</P>
<P>
   Along with improving dikes, critics of the dam-centered approach
to flood control say, more must be done to protect natural
waterways that can soak up water and to set aside basins downstream
where overflows can be diverted. But China's intense population
pressures and poverty make this ever more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Hubei Province _ on the middle reaches of the Yangtze, where
this year's damage is worst _ was once known as the province of
1,000 lakes, many of them linked to the Yangtze system, said Zhou
Kuiyi, vice director of the government's Research Center on Flood
Disasters. But because of draining projects and siltation, many of
the lakes have simply disappeared, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The huge Dongting Lake in Hubei is the most important single
lake for retaining excess waters along the Yangtze. According to a
new report by the State Environmental Protection Agency, the lake
borders, again because of drainage for farms and the inflow of
silt, have shrunk drastically. Its capacity has fallen from 7,742
billion gallons in 1949 to 4,698 billion gallons today.
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, a large basin near the Yangtze in Hubei was
designated as the major emergency water diversion area: when floods
grew too high, dikes there would be intentionally breached,
relieving pressures elsewhere. The waters were so diverted in the
great floods of 1954, when 170,000 people lived there and had to be
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   But today, 550,000 people live in that diversion zone, said Zhou
of the disaster research center. This makes it nearly impossible to
open the floodgates. Instead, the government has poured hundreds of
thousands of troops onto dikes throughout the region, and they are
working around the clock to fend off breaches.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's news conference, officials said it had not been
possible to finish updating the number of flood-related deaths.
Zhao, the information chief, said a total would be announced by the
end of the week. The last figure, on Aug. 6, was 2,100 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Yang Yongliang, a senior Communist Party official from Hubei
Province, said at the news conference that, through the valiant
efforts of 2.3 million flood-fighters, ``we have identified and
removed 4,492 dangerous situations,'' where dikes were threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Ma Shukuan, of the General Political Department of the
Central Military Commission, said that the soldiers, in their
greatest concentration since 1949, ``have displayed a revolutionary
spirit of fearing no hardship nor death.''
</P>
<P>
   Film clips of soldiers in chest-high water fortifying the dikes
appear nightly on the news. The People's Liberation Army is clearly
using the flood battle to build morale and to improve its public
image, battered by military involvement in smuggling and by its
role in smashing the Tiananmen Square student demonstrations in
1989.

TENNIS' AMBASSADOR HAS HIS EYE ON SAMPRAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ A road less traveled is the circuitous one
from Black Butt in the Queensland Outback to Boston. But here was
an all-time roadie called ``Emmo,'' doing all the right steps that
he learned a half-century ago when his journey began, and showing
them to the kids at the Sportsmen's Tennis Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who he is,'' said Monet Duncan to her friend
Katrina Elderbush _ both transfixed by the gray-thatched
61-year-old pedagogue _ ``but he's, like, really awesome, isn't
he?''
</P>
<P>
   Later they found out, after the morning tutorial that he and
fellow Aussie Owen Davidson presented at the Smith Center. Then the
Sportsmen's gang were shipped to Longwood for an afternoon look at
Emmo's successors in the MFS Pro Championships, courtesy of MFS, a
benefactor of the inner city teach-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Later the kids learned that their teacher-for-a-day, Roy Stanley
``Emmo'' Emerson, had made the same sort of good impression at such
way stations along his road as Wimbledon, the Australian, French,
and US Championships, not to mention almost anyplace else in the
world boasting a tennis court.
</P>
<P>
   They learned that he is a stalked man, threatened by someone
they had heard about: Pete Sampras. Thirty-one years ago in Paris,
Emerson beat Tony Roche to win the French, and celebrated unnoticed
by downing a few beers with Roche, Davidson, and other Aussie
mates. A marvelously fit and nimble 6-footer with coal black hair
and gleaming gold-filled teeth, Emmo was totally unaware of having
achieved a record that Sampras (born four years later) would
fiercely covet.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Emerson's 12th major singles title, his second French
to accompany six Australian and two each at Wimbledon and the US.
Sampras, on the eve of possibly waylaying him at the US Open, has
11.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Pete takes the record _ and he will _ he'll get a lot of
publicity. Good on him,'' Emmo smiles. ``He's a great champion. I
didn't know there was such a record. We just played.'' He had
passed Bill Tilden's record 10th of 1930 by winning the Australian
of 1967 _ and basked in a tremendous absence of fanfare. ``Nobody
talked about records then.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary had her little lamb, and little Roy had his little calf
that walked him to school (when he didn't ride horseback) in Nukku.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nukku was near our dairy farm which was outside the big,'' he
laughs, pale green eyes amused, ``the big city, Black Butt. One
store. One pub. Maybe 600 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was first in my class for three years. Also last. Top and
bottom, the only one in that grade. It was a one-teacher school,
first to eighth grades, with 17 students. But we had a tennis
court. Every place in the bush, no matter how small, had a court.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father built ours on the property. I helped a little. Ant
hill court. You knocked over the hills that looked a little like
red traffic cones, spread out the grit. Not a bad surface.
Chicken-wire fences.'
</P>
<P>
   Remnants of that court can be seen, I'm told. Somebody ought put
up a plaque: ``World Champ Emmo Started Here.'' Sampras may seize
his singles record, but superb volleyer Emerson also nailed 16
majors in doubles _ he could have won with R2D2 _ for an
all-rounder mark of 28 that seems as far out of reach as Uranus.
</P>
<P>
   Longwood was first a port of call 44 years ago. ``Ashley Cooper
and I'' _ a pair of 17-year-olds who would wind up in the
International Tennis Hall of Fame _ ``were sent on our first
overseas tour in '54, and played the US Doubles when that was
Longwood's tournament, on grass.''
</P>
<P>
   They were quarterfinalists, but Emmo would win the title in 1959
with Neale Fraser. Alongside Fred Stolle he won again in 1965-66 as
they became local cult figures through the nightly Channel 2
telecasts. It was a thoroughgoing team effort, he recalls. ``We
didn't party together. We alternated. I'd stay in the hotel and
sleep one night, Fred the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was ever a better ambassador for the game or his country.
Emmo was a non-stop player everywhere. ``We played over 40
tournaments a year, singles and doubles. Plus exhibitions all over
Australia for the sporting goods firms that paid us a few dollars
in those amateur days. I reckon we played 46 weeks a year. Left
home in April, played our way through Europe, England, the US until
it was time to go back in October for the Aussie season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I laughed,'' he emits a typically joyful guffaw, ``when I read
recently that Sampras said he was `flat' after playing three
straight weeks. Just singles. Didn't even get to the finals.''
</P>
<P>
   He feels that if Sampras is to win the elusive French,``Pete
will have to stay in Europe as we did and play the entire clay
season. In '54 I didn't have a clue about playing on clay. At the
French I played an old guy in long pants named Asboth (36-year-old
Hungarian Joszef Asboth, winner of the title seven years before).
He had me running around like a blue-ass fly. I never got close to
him, and Kenny (Rosewall) and the other Aussies who'd been there
laughed their heads off.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson, residing in Newport Beach, Calif., relishes teaching
kids, giving clinics to anybody, hopeful heroes and hapless
hackers. His love for the game flows constantly. Black Butt or
Dorchester. Wherever on his road, give him a court, some kids _
whether or not they know him _ and he's an evangelist in short
pants.
</P>
<P>
   Very pleased, too, ``that there weren't any frogs or poisonous
brown snakes wandering the courts at Sportsmen's the way they often
did, getting in the way, in the Outback where I come from.''

SUDAN STRUCK CHEMICAL WEAPONS DEAL WITH IRAQ IN 1991, DIPLOMATS
SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: ATTACK-U.S., ATTACK-LADEN) 
(nk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan _ At the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991,
when Sudan was one of Iraq's few remaining friends in the world,
the government here struck a bargain with Baghdad, foreign
diplomats and Sudanese said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In return for Iraqi financial help and assistance by military
and civilian experts, Sudan agreed to allow its installations to be
used by Iraqi technicians for steps in the production of chemical
weapons, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was beneficial to both countries. Struggling Sudan got
economic help, and Iraq was able to move ahead with chemical
weapons far away from the gaze of U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sudan is a wonderful place to do secretive things,'' a former
Sudanese government official said.
</P>
<P>
   A diplomat here said the Clinton administration had known about
the Iraqi chemical weapons activities here for some time. The
United States attacked a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum last
week and says it was because the factory was making a rare chemical
used for the nerve agent VX.
</P>
<P>
   The Sudanese government has insisted that the factory was used
only for the manufacture of medicines and has called for an
international investigation to prove its contention.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats and the former government official said it was not
absolutely clear at which of several plants the Iraqis were working
on chemical weapons or their precursors. It was not clear either,
the diplomat said, whether completed chemical weapons or only
precursors were being produced.
</P>
<P>
   They said, however, that a military complex on the southern
outskirts of the city, not the plant that was attacked, was the
most likely place for the production to have been taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the gulf war, 40 Iraqi government employees
were sent to the heavily guarded military complex, one diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iraqis are there to guard chemical weapons or substances
that Iraq doesn't want in Iraq,'' the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of other Iraqi experts have worked in various fields in
Sudan since the gulf war, including the manufacture of munitions,
the diplomat and the former government official said.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of the pharmaceutical factory in the industrial
area of Khartoum was a surprise because the enterprise had been
touted since its opening in early 1997 as a breakthrough in the
local production of inexpensive medicines, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Monday that the pharmaceutical
factory, Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries, had been targeted after
soil samples from outside the plant, secretly obtained months ago,
were found to have a rare chemical needed for the manufacture of
VX.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical, ethyl methylphosphonothinonate, known as Empta,
has no industrial uses, the administration official said. The only
viable explanation for the presence of the ``precursor chemical''
is the production of VX, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, administration officials said the pharmaceutical plant
was not the only installation in Sudan suspected of producing
chemicals for VX, but rather the one where the United States had
the most persuasive evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were other facilities where there was really hard
evidence,'' an official said, ``but there was not a smoking gun;
there was not a soil sample.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed possible that the pharmaceutical factory was not
actually making the ``precursor chemical'' that the administration
described, the diplomats here said. They believed that the factory
had been chosen as a target because it could be more precisely hit
than the military plant and did not run the risk of spreading
deadly vapors.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has said in the last two days that it was
confident of its justification for hitting the pharmaceutical plant
and saw no reason for an investigation into whether Empta was
produced there.
</P>
<P>
   Traces of Empta would survive destruction of a site by fire,
said a chemical weapons expert, Amy Smythson of the Henry L.
Stimson Center in Washington. The center specializes in arms
control research.
</P>
<P>
   Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering said Tuesday in
Washington: ``We see evidence that we think is quite clear on
contacts between Sudan and Iraq. In fact, el Shifa officials, early
in the company's history, we believe, were in touch with Iraqi
individuals associated with Iraq's VX program.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Iraq and Iran are about Sudan's best friends in the Arab world.
Because the Sudanese government has been accused of harboring
training installations for terrorists, Sudan has tense relations
with neighboring Egypt and poor relations with Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the United States and the Islamic military
regime that came to power here in 1989 deteriorated to the point
where the American Embassy was closed in 1996. Sudan is on the
State Department's list of terrorist states.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi-Sudanese relationship has blossomed over time and
includes the assignment of Iraqi military officers at an air base
outside Khartoum, Sudanese officials say. The Iraqis have helped
with civilian activities, including repairing irrigation machinery
for agricultural projects, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis and the Sudanese have also developed trade relations,
including an order from the destroyed pharmaceutical plant for
veterinary drugs to be exported to Iraq. The sanctions committee of
the U.N. Security Council approved the supplies under the ``oil for
food'' program that allows Iraq to sell some oil despite U.N.
economic sanctions in order to buy relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The export-import relationship involving civilian products could
well have been developed to help cover the export of agents for
chemical weapons, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate connection between the pharmaceutical plant and
Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile now living in Afghanistan whose
training camps were hit by cruise missiles the same night as the
Sudanese factory, was not clear.
</P>
<P>
   A diplomat here said the United States had stressed that the
attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan were part of a general ``war
against terrorism.'' In hitting Sudanese installations, the
administration wanted to warn Sudan that it knew about the chemical
weapon preparations and that it should stop helping Iraq, the
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States originally suggested that the pharmaceutical
plant was financed by bin Laden, which could have been the case
during the plant's construction, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The factory is now owned by Saleh Idresse, a Sudanese who also
has citizenship in Saudi Arabia. Businessmen in Khartoum said
Idresse had plenty of cash, the sources of which are not clear.
They said he had paid $27 million in cash for the Shifa plant.
</P>
<P>
   He is also reported to have invested in what the Sudanese refer
to as the government ``military industrial complex.'' This includes
the plant in southern Khartoum, the diplomat said, where the Iraqi
technicians worked on the chemical weapons agents.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Iraq's representative at the United Nations denied
that his country had been involved in the development or production
of chemical weapons in Sudan and said the Iraqi government would
welcome an independent investigation of the factory in Khartoum
destroyed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the United States of trying to deflect attention from
the attacks on the Sudanese factory by saying Iraq was helping
Sudan produce nerve gas components.

TEXAS A&AMP;M SCIENTISTS SEEK TO CLONE FAMILY PET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: San Francisco) 
 
By ALLAN TURNER 
and TODD ACKERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Missy, by all accounts, has been a pretty good dog.
But if Texas A&AMP;M scientists succeed in a bold $2.3 million effort
to clone the beloved pet of a mysterious family of
multimillionaires, Missy could become a very good dog, dog, dog.
</P>
<P>
   Those involved in the ``Missyplicity Project'' _ the first
attempt to clone a canine _ say it could provide valuable insights
into replicating genetically superior seeing-eye and search and
rescue dogs. Technological advances also might help save endangered
canines in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan, announced this week by spokesmen for the College
Station university's College of Veterinary Medicine, brought bleats
of dismissal from the Scottish scientists who created Dolly, the
world's first cloned sheep.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we're concerned,'' Dr. Harry Griffin of Edinburgh's
Roslin Institute told a London newspaper, ``we disapprove. ... It
perpetuates the myth that you can recreate an individual through
cloning.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Caplin, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania,
added that cloning pets, as opposed to farm animals, can be
problematic because researchers simply cannot guarantee how well
the process will work.
</P>
<P>
   Cloned animals like Dolly, he said, are alive and look as they
should. But scientists have no way of knowing that they will grow
into normal, healthy creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask a lot of pets,'' Caplin said. ``They're friends and
entertainment sources. We don't ask sheep for anything besides
their wool and lamb chops. In short, we love pets for their minds,
we love Dolly for her body.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Missy's owners said the family is well aware that
a genetic duplicate of a pet is not the same as recreating the pet.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Hawthorne, president of San Francisco-based Bio Art and
Research Corp., or BARC _ the company that organized the project
for Missy's owners _ suggested such concerns might be based on only
a partial knowledge of the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists have a natural tendency to be skeptical of any
project that has a high profile,'' he said. ``I'm not sure they're
hearing the story accurately. I'm not sure they realize Texas A&AMP;M
is working on the project. That these are their friends and peers
that they see at every world-class scientific gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Westhusin, the A&AMP;M associate professor of veterinary
physiology and pharmacology who heads the Missyplicity Project,
said the undertaking ``goes well beyond cloning a pet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not $2 million to clone an individual's pet,'' he
said. ``This is $2 million to do some great science.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloning Missy, an aging collie-mix, he warned, is ``not
falling-off-the-log technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to say when we'll succeed,'' he said. ``We set
project goals and milestones. It's our goal to produce puppies at
the end of two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Westhusin, who will lead a team of about 10 researchers, said
the cloning process entails removing genetic material from Missy,
then inserting it into an egg from a donor dog. The egg is then
implanted into a surrogate mother for gestation.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne, whose background includes an eclectic array of
scientific and media undertakings _ he currently is writing a book
detailing his motorcycle trip across India _ said tissue samples
have been retrieved from Missy's belly and mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a simple, painless process,'' he said. ``While she was
at A&AMP;M, she was treated like royalty. The cadets played with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Missy, though, is accustomed to being treated like royalty. She
even has her own Web page (www.missyplicity.com).
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne declined to identify his millionaire clients, nor even
to divulge the state in which they live other than to deny that
they are Texans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They value their privacy,'' he said. ``And there also is some
concern for Missy's safety.''
</P>
<P>
   In a touching reminiscence on the dog's web page, Missy's owner
recalled visiting the pound to find a companion for his enfeebled
shepherd-coyote, Liebe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her (Missy's) eyes stared at me and I couldn't look away,''
the owner recalled. ``She poked her nose through the fence, whined,
got her paw through an opening and when I took her paw in my hand
she licked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to know if she had a high, ear-shattering bark (which
I don't like), and if she could howl (which I do like). I began
talking to her and she sat there sloppily, one leg loose, cocking
her head, left, right, and I noticed that one erect ear had a dip,
which I found somehow charming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I offered a howl to her and she raised her nose and howled at
the roof. I barked at her and she barked right back, a low
rich-toned, businesslike bark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I whined, she whined.''

FBI KEPT HIM IN CRIME, FORMER MOB INFORMANT TESTIFIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ To hear former mobster/informant Stephen Flemmi tell it
from the witness stand, he just wanted to go straight. But the FBI
wouldn't let him.
</P>
<P>
   He liked Canada, his home on the lam, and his job at a
color-printing company. By 1974, five years after he was charged
with blowing up a lawyer's car in Boston, Flemmi had applied for a
Canadian passport and considered secretly sending for his family.
</P>
<P>
   So when he talked to his former FBI handler H. Paul Rico in the
spring of 1974, Flemmi said, he was unhappy when Rico urged him to
return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't ready to come back,'' Flemmi testified Tuesday in
federal court, his fourth day on the witness stand. ``He convinced
me to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Within months of returning to Boston in May of 1974, Flemmi said
the car-bombing charge was dropped _ evidence, he claims, of an
immunity deal he'd cut with Rico. Back in town, Flemmi claims he
was coaxed back into a life of crime so he could position himself
to feed the bureau information on his criminal associates in the
Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell back into the (same) pattern more or less,'' Flemmi
testified. ``But it was more at the insistence of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the government had a different view.
</P>
<P>
   Through a series of questions, most of which Flemmi refused to
answer, Assistant US Attorney Fred M. Wyshak Jr. asked about the
owner of the garage where Flemmi ran his auto sales business:
Winter Hill gangster Howard Winter.
</P>
<P>
   Wyshak asked about Flemmi's criminal associates, who had taken
over his loansharking business while he was in Canada. Wyshak
argued that the car-bombing case was dropped not because Rico had
intervened, but because a key witness had testified in the trial of
Francis Salemme that Flemmi was not at the scene of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Salemme was convicted and two others were acquitted. Charges
against Flemmi were eventually dropped. &UR;  &LR; Flemmi admitted following
the bombing case in the Boston newspapers while in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You made a conscious choice to be a criminal again and you
made a conscious choice to be an FBI informant,'' asserted Wyshak.
The prosecutor got Flemmi to acknowledge that he never told his
long-time FBI contact, agent John Connolly, that he wanted to cut
his ties to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   But Flemmi, who funneled information to the bureau over the
course of 30 years, insisted he wanted to quit. ``I felt it was
distasteful. I wanted to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked which was more distasteful, being a criminal or being an
informant, Flemmi replied, ``If I was asked, I'd say informant.''
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi is trying to prove to US District Judge Mark L. Wolf that
a series of FBI agents and supervisors promised him and his
criminal partner, fugitive James ``Whitey'' Bulger immunity from
prosecution in exchange for information they provided the bureau on
the Mafia. Flemmi contends they were given permission to commit any
crime short of murder.
</P>
<P>
   If he killed someone, ``all bets would be off,'' said Flemmi,
who is charged in a 1995 indictment with killing four men and has
been suspected in several other murders. But he said he did not
believe that his involvement in murders would negate the immunity
deal covering all other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The government denies that any valid immunity agreement exists.
If such promises were made they amounted to FBI misconduct and the
agreement isn't legally defensible.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth day of cross-examination by federal prosecutors,
Flemmi said he didn't believe his FBI handlers acted improperly or
illegally when they tipped him off to investigations or indictments
or scared away merchants who complained to the FBI about his
company's strong-arm approach to installing vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be the way government works,'' Flemmi said. ``That
may be standard procedure for them. The law works in mysterious
ways ... Whatever they want to do they can do it and get away with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyshak asked Flemmi if he believed that law enforcement can
``get away with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I do. Absolutely,'' Flemmi answered. ``They do it all the
time. I read about it in the paper every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what authority Connolly or other agents had to promise him
immunity from prosecution, Flemmi said, ``He's the US government.
When I look at him, I'm looking at the US government.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Flemmi dismissed Wyshak's suggestion that the
``protection'' Flemmi received from his FBI handlers actually
amounted to obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I was performing a service for the US government in
my role as an informant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wyshak angrily retorted, ``Were you providing a service to the
US government by controlling the flow of drugs into South Boston?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll assert the Fifth on that,'' replied Flemmi. ``I can
understand why you're getting mad, too.''

<P>
   ``It's very hard to say when we'll succeed,'' he said. ``We set
project goals and milestones. It's our goal to produce puppies at
the end of two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Westhusin, who will lead a team of about 10 researchers, said
the cloning process entails removing genetic material from Missy,
then inserting it into an egg from a donor dog. The egg is then
implanted into a surrogate mother for gestation.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne, whose background includes an eclectic array of
scientific and media undertakings _ he currently is writing a book
detailing his motorcycle trip across India _ said tissue samples
have been retrieved from Missy's belly and mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a simple, painless process,'' he said. ``While she was
at A&AMP;M, she was treated like royalty. The cadets played with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Missy, though, is accustomed to being treated like royalty. She
even has her own Web page (www.missyplicity.com).
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne declined to identify his millionaire clients, nor even
to divulge the state in which they live other than to deny that
they are Texans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They value their privacy,'' he said. ``And there also is some
concern for Missy's safety.''
</P>
<P>
   In a touching reminiscence on the dog's web page, Missy's owner
recalled visiting the pound to find a companion for his enfeebled
shepherd-coyote, Liebe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her (Missy's) eyes stared at me and I couldn't look away,''
the owner recalled. ``She poked her nose through the fence, whined,
got her paw through an opening and when I took her paw in my hand
she licked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to know if she had a high, ear-shattering bark (which
I don't like), and if she could howl (which I do like). I began
talking to her and she sat there sloppily, one leg loose, cocking
her head, left, right, and I noticed that one erect ear had a dip,
which I found somehow charming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I offered a howl to her and she raised her nose and howled at
the roof. I barked at her and she barked right back, a low
rich-toned, businesslike bark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I whined, she whined.''

WIRE MANUFACTURER INDICTED IN CHEMICAL DUMPING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BABSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ James M. Knott Sr., owner of a company that makes steel
wire mesh used in lobster traps and chicken coops, has been
indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly dumping acidic waste
water into the Northbridge public sewer system.
</P>
<P>
   Knott, 68, president of the Riverdale Mills Corp. in
Northbridge, was charged with two counts of violating the federal
Clean Water Act. The indictment alleges that although Knott knew a
wastewater treament system in his Riverdale Mills factory had
malfunctioned by April or May of 1997, the company failed to repair
or restore it until at least November 1997 _ at which point high
levels of acid had been detected in untreated wastewater going into
the sewer system.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Knott could face up to six years in jail; he and
his firm could face fines of between $500,000 to $1 million. The
case is being investigated by the US Environmental Protection
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Knott said he was not aware that the company's
water treatment system was not working. Of those who are
prosecuting and investigating him he said: ``I just don't think
these people are very competent.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Knott said the discharged water in question at its
most potent ``is very, very mild acid. It's about like a Coca-Cola
or lemon juice or salad dressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Riverdale Mills employs about 150 people.
</P>
<P>
   The company operates production lines in which steel wire is
welded into wire mesh, which is galvanized and then coated with
plastic. The mesh is used in the manufacture of various commercial
products, including lobster and crab traps, chicken coops and
protective fencing.
</P>
<P>
   The galvanizing and coating processes yield acidic industrial
wastewater that is supposed to be neutralized before it is
eventually discharged into the Northridge municipal sewer system.
</P>
<P>
   Knott is known locally as a gadfly who is prone to picking
fights with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   He is ``a hard-driving businessman and a difficult person to
deal with,'' Northbridge Town Manager Bill Williams said.
``Certainly the town has locked horns with him on certain issues
... On the good side, there are a lot of people who probably look
at him as a good-standing member of the community.''

TEXAS A&AMP;M SCIENTISTS SEEK TO CLONE MILLIONAIRE FAMILY'S PET DOG 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: San Francisco) 
(Sub to correct spelling to ``Caplan'' sted of ``Caplin'') 
 
By ALLAN TURNER 
and TODD ACKERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Missy, by all accounts, has been a pretty good dog.
But if Texas A&AMP;M scientists succeed in a bold $2.3 million effort
to clone the beloved pet of a mysterious family of
multimillionaires, Missy could become a very good dog, dog, dog.
</P>
<P>
   Those involved in the ``Missyplicity Project'' _ the first
attempt to clone a canine _ say it could provide valuable insights
into replicating genetically superior seeing-eye and search and
rescue dogs. Technological advances also might help save endangered
canines in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan, announced this week by spokesmen for the College
Station university's College of Veterinary Medicine, brought bleats
of dismissal from the Scottish scientists who created Dolly, the
world's first cloned sheep.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we're concerned,'' Dr. Harry Griffin of Edinburgh's
Roslin Institute told a London newspaper, ``we disapprove. ... It
perpetuates the myth that you can recreate an individual through
cloning.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania,
added that cloning pets, as opposed to farm animals, can be
problematic because researchers simply cannot guarantee how well
the process will work.
</P>
<P>
   Cloned animals like Dolly, he said, are alive and look as they
should. But scientists have no way of knowing that they will grow
into normal, healthy creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask a lot of pets,'' Caplan said. ``They're friends and
entertainment sources. We don't ask sheep for anything besides
their wool and lamb chops. In short, we love pets for their minds,
we love Dolly for her body.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Missy's owners said the family is well aware that
a genetic duplicate of a pet is not the same as recreating the pet.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Hawthorne, president of San Francisco-based Bio Art and
Research Corp., or BARC _ the company that organized the project
for Missy's owners _ suggested such concerns might be based on only
a partial knowledge of the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists have a natural tendency to be skeptical of any
project that has a high profile,'' he said. ``I'm not sure they're
hearing the story accurately. I'm not sure they realize Texas A&AMP;M
is working on the project. That these are their friends and peers
that they see at every world-class scientific gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Westhusin, the A&AMP;M associate professor of veterinary
physiology and pharmacology who heads the Missyplicity Project,
said the undertaking ``goes well beyond cloning a pet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not $2 million to clone an individual's pet,'' he
said. ``This is $2 million to do some great science.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloning Missy, an aging collie-mix, he warned, is ``not
falling-off-the-log technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to say when we'll succeed,'' he said. ``We set
project goals and milestones. It's our goal to produce puppies at
the end of two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Westhusin, who will lead a team of about 10 researchers, said

then inserting it into an egg from a donor dog. The egg is then
implanted into a surrogate mother for gestation.

IT'S FANTASTIC, INCREDIBLE _ IT'S A BLURB! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Book, cover, the rush to judgment _ you know the old
saying.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to propose a corollary: You can't judge a book by its
blurbs, either.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone actually buy a book because of the blurbs? Judging
from some of the quotes you see printed on the covers, every book
published is a classic of its genre, the most
suspenseful/harrowing/funny/sad/moving of its kind that the person
doing the blurb has ever read.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, everything can't be the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a twisted wizard, a genre-busting virtuoso working at
the outer edge of narrative convention.'' That's what Jay McInerney
said of Mark Leyner's ``I Smell Esther Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Leyner? I'll buy that he's an attention-busting hack
working at the outer edge of readability, but that's about it.
</P>
<P>
   Just so we're clear on what we're talking about, a blurb is a
quote about a book from a person presumably so well-known that the
jacket usually just lists his name and what he has to say about
it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Classic fodder
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although occasionally they're not so well-known. ``This book is
destined to be a classic,'' Joan Borysenko says on the cover of Dr.
Andrew Weil's ``Spontaneous Healing.'' You're saying, swell, but
who the hell is Joan Borysenko?
</P>
<P>
   Happily, it says right there beside her quote: She's the author
of ``Minding the Body, Mending the Mind.'' Now you know.
</P>
<P>
   What we're (begin ital) not (end ital) talking about are the
pages of snippets from newspaper reviews. You know, ``Wonderful'' _
``USA Today,'' that kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's one word _ `Gripping!' _ from the ``Arkansas
Gazette,'' generally it's taken from a thicket of blisteringly
negative reviews,'' said James Lileks, a Minneapolis columnist and
author.
</P>
<P>
   Lileks knows about blurbs. He has written them, he thinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blurbed somebody,'' he said. ``And I can't remember what it
was. I felt vaguely soiled doing it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As you might guess, Lileks doesn't have much use for blurbs
generally.
</P>
<P>
   ``All blurbs are back-scratching and log-rolling,'' he said.
``Except for the blurbs I got from Dave Barry.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, those. When it comes to blurbs, Barry is a master; he
has graced two of Lileks' books with them. For ``Fresh Lies,''
Barry wrote: ``Fresh Lies'' is funny as hell, and James Lileks is
the funniest writer I know. For his height.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Awfully kind
</P>
<P>
   And this, for ``Notes of a Nervous Man``: ``James Lileks is a
wonderfully funny writer, and I am not saying this just because he
bought me a lot of beer. Although that certainly is a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   (For my money, Barry's best blurb is for Tony Kornheiser's
``Pumping Irony'': ``Tony Kornheiser is the funniest writer in
world history. And I do not say this because he is my close
personal friend. I say this because I am a pathological liar.'')
</P>
<P>
   The reason I spoke with Lileks is that he once offered, if I
could get a book compiling my columns together, to blurb it. Which
piqued my curiosity _ just what would he say? (Actually, I was
mostly curious if he remembered making the offer. He did. So I've
got that going for me. And since I have yet to compile such a book,
I figured writing about blurbs would be the next best thing.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was really, really awful, I would find some kind way not
to say that,'' Lileks said.
</P>
<P>
   And if it was _ if you can imagine such a thing _ not?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would find some trite and hackneyed way to say it was
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Lileks writing a blurb is that the blurb would
be better than the book. I suspect that's often the case.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not:
</P>
<P>
   ``If Rachel Felder knew more about underground guitar bands in
England and America, she'd turn into a Fender Stratocaster and a
Marshall Stack.'' That's what Patrick Fitzgerald, the lead singer
for the band Kitchens of Distinction, said of Felder's ``Manic Pop
Thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's just a shrewd marketing ploy. After all, the book
is (begin ital) bound (end ital) be better than that. &QL;

<P>
   UNDATED - There's Lady, Maxwell, Happy and Sweeper. Odd names
for co-workers, even by today's standards. But they are regulars at
Phoenix-area businesses where they help to boost employee loyalty
and build customer satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Lady is a shelty, Maxwell and Happy are cockers and Sweeper is a
long-haired dog of unspecified pedigree. Pets such as these are
increasingly finding their way into businesses and offices where
they can relax and motivate stressed workers and help promote
better relations with customers.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have established policies that allow workers to
bring their pets to work on a regular basis. Employee resource
specialists believe more firms will follow suit to help attract and
retain employees in a tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If enough people like the concept, it could become a factor in
employment decisions,'' said John Challenger, a vice president at
Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, an outplacement firm in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   To promote the concept, Pet Sitters International, a
2,200-member educational organization for professional pet sitters,
is organizing a national take-your-pet-to-work day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for sponsors and shooting for June 1999, or 2000
for our first event,'' said Cara Haynes, a spokeswoman for the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   At Autodesk Inc., a $680 million-a-year computer software
company in San Rafael, Calif., there are 75 to 100 dogs at work
with their owners on any given day. The company also welcomes cats,
birds, snakes and other pets. They have to stay in their owners'
offices or cubicles and can't bark or display aggressive behavior.
They are not allowed in public areas, and three accidents inside
the building means banishment until the owner can demonstrate their
pets continence.
</P>
<P>
   Autodesk's pets-at-work program dates to the early 1980s when
the company was operated out of a group of condominiums and its
employees worked odd hours and needed a place to bring their pets.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's viewed as an important employee benefit and a plum
in attracting and keeping talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once employees get used to having their pets with them at
work, it's hard to go somewhere else where they'd have to stay at
home,'' company spokeswoman Kathy Tom said.
</P>
<P>
   Another national company that allows employees to bring their
pets to work is Netscape Communications Corp. in Mountain View,
Calif. Netscape adopted a formal policy 18 months ago after an
informal one was suspended when a dog got into a conference room
and scarfed up a buffet that had been set up for clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``People felt so strongly about it that we reinstated it under
more formal terms,'' company spokeswoman Chris Holten said.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape welcomes all pets except cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many people allergic to cat dander, we had to
exclude them,'' Holten said.
</P>
<P>
   At Netscape, the pets need to be licensed and vaccinated, and
their owners must have liability insurance. They are not permitted
in business meetings and can temporarily be banished for only two
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Besides helping attract and retain employees, companies with
pet-friendly policies find the animals reduce stress and increase
productivity among workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more focused and able to work longer hours when
they are not worried about their pets at home,'' Holten said.
</P>
<P>
   In Mesa, Ariz.'s police and fire dispatch department, it is the
custom for employees to bring in their pets _ particularly if they
have a veterinarian appointment. On those occasions, department
supervisor Robin Bollman said the atmosphere is more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can get pretty stressful around here and having an animal
around really seems to help,'' Bollman said. While the Mesa
department does not officially allow employees to bring their pets
to work, Bollman believes her department would be better off it it
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be really beneficial,'' she said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Law firm full of cats
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the Phoenix law firm of Taylor Associates, clients are
regularly entertained by 16 cats that live in the firm's two
offices. Two more reside at each of the firm's offices in Flagstaff
and Prescott.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's principal, Richard Taylor, said the cats are
generally abandoned strays that have been rescued by the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started with one cat that my daughter found in a
Dumpster,`` he said. Taylor took the cat to the office and the
employees were so taken with it they went to the Humane Society and
got a companion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just took off from there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to taking in strays, Taylor runs a non-profit agency
out of his law firm that will help needy owners pay for life-saving
medical procedures for their pets.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has found that the cats have become unexpected marketing
assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have put cats on our logo and people refer to us the cat
attorneys,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell's Hallmark Cards and Gifts in Phoenix also has found the
marketing value of animals. Maxwell, the store's namesake is a
cocker spaniel who regularly shows up in a necktie and name tag
which reads ``manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Store owner Chitty Kang explained that when he bought the
Hallmark franchise three years ago, the agreement required him to
use his first name in the store's title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not like Chitty's Hallmark, so I got permission to use
Maxwell's name.
</P>
<P>
   Besides lending his name to the business, Maxwell is featured on
the store's advertising and has proved to be an effective drawing
card for customers. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A real `watch dog'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Lady, a 13-year-old shelty, holds court at the Alpine Clock &AMP; Watch
Shop in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wears a little pocket watch on her collar and we call her
our watch dog,'' said the shop's co-owner, Erika Meyer-John.
</P>
<P>
   Pets also are a regular fixtures at Community Florist in
Phoenix. Recently, there were three dogs and a bird, Rosie, who
likes to be petted. Owner Tony Dombrowski regularly brings in his
dog, Victor, and encourages other employees to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It relaxes everybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barb Goethe, owner of Uniforms for America in Glendale, Ariz.,
encourages her employees to bring in their pets. They include a rat
named Templeton and a dachshund named Gloria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love animals,'' Goethe said. ``They're so relaxing.''
</P>
<P>
   The store's pet-friendly atmosphere also is a hit with
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our customers are nurses and they tend to like
animals,'' she said. Like Taylor, Goethe's business often fronts as
a stray animal adoption service.
</P>
<P>
   ``People bring in strays and if someone takes a shine to them we
tell them `this little guy is looking for a home.' '' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Arizona State University was the only Pac-10 school listed in
``America's 100 Best College Buys 1999,'' a new book that evaluates
higher-education institutions for academic excellence, low costs
and other factors. Grand Canyon University was the only other
Arizona university on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Florida led the rankings with nine schools, followed by
Tennessee with seven and Kansas and Texas with five apiece.
</P>
<P>
   No schools in California or New York made the grade. Nor did any
Ivy League institutions. The University of Iowa was the lone Big 10
representative.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State was cited for having top research facilities, a
highly ranked library and numerous academic honors, among other
features.
</P>
<P>
   ``ASU is on the forefront in integrating new technologies into
the undergraduate curriculum and successfully garnering increased
support for its diverse research projects,'' said the guide
($19.95; John Culler &AMP; Sons; 803-432-2001).
</P>
<P>
   It described the Tempe campus, with its mix of palms, citrus
trees and cactuses, as ``a unique and intriguing environment that
draws students from all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Grand Canyon University was cited for ``top academics,'' a
``vibrant'' campus and ``outstanding NCAA athletic competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The rankings were based on a survey conducted in May and June
1997. High marks were given to schools that had below-average costs
as well as freshman classes that scored above average in terms of
grade point averages and SAT/ACT results. The survey was open only
to four-year, accredited institutions that offered financial aid
and full residential facilities.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,430 colleges and universities responded to the survey. &QL;

COLLEGE TAX SHELTERS: NEW PLANS HELP FAMILIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUSS WILES  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Thomas Chilcoat this month became not only the first
person on his block but one of the first in Arizona to open a new
type of college-savings plan.
</P>
<P>
   His investment is in what's known as a 529 plan, after a section
of the federal tax code amended by Congress this year. These plans
allow more generous contributions into tax-sheltered college
accounts than were previously permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Chilcoat, who lives in Kingman and maintains railroad signals
for Burlington Northern Santa Fe, plans to put $1,500 a year into
an account for his 8-year-old daughter, Kendra. He opened the
account with Boston-based Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax deferral is what sold me on the program,'' Chilcoat said.
He also likes the ability to have money debited from his bank
account each month for automatic investing.
</P>
<P>
   As his example shows, times are changing in college planning.
Not only are 529 plans hitting the scene, but Congress recently
made some adjustments to tax-sheltered education individual
retirement accounts, which are really misnamed college-saving
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all sorts of arrows in the quiver because of the new
tax law,'' said Tom LaPorte, manager of a Phoenix area branch of
brokerage Piper Jaffray.
</P>
<P>
   Even Arizona has a tax-sheltered college plan in the works,
thanks to legislative action last year. Here's a look at some of
the new and upcoming programs:
</P>
<P>
   - 529 plans. Fidelity is among the pioneers in offering these
vehicles, which are enhanced state-tuition savings programs
stemming from the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. The plans feature
tax-deferred growth of earnings and high investment ceilings, and
the money can be used to meet education costs at colleges around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings grow tax-sheltered until withdrawn. Assuming a
beneficiary attends college, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary
income at his or her rate, not the parents' rate. Proceeds can be
used for tuition, room and board, books and more.
</P>
<P>
   Cash withdrawn prematurely or not used for education is subject
to a penalty and taxation at the parents' rate. But if a child
decides not to enter college, the account can be transferred to
another beneficiary. No penalty would apply if a beneficiary dies,
becomes disabled or receives a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   A big benefit is that parents, grandparents or friends can sock
away up to $50,000 per child in a single year without triggering
gift taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means you basically can fund an entire college plan all
at once,'' said Mark McPherson, manager of Fidelity's Scottsdale
branch.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity (800-544-1914) requires investors to buy into a
predetermined mix of mutual funds. The mix for young kids starts
out almost entirely in the stock market but shifts into bonds and
money-market instruments as a beneficiary nears college age.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the above description applies to the federal tax
treatment of 529 plans. Arizona has indicated it will exempt
earnings in these accounts from taxes, according to Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   - Education IRAs. For people on a budget and seeking a better
tax break, these accounts may make sense. Unlike 529 plans, cash
withdrawn from education IRAs isn't taxed, provided it's used for
tuition, books and other qualifying expenses.
</P>
<P>
   But education IRAs have their drawbacks. For starters, the
accounts are off-limits to single parents earning more than $95,000
a year or couples making above $150,000. More critical, no more
than $500 can be invested on behalf of a child from all sources
combined _ parents, grandparents and friends. Assuming you invest
$500 each year for 18 years and earn 8 percent annually, the
account would barely top $20,000, says T. Rowe Price Associates of
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Education IRA benefits include the ability to transfer the
account to a younger child if the beneficiary doesn't go to college
or receives a scholarship. Also, the person controlling the account
_ usually a parent _ can exercise control until the beneficiary
turns 30.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage is that education IRAs are widely available.
Many brokerages, banks and mutual-fund groups offer them.
</P>
<P>
   - The Arizona Family College Savings Plan. This program could be
an enticing one, when it finally sees the light of day.
</P>
<P>
   State-savings accounts were signed into law by former Gov. Fife
Symington last year and were supposed to debut in March 1998. But
Arizona officials delayed the program until loose ends could be
tied up with the IRS. Now, a September launch is likely, said Verna
Allen, executive director of the Arizona Commission for
Postsecondary Education.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmarks of this plan are expected to include tax-deferred
growth, a range of investment vehicles and the ability to apply the
cash to meet educational costs at institutions around the country.
</P>
<P>
   As written into state law, the plans would allow unlimited
yearly investments, although that's one point requiring IRS
clarification, Allen said. Another unresolved issue hinges on
whether earnings would accumulate sheltered from both federal and
state taxes until the money is withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Cash not spent on education could be subject to a tax penalty.
</P>
<P>
   One possible drawback is that Arizona has chosen just three
investment firms to offer the savings plan. They are the Equitable
of New York; Securities Management &AMP; Research of Galveston, Texas;
and the College Savings Bank of Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to these savings methods, parents and grandparents
have other college strategies to ponder.
</P>
<P>
   At one extreme are Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning
credits, which offer annual tax refunds of up to $1,500 and $1,000
to cover education costs. They're available to single filers
earning less than $50,000, or couples with incomes below $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to invest in a traditional tax-deferred IRA.
Penalty-free withdrawals can be made from these accounts for
education thanks to the 1997 tax law, although income taxes would
apply on earnings. Tax deductions on traditional IRAs are possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandparents could gift money to their children, with the
provision that they open an IRA for the benefit of the grandkids,''
LaPorte said. ``If the grandkids didn't go to college, the
grandparents would be helping their own kids with retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   At another extreme are simple custodial accounts that allow
parents to retain control of a child's college assets until age 18.
These accounts are widely available and very flexible _ almost any
investment can be used _ but they offer no tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Custodial accounts aren't specifically set up for college, but
they're a convenient way to invest,'' McPherson said. &QL;

   At another extreme are simple custodial accounts that allow
parents to retain control of a child's college assets until age 18.
These accounts are widely available and very flexible _ almost any
investment can be used _ but they offer no tax breaks.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; FOR KINGS AND PLANETS &QL; 
 &UR; Ethan Canin (Random House, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Canin's second novel (following ``Blue River,'' and the story
collections ``Emperor of the Air'' and ``The Palace Thief'') is the
quiet story of two friends whose backgrounds steer them down
dissimilar paths in their adult lives. Orno Tarcher and Marshall
Emerson meet in 1974 as freshmen at Columbia University. Orno,
whose family lives in the farm country of the Midwest, arrives
wide-eyed and embarrassed by his own stolidness _ among his fellow
students, Canin writes, Orno felt ``the word `Missouri' written on
his forehead.'' Marshall is brilliant, worldly and to all
appearances privileged, and Orno is caught up in his exotic and
affected world. There are no special effects in this novel, no
literary pyrotechnics. Instead, Canin watches his characters with
such patience and compassion that the reader is forced to slow down
and acknowledge the gravity of such a story, one that is both
plodding and profound. This is real life _ the small tragedies and
triumphs, betrayals and lucky strokes that shape what becomes of
us. It's also a tribute to New York. Canin pauses often to describe
the city through Orno's eyes, in pages so full of atmosphere that
you'll probably hear Gershwin playing in the background as you
read. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; AROUND THE HOUSE &QL; 
 &UR; David Owen (Villard, $21)
</P>
<P>
   The best way to increase the value of your house by $25,000 is
to add a $50,000 kitchen to it. Most home improvement, however, is
futile: You can spend a fortune fixing up your living room, but at
your next dinner party you'll still find guests in the laundry room
resting their drinks on piles of folded underwear. David Owen knows
a lot about home ownership. He's also a funny guy, especially
because he learned how to use a reciprocating saw. This is a
collection of brief essays with titles such as ``Deck Mania,''
``Let There Be Weeds,'' ``Anatomy of a Kitchen'' and, our favorite,
``Drip, Drip, Drip.'' They are reassuring for people who are home
improvement-impaired, especially when he tells us that the best way
to fix a house is one room at a time. Owen, whose previous book was
``The Walls Around Us: The Thinking Person's Guide to How a House
Works,'' is a staff writer for the ``New Yorker.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; REAL BOYS &QL; 
 &UR; William Pollack (Random House, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys today are in serious trouble, including many who seem
`normal' and to be doing just fine.'' That's the way to start a
book about kids: Tell their parents not to believe their eyes.
Pollack, a psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School,
describes problems that many experts have attributed to girls,
including low self-esteem and feelings of loneliness and isolation.
But boys also are forced into independence too early and made to
feel ashamed of vulnerability. Pollack discusses the ``gender
straitjacket'' and ``the Boy Code'' (``the outdated and
constricting assumptions, models and rules about boys that our
society has used since the 19th century'') and their most serious
consequences: depression, violence and even suicide. There is no
specific mention here of the recent shootings in schools across the
country, but the subject is heavy between the lines. ``By teaching
boys how to harness their anger and aggressive energy and redirect
them into healthy outlets,'' Pollack writes, ``we can help them
avoid hurting others or themselves.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE OVERSPENT AMERICAN &QL; 
 &UR; Juliet B. Schor (Basic, $25)
</P>
<P>
   From the author of ``The Overworked American'' comes another
disturbing look in the mirror. This time, we see what Schor calls
``competitive acquisition,'' only now, instead of keeping up with
the Joneses, we are trying to keep up with people who make much
more money than we do. More than a quarter of all families that
make more than $100,000 a year say that they cannot afford to buy
everything they need. Schor looks at the root of America's spending
problems (television does not help _ every additional hour a person
watches per week increases his annual spending by $218 per year)
and at the many ways our quality of life suffers. She also profiles
``downshifters'' who have chosen to make less money in order to
relieve stress and enjoy their lives. Rampant consumerism is
unnecessary, Schor says. ``We remain a creative, resourceful and
caring nation. There's still time left to find our way out of the
mall.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE DAY DIANA DIED &QL; 
 &UR; Christopher Andersen (Morrow, $27)
</P>
<P>
   There is no end to it. We're starting all over again with this
book, which launches the countdown toward the anniversary of
Diana's death. Thanks to Andersen, a former contributing editor of
``Time'' and senior editor of ``People,'' we now know that Queen
Elizabeth behaved badly (and stupidly, for a woman who should know
something about public relations) after she learned that Diana was
dead. We know that Diana's last words were ``My God, what's
happened?'' (and not, as was reported by Mohamed Al Fayed, ``I
would like all my possessions in Dodi's apartment to be given to my
sister Sarah, including my jewelry and my personal clothes, and
please tell her to take care of my boys.''). We know that Prince
Charles wept when told of the accident in Paris, and later bullied
his mother into acknowledging England's grief. If there's anything
new to say about that day, Andersen has tried to find it, but
there's one more thing we know: It won't be the last word on
Diana. &QL;

FINANCIAL PANIC AS RUBLE DROPS AGAIN; GOVERNMENT UNVEILS DEBT

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Russia searches for a new government and a program
to pull the nation out of a tailspin, fresh panic swept through its
financial institutions Tuesday as the currency plunged, three banks
announced a merger to shore up their stability and the government
unveiled a plan to stretch out the repayment of its debt.
</P>
<P>
   Coming at a moment when Prime Minister-designate Viktor
Chernomyrdin is still negotiating with the Parliament over the
makeup of his new government, the ruble's abrupt drop stoked new
fears of inflation similar to the spiraling rates that plunged
Russia into a depression in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is worse today because then, the country was
dependent on domestic production, however bad it may have been,''
said Mikhail Berger, editor of the newspaper Segodnya. ``Now, big
cities are mostly dependent on imports, and traders can no longer
get credits, not from banks, not from abroad. So there is a danger
that supplies to the cities will fall short.''
</P>
<P>
   The drop in the value of the currency was the deepest in four
years, and it was stopped only when the Central Bank intervened to
hold its value at 7.8 to the dollar, after trading was twice
suspended. In the 10 days since the ruble's value was weakened from
its previous level of 6.2, the Bank has spent an estimated $1
billion to buy rubles in currency markets to keep it from falling
too far, too fast.
</P>
<P>
   The lunge for dollars was driven mostly by Russian banks that
scrambled to trade rubles for dollars and other foreign currencies.
The moves reflected a pessimism by bankers and investors about the
outlook for the ruble as well as the uncertainty over whether
Chernomyrdin can halt the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, in meetings Tuesday with parliamentary leaders,
said he was open to a coalition government that would necessarily
include members of a Communist opposition that has been a resolute
foe of Russia's now-sputtering economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
   Putting forward the Parliament's demands in unusually blunt and
bold terms, Speaker Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist, pressed for a
greater role for the legislature in a system that until now has
been dominated by President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   With Yeltsin now acting increasingly like a lame duck, space has
opened up on the political spectrum for new forces. Chernomyrdin,
whom Yeltsin all but anointed as his political heir in an address
to the nation Monday, is one beneficiary, but others include
members of Russia's powerful financial elite, many of whom support
the new prime minister, and the legislature itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot rule out the possibility that the president might
step down before his term is over, leaving the country in the hands
of a more predictable prime minister,'' Seleznyov said.
</P>
<P>
   At his press conference Tuesday, Seleznyov struck a defiant
note, warning Yeltsin to keep his hands off the new government and
saying the parliament will insist that Chernomyrdin follow the
legislature's own anti-crisis package _ now in preparation _ before
confirming him.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's deepening troubles came on a day when major investors
anxiously awaited Russia's plan to restructure about $40 billion in
Russian short-term domestic debt, of which about 25 percent is held
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, delayed Monday so it could be reviewed by
Chernomyrdin, will allow investors holding Russian short-term
Treasury bills, which were sold with maturities of up to three
years, to trade them for three new issues of Russian securities
that will mature over three to five years, with varying interest
rates and staggered redemption schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, investors can swap their ruble-denominated notes
for a new security, maturing in 2006, denominated in dollars but
paying a slender 5 percent annual interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the plan was cool at best, especially in the United
States. ``If the question is whether this package will secure
Russian access to capital markets in the future, then the answer is
no, it doesn't,'' said an American investor who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``This is sort of the slash and burn
approach to restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some analysts said the repackaging is a needed step
forward. ``No one would buy or sell Russian debt because no one
knew what price to put on it,'' said Charles Peabody, an analyst
with Mitchell Securities Inc. in New York. ``This is an attempt to
get the markets working again by establishing some price for the
debt, but obviously fiscal reforms are going to be equally
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some foreign analysts were already expecting losses as
high as 30 percent on treasury bills, or GKOs, given the loss of
faith in the Russian market after the tumultuous events of the
previous 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the turmoil has involved Russia's banking system, which
has faced a double-sided problem of a cash shortage and debts they
cannot fully repay. A 90-day moratorium has been imposed on bank
debt owed abroad, and three major Russian banks on Tuesday
announced a proposal to form a new banking company in a bid to
bolster their capital base. Some analysts saw the merger plan,
involving Uneximbank, Menatep and Most-Bank, as an attempt to
circle the wagons against the growing storm.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday night, Menatep chairman Alexander Zurabov
suggested the new consolidated banking group would join forces to
press the Central Bank to loosen its control on Russia's money
supply to pump more money into the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The softening of the tough monetaristic policy is an absolute
necessity understood by everybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Yeltsin replaced Kiriyenko with Chernomyrdin _
five months after he replaced Chernomyrdin with Kiriyenko _
Russians and foreigners alike were left waiting for a clear signal
of how the new government plans to pull the country out of its
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published Tuesday in the newspaper Komsomolskaya
Pravda, Chernomyrdin said his first priorities would be ``the
protection of the population's social interest, the payment of
wages and pensions. Next on his list, would an industrial policy
because, he said, ``Russia cannot be pulled out of the crisis by
purely monetary steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's choice of words, harking back to Soviet
terminology, suggested more government support for Russia's
flailing industries, and not the kind of tough measures proposed in
recent weeks by Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
   ``To predict what Chernomyrdin will do is very difficult,'' said
Boris Nemtsov, an outgoing member of the Kiriyenko government, in
an interview Tuesday. ``During his five years in government, there
have been seven governments. This time, in a best case scenario,
inflation will not be so big, 15 to 20 percent next year. In the
worst case, there might be hyperinflation, 100, 200 or even 1,000
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But with Russia's enfeebled banking system sinking deeper into
debt, leaving Russian companies and foreign creditors holding the
bag, others have warned that the country can not afford to waste
time arguing over rescue packages and ministerial portfolios. One
example of the country's spreading cash crunch emerged Tuesday when
distributors for the evening newspaper Izvestia said Tuesday
night's edition had been halted because the printing plant had run
out of money.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-crisis program adopted last week by the Kiriyenko
government in addition to the 90-day breathing space on bank debts
owed to foreign creditors, temporarily froze GKO trading, pending
Tuesday's announcement of the restructuring plan and seemed to only
worsened an existing cash crunch.
</P>
<P>
   The banks' liquidity problem was eased somewhat in recent weeks
by an extension of new credits by the Central Bank, which also this
week lowered the minimum capital requirement for banks, allowing
them to dip into reserves to keep afloat.
</P>
<P>
   But the heavy trading on currency markets Tuesday suggested that
many Russians banks were using their ruble reserves to buy dollars,
now the currency of choice in Russia. ``Of course, we are worried
that many banks are using their credits to speculate on the
currency market, not to pay their creditors,'' said Central Bank
spokesman Irina Yasina. ``But we cannot interfere with the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign analysts were appalled by the banks' actions, which
they said was a prelude to large-scale capital flight. ``Robbery is
going on, that is the only way to describe it,'' said Charles
Blitzer, the London-based director of emerging markets research for
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``The Central Bank has provided
liquidity to commercial banks which are using it to go to the
currency exchanges and get their money out. It seems Russia's
oligarchs are engaging in big-time capital flight, undermining the
ruble and fleeing the country. For the Central Bank to say they
can't control it is a total abdication of what a central bank's
responsibilities are.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger, the newspaper editor, noted that it was natural that
Russian banks, faced with a cash shortage that has put a squeeze on
the value of the ruble, would buy foreign currency. ``Right now,
the most liquid currency on the market is the dollar,'' he said.
``There are no GKOs, there are no bonds that are worth anything.''

NERVE GAS USED BY CULT HAD SAME CHEMICAL FOUND AT SUDAN PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Virtually the same compound that was found outside a
pharmaceutical plant in Sudan and led to last week's US rocket
strike was also found in the blood of a man who had been killed by
VX nerve gas in an attack by a Japanese cult, a team of scientists
reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a meeting of the American Chemical Society, chemist
Anthony Tu said that the compound, called EMPTA, is ``unique for
VX,'' the deadliest nerve gas known, and has no other chemical
function. It exists only as an ingredient for the manufacture of
VX, or as a product of its breakdown after use, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tu, a specialist in chemical weapons who teaches at Colorado
State University and was one of the specialists called in by
Japanese officials in the aftermath of a deadly attack by sarin
nerve gas in the Tokyo subway system in 1995, said that VX had been
used by the same cult group in an attack on a 28-year-old man in
December 1994. In that attack, the deadly compound was sprayed
directly on the victim's skin. The man lost consciousness
immediately and died 10 days later, although the cause of his death
was not determined at the time.
</P>
<P>
   It was a year later, after members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult had
confessed to the subway attack and also to the separate VX attack,
that scientists analyzed a blood sample that had been taken from
the VX victim. After all that time, the distinctive EMPTA was still
clearly evident in the blood sample, said Dr. Hitoshi Tsuchihashi
of the Osaka Police Institute Forensic Science Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Tsuchihashi said no research had been published in the
scientific literature about the metabolism of VX and its breakdown
products, so the discovery of EMPTA in the man's blood could lead
to a diagnostic test to determine if the agent was used used in any
future attacks. The victim of that 1994 attack is the only person
ever known to have died from VX poisoning, Tsuchihashi said.
</P>
<P>
   Tsuchihashi and his colleagues have also studied the break-down
products of sarin gas and other forms of nerve gas that might be
used by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Tu said that a team of American specialists was sent to Japan
shortly after the subway attack in 1995, but Japanese officials
were not willing to share detailed information with them and the
group ``came back empty-handed.'' That's why, he said, he decided
to organize a session at this year's chemical society meeting to
share the lessons learned from that attack with American scientists
and emergency officials. All of the key forensic scientists,
biochemists and doctors who participated in the treatment of the
victims of the sarin attack had been invited to participate, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 12 deaths were attributed to the sarin attack. Those
deaths could have been prevented, said Dr. Tetsu Okumura of the
department of acute medicine at Japan's Kawasaki Medical School, if
the information had been available for a proper medical response.
</P>
<P>
   Okumura, who was one of the doctors in the emergency room at St.
Luke's hospital in Tokyo, where many of the victims were treated,
said emergency medical personnel in his country are not allowed to
perform intubations _ a treatment to open blocked airways _ at the
scene of an emergency. Such treatment would have ensured the
survival of all the sarin victims, he said, adding that nerve gases
cause paralysis, and those who received the largest doses of sarin
were unable to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Although sarin ``victims, adequately intubated, never die,'' he
said, ``in present Japanese law, EMTs cannot save the victim. But
in the US, many paramedics can do intubation at the site.''
</P>
<P>
   The other treatment given in the sarin poisoning was a compound
called PAM, which is also used to treat some pesticide poisonings.
As a result, in Japan the compound is routinely stocked in rural
hospitals where pesticide poisonings are more common, but not in
urban hospitals. That policy needs to be re-examined in light of
recent terrorist activity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sarin victims were also treated with atropine, which is
routinely stocked in hospitals, Okumura said. But even that was not
available in sufficient quantity to deal with the massive subway
attack, which affected more than 5,000 people. Only the most
severely affected patients received atropine, but many others might
have been spared long-term symptoms if the treatment had been
available.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tsuchihashi said a large-scale study is being carried out to
monitor survivors of the subway attack, to learn what long-term
effects their exposure to the gas may produce.

CONGRESS PANEL LOOKS TO ANDREW JACKSON CENSURE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Congress prepares to receive the independent
counsel's report on President Clinton that could lead to
impeachment hearings, some lawmakers are studying a little-known
case: the Senate's 1834 censure of President Andrew Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the Constitution explicitly gives Congress the
authority to censure a president, but nothing prohibits it, either,
according to associate Senate historian Don Ritchie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress could do whatever it wished to do,'' said
Representative Bill McCollum of Florida, the third-ranking
Republican on the House Judiciary Committee. ``We pass resolutions
condemning things every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of censuring Clinton has gained favor among some
Republicans and Democrats partly because polls show most Americans
oppose impeachment. An ABC-TV poll found 55 percent of those
surveyed think Clinton should receive a congressional censure.
</P>
<P>
   A censure is a strong statement of disapproval and carries no
specific penalty, other than the condemnation itself.
</P>
<P>
   The idea may be even more appealing to Democrats than to
Republicans. Democratic leaders are concerned that the president's
admission of an inappropriate relationship with former White House
intern Monica S. Lewinsky could derail the party's effort to regain
control of the House. (Democrats have long thought there is no
chance to retake the Senate this year). So some Democrats may look
favorably on censuring the president in order to show that the
party is displeased with Clinton's actions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, even before Clinton's admission last week, Senator
Joseph Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat, told the New Haven
Register: ``That is a distinct possibility, the censure. You can
sense as you listen not just to Democrats but also to Republicans
that there is not a great yearning for an impeachment here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was on vacation Tuesday and unavailable for comment,
an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Congress have made no comment on the question of
censure or impeachment since Clinton's televised confession on Aug.
17. But lawmakers will be under more pressure to declare their
views when Congress returns from vacation starting next week. House
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt Tuesday delivered his strongest
rebuke yet to Clinton, saying the president's behavior was
``reprehensible,'' although Gephardt said he would ``reserve
judgment'' on whether Clinton should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   The staff of the House Judiciary Committee, which would hold an
impeachment investigation and hearings, has already begun studying
possible alternatives to impeachment. Staff members have found that
the House and Senate have applied a number of penalties to members
of Congress, including: reprimand, denunciation, censure,
condemnation, expulsion, disqualification, and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The lesser of these penalties, such as a reprimand or censure,
do not take away any powers from the affected individual, but there
is often a public and political price to pay. Still, some members
have recovered from the punishment. Former Representative Gerry
Studds, a Massachusetts Democrat, was censured in 1983 for his
relationship with teenage male page and went on to be reelected.
Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, was
reprimanded in 1990 for writing a misleading memo in an effort to
end a male prostitute's probation and for allowing his House
privileges to be used for waiving parking tickets. Frank remains in
office and also sits on the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi was one of the
first to suggest that Clinton could be censured, mentioning the
idea in March. A senior Democratic official who is studying the
question of various penalties said it would not be surprising if
Democrats supported a censure or some other discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a logical political resolution of all of this,''
said Jim Jordan, the Democratic spokesman of the House Judiciary
Committee. ``At the end of the day, if whatever charges that Starr
makes don't logically dictate removal of the president of the
United States ... the members may be looking for some means to
voice disapproval for the president's behavior without
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   But is censure of a president possible? The Judiciary Committee
staff started researching the issue and was surprised to learn of
one effort to censure a president.
</P>
<P>
   It happened on March 28, 1834. Jackson, a Democrat, had vetoed
legislation that would have extended the life of the Bank of the
United States. Jackson thought the bank catered to Eastern
elitists. When the Whig party asked for documents relating to the
veto, Jackson refused to turn them over.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate then voted to censure Jackson. But Jackson, aware
that he had the support of the Democratic majority in the House,
told the Senate it had no constitutional power to censure him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lived in vain if it be necessary to enter into a formal
vindication of my character,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   After Democrats gained control of the Senate in 1836, the Senate
voted to expunge Jackson's censure from the record.

SERBIAN CANNON FIRE KILLS 3 MOTHER TERESA AID WORKERS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KIJEVO, Serbia _ Three people bringing supplies to refugees have
been killed by cannon fire from a police vehicle in what appears to
be the most serious government effort yet to harass aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   The three, all ethnic Albanians working for the Mother Teresa
relief organization, were killed on Monday as they rode on tractors
pulling wagons loaded with supplies for some of the ethnic refugees
who have fled a government military offensive in the province of
Kosovo. The number of refugees has grown to upwards of 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The wagons were piled with food and white boxes with large blue
circles bearing the name of the donor, Doctors of the World. Still,
a government statement explained the shooting by saying the police
in an armored personnel carrier could not see what was in the
wagons and became suspicious and opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred in an open field at midafternoon in the
village of Vlaski Drenovac, about two miles from here. The three
slain aid workers were local representatives of the Mother Teresa
group, which handles distribution of most international refugee
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The attack seems to confirm the suspicions of many relief
workers that the government has decided to make distributing
supplies more dangerous, both for the aid workers and the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government's military offensive, which began five
weeks ago, has hurt the rebels, but brought disaster to civilians.
International relief workers estimate as many as 20,000 homes have
been damaged or destroyed by government forces.
</P>
<P>
   With troops continuing to shell and burn villages, most refugees
are afraid to return home, or have no homes left.
</P>
<P>
   Getting adequate supplies to many of the civilians has been
impossible because they have scattered into small groups in remote
areas to avoid government attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The killings on Monday seem to follow a pattern established as
soon as the military offensive began. In the early stages, the
government refused to allow relief convoys to go to many areas
where civilians were fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under Western pressure, the government has relented
somewhat on restricting access, while tightening control in other
ways. It has blocked imports of some humanitarian supplies, and
delayed by weeks the entry visas for additional staff members that
international agencies say they need.
</P>
<P>
   The police are also harassing local employees of the agencies,
foreign officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, we are barely staggering by already, and when they
start shooting our people, that turns everything black,'' said an
international aid official.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks, aid workers have said they thought the government
might be trying to intimidate refugees to keep them away from
places where supplies were being distributed. The workers said
villagers have told them that after a delivery of supplies, the
government often shelled nearby villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like paranoia at first, but we looked a little
closer and it did not seem crazy,'' said a senior official for a
nonprofit aid agency. ``There is a lot of shelling so you can't be
absolutely sure, but if you look at where the supply convoys go and
then see what happens the next day or so, you begin to see a
pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign diplomats in Yugoslavia say they believe the
government's strategy is to make civilians pay a high cost for
their support of the rebels, who call themselves the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, one of the two republics that
make up what remains of Yugoslavia. The other is Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians are about 90 percent of the population of
Kosovo, and most of the rest are ethnic Serbs. The Kosovo
Liberation Army, as well as almost all ethnic Albanians in Kosovo,
wants to break away from Serbia to form an independent country.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say the government's tactics are inhumane and, with
aid being restricted, are likely to cause many deaths among the
refugees, especially among the infants and the elderly, and more so
as the fierce Balkan winter approaches and possibly 100,000
refugees are homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups will not be able to cope with the most basic needs of
refugees unless the offensive stops immediately, officials of the
groups say.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomacy has failed to stop the offensive, and
countries have threatened to use NATO air strikes. But diplomats
and senior aid officials say that they think air strikes may be out
of the question because the Yugoslav government could retaliate by
blocking relief supplies to the refugee population that it created.
</P>
<P>
   Government troops Tuesday continued their tactics of forcing
civilians into flight and then destroying their homes. One valley
away from the killings on Monday, dozens of homes were burning
Tuesday afternoon as tanks moved along the roads.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter was repeatedly blocked Tuesday from reaching the area
where the relief workers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Videotape of the scene Tuesday showed two tractors that had been
hit by large caliber rounds. Relief supplies in one wagon were
still burning. Villagers told reporters that the dead had been
buried at nightfall so that the police could not fire on mourners.

U.N. WAR CRIMES PANEL STEPS UP KOSOVO INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ The United Nations war crimes tribunal
is stepping up its investigations of war crimes in the Serbian
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia
has assembled a team of investigators, lawyers and military
analysts to focus exclusively on Kosovo, tribunal officials said.
Members of that team have made their first fact-finding mission to
the area and are scheduled to go again soon.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators have instructions to identify the people
responsible for the ongoing shelling and torching of civilian areas
in Kosovo. And they are examining accounts that numerous civilians,
most of them ethnic Albanians, have been kidnapped and killed in
circumstances that cannot be defined as military combat.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, thanks to additional U.N. funds earmarked for
Kosovo, the tribunal has been able to hire about a dozen new
experts. ``Kosovo is definitely one of our priorities,'' said
Graham Blewitt, the tribunal's deputy prosecutor. ``We are doing
all we can, collecting information, assembling cases and drawing up
plans for indictments.''
</P>
<P>
   Blewitt added that the tribunal was looking into war crimes by
both parties in the conflict, a comment that seemed to address the
frequent charges from Serbia that the tribunal was anti-Serb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigation involves not just Serbs but also the Kosovo
Liberation Army,'' he said. ``There are allegations of war crimes
on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the conflict in Kosovo began early this year, the U.N.
Security Council, which created the tribunal, has maintained that
the court's jurisdiction includes Kosovo. The tribunal's chief
prosecutor has repeated the point in the face of Serbian claims
that events in the province of Kosovo are an internal affair. The
tribunal was created in 1993 to prosecute war crimes in the
territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991. This jurisdiction is
ongoing and has no expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over war crimes, even as they are going on, once
again raises the question of the purpose of the tribunal and
whether it can fulfill its role to help heal war wounds and act as
a deterrent. The six trials now going at The Hague involve war
crimes from Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Seen from The Hague, where high-minded principles of
international law are repeated in the quiet corridors and
courtrooms, the events in Kosovo are remote. The horror of the
refugees and of distant burning villages is hard to fathom. Human
rights activists, aid workers and military observers report that
240,000 people, perhaps one-tenth of the population, have been left
homeless by the Serbian drive to secure Kosovo from rebels who are
fighting for independence.
</P>
<P>
   However remote the court may be from Kosovo, some tribunal
officials believe it has made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got more reports of atrocities, of summary executions,
kidnappings and murders by the Serb police earlier this year,'' one
senior official said. ``There's obviously still a lot of suffering
and destruction. But we're not getting as much evidence of
atrocities in the past few months since the prosecutor made it
clear that the tribunal is involved.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to prove, he said, ``but it is possible that
the prosecutor's several warnings have lessened the crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is also possible,'' he added, ``that the Serb military who
got more involved from June onward had different instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are looking into war crimes such as mistreatment
of civilians and prisoners of war along with arbitrary arrests,
torture and killing, all of which are not related to direct
military actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bloody and messy and violent as war is, we need to
establish there was criminal action,'' one official close to the
investigation said. ``If the Serb army is trying to retake an area,
the mere fact of shelling or bombing does not make the actions into
war crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the wanton destruction of a village that is not a military
target, where there are no military objectives or soldiers present,
that is a war crime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing lessons from their slow progress in investigating war
crimes in Bosnia and Croatia, prosecutors have changed strategy in
their work on Kosovo. Blewitt, the deputy prosecutor, said that in
Kosovo investigators would focus on people in positions of
authority, ``the people who made things happen or who could prevent
them from happening.''

<P>
   When Agnes Varis was asked to join the board of Copley
Pharmaceutical Inc. in 1992, it was not because she was expected to
hold her tongue. As president of her own chemical company in Little
Falls, N.J., she had more than two decades of industry experience.
And here was a chance to help Copley, a promising maker of generic
drugs, become a major player. ``You get a good rush from all of
that,'' Varis said.
</P>
<P>
   But that all changed when Hoechst AG, the big German
conglomerate, bought a majority stake in Copley, based in Canton,
Mass., the following year. Hoechst did not seem to appreciate
Varis' occasional dissent. ``They look for directors that are
`parsley on the fish,''' she said in an interview, describing what
she regarded as the trivial role Hoechst executives expected the
outside directors on the board to play.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Varis quit. But unlike many frustrated directors, she
did not go quietly. Instead, she publicly accused Hoechst of
mismanaging Copley and not acting in the best interests of all
investors. Hoechst had contributed to ``the steady decline of
shareholders' value,'' she wrote in a two-page resignation letter.
While Hoechst believed that what was good for it was good for
everyone else, she said, ``I cannot remember a single instance
where this turned out to be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst, which has headquarters in Frankfurt, declined to
comment specifically on any of Varis' allegations. But it says its
goals are no different from those of other shareholders, and on
Monday Copley named a new chief executive to help revive the stock.
The shares _ which closed on Nasdaq yesterday at $8.6875, down
$1.25 _ are trading at less than a fifth of what Hoechst paid for
them.``We are going to do everything we can to increase shareholder
value,'' said Patricia Munzer, a Hoechst spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Varis' story illustrates just how little power directors often
have. What happened to Copley, it seems, could befall any company
that finds itself out of favor with its majority shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Her experience also provides a fleeting glimpse of what goes on
behind the doors of a corporate boardroom. Directors rarely quit,
and even when they do, they almost never tell shareholders why.
``What goes on in the boardroom is kept in the boardroom,'' said
Julie Daum, a headhunter at Spencer Stuart in New York who
specializes in recruiting directors.
</P>
<P>
   A second Copley director, Judith Fensterer, resigned two days
after Varis did. In keeping with the directors' code of silence,
she did not return phone calls and has made no public comment.
</P>
<P>
   At 68, however, Varis was willing to rock the boat, giving up a
perch that offered both prestige and perks. In exchange for
attending a meeting once a month or so, Varis made about $20,000 a
year in director fees from Copley, not including stock options, and
Copley bought raw materials from her company, Agvar Chemicals,
purchasing about $808,000 worth in one year, much less in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By speaking out, directors are virtually guaranteed that they
will be blackballed from other boards. ``If you are an independent
director, this would be your first and last time on a board,'' said
Corinna Arnold, the director of global shareholder services for the
Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington. Varis said
she had been approached to sit on other boards since her
resignation, though she is not sure she wants to spend her time
that way.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the world was very different six years ago when Varis
joined Copley's board. The growth of generic drugs _ the unbranded
versions that come out once a pharmaceutical's patent has expired _
``was going to answer all the problems of high-priced
pharmaceuticals,'' Varis recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after her arrival, in October 1992, Copley went public,
selling its shares to investors for $12.67 apiece, adjusted for a
3-for-2 split. Analysts had nothing but praise for Jane C.I. Hirsh,
its chief executive at the time, and the stock roughly quadrupled
within its first year. When Hoechst Celanese, a unit of Hoechst,
arrived a year later, offering $546 million, or $55 a share, for a
51 percent interest, Copley did not hesitate: The deal carried an
11 percent premium to the price of the stock in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this would put Copley into another league,'' Varis
said. Hoechst Celanese would provide the much tinier Copley access
to raw materials for its drugs and first call on any of the drugs
coming off patent from Hoechst-Roussel, then its drug subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst was just as excited. As were many pharmaceutical
companies at the time, it was worried about the attacks on high
drug prices coming out of the Clinton White House, so Hoechst
viewed Copley as a way of inoculating itself from the ravages of
cost controls and managed care.
</P>
<P>
   But the honeymoon was brief, and Hoechst had every right to feel
bitterly disappointed. Within a few months, Copley was tarred in a
quality-control scandal that battered its stock. In January 1994,
Copley recalled its albuterol asthma inhalant because of possible
contamination, leading to a series of regulatory and legal
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst stood by the company, and Varis remembers working
closely with the directors originally chosen by Hoechst. They were
``very understanding,'' she said. To demonstrate her support, Varis
bought more stock, which was then trading in the low $30's.
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst proceeded to shake up Copley's management. Kenneth N.
Larsen, an industry consultant who sat on Copley's board in the
mid-1980's, was named interim president in November 1994. The next
May, Hirsh was demoted to president of international business, and
Larsen became chairman. Gabriel R. Cipau, a pharmaceutical
executive, was brought in as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Hoechst, like many of its peers, including Merck and
Warner-Lambert, was starting to lose interest in the generic
business. With brutal competition and low and erratic profit
margins, ``no one was making any money,'' said Viren Mehta of Mehta
Partners, a biopharmaceuticals investment firm in New York. With
their profits no longer in danger from a Washington-directed health
care overhaul, most pharmaceutical companies wanted out.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, Hoechst told investors and analysts that it
no longer considered generics part of its ``core'' strategy. In
October, Copley hired Oppenheimer &AMP; Company as an investment banker
to look into its options, including a possible sale.
</P>
<P>
   The company was in limbo. Cipau, the chief executive, had
departed in mid-1996. When Larsen, who took over temporarily as
president, stepped down in early 1997 for health reasons, no one
replaced him. Copley would not say who was actually in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst's lack of interest in Copley also displayed itself in
the boardroom, where directors came and went. Under the current
arrangement, Hoechst names three of the nine board members, and it
has chosen 10 different people over the last five years to
represent it. ``There is no continuity,'' Varis complained.
</P>
<P>
   The change in directors simply reflects the upheaval at Hoechst,
said Munzer, the company spokeswoman. All of the choices have been
``high caliber,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the tension among the directors began to build. Varis
said her relationship with the Hoechst directors was ``cordial but
not one of respect.'' Those directors always voted in unison, she
said, apparently following whatever orders came out of Frankfurt.
Only Fensterer seemed to share her goal of representing all the
shareholders, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Varis continued to speak up at board meetings, prompting an
effort by the Hoechst directors last year to force her off the
board, she said. They lobbied the Copley inside directors to drop
her from the renomination slate. Varis demanded that they provide a
specific reason for their opposition. When the Copley directors
decided not to go along, Hoechst backed down, she said. Hoechst
would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   For a year, the one thing the board agreed upon was the decision
to sell Copley. ``It was the only time we worked together,'' said
Varis, who was part of the team in charge of finding a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of 1997, just short of settling on a final price
with an undisclosed buyer, Varis began to sense that something was
amiss. She was informed in a telephone call that Hoechst had
changed its mind because of concerns over recognizing a loss of
several hundred million dollars on its investment. ``It was almost
like, `Oops, we just found out,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Varis and the rest of the negotiating team scrambled to
come up with alternatives, Hoechst refused to consider a sale until
at least 1999. At Copley's annual meeting, the company dismissed
its investment banker. Frustrated by what she believed were
Hoechst's missteps, Varis quit on July 24.
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst officials never considered ``the devastating effect
their actions would have on the value of Copley's shares, the total
demoralization of Copley's employees and the deleterious effect on
Copley's reputation as an ongoing company,'' Varis said in her
resignation letter.
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst said its decision was in keeping with its goal of
maximizing shareholder value. ``When the time is right, we will
look for a sale,'' Munzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has lost about 40 percent of its value since Copley
first retained Oppenheimer. The company's 1997 sales, about $121
million, were down from a peak of $142 million in 1995 and were
about what Copley generated in 1994. Without burdensome recall and
legal costs, Copley finally eked out a profit last year of $2.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it's surviving,'' said David Saks, a managing
director at Gruntal &AMP; Company, who says he believes that most of
the company's troubles are behind it but is still not recommending
the stock to investors.
</P>
<P>
   But while some other generic companies have started to prosper,
Copley has struggled without steady management and the capital it
needs, said Steven B. Gerber, an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Gene M. Bauer, Copley's general counsel, conceded that Copley
``has been rocked by things.'' He said that the board was actively
looking to replace Varis and Fensterer. He points to four
consecutive quarters of profitability and numerous approvals for
new drugs as evidence of a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment this week of Daniel L. Korpolinski as chief
executive is another step. But Korpolinski's record is spotty.
While he was chief executive of Cocensys, a biotechnology company,
the stock fell from its 1993 initial offering price of $9 a share
to around $6.50 by the time he stepped down in late 1996. It now
trades at around $1. ``I don't think he was a great manager,'' said
Jim McMamant, an analyst in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   And Hoechst is under no obligation to consider other interests.
Directors ``are supposed to act in the best interest of
shareholders, writ large,'' but a majority owner has no such duty,
said John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia
University. The shareholder, he added, can do what it wants for its
own ``petty, selfish reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Copley, it never informed investors in any of its public
filings that two directors had resigned. Shareholders found out
only because Varis issued her own press release and, in the course
of answering questions, the company said there had been another
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Varis said she left the board only when she decided she could do
more for Copley as an outsider. But she wanted to make sure that
the six years as a director had not been wasted, and she refused to
remain silent. ``How could I ever do that?'' she asked.

ZENGA TO BE '99 SEASON PLAYER-COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Walter Zenga plans to not only coach the Revolution
through the remainder of the MLS season but to return as
player-coach next season.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga was hired to replace Thomas Rongen after Saturday's 5-1
loss to the Los Angeles Galaxy Saturday in a surprising move that
was announced Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The change was so swift that Zenga, who had arrived for a
halftime tribute, had to return to Italy to gather his possessions
for a move to back to his Newton, Mass. residence. His first
practice as coach will be Friday at Babson College in preparation
for Sunday's visit to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I have to say is that I have the greatest
respect for Thomas Rongen,'' Zenga said Tuesday from Milan. ``He is
one of the best coaches I've know and I respect him very much. So,
then what can I do now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I will try to find a way to bring my mentality to the players
and develop a team that the fans and the city of Boston, and the
players themselves, will respect. It's very important to say that
no one loses, 5-1, at home; it's a matter of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team has to have the will to win. When we go to Miami, and
if they are the better team and they win, compliments to them. But
we have to have the will to win and to play for pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga, whose goalkeeping helped the Revolution qualify for last
year's playoffs before he retired, will leave many of the coaching
decisions to assistant Sid Mazzola, who has been a scout for the
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't make big changes,'' Zenga said. ``I'm not David
Copperfield. I will be satisfied if we can perform respectably and
put on a good show for the great crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to return to the Revolution, but not so soon. I
wanted to talk to Thomas after the game about what I might be able
to do to help him and the team next year. But it wasn't the right
time after a loss like that. Still, I wasn't thinking anything
about this year for myself, but about what we could do next year.
The way this happened, it's carpe diem.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga, nicknamed Spiderman for his goalkeeping style, is
expected to use the connections he developed in nearly 20 years of
playing in Europe. His agent, Giovanni Branchini, represents many
of the world's best players, and has worked closely with MLS deputy
commissioner Sunil Gulati, who is in charge of player acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have six games to do what we can, then we can do more after
the season,'' Zenga, 38, said. ``In the future, we want to have a
competitive team. We need to analyze what to do. We have 30,000
fans coming to the stadium, and these fans are important, and they
need to have a good team to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not coming just for a few months but for a long time. I
am young and I have time. I want to contribute something important
to Boston sports and I hope I can.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for next year, it is my dream to be a player-coach, and I
need someone next to me to help me do it, and that's Sid Mazzola. I
will use my connections with Inter to help the Revolution, and one
thing I hope to do is to bring Inter here _ I've already had
discussions with them _ for a game.''
</P>

   General manager Brian O'Donovan said Zenga has been hired as
interim coach and his status for next year is undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity to check each other out for the last
six games of a fairly dismal season,'' O'Donovan said. ``Walter
intends to maintain a connection to the MLS in the future, and for
us, that includes any and all options, including being
player-coach.''

 &HT;    Panel sees itself as information source
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In assessing their own situations, members of the
Atlanta Y2K Users Group began to wonder about their exposure to
potential Y2K breakdowns at such public services as utilities,
hospitals, and water and sewer services.
</P>
<P>
   Out of these concerns sprang a subset of the users group, the
Common Services Committee, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to its current chairman, Paul H. Arne, an attorney
with Morris, Manning &AMP; Martin, the committee was the brainchild of
Atlanta consultant Ted Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   He perceived such a committee could perform a public service of
its own and avoid much duplication of effort by acting in concert.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to Arne, the committee has about 10 to 15 members
in attendance at its regular monthly meetings. They supply
information to 114 companies, at last count _ companies such as
Equifax, BellSouth and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The committee doesn't plan to use publicity to further its aims.
These include not only the determination of potential problem areas
but also a plan to offer help from the participating companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view our role as providing information to the Year 2000
Users Group, with the idea being that, if you tell over 100 of the
largest companies in Atlanta whether a particular government agency
has a credible Year 2000 program or not, then you can help those
agencies without strong Year 2000 programs get the resources they
need,'' said Arne.
</P>
<P>
   The information the committee gathers will go into computer
spreadsheets and will cover the Year 2000 plans from 125 to 200
city, state, and county organizations and agencies in the Metro
area.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is in the process of sending out letters to these
such common services requesting a contact name. Those that don't
respond will get another letter in about 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   All these organizations, whether or not they answer the letters,
will hear from the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are getting the information eat and breathe
Year 2000, and they know how to separate true information from
assurances without substance,'' Arne said.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the committee's work is available to members
of the Atlanta Year 2000 Users Group. Membership is open and free.

 &HT;    Gingrich takes stand against government investigation into
Microsoft
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (f) Financial and (w) Washington categories.)
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A month before the Justice Department's antitrust
lawsuit against Microsoft is to be heard in federal court, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich on Tuesday defended the embattled software
giant and questioned the government's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich attributed some of the criticism of the Justice
Department to the Seattle area's congressional delegation, which
has strongly supported Microsoft, based in the Seattle suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But the speaker, in his own words, accused the federal
government of ``trying to destroy jobs at one of America's leading
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said Congress would investigate allegations that the
Justice Department had encouraged foreign governments to sue
Microsoft over allegedly monopolistic practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we're going to work very hard to get to the
bottom of, because it's entirely inappropriate,'' Gingrich said.
``The purpose of the American government is to strengthen American
companies in the world market ... not undermine American
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said the
allegations against the department are ``completely false.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Microsoft executives were on hand for Gingrich's speech
at a fund-raising breakfast for Republican Rep. Rick White, whose
district includes Microsoft's campus and founder Bill Gates'
spectacular home.
</P>
<P>
   In another show of support for Microsoft, Gingrich omitted from
his standard speech an anecdote about a ring made by Sun
Microsystems Inc., a Silicon Valley computer firm, that contains a
tiny computer.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich frequently displays the ring to his audiences to
illustrate the pace of change.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear why Gingrich moved away from the impartial stance
on Microsoft that he adopted in January, when he visited the
company and met with Gates. He refused to answer questions about
his remarks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 20 states filed suit in May, charging
that Microsoft is trying to corner the market on access to the
Internet by tying its Web browser to its already dominant operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft denies the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The case is scheduled for trial Sept. 23 in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Microsoft had been virtually absent from the
political arena. But the company has given $200,000 in cash and
computer equipment to Republican groups this year and thousands
more to individual candidates.
</P>
<P>
   It has gotten a better reception in the House than in the
Senate, where the Senate Judiciary Committee has held hearings on
Microsoft's practices.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning today, Gingrich is setting aside his campaign activity
for a few days of travel through Washington and Alaska with the
Western States Coalition, a property-rights group that opposes
federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich will travel with the speakers of the Washington and
Alaska Houses of Representatives to environmentally sensitive areas
for what Gingrich said is a chance for ``Easterners to have a
better sense of the scale and complexity of the West and a better
understanding of Western issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brian O'Donnell, spokesman for the Alaska Wilderness League,
said conservation groups have been excluded from the trip. ``It
will be as one-sided as a Cuban election,'' he said.

 &HT;    Web sites search out new ways to hang on to surfers
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Memo to Web surfers everywhere: Knock it off.
</P>
<P>
   Find one comprehensive site and stay there. Search there. Shop
there. Check your mail there. Read the news there. Monitor the
stock market there. Plan your day there. Build a Web site there.
Surf on over. Stay a while.
</P>
<P>
   The newest scheme Web sites are adopting to eke out some kind of
profit is to load up their sites with additional products and
services in addition to their core businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo (http://www.yahoo.com) was perhaps the first company to
realize people conducting searches find what they want and leave.
To stop that disturbing trend, Yahoo has added a variety of new
services including phone service and a travel service.
</P>
<P>
   CNNfn (http://www.cnnfn.com), the Cable News Network's financial
Web site, plans to add a shopping area before the end of the year.
City-sites are also trying to hold on to audiences who have already
gotten into the habit of stopping by for local news and
entertainment information.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Interactive Media, which operates AccessAtlanta (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .accessatlanta.com), is planning a redesign of its 21
city-specific sites to include search capabilities aimed at
attracting a broader audience to the site. Both companies are owned
by Cox Enterprises Inc., which also owns The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that everybody is thinking about portals,'' says Lisa
Allen, a senior research analyst at Forrester Research. ``There is
an epidemic case of portal envy, and it seems to be contagious
because it first appeared at the national level.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, CNNfn, one of the most popular financial sites on the
Web, announced it had taken an equity stake in C2B Technologies to
integrate an electronic commerce shopping area into the CNNfn site.
Craig Forman, vice president of CNNfn Interactive, says the area
will launch before the end of the year. The C2B shopping service
will include e-commerce as well as e-commerce comparison shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Kim Whelan, CNNfn's vice president of business
development, says the addition of e-commerce to the CNNfn site is a
natural evolution for the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found out on CNNfn is something that we've known for
quite a while _ our users are a well-heeled, educated bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Most are middle-aged males with an average income of $87,000.
CNNfn users are also slightly ahead of the curve when it comes to
making purchases on the Web. Statistics show they've bought more
books, software and airline tickets. Like the TV networks who
understand the money to be made from a night of ``must see TV,''
media Web sites are just beginning to see it's not enough to have
users surf through your site. You've got to do something to make
them stay a while.
</P>
<P>
   Developing sites that will engage users for more than a minute
or two is a dramatic shift from the way Web sites were developed in
the Internet's infancy only three or four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, it was all about breaking news and finding
news on the Internet,'' says CNNfn's Forman. ``We realized the Web
was something people wanted to come to for breaking news.'' But in
1998, CNNfn, finds itself with a huge loyal audience checking in
every day. (Measurement firm Relevant Knowledge ranks it the fourth
most-visited commercial network site on the Web). With 87 percent
of CNNfn's users returning daily and with research indicating they
are established e-commerce customers, the Web site decided to
provide shopping resources to keep users on the CNNfn site.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Cox Interactive Media, which oversees not only Access
Atlanta, but the sites around the country, users already get local
news and information courtesy of Cox companies such as this
newspaper as well as a variety of nationwide media partners. CIM
says the advantage of being ``the home team'' in each of these
markets is a key drawing point, but the goal is to draw even more
users into the site and keep them there. By mid-September, Access
Atlanta and Cox sites nationwide will add a search engine called
``LookSmart.'' It offers intelligent Web searches delivering local
Web information first followed by national and international
information.
</P>
<P>
   George deGolian, acting general manager of CIM's Atlanta studio,
says the addition of a search engine will draw more users to the
site including women and minorities _ two of the most rapidly
growing user groups on the Web. ``A few months ago we determined we
had a clear leadership in this space,'' deGolian says. ``Then we
looked at the Net as a whole and we realized the number one thing
people do on the Web is search.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The average Web user doesn't spend much time on the Web'' adds
marketing manager Beth Goldstein. ``We want to offer both features
and functionality _ a place where users will want to stay longer
because of the information we are able to provide. We don't want
users to visit our sites for local information and then hop off to
Yahoo! to look into buying a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrester's Allen calls this kind of tactic, whether it's adding
e-commerce to CNNfn or a high-powered search engine to Access
Atlanta ``sticky products.'' She says the goal of ``sticky
products'' is to get users to go a site and stay there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's enough to say, 'We want to be your first
stop when you log on to the Internet,''' she says. ``A better
approach is to not only strive to be the first site, but the site
where users spend the most time. You want users to spend time and
enjoy it. You don't want users to just walk. ``

 &HT;    SynQuest lets execs weigh pros, cons of various strategies
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Your company is expanding rapidly, but where do you
put a new plant? It's a big decision that has wrecked many an
expanding company.
</P>
<P>
   But what's dangerous for many companies is a marketing
opportunity for Joe Trino and his Atlanta-based SynQuest. His
company makes industrial-strength software that helps chief
executives make big decisions about such things as new plant
openings.
</P>
<P>
   The software is called supply chain optimization, but what that
means is simple. Trino's software analyzes company and market
information in a way that lets top executives weigh the advantages
of various strategies.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, it lets executives identify scenarios with the
highest potential for profit and the lowest costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was doing this, and we saw an opportunity,'' says
Trino. When he began four years ago, the market was small, but it
is now growing rapidly. There were, for example, $420 million in
sales in 1996 _ a figure industry forecasts peg to reach $2.7
billion by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   While SynQuest has competition now, its software is unique, and
competition is limited to a handful of companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a very competitive suite of software,'' says Craig
Gustin, a principal of industry consultant CGR Management.
``SynQuest offers what only a few others in the industry do.''
</P>
<P>
   And more and more companies are looking for decision-making
software.
</P>
<P>
   SynQuest is garnering an increasingly big piece of that growing
pie. It had revenue of $20 million for fiscal 1998, which ended
June 30, up 145 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Trino says the company's growth is on track to reach $200
million in revenue by the end of the century. It plans to add 100
employees this year alone, expanding the staff to 300.
</P>
<P>
   If growth continues at this pace, Trino plans to go public
sometime in the first half of 1999. ``We're running now as a public
company,'' says Trino, explaining the release of the sales figure
by his private company.
</P>
<P>
   Trino is no stranger to the market of corporate planning
software. He has been in the business for nearly 20 years,
including a long stint with Dun &AMP; Bradstreet Software.
</P>
<P>
   He jumped ship in the early 1990s to money manager venture
capital firm Warburg Pincus. His assignment was to figure out the
next big market for planning software. After interviewing the top
computer consultants and industrial companies, he reached a
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they saw was software that would orchestrate planning,
marketing and distribution,'' says Trino. ``Our strategy became to
found such a company through acquisitions and internal growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort began in 1994, when Warburg Pincus bought a New
York-based corporate planner. The company was moved to Atlanta.
Eventually four other companies were bought and added to this
original venture.
</P>
<P>
   Today, SynQuest serves some of the country's largest industrial
concerns. Those companies include Ford, golf ball maker Titlelist
and the packaged cereal giant, Kellogg.
</P>
<P>
   While there's one $10 million contract, most of SynQuest's other
deals are in the $550,000 range. It signed up 12 new customers in
the last four months alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is growing, and we are growing with it,'' says
Trino. ``We have significantly raised our visibility and are very
well positioned.''

 &HT;    It'll take a fancy suitor to wed BellSouth, analyst says
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bell Atlantic has done it, so has NYNEX.
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications and Ameritech want to do it.
</P>
<P>
   So, when will BellSouth?
</P>
<P>
   A well-known Wall Street analyst says Atlanta-based BellSouth,
the larger of the two baby Bells still unspoken for, was not likely
to merge without a long courtship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know BellSouth pretty well and based on that we feel pretty
confident about their competitive position,'' said Jim Ferency, of
Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. ``But if the right company came along with the
right offer at the right time? They might reconsider. But knowing
BellSouth, I think they are very confident both domestically and
internationally. They have terrific growth on the bottom line and a
highly regarded senior management team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think they look in the mirror every day and feel
pretty good about who they are,'' he said. ``And when you feel
pretty good you're not likely to do anything rash.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferency spoke at the Georgia Center for Advanced
Telecommunications Technology recently, addressing a roomful of
telecommunications executives, lawyers and researchers about the
massive rash of mergers and acquisitions in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   He said the urge to merge is fueled by federal telecom
deregulation, an until-recently surging stockmarket and low
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The combined value of newly wed U.S. companies in 1985 was $241
billion. In the first two quarters of 1998 alone, the combined
value of merged U.S. companies was $907 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ferency said mergers within the domestic telecom industry are
growing as a percentage of overall domestic mergers. Since 1997,
telecom stocks have outperformed the market by 20 percent, Ferency
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, the music's going to stop. At some point,
someone's going to be left without a chair.'' he said. ``But for
now, there is still a lot of robust activity. I hate to sound like
a broken record, but if you're in the market place, it's a pretty
good place to be doing business.''

   ONE NUMBER, TO GO
</P>
<P>
   Those 10 digits follow
</P>
<P>
   you around under a
</P>
<P>
   new plan from BellSouth
</P>
<P>
   By Michael E. Kanell
</P>
<P>
   STAFF WRITER
</P>
<P>
   One number, wherever you go and no matter what company carries
the call _ BellSouth says the technology is now ready.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, telecommunications experts have predicted the
advent of ``number portability,'' a world in which customers would
carry their phone numbers with them. Federal and state regulators
have mandated such a system, although they have postponed the
deadlines for making it happen.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is basic for customers, who would seldom change phone
carriers if they got a new number that would have to be passed
along to friends, family and clients. Naturally, the idea is also
critical for competition in local service, since virtually no one
would leave BellSouth _ or go back to it _ if they had to surrender
their number with each shift.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, BellSouth Corp. announced completion of a $425 million
project that permits number portability in metro Atlanta, although
at first it will be limited to when customers make changes in
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the ability to carry a number anywhere _ including to
other parts of the country, signaling the end of area codes as an
indicator of a customer's location _ is only a matter of time,
requiring regulatory oversight and changes in other networks. The
technology is here.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's two-year effort involved several thousand
technicians in eight states, 300 software developers and scores of
engineers and systems analysts, said Doug McDougal, director of
local number portability for the $21 billion-a-year company.
</P>
<P>
   The revision in software and hardware covers millions of access
lines, reshaping the century-old method for routing phone calls, he
said. ``This is the most complex project ever undertaken in the
history of telecommunications.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday, when the new system went into effect in metro
Atlanta, each local phone company would ``own'' a set of numbers.
Rivals to BellSouth have complained the company unfairly hoarded
all the ``designer'' numbers, parsing out less-desirable exchanges
and combinations. But the new system eliminates that notion of
ownership, BellSouth says.
</P>
<P>
   Now, any call in the Southeast made through BellSouth's network
_ or the network of a rival programmed for number portability _
will be passed through a huge database managed by Lockheed Martin.
That database is intended to include all the numbers in the region.
``In this new environment, the numbers don't belong to anyone,''
said BellSouth spokesman John Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth currently faces competition, mostly for the local
service needs of large companies, a market more lucrative to serve
than residents. Only MGC Communications and MediaOne now offer
consumers a choice in local service. Jim Mitchell, general manager
for MGC, said the new system could eliminate confusion among
customers who fret about having a different number.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Baker, public service commissioner, stopped short of saying
portability would be enough to persuade the PSC to endorse
BellSouth's request to offer long-distance but called the
announcement ``a big step in the right direction in opening up the
local market.''
</P>
<P>
   At least until Monday, customers using a competing carrier would
keep their number, but only because their calls were routed from
that number _ which BellSouth continued to ``own'' _ to a number
owned by their new carrier.

 &HT;    CST's Jacada software builds bridge to Internet, intranet
 &HT;    By John Ghirardini
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta software-maker CST is in the business of
breathing new life into dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   No, not the long-extinct creatures whose massive skeletons and
razor-sharp teeth inspire awe in natural history museums. The
beasts CST stalks are mainframe computers too extensive, too
entrenched or too expensive to be replaced by the networked-PC
setup prevalent in many companies today.
</P>
<P>
   CST's signature product is Jacada, a software package that
transforms a mainframe's utilitarian ``green screen'' into a
graphical display that allows point-and-click operation instead of
tedious and arcane command input in which computer commands are
typed. The software also extends a mainframe's software
applications to the Internet or an intranet.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-year-old company has propelled itself into the No. 2
market share in ``Web-to-host'' integration, a part of the computer
world an International Data Corp. study concludes will be a
billion-dollar-plus business by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Mainframes ``won't be going away in our lifetimes,'' said Mike
Potts, president of CST's North American operations. ``With people
having invested millions in Y2K compliancy, it looks like they'll
be here for perpetuity.''
</P>
<P>
   The mainframe market is actually growing, Potts said. Last year,
for example, IBM alone sold more than 60,000 AS/400 computers, a
small mainframe intended for small- to medium-size companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacada is a family line with several derivative products which
will give us great market opportunity beyond the year 2000,'' Potts
said. ``The technology takes advantage of all the skills (mainframe
programmers) have as they try to bridge to Internet and intranet
technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Saab Cars USA, which has its headquarters in Norcross, is in the
process of installing Jacada to work with two different mainframes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jacada project gave us a very friendly user interface,''
said John Jacobs, Saab's manager of retailer and field information
systems. The company may be using two mainframes, but with Jacada
the screen view from either is the same for the end user, Jacobs
said. Saab expects to have the system up and running by early
October, Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   CST recently completed an agreement with Gulfstream Aerospace
Corp., a company best known for its corporate-jet business, to
install the Jacada software in its mainframe-based applications.
Gulfstream has offices in Savannah and in Long Beach, Calif.

 &HT;    WebMD may cure what ails HBO &AMP; Co.
 &HT;    By John Ghirardini
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ HBO &AMP; Co.'s investment in WebMD Inc. may be just what
the doctor ordered for both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based HBO is a health information systems provider that
racked up more than a billion and a half dollars in revenue last
year. On Monday it said it had acquired a 5 percent stake in WebMD
for $10 million. HBOC Chief Financial Officer Jay Gilbertson will
assume a seat on WebMD's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD, founded as Endeavor Technologies in 1994 by Jeff Arnold,
provides Internet access and services to physicians in 32 states.
This week WebMD announced the name change to reflect its focus on
Internet-based services. WebMD offers medical reference, physician
home pages, a national directory of doctors, communication services
and online clinical data.
</P>
<P>
   Each company offered a market the other coveted.
</P>
<P>
   ``WebMD offers a tremendous opportunity to gain access to the
physician desktop by providing superior Internet-based services to
physicians and their patients,'' said Charles McCall, HBO's
chairman and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   HBOC already provides patient test results and and health
information library services as part of WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, WebMD will gain access to HBO's Web-based
applications and its market presence, Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD has embarked on a plan to put 60,000 computers on
physicians' desks around the nation over the next year. ``We're
basically giving the computers away to the doctors at no cost to be
able to help them get on the Net and to seed the market,'' Arnold
said.

 &HT;    It's Earnhardt vs. Earnhartd at Coca-Cola
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dale Earnhardt and Dale Earnhardt Jr., one of NASCAR's
hottest father-and-son duos, will confirm today that they will
compete for the first time during the Coca-Cola 500, in Motegi,
Japan, on Nov. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The Earnhardts will make the announcement at 11 a.m. at
Atlanta's World of Coca-Cola, where they will unveil the special
Coca-Cola-themed Chevrolet Monte Carlos they'll drive during the
post-season exhibition event.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr.'s car, which is black, will feature the Coca-Cola
polar bear, while his father's car, which is red, has Coca-Cola's
red disk icon and Coke's NASCAR-inspired checkered flag contour
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   After the race, the cars are expected to be used by Coca-Cola
during promotional events, and both drivers will return to their
usual cars. Earnhardt Jr., who has won five Busch series races and
leads the point standings, drives an AC Delco-sponsored blue Chevy
Monte Carlo; Earnhardt Sr., a seven-time Winston Cup champion and
winner of this year's Daytona 500, drives a Goodwrench-sponsored
black Chevy Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in April, the 23-year-old Earnhardt Jr. credited
his father with being a major influence on his career. ``I feel I
need to prove myself to him more than anybody else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He'll get that chance in the Coca-Cola 500, which will feature
other firsts. The race, to be broadcast on TBS, will be the first
sponsored by Coca-Cola Japan and will also be the race's first
running at Motegi's new 1.5-mile track.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico held the NASCAR sponsorship for more than 40 years until
Jan. 1, when Atlanta-based Coca-Cola began a five-year sponsorship
agreement. Coca-Cola is spending an estimated $30 million to
execute its NASCAR strategy.
</P>
<P>
   A key element of that strategy is promoting ``the Coca-Cola
Racing Family,'' whose members include the Earnhardts; Dale, Ned
and Jason Jarrett; and Kyle, Adam and Patty Petty.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the sponsorship plan does not include putting a driver
behind the wheel of a Coca-Cola car for NASCAR's main season. It's
been more than 20 years since that was done, when Bobby Allison
drove for Coca-Cola.

 &HT;    Singh, Singh, Singh: Vijay aims for three wins in a row
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He reminds us why it's the name of the game. Why
people do it for dough. Why Dave Pelz is in business.
</P>
<P>
   Putting.
</P>
<P>
   For the average player, it represents about 40 percent of
strokes burned on the golf course. For the average tour pro, it's
the difference between being Vijay Singh over the past two weeks or
getting lost in his exhaust fumes.
</P>
<P>
   Singh's two-week ascension to the top of the PGA Tour money list
with consecutive wins in the PGA Championship and Sprint
International is no mystery. Known for the hundreds of range balls
he hits every day, Singh in the past two months has started making
eagle putts instead of three-putting for pars. Birdie putts that
seldom found the hole for a player who brandished everything but a
Power Pod are now falling with impressive regularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, he's mad if he misses a 15-footer,'' says Davis Love III.
``Before, he just felt lucky if he made one every once in a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Filled with confidence instead of doubt, Singh, who switched to
a cross-handed putting grip at the suggestion of his wife two
months ago, now has a complete game to play with anyone. His PGA
Tour colleagues always knew that if Singh's putter ever sang, with
such ball-striking skills already established, he had the potential
for a streak like this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always wondered why he hit so many balls,'' Love was
saying Monday at Callaway Gardens, where he attended Media Day as
the Buick Challenge's defending champion. ``He hit it so good and
he hit it so long, you figured he ought to be putting most of the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, as the pros know best, it's usually a matter
of mind over technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of it is just getting confidence and getting on a
roll,'' Love said. ``Guys play good in streaks, like David Duval.
All of a sudden he won and got some confidence and had a great
streak there. Now, he's not really doing that much. It's just as
easy to get off it as it is to get on it. Vijay's on it right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a scary thought: Now that Singh is feeling secure with
his putting, imagine how much time he might spend on the range,
where nobody outlasts him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you could if you got there 30 minutes before he's
done,'' Love said, ``or if you stay after dark. It's always a joke
that he wears out caddies because he stays out there so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing this week at the NEC World Series of Golf in Akron,
Ohio, Singh tries for three in a row, which Duval managed last
fall. Assuredly, two in a row, with the second following a major,
was strong enough. Love tied for ninth at the NEC last year, when
the tournament followed his PGA win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to do because you're still on cloud nine,''
Love said. ``But Vijay's a different guy. He's very, very focused
on what he's doing. It's like he says, `My family is very important
to me, but I'm obsessed with golf.' ''

   Daly dilemmas
</P>
<P>
   People who observe John Daly regularly don't like the signals
he's been sending. Snapped clubs. Failing to sign a scorecard. Big
numbers at the end of a Friday round to miss the cut. Weight out of
control. It doesn't take a cynic to wonder whether Daly is setting
himself up for another fall. If Daly blows his shot with Callaway
Golf, it might be his last. He is scheduled to play in the Dunhill
Cup at St. Andrews in October as the partner of Tiger Woods and
Mark O'Meara, but he might ask to be replaced. ``I wouldn't help
Mark and Tiger right now,'' Daly said. ``I'd only be hurting the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Buick Challenge field
</P>
<P>
   While Daly has said he will play ``only the fun events'' through
the remainder of the year and no more official PGA Tour events,
Buick Challenge officials still are expecting him at Callaway
Gardens Oct. 1-4. Tournament director Bob Berry reports official
commitments from defending champion Davis Love III, David Duval,
Stewart Cink, Scott Hoch, Jeff Sluman, Justin Leonard, Andrew
Magee, Fred Funk and David Frost. The purse has been upped to $1.5
million, with $270,000 to the winner. Georgia Tech's Matt Kuchar,
the tournament's Haskins Award winner, has accepted a sponsor's
exemption.

<P>
   Homeland havoc distracts Els
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els deeply loves his homeland of South Africa and calls
his residence there in the Western Cape Province ``the most
beautiful place on the planet.'' Lately, however, it has been
nothing short of frightening. Earlier this year, after Els' home
was burglarized, the man who stole his jeep was killed in a crash
with the vehicle. Recently, a crazed farmer who used to work for
one of Els' neighbors, ran through Els' house and three others,
killing four people. ``He ripped out the alarm system and just went
berserk,'' Els said. ``Thank God there was nobody in my house.''
Whether the incidents have affected Els' recent play is difficult
to determine. Back problems were probably more of a factor. In any
case, it was a mediocre year for Els in the majors. He tied for
16th in the Masters, tied for 49th in the U.S. Open as defending
champion, tied for 29th in the British Open and tied for 21st at
the PGA. ``I'm a little bit disappointed, but there's always next
year,'' said Els.
</P>
<P>
   Chip shots
</P>
<P>
   Known for his rigorous exercise regimen, Gary Player had a quick
reply when told he was behind only Mike Fetchick, who won the 1985
Hilton Head Seniors Invitational on his 63rd birthday, in the race
for oldest player to win a Senior PGA Tour event. ``I'll have to do
some more sit-ups, that's all,'' said Player, who will turn 63 on
Nov. 1. . . . LaGrange's Allen Doyle won the Senior Series event
and $15,000 at Stonebridge Golf Club in Albany on Sunday, marking
his first victory since turning 50. Doyle shot rounds of 68-68-66
to win by four shots over Horacio Carbonetti. . . . Atlanta's Billy
Andrade suggests that Mark McGwire occasionally might be able to
knock a ball past Woods. Having seen McGwire's strength with a golf
ball as a former partner at the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am,
Andrade said, ``For length, I think he and Tiger would have a
battle.'' Andrade has seen McGwire hit the 18th green at Pebble
Beach in two _ with a driver and a 5-iron. Two years ago at Pebble
Beach Woods was the only to hit the 18th green in two, with a
3-wood. . . . Love and Leonard, who met head-to-head on the closing
day of the 1997 PGA Championship, will play a ``Shell's Wonderful
World of Golf'' match Sept. 29 at Winged Foot.

 &HT;    Looking for a Seminole-buster? Try Virginia
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ If there is to be a challenge to Florida
State's supremacy in the Atlantic Coast Conference, many feel its
going to come out of this place known simply as ``Mr. Jefferson's
University.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the usually conservative George Welsh has pronounced this
year's Virginia team as capable. Football success is nothing new to
Welsh: Virginia has won seven or more games for 11 consecutive
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have the experience and we have the talent to win
more than seven games,'' Welsh said. ``We project to be a better
team early in the season than we were last year. You've got to have
some luck and some breaks, and you've got to stay healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's for sure that Welsh will find out early just how good his
Cavaliers may be. Auburn and Virginia tangle on national television
Sept. 3 in a game at Jordan-Hare Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for Welsh's optimism are that the Cavaliers might have
their best defensive unit in history and most of the skill
positions are back on offense.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Rick Lantz pronounced this his fastest
team since he's been in Charlottesville, as nine of last year's 11
starters return.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, quarterback Aaron Brooks, who finished the year as
the ACC's leading passer, opens with the confidence he lacked last
season. Tailback Thomas Jones, who rushed for 692 yards in '97, is
the top returning rusher in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jones has had a good pre-season, I must admit,'' Welsh said.
``And Brooks is much more accurate now than he was last year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a veteran ball club here,'' said the 5-10, 210-pound
Jones. ``With the people we've got coming back, I think we could
win every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks concurs. ``We're a very patient offense. We take whatever
a defensve gives us. Auburn is a very big game, because we have to
go and play in front of 80,000 people in a hostile environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Cavs got off to a 1-2 start, dropping their
opener to Auburn 28-17 and getting trounced by North Carolina two
games later 48-20.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a lot further along this year than we were last year,''
tight end Casey Crawford said. ``I think opening against Auburn, a
highly regarded team from the SEC, has helped us stay focused. We
know what happened when we played them last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lantz' defense is what might put the Cavs over the FSU hump.
Everyone returns except defensive backs Stephen Phelan and Joe
Williams, but safety Adrian Burnim and corner Antwan Harris saw
extensive action as reserves in '97.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive line is intact, with Antonio Dingle and Johnny
Shivers at tackles and senior Patrick Kerney and junior Travis
Griffith at ends.
</P>
<P>
   All-America candidate Anthony Poindexter will keep things
running smoothly from his safety spot, but the 6-1 senior wanted to
talk more offense than defense. ``Aaron shredded us,'' Poindexter
said. ``He's playing with a confidence I've never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   The lone question mark about this team is the kicking game.
Welsh hasn't settled on his punter or placekicker, but he says that
he's not worried. ``We don't have enough depth in certain areas, if
you want to talk about things that concern me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Virginia gets by Auburn, the Cavs have all of their tough
games at home except for Florida State on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh, 65, has said he wants to stick around long enough to put
together a serious run at a national title. He was asked if this
could be the start of that run. ``I don't know,'' he said. ``You
got to have a lot of luck, and you've got to stay healthy.''

 &HT;    Corner is pricey parcel
 &HT;    By Tinah Saunders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A generous gift made more than 70 years ago by a
grateful city to its battle-weary sons may cost Atlanta nearly $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1926, Atlanta officials sold a parcel of land adjacent to
Piedmont Park to the American Legion's Post No. 1 as a site for a
meeting hall. The nearly two-thirds acre at 1071 Piedmont Ave. went
for the token price of $100, but the deed restricted use of the
land for ``the purpose of erecting a home'' for the Argonne Post of
the American Legion, as Post No. 1 was known at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, Mayor William B. Hartsfield removed the restrictions by
signing a quit-claim deed, giving ``complete or unrestricted title
to the post and its heirs and assigns'' for the consideration of $1
more.
</P>
<P>
   Today, that property is valued at nearly $1 million by the
Fulton County Tax Assessor's Office. And it is on the market, now
that aging members of Post No. 1, who find maintaining the property
a burden, have voted to sell the land and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are under way with the Piedmont Park Conservancy,
which is trying to find funding for the purchase. Neither party has
revealed the asking price.
</P>
<P>
   Although the property is located in the heart of Midtown at the
southwest corner of the park, it is ``prohibitively expensive for
commercial development,'' said Tom Walsh, chairman of the post's
property disposition committee, who has done extensive research on
possible uses for the site. Walsh and other members of the post
determined that the conservancy was the primary market for the
land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zoning restricts any buildings to four stories, and there is a
40-foot setback in front and 20 feet on each side,'' he said. ``And
then there is the problem of parking for a building of any size.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlanta Mayor Sam Massell explained the city's generosity
after what was called ``the war to end all wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The original purpose was to help the veterans,'' said Massell,
who now heads the Buckhead Coalition. ``Back then, folks would have
done anything for them _ housing, education _ anything.''

 &HT;    Release of falcon a symbol of removal from endangered list
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and other
dignitaries standing close by, a peregrine falcon erupted from its
cage atop Stone Mountain on Tuesday and sped into the late-morning
sky.
</P>
<P>
   It was an historic flight: Babbitt seized the opportunity to
announce that federal officials are taking steps to remove the
swift-moving raptor from the federal list of endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   ``As this bird flies off this mountain today, I hope it carries
this message through Georgia and throughout the land: The
Endangered Species Act is working,'' Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The crow-size falcon, known for its diving speeds that can reach
up to 200 mph, was on the brink of extinction in 1970 when it was
first listed as endangered -- the victim of encroaching
development, hunters and pesticides. By 1975, the population
reached an all time low with 324 nesting pairs in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are 1,600 nesting pairs due to successful restoration
efforts. ``For years, the peregrine falcon has aroused wonder in
men and we must realize how close we came to seeing this bird
eradicated from the face of the Earth,'' said Georgia Lt. Gov.
Pierre Howard.
</P>
<P>
   The official notice to ``delist'' the falcon will be published
in the Federal Register on Wednesday by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service. After a public comment period that ends Nov. 23, the
service will remove the bird from the list if there are no strong
public objections.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said he came to Georgia to make the announcement because
of ``the fine spirt of conservation in this state'' and because of
numerous organizations that have helped the bird's recovery in
Georgia, including the Department of Natural Resources, Georgia
Power Co. and the Chattahoochee Nature Center. The falcon released
on Tuesday was rehabilitated at the nature center after it was
found injured in June in a Roswell backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Peregrines nest in the tucks of cliffs, the ledges of tall
buildings or on large bridges. Several of them are now found in
Georgia.

 &HT;    10 digit phone numbers per person under a new BellSouth plan
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One number, wherever you go and no matter what company
carries the call _ BellSouth says the technology is now ready.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, telecommunications experts have predicted the
advent of ``number portability,'' a world in which customers would
carry their phone numbers with them. Federal and state regulators
have mandated such a system, although they have postponed the
deadlines for making it happen.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is basic for customers, who would seldom change phone
carriers if they got a new number that would have to be passed
along to friends, family and clients. Naturally, the idea is also
critical for competition in local service, since virtually no one
would leave BellSouth _ or go back to it _ if they had to surrender
their number with each shift.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, BellSouth Corp. announced completion of a $425 million
project that permits number portability in metro Atlanta, although
at first it will be limited to when customers make changes in
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the ability to carry a number anywhere _ including to
other parts of the country, signaling the end of area codes as an
indicator of a customer's location _ is only a matter of time,
requiring regulatory oversight and changes in other networks. The
technology is here.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's two-year effort involved several thousand
technicians in eight states, 300 software developers and scores of
engineers and systems analysts, said Doug McDougal, director of
local number portability for the $21 billion-a-year company.
</P>
<P>
   The revision in software and hardware covers millions of access
lines, reshaping the century-old method for routing phone calls, he
said. ``This is the most complex project ever undertaken in the
history of telecommunications.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday, when the new system went into effect in metro
Atlanta, each local phone company would ``own'' a set of numbers.
Rivals to BellSouth have complained the company unfairly hoarded
all the ``designer'' numbers, parsing out less-desirable exchanges
and combinations. But the new system eliminates that notion of
ownership, BellSouth says.
</P>
<P>
   Now, any call in the Southeast made through BellSouth's network
_ or the network of a rival programmed for number portability _
will be passed through a huge database managed by Lockheed Martin.
That database is intended to include all the numbers in the region.
``In this new environment, the numbers don't belong to anyone,''
said BellSouth spokesman John Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth currently faces competition, mostly for the local
service needs of large companies, a market more lucrative to serve
than residents. Only MGC Communications and MediaOne now offer
consumers a choice in local service. Jim Mitchell, general manager
for MGC, said the new system could eliminate confusion among
customers who fret about having a different number.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Baker, public service commissioner, stopped short of saying
portability would be enough to persuade the PSC to endorse
BellSouth's request to offer long-distance but called the
announcement ``a big step in the right direction in opening up the
local market.''
</P>
<P>
   At least until Monday, customers using a competing carrier would
keep their number, but only because their calls were routed from
that number _ which BellSouth continued to ``own'' _ to a number
owned by their new carrier.

   Wanted: People named for The Bear
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: FREELANCE MATERIAL _ not for NYT wires.)
</P>
<P>
   By Gita M. Smith
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL TO THE ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION
</P>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM_No one knows for sure how many baby boys were named
for legendary football coach Paul William ``Bear'' Bryant over the
25 years he spurred the Crimson Tide to 323 winning games. But the
University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa already has collected more than
400 names and stories from various Pauls, Bears, Williams and
Bryants across the nation, and it is looking for more.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the university's Paul W. Bryant Museum is sending out
the call: Persons named for coach Bryant who would like to attend
an invitation-only gala namesake reunion before the Tide's season
kickoff on Sept. 5 should let the museum know.
</P>
<P>
   ``This started with Paul Bryant Jr., the Bear's son, after he
got hundreds of letters from people who said they were named for
his dad,'' said Jan Adams, spokeswoman for the Bryant Museum. ``We
decided to try to collect people's stories, and we've started a
database.''
</P>
<P>
   A party held in 1996 for Bryant namesakes appears to be on the
verge of becoming an annual tradition. About 150 people showed up
then, including two girls, and a similar number, including three
namesakes under a year old, attended last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a senior in high school when I attended my first Alabama
football game _ Coach Bryant's 300th win,'' said Claire Chandler of
Collinsville, Ala., who named her son William Bryant. ``I often
hear people call him `Brian,' and I am quick to correct them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another entry in the Bryant database recalls a lonely childhood
of poverty in which Bear Bryant loomed large as a hero and
substitute father figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son Bryant was born on May 14, 1980, and there was never
any question or debate as to whom he would be named for,'' Tony
Smith wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant fever isn't limited to Alabama. The
houndstooth-hatted University of Alabama head coach gathered fans
in dozens of states while winning six national championships.
``Papa knew from the letters he received that children were being
named for him, and it made him proud,'' his son said. To become
part of the namesake registry and attend the reunion, write to Paul
W. Bryant Museum, Box 870385, Tuscaloosa, Ala. 35487-0385, or call:
205-348-4668.

   By MICHAEL MURPHY
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Comets coach Van Chancellor loves to make a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Most any subject is fair game for Chancellor, but his
magnolia-drenched wit usually is directed at one target _ himself.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, just try to get Chancellor to tell you what a great
job he does with the Comets. Chancellor usually will reply with
some self-deprecating, aw-shucks remark to deflect the praise.
Never mind that Chancellor has taken home the only two WNBA Coach
of the Year trophies.
</P>
<P>
   And forget that the Comets are gunning for their second WNBA
championship behind two-time league Most Valuable Player Cynthia
Cooper. Chancellor would rather crack a disarming joke than accept
credit.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one subject about which Chancellor gets serious _
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Chancellor the reason for the Comets' success, and he won't
talk about their league-leading offense or tremendous individual
talents such as Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and Tina Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   No, Chancellor will point to the Comets' defense as the key to
last year's championship and this year's team that will play for
another WNBA title after throttling Charlotte 77-61 on Monday night
to complete a two-game semifinals sweep of the Sting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to tell you, that's what I'm proudest of _ I think
we're the best defensive basketball team I've seen in a long, long
time,'' Chancellor said. ``I've thought all along that every big
basketball game we've won, we've won it with defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won this playoff (against the Sting) because we are so
really good on offense, but we've always been a great defensive
basketball team. We always have been.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Comets so good defensively is the same thing that
makes the Chicago Bulls such a great team. With the Bulls,
superstars Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen are the team's best
defensive players. And with the Comets, superstars Cooper and
Swoopes are defensive stoppers as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's amazing,'' Chancellor said. ``When people ask me
why we've been such a good basketball team, I say, `Because our
best players work so hard.' I think Cynthia and Sheryl are the two
best defensive wing players in the league. And I think Kim Perrot
and Tina Thompson give us the two one-four (point guard-power
forward) defenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper just shrugged off the dual role of league-leading scorer
(22.7 points) and top-notch defensive player. Simply part of the
job for herself and Swoopes, who was the league's sixth-leading
scorer at 15.6 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be (good defensive players),'' Cooper said. ``In
order to make our team complete and our franchise a winning
franchise, we have to play both ends of the floor. We actually let
our offense feed off our defense, and if we continue to play good
defense, we feel that we can get it going on offense. We can get
some easy buckets off the fast break, and that's what it's all
about _ playing a complete game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I normally defend the best two guard on the opposing team. My
goal is to stop them, and whatever I get on offense is a plus. I
set out with that goal. I know that I'm not going to just let her
(the opponent) score 20 points and hope that I score 24. The key is
to hold her to 10 points and me to score 24. I think when my
teammates see me getting out there and getting down on defense,
then they give a little more on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets hunkered down on defense Monday night against
Charlotte, limiting the Sting to 37.9-percent shooting. Vicky
Bullett hit just four of 14 shots, and point guard Tora Suber was
just 3-for-12 from the floor. The key was pushing both just a bit
farther from the basket than they liked, forcing them out of their
respective offensive comfort zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic defensive philosophy is, `Let's get you out of where
you want to be.' That's the simplest terms,'' Chancellor said. ``We
like to get you out of your comfort zone. If you like to be on the
block, we get you out of the block. If you like to score from 15
feet, then we'll get you to 18 feet. And we like to pressure the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   And Chancellor has the good fortune to have one of the league's
top defensive point guards in Perrot, who often seems to be a
one-woman press at work. Perrot has her finger on the pulse of the
game, turning up the defensive heat when she thinks the Comets are
lagging or coasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I enjoy doing,'' Perrot said. ``Growing up,
that's something that I took pride in, playing defense, and that's
a big part of my game. I've played on different teams where I had
to score, but on this team I really don't have to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just concentrate more on defense. It's fortunate that we
have other players who also take pride in defense. When they see
how hard I work, they just put extra effort as well into the
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor is quick to credit his players; the players are just
as quick to credit the coaching staff for all the hard work on
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to give credit to our coaching staff, which has done an
excellent job of getting us in shape, keeping us in shape over the
course of the season and stressing defense,'' Cooper said. ``They
could have put defense on the back burner, saying, `Well, this team
is good enough on offense,' but they didn't. That's why we're so

AFTER EARLY BUYING SPREE, INVESTORS BALK AT RUSSIA PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-ECON, moved in `i' category)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cautious optimism about the outlook for emerging
markets took a turn for the worse Tuesday as investors balked at
the details of a plan by Russia to restructure some
government-backed debt.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' displeasure with the low interest rates offered on
new longer-term securities as part of the Russian bailout package
moved bank shares off their highs and overshadowed earlier euphoria
that pushed stocks strongly higher.
</P>
<P>
   Investors began the day buying shares as the Dow Jones
industrial average climbed more than 122 points. The buying spree
was a sign of confidence that the domestic economy's low interest
rates and moderate rate of growth would buoy profits of U.S.
corporations. Following on the heels of gains in overseas markets,
it also signaled a belief that recent price declines might have
been overdone, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   But disappointment with the Russian plan ushered in another wave
of stock selling and buying of Treasuries, pushing the yield on the
30-year bond down to 5.43 percent, a historic low.
</P>
<P>
   Treasuries were also bolstered by a stronger dollar, which rose
partly on reports that the Japanese government may not step in soon
to shore up the yen by selling dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Early gains in stocks erased most of Monday's losses. But by
midafternoon, stocks, led by banks, began to stumble as details of
Russia's rescue plan began to trickle into the market.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of J.P. Morgan, which had climbed as much as 4 3/16
points, closed at 120~, up 1| points. Citicorp, up as much as 5
3/16 points, closed at 136[, up 2 11/16 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian plan to exchange about $40 billion of short-term,
ruble-denominated debt into longer-term securities calls for the
new debt to carry an interest rate of about 30 percent for
three-year securities. The rate declines to 20 percent in the fifth
year. Investors who redeem the securities prior to maturity will
receive about 5 percent of their par value.
</P>
<P>
   The debt pact reminded investors that the financial woes of
emerging markets would take some time to mend, analysts and traders
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that a reason to sell? I guess,'' said Andrew Brooks, vice
president for equity trading at T. Rowe Price Associates. ``It just
highlights some of the skittishness in the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,602.65, a
36.04-point gain. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index closed up
4.72 points at 1,092.86. The Nasdaq composite index gained 7.35
points, to 1,798.17.
</P>
<P>
   But smaller shares fared worse. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller- company stocks fell 3.94 points, or 1 percent, to 389.76,
its lowest close in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts pointed to the limited rally and the declines among
small- company shares as indicators the market remained vulnerable
to further declines in the near term.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way trading-range corrections proceed,'' said
Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards Inc. ``When
you look at all the problems the market has had to digest in the
past week, I think we're putting on a good show.''

WHITE HOUSE TO APPEAL RULING ON SAMPLING IN CENSUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, while acknowledging
that a federal court ruling on Monday was a blow to its efforts to
use sampling to supplement the 2000 census, said Tuesday that it
would still press Congress for the money the Census Bureau would
need to plan for sampling.
</P>
<P>
   The administration immediately said it would appeal the ruling,
which was made by a special three-judge panel that said statistical
sampling violated federal law. Late Tuesday afternoon it filed a
notice of appeal asking the Supreme Court to review the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first stop on a long journey of resolution,'' said
Everett Ehrlich, a former Commerce Department official who is now a
Democratic member of an independent board that is monitoring the
Census Bureau's plans.
</P>
<P>
   But any Supreme Court ruling is not expected until next year.
That still leaves plenty of time for the administration and House
Republicans to engage in a knock-down, drag-out fight this fall
over a spending bill to pay for the Census Bureau's plans for the
next census _ plans that still include the use of sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Statistical sampling is expected to provide a more complete
count of the nation's population, which would mean that groups that
analysts say were under-represented in the 1990 census could
benefit from a 2000 census based on sampling. These groups, mostly
the urban and rural poor, tend to live in predominantly Democratic
areas and therefore counting them might benefit that party in
drawing district lines.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans rejoiced in the court ruling. ``The public
perception is that it certainly enhanced our standing,'' said Pete
Jeffries, spokesman for Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., an ardent foe
of sampling. ``This shows that this is just another example of the
Clinton administration trying to run roughshod over the law and the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shapiro, under secretary of Commerce for economic
affairs, the division that oversees the Census Bureau, was just as
vehement a proponent of sampling. ``Regardless of the court
decision, this is going to be a very tough political fight that
will be hard fought on all sides,'' Shapiro said. ``The opponents
of the use of scientific methods will try to use this ruling to try
to make their case, just like the proponents of scientific methods
use the testimony of noted scientists to make their case. This is a
real fight, and people will use whatever is available.''
</P>
<P>
   The court decision and the coming fight in Congress both flow
from an agreement negotiated in November between Speaker Newt
Gingrich and Erskine Bowles, the White House chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, which broke a logjam over a spending bill,
Gingrich was able to proceed with a lawsuit paid for by taxpayers
to have sampling declared unconstitutional or illegal, a suit that
was heard by a special three-judge panel. The agreement also
allowed for any decison to be appealed directly and expeditiously
to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, under the agreement the spending bill would not
fully fund the Departments of Commerce _ including the Census
Bureau _ Justice and State in the next fiscal year, though there is
dispute between the parties on just what it would finance. The
administration and the Democrats say the agreement was to fund the
three departments for six months while everyone waited for a
decision on sampling from the Supreme Court. The Republicans assert
that they agreed to fund only the Census Bureau for half a year.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is pushing for funding all of the operations
of the Commerce, Justice and State departments for six months,
figuring that the pressure of a looming government shut-down _ even
a partial one _ will drive the Republicans to resolve the sampling
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans reason that if only the Census Bureau runs out
of funds next spring, the administraton will be so desperate to
gain the rest of the financing it will agree to drop its plans to
use sampling.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over sampling also comes as Clinton's personal
popularity has been brought low by his acknowledgement of his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's political difficulty certainly has to be
factored in,'' said one former administration official familiar
with the census battle. ``It could go either way.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats feel that the possiblity that Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel, will be submitting a report to Congress
that accuses Clinton of having engaged in illegal activity might
strengthen his resolve in the census fight.

GINGRICH QUESTIONS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PURSUIT OF MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich, in his strongest
criticism to date of the government's case against Microsoft,
suggested Tuesday that the Justice Department would be better off
pursuing drug dealers or campaign finance violators than going
after the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, speaking at a Seattle fundraiser for Rep. Rick White,
R-Wash., also said Congress should investigate whether the Justice
Department improperly has attempted to persuade foreign governments
to initiate their own legal cases against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department could do a variety of things _ they
could be looking more effectively into bringing drugs into the
country illegally, they could be looking more effectively at
illegal foreign campaign contributions _ there are a range of
opportunities for the Justice Department other than trying to
destroy jobs at one of America's leading companies and trying to
weaken America's role in the world market,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gingrich at first seemed to attribute that stance
to White, Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., and Sen. Slade Gorton,
R-Wash, but a spokesman said later that Gingrich shares the
pro-Microsoft sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who posed for a photo with Microsoft vice president
William Neukom before giving his speech, seemed particularly
disturbed about the Justice Department's conversations with foreign
goverments.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Justice Department began to raise questions about
Microsoft the way they did, all over the world other countries also
began to raise questions,'' Gingrich said. ``There's some very real
question whether or not there was in fact collusion by the American
Justice Department encouraging foreign governments to file a
lawsuit against an American company.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling such activity ``entirely inappropriate,'' Gingrich said
it is ``something we're going to work very hard to get to the
bottom of. ... The purpose of the American government is to
strengthen American companies in the world market and increase
American exports in the world market, not to undermine American
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's complaint echoes one made last month by Sens. Jeff
Sessions, R-Ala., Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and Spencer Abraham, R-Mich.,
who alleged that investigations of Microsoft by Japan, Israel,
Brazil and others were prompted by senior Justice Department
antitrust officials. The senators pointed out that shortly after a
visit to Tokyo by Justice Department antitrust chief Joel Klein,
the Japanese Fair Trade Commission raided Microsoft's offices
there.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Gingrich make positive comments about Microsoft,
but he excised from his standard stump speech a positive reference
to technology manufactured by Sun Microsystems Inc., a California
company that is now suing Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Justice Department defended the agency's
conduct. The Justice Department has been embroiled in various legal
battles with Microsoft for four years, most recently with a broad
antitrust suit accusing the company of illegally trying to extend a
monopoly on computer operating systems into the market for Internet
browsers. That case is scheduled for trial Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charge that the Department colluded with, solicited, or
encouraged foreign governments to take legal action is completely
false,'' said Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona.
</P>
<P>
   Talamona also said it was appropriate for the Justice Department
to press its case against Microsoft, saying that ``The antitrust
division is about protecting consumers and enforcing laws, and we
need to continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   White said he has been encouraging the speaker to be more
outspoken on behalf of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're indicating to him that he needs to speak out a little
bit more on the Microsoft situation, and I think he's relatively
receptive to that message,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has been spending parts of this week in Washington
state. On Saturday he attended the King County GOP picnic on Vashon
Island and a state GOP fundraiser in Seattle. On Monday he attended
a fundraiser in Pasco for Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash. Tuesday, in
addition to the White fundraiser, he visited the Pacific Science
Center at Seattle Center. Wednesday and Thursday he is to tour the
Hanford nuclear reservation, the Hanford Reach, and the North
Cascades National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has sharply limited his accessibility to the news media
while in Washington state, generally declining to answer questions
or grant interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's staff Tuesday cancelled a promised question and
answer session at the Pacific Science Center, and physically
blocked reporters from following the Speaker around the private,
non-profit museum. Gingrich's spokesman said he did not want to be
distracted by questions about President Clinton's sex scandal.

FOSTER CARE PROGRAMS AIMED AT KEEPING SIBLINGS TOGETHER ARE
EXPANDING

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Childhood has not been kind to them, these four
brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Their overwhelmed parents smacked them to keep them in line,
counselors say, and the three oldest, now ages 10, 9, and 5, were
sexually molested by their mother's brothers. Now angry and
insecure, the siblings pummel one another, make disturbing sexual
gestures, sometimes wet their beds, and misbehave in school, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   When child welfare authorities decided to remove them from their
parents' home and place them in foster care two years ago, they
stood a good chance of being separated from each other. Child
welfare agencies have historically focused on finding available
foster parents, not on trying to keep sisters and brothers in the
same home. And it is hard to find foster parents with room for
four, let alone the willingness to take care of so many troubled
children at once.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Veronica, Chantel, Jimmy and Jermaine were
steered toward a new program that pays foster parents a premium - a
salary thousands of dollars more than they get from the state,
health benefits, vacation time, pension and sick days - all to
persuade them to take care of a group of brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago program reflects a growing movement in foster care
nationally. Fueled by lawsuits in New York, Chicago and elsewhere,
and by a groundswell of lobbying by child welfare advocates, states
have begun enacting laws and inaugurating programs designed to
encourage foster parents to care for groups of siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't underestimate the trauma children go through when
they're separated from their siblings,'' said Gordon Johnson, a
former director of the Illinois Department of Children and Family
Services, who is now the president of the Jane Addams Hull House
Association, a non-profit agency which runs the sibling program.
``On top of the trauma of being separated from their parents, you
put them in a strange environment where they're mixed with other
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Some child welfare officials point out potential pitfalls of
trying to routinely place siblings together. Special programs like
Chicago's are generally expensive, and the laws and consent decrees
often logistically difficult to enforce, if only because there may
be so many more needy siblings than families willing to take them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some officials and advocates worry that it might
compromise another increasingly supported goal: to get children
with no chance of being reunited with their parents adopted as soon
as possible so they don't remain in the limbo of the foster care
system. It is always easier to find a family to adopt one child,
rather than several.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, most foster care experts agree that trying to
keep brothers and sisters together is at least worth shooting for,
an effort to maintain some thread of consistency for children whose
small worlds are being otherwise ripped apart.
</P>
<P>
   Since the majority of children in foster care have siblings who
are also in foster care, keeping them together is not a small task.
In some states, as many as 80 percent of foster children have
siblings in the system and half or more are scattered among
different foster homes. And anecdotally, many child welfare
agencies report seeing more large sibling groups, possibly because
social workers who find one abused child in a family are more
inclined to quickly remove the other children.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, California passed a law allowing foster homes to take
more than the maximum number of children, 6, if it meant keeping
brothers and sisters together. Ohio, Massachusetts and New York
took up similar measures the year before, and Minnesota and Alabama
recently began requiring siblings to be placed together, whenever
possible, according to the Child Welfare League of America, a
national advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, a small program begun last fall gives foster
parents who take in sibling groups an apartment - rent-free - in a
building in Rego Park, Queens, pays them an extra stipend and gives
them benefits like laundry service and babysitting.
</P>
<P>
   California's Social Services Department is giving social workers
special training in placing siblings together and has recommended
that counties pay prospective foster families to keep their homes
vacant until a sibling group comes along. New Jersey has just begun
heavily recruiting foster parents who will agree to take sibling
groups. Kentucky has an extra stipend for such foster families.
Florida is setting up a pilot program along the lines of the Hull
House program in Chicago. And Illinois also has another program
that pays foster families extra money for rent if they move to a
larger house to take in more brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people are talking about it and trying to do
better,'' said Kathy Barbell, director of foster care for the Child
Welfare League. ``It's like a light bulb went off. What is longest
relationship you have with any person? It's your siblings. And
there are more former foster children searching for their siblings
these days than their biological parents.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, these sibling initiatives reflect a broader
national movement to give foster children more stability. New York
City and other systems are championing plans to keep foster
children in their original neighborhoods, and many states, like
Illinois, are trying to place more children with relatives, which
can also lead to more sibling contact.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So far, the fledgling sibling programs are making incremental
differences, as states try to weigh priorities in foster care
placement. What should social workers do, for example, if a family
takes in one child, but then does not have room for a sibling taken
from the parents later on or a new baby born to the parents after
other children were removed?
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, where a class action lawsuit filed by the
Legal Aid Society against the city was settled in 1993 with an
agreement requiring siblings to be placed together unless their
health and safety was compromised, more sibling groups are being
placed together now - 51 percent in 1996 up from 45 percent in
1990, when the suit was filed. Jennifer Folk, a spokeswoman for the
Administration of Children's Services, said the main reason
siblings are separated is that a social worker decides they need
different types of medical or psychological care, or a relative
wants to take one or two children, but not all. Child welfare
advocates believe more sibling groups could be kept together.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the Cook County Public Guardian won a similar
consent decree with a suit against the state, including a provision
that siblings, when separated, should visit each other twice a
month. Still, currently two-thirds of Illinois' 37,762 siblings in
foster care are not placed with all their other siblings, and only
about half of the separated siblings were visiting each other twice
a month, said Mary Sue Morsch, a deputy director of the Illinois
Department of Children and Family Services, adding that her
department was working to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he wanted to expand the Hull House program, called
Neighbor to Neighbor, beyond its 30 foster families. He said that
placing siblings together makes it easier for social workers to
assess whether children should be reunited with their parents, a
goal the program tries to achieve. Even if they are ultimately
split up in adoption, he said, they have at least benefited from
being together for a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Very few studies have actually tried to measure the consequences
of sibling placements. One small recent study of preschool foster
children near Syracuse, found that siblings placed together were
more emotionally stable, but did not do as well on cognitive tests,
perhaps because foster parents allowed older siblings to teach the
younger children skills like vocabulary and colors, said the
author, Maureen Smith, an assistant professor of psychology at
Chicago State University. Professor Smith said she concluded that
sibling placements should not be automatic, but should depend on
each child's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that they are plowing new ground, some of the sibling
programs are explicitly designed to react quickly when conflicts
between siblings and other difficulties arise. After problems
cropped up between brothers and sisters in one of the New York
program's foster families, two brothers moved in temporarily with
another family in the same program, trading places with two
sisters, said Sue Goldman, assistant of director of foster home
services for the Jewish Child Care Association, which runs the
program.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Hull House gives its foster parents intensive
training and monitors the families closely, at least once a week.
In exchange for a $16,000 salary (which supplements the regular
state stipend of roughly $415 per child per month), Hull House
treats foster parents like full-time employees. They cannot hold
another job and can be terminated quickly, for cause.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened to the first Hull House foster mother who
took in Veronica, 10, Chantel, 9, Jimmy, 5, and Jermaine, 3. The
woman, Bobbie Luckett, 56, tried hard to establish order and
dependability for the children, who seemed to gorge themselves on
food as if they never had enough and who were often very physical
with each other. Once, Ms. Luckett said, Veronica brandished a
kitchen knife at her. Chantel acted out in school, calling a
substitute teacher profane names and disturbing other children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Luckett repeatedly consulted the program for guidance and
used methods like ``The Good Kid Chart,'' a checklist which listed
goals like ``I did not fight before school'' and ``I did not argue
tonight.'' But in February, about a year after they had been placed
with Ms. Luckett, the two girls locked the two boys in a closet and
Ms. Luckett's adult daughter, who was babysitting, lost her temper
and struck the girls with a belt, said Michael Heard, a Hull House
therapist. Within 24 hours, the children were removed from Ms.
Luckett's home and placed with Mary Hardwick, a 58-year-old woman
who had years of experience as a foster mother.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hardwick says the siblings are the most troubled children
she has cared for. Besides disciplinary problems at home, the girls
once were kicked out of a church program for fighting with each
other. But Heard says that with Ms. Hardwick's steady approach, he
is seeing gradual progress, Jermaine becoming more verbal, all four
playing together nicely in group therapy sessions. On balance, he
believes, they are gaining stability from staying together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they really love each other,'' Ms. Hardwick said.
``They just don't know how to express it. But all of them together
is better. I wouldn't want to be split up from my sisters and
brothers.''

<P>
   For her civics class last spring at Lincoln High School in
Portland, Ore., Rebecca Strong had to memorize the names of all the
participants in the White House scandal, including the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were tested on that,'' Strong recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But she was uncomfortable with the class discussions and her
friends' reaction to the relationship between President Clinton and
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them would say, `What's the big deal?''' Strong said.
``They couldn't understand my thinking premarital sex is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, she said, is why she will enter Seattle Pacific
University, a ``Christ-centered'' college of 2,470 students, in
September. In choosing an evangelical _ or born-again _ Christian
college, she is part of a surge in applicants to institutions that
take a strict view of relations between the sexes, and who say the
White House scandal was a focusing event in their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear a lot about that,'' said Bob Andringa, president of
the Coalition for Christian Colleges and Universities, an
association of 93 evangelical Christian colleges that offer
four-year liberal arts programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's troubles and the fact that so many Americans
don't take them seriously,'' Andringa said, ``underscore for the
conservative Christian community that we're in a society that can
look at something morally questionable and not have it make a
difference. That leads many parents to ask, `Do I want my 18- or
19-year-old going to a campus that is so casual?' The answer to
that brings many of them to our schools.''
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 100 evangelical colleges across the country
(most densely in Indiana, Illinois and Southern California), and
they tend to be nestled on rural campuses with a small number of
students. Total enrollment is about 160,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan College, in Dayton, Tenn., has about 470 students, but
there has been an increase in applicants this year of almost 30
percent, and many other small, little-known evangelical colleges
are reporting increases in applicants of 10 percent to 12 percent
over last year. Applications at Dordt College, in Sioux Center,
Iowa, are up 15 percent over last year, and more than 20 percent at
Palm Beach-Atlantic College, in West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Double-digit growth is highly unusual, said Vance Grant, a
statistics specialist at the U.S. Department of Education. The
increase in this year's class of high school graduates (about 3
percent over last year, according to the department) explains only
part of that growth. What is more, the evangelical movement has
remained static in recent years, said Kent Hunter, president of the
Church Growth Center, a consulting agency for evangelical churches.
</P>
<P>
   College officials have long been impressed, and baffled, by how
the culture affects applications. In the 1980s, the University of
Chicago's dean of admissions attributed ``an astounding number'' of
applicants to Indiana Jones' being a fictional archaeology
professor there.
</P>
<P>
   The classic example is what admissions officials refer to as
``the Flutie spike.'' A huge increase in applications to Boston
College in the mid-1980s was tied to the heart-stopping performance
of a gifted quarterback named Doug Flutie. The number of
applicants, which had been a steady 10,000 a year, leaped to 16,163
in 1985 when high school boys across the country, after imitating
Flutie's passing technique, also applied for admission to his
college.
</P>
<P>
   Today's ``triggering event,'' said Stephen Balch, president of
the neoconservative National Association of Scholars, is the White
House scandal, which has caused people to realize they ``must build
a fortress to defend their way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Eisenback of Blacksburg, Va., encouraged her son, Brian,
to choose Bryan College to protect him against what she and her
husband saw as growing moral permissiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal, Mrs. Eisenback said, ``goes with abortion, children
being born out of wedlock and morals not being considered `in.' In
that kind of a world, we have a responsibility to make sure our
children learn values, and Bryan College teaches them.''
</P>
<P>
   The evangelical colleges _ as distinct from Bible schools, whose
curriculum is centered on teaching Scripture _ offer a typical
array of liberal arts courses but teach them from a Christian
perspective. For instance, Bryan College, which is named after
William Jennings Bryan, teaches creationism as opposed to Darwinian
evolution. Southern Nazarene University, in Bethany, Okla., will
not teach Nabokov but will teach Milton and Bunyan, who, explained
Gwen Ladd Hackler, a professor of English, ``portray the kind of
struggle that would occur in a spiritual life.'' Psychology at
Calvin College, in Grand Rapids, Mich., emphasizes ``the dignity of
humanity, because people are created in the image of God,'' said
Thomas E. McWhertor, an administrator there.
</P>
<P>
   Dordt College, which has 1,300 students, requires faculty
members and students to sign a pledge that they understand and will
abide by a conservative interpretation of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   The colleges benefit from a perception of safety and have strict
rules of conduct. Many ban alcohol and tobacco on campus. Dancing,
where allowed, is carefully regulated. Attendance at chapel
services is usually mandatory, and the colleges teach that
extramarital sex, abortion, co-ed living arrangements and
homosexual and lesbian behavior are contrary to Scriptural
principles.
</P>
<P>
   When an administrative employee at Dordt College was recently
discovered to have had an extramarital relationship, the employee
was summarily dismissed, said Carl Zylstra, president of Dordt.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian colleges have long been weak academically, with
entrance requirements listed in their promotional literature as
moderately to minimally difficult, but a few have made significant
improvements. Wheaton College, in Wheaton, Ill., is sometimes
called the Harvard of the evangelicals because 86 percent of its
faculty members have Ph.D.'s; the National Research Council's 1995
study listed Wheaton as 138th of 2,307 institutions in the number
of graduates going on to receive doctorates.
</P>
<P>
   Some evangelical colleges are deliberately trying to position
themselves in the public consciousness as moral centers. The Boston
Sunday Herald published an opinion piece last February by R. Judson
Carlberg, the president of Gordon College, in Wenham, Mass., on
``our lack of concern for the truth'' in the White House.
Applicants are up about 8 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
   In March, The Seattle Times published an op-ed article by Philip
Eaton, the president of Seattle Pacific University, urging readers
to ``pray for our president and for all involved in this sorry
matter.'' In an interview, Eaton pointed to ``issues of cultural
drift, the loss of standards, truthfulness and the tyranny of
tolerance in which people say, `If you think that way, that's your
business.'''
</P>
<P>
   Quentin Van Essen, director of admissions at Dordt, said he
sensed such concerns on campus tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents who visit the school with their kids won't come right
out and say what they're thinking,'' Van Essen said, ``but they'll
ask, `What do your faculty think are the important issues?' And
then they'll say, `Are any of the athletic coaches homosexual?' And
then they may come around to making a remark about what's going on
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what's on their minds.''

 &HT;    Southern black students are focal point of private studyBy Ernie
Suggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While blacks continue to lag behind whites in higher
educational opportunities in the South, programs in Georgia may
serve as an example of what can be done to provide greater access
for blacks in higher education, according to an Atlanta-based
education group.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the Southern Education Foundation released Tuesday,
focusing on the lack of educational opportunities for blacks in the
South, singled out the University System of Georgia's P-16
Initiative, which connects pre-school and high school with college,
and the HOPE Scholarship, which provides additional college funding
for Georgia high school students to attend college, as examples of
state programs to bridge the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's approach is the right one, said Michael Timpane,
senior advisor for Education Policy at the RAND Corporation, a
non-profit institution that researches public policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our conviction and belief that working on the K-12
system and working on the connection between them an higher
education _ these separate systems working together _ can produce
dramatic changes (in the access that blacks will have to higher
education opportunities),'' said Timpane, former president of
Columbia University's School of Education. ``Colleges have to pay
attention to K-12 or they will never solve their problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Timpane's comments, and subsequent praise of Georgia's
direction, came Tuesday after the SEF's release of that states that
on virtually all fronts, efforts to desegregate higher education in
the South have little impact over the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Among other indicators, the report lists economics and a lack of
preparation of black students in the lower grades as a direct
correlation on why the gap is still wide.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kronley, project director for the SEF, said even though
the black population has grown and remedies have been developed for
blacks over the last 20 years, opportunities for blacks at colleges
and universities have been at a virtual standstill.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found is alarming,'' said Kronley. ``Despite an
appearance of progress here and there, blacks lag behind whites.
The gap is not closing, but the gateway to opportunity is
closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kronley added that other efforts, including the implementation
of admissions programs that may be viewed as pro-affirmative
action, would be another way to close the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this reports says is that race sensitive remedies are
still relevant, but not by any means the only solution,'' said
Kronley. ``While we are still struggling to cast off the vestiges
of the past, we may need to consider these.''
</P>
<P>
   The report looked at 19 mostly Southern states that currently
have historically black colleges and at one time maintained a dual
system of higher education. Including Georgia, those states include
Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is unique about these states is the legacy of
segregation,'' said Kronley.
</P>
<P>
   More than 75 percent of black first-time, full-time freshmen at
four-year public schools attend school in one of those 19 states.
All but three of the nation's 103 historically black colleges and
universities are also located in the 19 states and more than half
of them are public. These were included in the study's results.
</P>
<P>
   But while the number of blacks entering higher education has
grown, the percentage of blacks among full-time freshmen is almost
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Kronley said that in nine of the 19 states, the proportion of
first time, full-time black freshmen has actually declined over the
last five years. In Georgia, where blacks represent more than 32
percent of the 18- to 24-year-old population, fewer than 24 percent
of the first-time, full-time freshmen are enrolled at four-year
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flat percentage of blacks who are participating in higher
education reflect the fact that states are shrinking from their
commitment to ensure that all students have access to quality
education,'' Kronley said.
</P>
<P>
   University System of Georgia Chancellor Stephen Portch would not
comment on the report.

RE-EMERGENT CLINTON GOES SAILING, PLANS SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ President Clinton is slowly emerging from his
self-imposed cocoon, venturing out Tuesday into public view with
his wife and daughter for the first time since they arrived here a
week ago after he admitted to an ``inappropriate'' relationship
with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The first family went for an hourlong sail Tuesday afternoon
with Walter Cronkite on the former CBS News anchorman's nearly
60-foot-long ketch, Wyntje, with the Clintons drawing hundreds of
spectators to the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   And the president has decided after much debate among his
advisers to give a speech in Worcester on Thursday, testing the
theory that by changing the national conversation from his sex life
to policy matters Clinton can rebuild his leverage as he heads into
negotiations this fall with Congress over spending issues and as
Congress considers whether to reprimand him in some way, or even to
impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been searching for a venue in which Clinton
could appear presidential. Since he admitted last week on national
television to an affair with the intern, Monica Lewinsky, his aides
have been telephoning Democratic members of Congress to gauge the
public reaction and how the president might help Democrats this
fall _ even if it means staying away from their districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've definitely been reaching out,'' said an aide to one
Democratic member. Such reaching out has included invitations to
join Clinton next week as he visits Russia and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The decision for the president to go to Worcester to speak on
the topic of juvenile crime was made on Monday night. Rep. Jim
McGovern, D-Mass., whose district includes Worcester, said he had a
longstanding invitation to Clinton to visit the district, and the
White House _ to the surprise of McGovern's aides _ suddenly
accepted. The site for the speech had not been determined as of
late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Worcester struck some political veterans as
odd. It is a swing district _ an anomaly in heavily Democratic
Massachusetts _ and McGovern, a first-term Democrat, is a top
target for national Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said the district offered an easily accessible
destination that would not cut too much into the time that Clinton
is spending here, generally in seclusion with his wife and
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were more cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only district that would have him,'' sneered Marc
DeCourcey, executive director of the Massachusetts Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Marsh, media consultant for McGovern's Republican
challenger, State Sen. Matthew Amorello, said he looked forward to
using film footage of McGovern with Clinton in the campaign this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who care about cultural issues, their
families and the breakdown in values in society, and I wouldn't
think Bill Clinton would be the image that McGovern would want to
project,'' Marsh said. ``Bill Clinton is the poster boy for
everything that's wrong, values-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   But McGovern said he was thrilled with the prospect of Clinton's
visit. ``Having the president come is a big deal, and people are
proud he's coming here,'' the congressman said. ``People here are
hungering for a discussion of the issues.''

WORCESTER HOPES CLINTON WILL HELP PUT IT ON THE MAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GEETA ANAND  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ Miles off of the state's main highway routes,
Worcester, New England's second-largest city, has long felt
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sat here and told people we're the second-largest city in
New England and had them insist I am wrong,'' Mayor Raymond Mariano
said Tuesday. ``They say, `No, it's Providence,' or, `No, it's
Hartford.' For too long, Worcester hasn't gotten the recognition it
deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   But with President Clinton's planned visit here Thursday,
Mariano and those who make this city an hour west of Boston home
hope that will change _ at least a little. They will be trying to
stretch the media spotlight to showcase some of the Worcester they
know and love as the president goes about unveiling a school safety
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Worcester as the site for one of the
president's excursions from Martha's Vineyard, where he is
vacationing, seems to make sense. A tough program that charges
police officers with bringing truant kids back to school has cut
the dropout rate in half. Student test scores are improving.
</P>
<P>
   And the president, fresh from his embarrassing revelation of his
affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, couldn't hope for a much more
sympathetic audience. In interview after interview Tuesday, the
people of Worcester strongly, sometimes adamantly, declared their
support for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``His business is his business,'' Jack Danzilio, a regular
History Channel watcher who cooks at the Boulevard Diner, said
Tuesday of the Lewinsky affair. ``I like everything about him. I
like his personality. I like his policies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nobody's business,'' the diner owner, Debbie Griffin,
interjected, from behind the kitchen counter.
</P>
<P>
   Genuine excitement seemed to greet news of the president's
visit. No one interviewed _ not even the mayor _ could remember the
last time a sitting US president stopped by this city of 170,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever he goes, I'll be there,'' said Brenda Bombard, a
waitress at Porto Bello restaurant, who has a daughter, Ari, in
first grade. ``I'll keep Ari home from school for that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll put us on the map,'' Danzilio said.
</P>
<P>
   As they and others eagerly point out, Worcester does have much
to be proud of. It is the economic engine of central Massachusetts
_ a center for biotechnology, health services and higher education.
It is home to the second-largest art museum in New England and the
New England Science Center. Two major building projects are under
way downtown: the $300 million Worcester Medical Center and the $40
million restoration of the historic Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the city has improved its schools, said Roberta
Schaefer, a Worcester resident who is also director of the
Worcester Municipal Research Bureau as well as a member of the
state education board.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, educators often cite Worcester as one of the success
stories of the state's education reform efforts. The city has
invested its share of the billions of dollars in new money
available under the Education Reform Act of 1993 into teacher
hiring, salary increases and new programs to promote professional
development, a new Worcester Municipal Research Bureau report due
out Friday says.
</P>
<P>
   Student test results have improved markedly, particularly in the
younger grades, the report says. Test scores have risen in all
subject areas for fourth graders and eighth graders since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significant, though, has been the fall in the
dropout rate: from 14 percent to 6.8 percent, the report says. An
innovative program has empowered police officers to nab students
found outside school and bring them back.
</P>
<P>
   These students are then put into a three-day program that
involves bringing them and their parents together with teachers,
counselors, social service agencies, police _ in an effort to
develop a plan to support the young person's attendence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we can show the president and the world is that we've
succeeded in our schools,'' Mariano says. ``We're looking forward
to telling our story.''

7 MEN TIED TO CUBAN EXILE GROUP CHARGED WITH PLOTTING TO KILL
CASTRO 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER and ANN LOUISE BARDACH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ A member of the board of the principal
Cuban exile organization in the United States was indicted here
Tuesday with six other men on charges that they conspired to
assassinate Fidel Castro when he was on an official visit to
Venezuela last year.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said Jose Antonio Llama, one of the 28-man inner
circle that runs the organization, the Cuban-American National
Foundation, ``obtained a .50-caliber rifle'' and bought a boat for
his fellow conspirators and others who were not identified. Their
purpose, the document charged, was ``to kill, with malice
aforethought, Fidel Castro at a place outside the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Llama, those indicted were Jose Rodriguez Sosa, Alfredo
Otero, Angel Alfonso Aleman, Angel Hernandez, Juan Bautista Marquez
and Francisco Secundino Cordova. A former officer of the
Cuban-American foundation said most of the men had been affiliated
with the organization at one time or another.
</P>
<P>
   According to the seven-count indictment, the would-be assassins
traveled last October to Isla Margarita, Venezuela, where Castro
was to attend a meeting of Latin American leaders, to scout a
location for the killing and picked a hilltop overlooking the
airport there. That same month, four Cuban exiles were arrested on
a cabin cruiser by the U.S. Coast Guard after one of them said they
were heading to kill Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators discovered that Llama owned the boat,
which had left from a private dock in Coral Gables, Fla., that was
owned by the business partner of another foundation official.
</P>
<P>
   One of the sniper rifles found on the boat was registered to
Jose Francisco Hernandez, president of the Cuban-American National
Foundation. Hernandez was notified late last year that he was a
``target'' of the investigation, a legal term that signifies that
he could face indictment, officials said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a lawyer for Hernandez held a news conference to say
Hernandez expected to be indicted in the case and denounced the
prosecution as a politically motivated attack on the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The group has tax-exempt status and has said since its founding
in 1981 that it espouses strictly peaceful means of effecting
change in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez was not indicted Tuesday. A Justice Department
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity called him ``not a
minor player'' in the affair, adding that he was still under
investigation, along with others in the organization whom the
official did not identify.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, lawyers for foundation leaders predicted that their
clients would be indicted on the relatively minor offense of
infringing the neutrality act, whose ambiguous language makes
obtaining a conviction difficult. But the charges announced Tuesday
were far more serious; they are based on a federal statute that
covers the murder of an ``internationally protected person'' such
as a head of state and carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Llama and Hernandez did not respond to requests for comment made
to the Cuban-American foundation headquarters in Miami on Tuesday.
But the group issued a statement saying its policy was ``that
violence is not the answer to the Cuban crisis'' and ``that is what
distinguishes us from Castro and his ruthless dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a high-ranking former officer of the foundation,
though, leaders of the group for many years forged alliances with
terrorist groups while publicly proclaiming a commitment to
peaceful means. ``We were involved with a number of clandestine
operations which were illegal, which, no question, were terrorist
activities,'' the officer, who was not identified, said in an
interview with an investigator of a Congressional committee in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement late last week, the foundation maintained that
the Lewinsky scandal may have emboldened ``those in the
administration who look favorably upon the Castro regime'' to try
to ``advance an immoral policy of rapprochement.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Miami last Thursday, lawyers for Lama
and Hernandez echoed that contention. ``It seems to me that the
enemies of the embargo in this country are behind this action,''
said Manuel Vazquez, a lawyer for Llama. ``It seems to me that when
Castro snaps his fingers, our government jumps.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tuesday's indictments capped a series of events that began last
October when the Coast Guard stopped four Cuban exiles on a 46-foot
cabin cruiser for routine questioning in international waters off
Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. When a stash of weapons and ammunition was
found in a hidden compartment, one of the men, Angel Alfonso
Aleman, blurted out ``those weapons are to kill Fidel Castro,''
according to federal documents. ``My sole mission in life is to
kill Fidel Castro,'' he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators soon discovered that Llama owned the boat
and that a high-powered sniper rifle found on board was registered
in Hernandez's name. They also learned that the vessel had left
from the private dock in Coral Gables and that its course had been
set for Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso, leader of the failed expedition, is a former Cuban
political prisoner who works as a salesman at a clothing store in
Union City, N.J., that is owned by the former president of the
Cuban-American National Foundation's local chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was, am and consider myself a revolutionary,'' Alfonso said
in an interview this spring. ``We do whatever we can. The main
thing is to take Castro out, by any means necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Alfonso, Ricardo Pesquera, said he would seek a
change of venue to Miami and challenge the government's decision to
regard Castro as a protected person. Juries in Miami have in the
past proved far more sympathetic to anti-Castro activities than
those elsewhere, and Pesquera made it clear he planned to mount a
defense based at least in part on politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're opening a Pandora's box they're going to regret,'' he
said in a telephone interview, vowing to demand access to every CIA
and FBI document on nearly 40 years of plots, some of them
government-organized, to kill Castro. ``We're going to put their
whole foreign policy on trial.''

   LONDON _ One of the world's most wanted terrorists, the
Palestinian guerrilla chief, Sabri al-Banna, better known as Abu
Nidal, is being held by the Egyptian authorities in Cairo,
according to an Arab intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Nidal, 61, is accused by Washington of having killed or
injured 900 people in attacks in 20 countries since 1974. He is
wanted in the United States, Great Britain and Italy and was
condemned to death by the Palestine Liberation Organization, from
which he broke in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The story of his capture after years in which he had seemed to
vanish began emerging last week in the Arabic press and was as hard
to pin down as the man himself. The convoluted account is woven of
rumors of double-crosses, mysterious illnesses and murder. Over the
years, reports of his death, often spun by the man himself, have
circulated widely.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab intelligence official, who spoke Tuesday on the
condition of anonymity, said Abu Nidal was arrested two months ago
in Egypt but had actually been there for nine months. The official
said Egyptian intelligence agents wanted to use Abu Nidal's network
to target terrorist groups planning bombings and assassinations in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement collapsed two months ago, the intelligence
official said, when Egyptian intelligence agents successfully
infiltrated the Palestinian network and started using its
operatives against Egypt's fundamentalist enemies.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, according to the official, Abu Nidal stopped
cooperating and was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The official's account could not be independently confirmed, but
it was supported on some points by a PLO official.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Egyptian officials denied that Abu Nidal was on
Egyptian territory after two Arabic newspapers asserted he was
under arrest in Egypt. On Tuesday, several Egyptian officials
refused to comment when reached in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization, a main
target of Abu Nidal, who has accused the group of betraying the
Palestinian cause by negotiating peace with Israel, said Egypt
would not confirm these reports to them, but left open the
possibility the arrest may have taken place.
</P>
<P>
   The news first surfaced over the last few days in London in two
Saudi-owned Arabic dailies, Al Sharq Al Awsat and Al Hayat.
</P>
<P>
   Al Sharq al-Awsat reported on Aug. 23 that Abu Nidal was dying
of cancer in an Egyptian hospital. Al Hayat asserted on its front
page last week that he had been arrested in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times reported on Tuesday that Abu Nidal had
been arrested by Egyptian authorities as he crossed into Egypt from
Libya.
</P>
<P>
   At that point he was placed under arrest, about two months ago,
the official asserted. It is possible that Egyptian intelligence
planted the story of his terminal illness in anticipation of
getting rid of him, the Arab intelligence officials speculated
today, saying ``he is bound to disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Abu Nidal, whose name means `'Father of Struggle'' is the
founder of the Palestinian opposition Fatah Revolutionary Council
which has claimed lethal attacks around the world, mostly against
Israelis and PLO partisans, but also against Jews in Western Europe
and moderate Arab states.
</P>
<P>
   The group is one of 12 which had its assets frozen by President
Clinton in 1995 for waging campaigns to undermine the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   He broke ranks with the Palestine Liberation Organization in
1972, opting to form his own terror cells which targeted civilians
in numerous countries. Over the past decade he included the PLO
among his targets having taken responsibility for killing some the
organization's top leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Abu Nidal group is smaller now than it had been in
the past, it continues to have adherents in Lebanon, Syria, Libya,
Iraq and according to intelligence officials several dormant cells
in Europe. In Lebanon it is said to command several hundred
members. The State Department says it possesses a `'limited
overseas support structure,'' according to its report, Patterns of
Global Terrorism 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Abu Nidal is wanted in Italy, the United States, the United
Kingdom. The PLO has condemned to death in 1974. At various points
he operated out of Libya, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria. In the past few
years his whereabouts were unknown. Born in Jaffa in 1937, he has
ordered the killing of 150 of his own operatives on suspicion of
treason, which accounts for his ability to elude authorities around
the world for so long.

 &HT;    DA upset that assailant avoided jail after beating coach
 &HT;    By Celia Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ DeKalb County District Attorney J. Tom Morgan said
Tuesday he is outraged that a judge declined to send a Dunwoody,
Ga. man to jail for beating his son's baseball coach with a metal
bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this case had occurred in almost any other county, there
would have been jail time,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Clarence Seeliger on Monday sentenced
defendant Joel Eisenberg to five years' probation for the attack on
Dr. Harvey Steinberg, a radiologist. It occurred May 20, 1997, at
Zaban Park, an Atlanta Jewish Community Center facility in
Dunwoody.
</P>
<P>
   A youth coach himself, Morgan said he attended a sports event
Monday where parents and children were discussing the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said this is totally unacceptable behavior. . . .
Probation is nothing. It's (just saying) don't go do it again,''
said Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Seeliger allowed Eisenberg to enter an ``Alford'' plea, a legal
mechanism that allows defendants to plead guilty it they think it
is in their best interest, even if they believe they are innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Seeliger said he was concerned that Eisenberg's insurance would
not pay for the victim's medical expenses if Eisenberg entered a
straight guilty plea _ an admission that he intentionally harmed
Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Anne Long asked Seeliger Monday to
sentence Eisenberg, who was charged with aggravated battery and
aggravated assault, to a year in jail and nine years probation. But
the judge said he did not believe the case warranted jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, who may suffer permanent nerve damage to his left arm
from the attack, is suing Eisenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, on leave from work, regularly exercises the arm and
is still on medication. He hopes to return to radiology soon.
``It's been an unbelievable ordeal for me and my family,''
Steinberg said. ``I can't physically interact with the children the
way I want to because of the medicine I have to be on. What I wish
is to turn the clock back and never have been on the field that
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred after Eisenberg's son missed a fly ball, and
Steinberg, an assistant coach, made a comment on the error, said
Eisenberg's attorney, Cal Leipold. Eisenberg nudged Steinberg in
the back with a bat to let him know he heard the comment, Leipold
said. Steinberg said he then dropped his baseball glove, but some
witnesses said he threw it at Eisenberg's face, attorneys for both
sides said.

 &HT;    Evacuations begin as Bonnie moves towards coast
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt and Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC BEACH, N.C._More than half a million people were
evacuated Tuesday from the coast of North and South Carolina as
beach communities braced for today's landfall of Hurricane Bonnie,
an erratic, sprawling storm that accelerated and wobbled toward
North Carolina's Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Gale-force winds hit Tuesday night, a preview of the estimated
top winds of 115 mph winds that will sweep ashore today in the
Atlantic season's first hurricane. Tourists cut short vacations,
while residents flocked to emergency shelters set up in schools.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt had a succinct warning for coastal
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out of there,'' he said. ``It's not the time to be
frolicking on the beach and tempting fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predicted that the storm's eye would hit land at
Carteret County, a peninsula just west of the Cape Lookout
lighthouse. One predicted track put popular family beaches and the
state port at Morehead City in the path of damaging Category 3
tidal surges and winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in for a blow,'' said Robert Miller, 47, owner of Beach
Hardware at Atlantic Beach, a narrow spit at the southern tip of
the fragile, heavily developed Outer Banks. ``If the brunt of the
storm hits at high tide, it is going to be pretty rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie was packing winds equal to those of Hurricane Fran, which
did extensive damage along the North Carolina coast in September of
1996. Riding behind Bonnie out in the Atlantic near the Virgin
Islands was Hurricane Danielle, with winds of 80 mph expected to
increase in the next several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case Bonnie decided to take a sudden sharp turn west off
its northwest path, South Carolina officials ordered the evacuation
of about 200,000 people in Georgetown and Horry counties, and
closed the Port of Georgetown to ships.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, where some 330,000 coastal residents were
evacuated and shelters were set up in 13 counties, Carteret County
officials said they were concerned about permanent residents who
had decided not to go to shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the tourists are gone, but permanent residents rarely
evacuate,'' said Mike Addertion, the county's emergency management
coordinator. ``A lot of people live on the water and in pine
forests. They could have a lot of damage.''
</P>
<P>
   In Raleigh, the General Assembly recessed early to allow
lawmakers to head home to prepare for the storm, and the governor
declared a state of emergency and put 800 National Guardsmen on
alert.
</P>
<P>
   Along the coast, residents and business owners dragged out
plywood from past storms and nailed it over windows and doors. At
Ace Sound Hardware on Emerald Isle, owners posted a sign reading,
``My Bonnie lies over the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic backed up for miles as vacationers fled inland. On
Emerald Isle, Harry and Betty Rouse joined the caravan of
recreational vehicles and boats backed up on N.C. 58 waiting to
cross a two-lane bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The couple secured their 33-foot trailer home at Emerald Isle's
Beachfront RV Park, and then headed home to Greenville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do all we can do, but I figure if the Lord wants it to
hit, it will hit,'' Betty Rouse said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Indian Beach Pier, owner Lib Heverly stretched duct tape
over windows of the office overlooking the nearly deserted
campground. She recalled that, two years ago, hurricanes Bertha and
Fran damaged the end of the pier, as well as flooded streets and
caused widespread damages to beach property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just getting back from Bertha and Fran,'' said Heverly,
61. ``We are just crossing our fingers on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertha barreled up the Cape Fear River at Wilmington on July 12,
1996. Fran, North Carolina's most costly natural disaster, followed
on Sept. 5 and caused an estimated $6 billion in damages and 22
deaths as it cut a swatch as far inland as Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency preparedness officials said beach residents and
vacationeers heeded evacuation orders, despite the uncertainty
Tuesday over Bonnie's exact landfall. Officials warned that the
Category 3 storm could cause severe coastal flooding and
destruction of homes and buildings, as Fran did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are taking this one seriously,'' said John
Smith, a Red Cross supervisor in Beaufort, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   On the two westbound lanes of U.S. 70, heading away from
Atlantic Beach, Morehead City, Emerald Isle and other spots near
the southern tip of the Outer Banks, loaded vehicles streamed away
Tuesday afternoon from a projected point of landfall.
</P>
<P>
   In the hustle, some people towed fishing boats and other
watercraft with names like Reel Pleasure, Big Duck and Out of
Control. Plywood covered the plate glass windows at the Winn Dixie
in Morehead City. Spray-painted in red was a reminder to customers:
Open. Open.
</P>
<P>
   At the Fuel Market in Riverdale, 30 miles northwest of the
beach, gas truck drivers Gray Pridgin and Harold Hacker topped off
the station's four 12,000-gallon, above-ground gas storage tanks to
help them stay put during the hurricane-force winds expected this
morning. At other locations, they topped off underground tanks.
</P>
<P>
   A deluge might spell trouble, said Hacker, which is why he made
his regular 90-minute fuel run to suppliers in Raleigh Tuesday.
``If the tanks run out of gas, they'll bust up through the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Cars packed around the Fuel Market's four pumps six-to-10 at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't hardly see that all day long,'' Pridgin said.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Terry was one of the customers, filling up her aqua blue
Dodge Caravan. She planned to ride out the storm with her family of
six in Havelock, 15 miles inland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to get some water and ice,'' said Terry, who
has boarded up her house. ``If I'm going to stay, I'm going to be
protected.''

 &HT;    Column: Smile drivers, you could be on HOV camera
 &HT;    By Joey Ledford
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A high-tech version of ``Candid Camera'' might someday
be the answer for more effective policing of Atlanta's HOV lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by virtual waves of single-occupancy HOV violators,
the Georgia Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway
Administration asked Georgia Tech scientists to focus on the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gimmestad, principal research scientist for Tech's
Electro-Optics, Environment and Materials Laboratory, has devised a
way to identify the number of motorists in a vehicle without having
to rely on the vision of an enforcement officer.
</P>
<P>
   Officers often err, as I can personally attest. Last spring, I
was pulled over by a DOT enforcement officer who failed to spot my
10-year-old passenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only practical way was to get a picture of the people in
each vehicle,'' Gimmestad told Georgia transportation engineers at
a seminar last month. Standard still and video photography proved
impractical because of illumination problems. In addition, many
vehicles have tinted windows the naked eye or traditional cameras
can't penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   So Gimmestad devised an infrared strobe light, mounted on a
tripod by the roadside, to illuminate the interior of each passing
vehicle with a lightning-quick, invisible flash of infrared light.
</P>
<P>
   The infrared light even allows the camera to look through those
dark-tinted windows. ``We were sure happy to see that,'' said
Gimmestad.
</P>
<P>
   Gimmestad and his camera crew set up recently on an overpass,
focused on a single travel lane, and took some pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The detail was quite remarkable. One female driver photographed
was caught in the act of putting on her makeup.
</P>
<P>
   The device was able to take up to two pictures per second of
vehicles traveling up to 80 mph and store them on a computer hard
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the picture did not appear to be clear, the data ``could
be enhanced'' by the computer to determine the number of
passengers, even infants in back-seat child safety seats and
passengers in the back seats of full-sized vans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed this can be done,'' said Gimmestad. ``You can see
seat belts or lack of seat belts. You can see people talking on
cell phones as they drive.''
</P>
<P>
   When one considers that Gimmestad's cameras can be linked to
separate gear to record license plates, the possibility exists they
could be used to police HOV lanes if the Legislature made it legal.
HOV violators might one day receive citations in the mail, along
with a snapshot of the violation.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect it anytime soon, however. ``I don't think we could
put (together) a prototype that will work on the freeway for
several years,'' said Marion Waters, DOT's state traffic operations
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Since the device enhances what can be seen with the naked eye,
there is the real possibility of privacy law concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be very careful with the whole process,'' said
Gimmestad. ``You keep the traveling public aware of what you are
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters rejects the argument that such a camera could be seen as
a prying Big Brother sticking his nose into your personal vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are breaking a law on a public road, I don't think
you'd have the same rights,'' he said. ``If you are smooching with
your girlfriend in the grocery store, everyone in that grocery
store has the right to look.''

<P>
   MANTEO, N.C. _ The Outer Banks of North Carolina, an
elbow-shaped strand of barrier islands that have been battered time
and again by surging swells and withering gales, prepared Tuesday
for its latest assault from the sea as hundreds of thousands of
residents and tourists evacuated ahead of the anticipated landing
of Hurricane Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m., officials with the National Hurricane Center in Miami
predicted that the center of the category 3 storm, with sustained
winds of 115 mph, would come ashore by midday Wednesday. Using
satellite imaging and computer models, the center forecast that the
eye of the storm was most likely to strike between Wilmington,
N.C., and the southern end of the Outer Banks, near Cape Lookout
National Seashore. Hurricane warnings were in effect from Cape
Romain, S.C., to Chincoteague, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lepore, a public affairs officer for the hurricane center,
said that the most intimidating feature of the hurricane was its
breadth, with hurricane force winds extending 145 miles from the
eye and tropical storm force winds stretching across about 520
miles. ``It's about four or five times larger than Andrew in area
of extent,'' Lepore said, referring to the 1992 hurricane that
devastated south Florida with winds that reached 145 mph.
</P>
<P>
   After several days of sluggish movement in the waters north of
the Bahamas, Bonnie's momentum more than tripled as it approached
the southeastern coast. The hurricane was moving at 16 mph Tuesday
afternoon, compared with 5 mph on Monday. The hurricane center
warned that storm surges could reach 11 feet above normal tide
levels and that expected rainfall of 5 to 10 inches could cause
heavy flooding.
</P>
<P>
   The governors of both North Carolina and South Carolina declared
mandatory evacuations from coastal counties Tuesday, affecting
about 310,000 people in North Carolina and about 220,000 in South
Carolina. Motorists leaving those areas, many in cars with
surfboards and fishing rods strapped to their roofs, faced creeping
bumper-to-bumper rides for dozens of miles. Shelters opened in some
counties well before the storm approached.
</P>
<P>
   Both governors dusted off their best doomsday rhetoric to try to
persuade coastal residents and visitors to seek safer ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really could be killed,'' said Gov. Jim Hunt of North
Carolina. ``This is not a time to be frolicking on the beach and
tempting fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. David Beasley of South Carolina acknowledged that officials
could not force residents from their homes. But, he said, ``anybody
who does not abide by the mandatory evacuation, our law enforcement
has been instructed to ask them their next of kin.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency management officials said that most residents and
visitors seemed to be heeding the call, influenced perhaps by fresh
memories of the two hurricanes, Fran and Bertha, that blasted the
Wilmington area in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are paying attention,'' said Dorothy Holt, a
spokeswoman for the emergency management office in Dare County,
N.C., which includes most of the Outer Banks. ``In fact, I've heard
quite a bit from folks who in the past may not have evacuated but
who say they are going this time.''
</P>
<P>
   By afternoon on a day of sunny skies and eerily placid seas, the
beaches along the Outer Banks were virtually deserted and
storekeepers were busy nailing sheets of plywood over their
windows. Workers at Seabreeze Florist in Kitty Hawk, just north of
here, adorned their plywood with a lyrical message: ``My Bonnie
lies over the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Red and black hurricane warning flags flew in front of fire
stations and real estate offices. Radio broadcasts buzzed with
announcements of school closings and postponements of PTA meetings
and Lion's Club bingo games. Deejays repeatedly offered
pre-hurricane advice from the Federal Emergency Management Agency:
Cut down dead limbs, drain half of the water from swimming pools,
leave toilet seats up so that pets left in houses will have water
to drink.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Harrison, a 41-year-old tourist from Walkersville, Md.,
who had to cut short her vacation in Nags Head, N.C., near here,
could not hide her disappointment while packing beach chairs and
unopened cases of beer into her truck. ''It's just awful,'' she
said. ``We just got here Sunday. We were crushed when we heard.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, some leathery residents vowed to ride out the storm
despite warnings from authorities. ``I've been through too many of
these to be nervous,'' said David Bragg, a sport-fishing boat
captain who lives in south Nags Head. ``We're having a poker game
tonight. I'm going to try to win some money.''
</P>
<P>
   But the military was taking the approaching storm quite
seriously. About 60 Navy ships at Norfolk, Va., were instructed to
leave port and ride out the storm some 300 miles at sea. And at
Pope Air Force Base, N.C., ``every plane that is flyable is
leaving,'' said Lt. Tisha McGarry, a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In Wilmington, residents could not help but remember the vicious
one-two punch delivered by Bertha and Fran two years ago. Michael
Queen, pastor at First Baptist Church there, said contractors are
still replacing the historic steeple that crumbled in the storm.
``We put up a 40-foot section last Thursday and we've got another
60 feet to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And in Buxton, N.C., residents worried about the potential for
damage to the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, which the National Park
Service has proposed moving inland because of the threat from
encroaching seas. ``The lighthouse itself has withstood the type of
winds we're going to experience,'' said Bob Woody, a park service
spokesman. ``The difference will come with the erosional impact,
and that will depend on what quadrant of the storm it's in.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther out in the Atlantic, meanwhile, Hurricane Danielle moved
toward the U.S. Virgin Islands with 80 mph winds, and forecasters
predicted it could be as strong as Bonnie within days.

   WASHINGTON _ Federal authorities said on Tuesday that a sealed
indictment had been returned by a grand jury in New York against
Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born multimillionaire who has possible
ties to the deadly bombings earlier this month in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming news accounts, the officials said that the indictment
charging bin Laden with committing terrorist crimes had been
returned under seal before the embassy bombings on Aug. 7. The
indictment was first reported by the Wall Street Journal this week.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment has a negligible practical impact on bin Laden
because, the officials acknowledged, that they have little hope of
arresting or returning him from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the missile attacks last week on his training bases in
Afghanistan indicates that the United States regards him as a
problem subject to military action rather than as a fugitive to
brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
   The federal officials would not confirm the precise charges
outlined in the indictment against bin Laden. But they said he has
been the subject of scrutiny by the FBI since the World Trade
Center bombing in Manhattan in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A total of six people have been convicted of charges related to
that plot, among them Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian
cleric convicted of inciting the plot. A federal grand jury in New
York has been investigating further links between bin Laden and
Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, who was convicted as the mastermind of the
World Trade Center bombing and of a conspiracy to bomb American
passenger airlines in the Far East (a plot that was not carried
out.)
</P>
<P>
   The authorities' interest in bin Laden's suspected terrorist
activities intensified after the still-unsolved June 1996 bombing
at Al Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in which 19 American airmen
died. But the officials said that prosecutors began to present
evidence to the grand jury in New York about a year ago, adding
that the indictment was returned in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said they have compelling intelligence
information pointing to bin Laden's role as a spiritual and
financial figure behind a variety of terrorist acts. He has
publicly claimed responsibility for efforts to kill American
servicemen in Somalia in 1993 and in Yemen a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said they also had convincing information of bin
Laden's role in the Kenya and Tanzania bombings. That information
is believed to include intercepted communications among bin Laden
and his associates, but the officials have never disclosed the
content of those communications.

MARSH &AMP; MCLENNAN TO BUY SEDGWICK GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fortifying its position as the world's largest
insurance broker, Marsh &AMP; McLennan Cos. of New York said Tuesday
that it had agreed to buy the London-based Sedgwick Group, the
largest independent broker in Europe, for $2.05 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The deal increases Marsh &AMP; McLennan's business with the largest
corporations in Europe and with midsized companies in the United
States, the two main areas that Sedgwick had developed. And while
Marsh &AMP; McLennan has a commanding presence in financial services,
Sedgwick brings the combined company expertise in marine and energy
coverage, from oil-drilling rigs to the suppliers of drilling
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest things we get in this are operations in places
where we were not operating, or not operating as well, and a
greater accumulation of professional expertise,'' said A.J.C.
Smith, Marsh &AMP; McLennan's chief executive. In Asia alone, he said,
``this doubles our scale.''
</P>
<P>
   To acquire the British company, Marsh &AMP; McLennan agreed to pay
2.25 pounds a share, or about $3.60 _ 58 percent more than
Sedgwick's closing price on the London Stock Exchange on Monday.
The price _ a total of 1.25 billion pounds, or $2.05 billion, works
out to about 15 times earnings under generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States at a time when other insurance
brokers have been trading at 10 or 11 times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was the latest in a struggle for dominance in the
worldwide brokerage business between Marsh and its chief rival, Aon
Corp. of Chicago. And analysts said they thought Marsh had agreed
to pay such a premium partly to keep Sedgwick out of the hands of
Aon. Otherwise, said Ira Zuckerman, vice president for research at
Nutmeg Securities in Westport, Conn., ``they wouldn't have made as
high a bid as they did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling,'' Zuckerman added, ``is that it was sort of
pre-emptive.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Steel, a spokeswoman for Aon in Chicago, declined to
comment on whether Aon had been interested in buying Sedgwick. Nor
would she comment on analysts' speculation that Aon might submit a
higher bid for Sedgwick.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also suggested that, alternatively, Aon might
consider offering a higher bid for Willis Corroon Group, another
big London brokerage that an investor group led by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &AMP; Co., the New York buyout firm, said last month it had
agreed to buy for $1.4 billion. Steel would not comment on that
prospect either.
</P>
<P>
   Sedgwick and Willis Corroon were the last of the big competitors
of Marsh and Aon, leaving a handful of smaller insurance brokers
that analysts said were likely to be bought in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The American depository receipts of Sedgwick _ each representing
five shares _ rose $5.125, to $17.375, on the New York Stock
Exchange. Marsh &AMP; McLennan's shares fell $1.125, to $55.5625.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh had a little more than $6 billion in revenue last year
compared with $5.7 billion for Aon. The combined revenue of Marsh
and Sedgwick at the end of last year would have been $7.6 billion,
putting the new company far ahead of Aon.
</P>
<P>
   Aon moved ahead of Marsh, the longtime leader in the business,
in January 1997 with the purchase of Alexander &AMP; Alexander Services
for $1.23 billion. But then Marsh reclaimed the No. 1 spot two
months later by taking over Johnson &AMP; Higgins for $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In growing ever bigger, the companies hope to gain economies of
scale, and to increase their market share and the range of
expertise they can offer customers. With more influence, they also
hope to be able to negotiate better prices for their corporate
clients with the world's insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Buckley, a senior vice president and analyst at Duff &AMP;
Phelps Credit Rating Company in Chicago, said corporate customers
could benefit from lower prices from Marsh if it succeeded in
cutting costs through the merger. ``But the downside is that
competition between the brokers will have lessened,'' he said.
``Corporate customers will be forced to deal with fewer, more
powerful brokers, which may not always have their best interests at
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, Marsh's chief executive, said he was ``comfortable that
the price'' his company was paying ``was a good one.'' Some
savings, he said, would come in trimming the combined work force of
52,000. But he said more of the reduction was expected through
retirements and turnover than through layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   With the Sedgwick deal coming so soon after the acquisition of
Johnson &AMP; Higgins, Cathy Seifert, an S&AMP;P Equity Group analyst, said
this raised questions about how smoothly Marsh would be able to
combine the two companies. ``If it is very disruptive,'' she said,
``that could be a positive for Aon.''
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to solidify the deal, Marsh's bankers obtained a
commitment from the holders of more than 40 percent of Sedgwick's
stock that they would accept the offer. There is a caveat, however.
If another bidder offers 10 percent more, the deal can be
reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he expected a counterbid from Aon, Smith said: ``I
would hesitate to be involved in a bid for a professional
management staff where the staff were committed to somebody
else.'' &QL;

NEW JERSEY TEAM ROLLS ON, 5-3, OVER NORTH CAROLINA SQUAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: BBO-TOMS-RIVER) 
(JT) 
 By ED GUZMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. _ The Toms River second baseman Joey
Franceschini fielded a ground ball and stepped on the bag to record
the final out of a 5-3 victory over Greenville, N.C., Tuesday
afternoon and the celebrating erupted on the field and in the
stands. The New Jersey team had just added to its improbable run
through the Little League World Series by winning its third game in
as many days and assuring itself of a spot in the semifinals on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   But shortstop Todd Frazier, who hit a two-run home run and
scored three times, was busy looking for his family in the stands.
The 12-year old Frazier, who just 18 hours before had pitched a
complete-game victory and as the leadoff hitter has been setting
the tone for the Toms River attack, just wanted to see the sheer
joy on the faces of his family.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty to see, as 14 cousins, according to his father
Charlie's count, were there along with his parents and two
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he misses us a lot,'' said Todd's older brother, Jeff,
who was on the 1995 Toms River team that made it to Williamsport.
``I mean, he hasn't really seen us in three weeks. I just miss
fooling around with him.''
</P>
<P>
   If Todd Frazier does miss his family, he is having too much fun
to really let on. In the post-game news conference, he was
displaying a sparkling smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome,'' Frazier said of winning Tuesday's game. ``I
didn't think we'd go 3-0. I've had fun down here and it's a great
feeling to be in Williamsport.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he was going to tell Jeff about his experience,
he smiled and said: ``Now I can tell him that I hit two home runs
and he only hit one.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff's team went 1-2 at Williamsport.
</P>
<P>
   As the Toms River Little League team marched toward Howard J.
Lamade Stadium before Tuesday's game, the players began to chant:
``Who let the dogs out? Who? Who?''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of Tuesday afternoon's game, Greenville was wondering
the same thing about these 12-year-olds who refer to themselves as
Beasts from the East. They had won the longest game in Little
League World Series history Sunday night _ 11 innings _ and on
Monday had beaten a team that was 17-0 in West regional play,
topping Cypress, Calif., by 4-2. Toms River was ready to wrap up a
spot in the next round, and have some fun in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The manager, Mike Gaynor, sent his son, Casey, to the mound to
face a tough Greenville lineup that impressed the manager in
Monday's batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a scary bunch of dudes,'' said Gaynor of Greenville's
hitters. He said he told Casey ``to go out there and do his
thing.'' It was his show now.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey Gaynor was more than up to the task, going all six innings
and allowing only five hits and three earned runs. In the third
inning, Gaynor served up a slow curve that shortstop Justin Hardee,
a left-handed-batter, pulled down the right field line for a
two-run home run that put Greenville up, 2-1. After that, Gaynor
retired eight batters in a row before allowing one run in the final
inning.
</P>
<P>
   With Gaynor, whose older brother Colin also hit a home run for
that 1995 team, keeping it close, it gave Frazier the chance to be
a hero in the top of the fourth inning. Frazier had scored the
game's opening run in the first inning and came up to the plate
with a runner on first and one out. A right-handed batter, Frazier
drove a fastball on the outside corner over the right-center field
fence to put Toms River up, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   It had looked as if Toms River had added a run three batters
later on a sacrifice fly by Franceschini that scored first baseman
Scott Fisher. But the third-base umpire, James Tuck, called Fisher
out for leaving the base too soon when Greenville appealed the
play, keeping it as a one-run game. It ended up not mattering as
Toms River added two more runs in the sixth inning on a pair of
wild pitches that scored Frazier and Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Toms River will wait to see whom it will face in Thursday
night's game, which will be for the United States championship and
a berth in the Series final.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Cypress (0-1) will play Jenison, Mich. (0-2). On
Wednesday night, Cypress will face Greenville (1-1).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to sit back and enjoy every bit of it,'' Mike
Gaynor said of the Little League World Series experience.
</P>
<P>
   For Frazier and his teammates, that means Ping-Pong games and
relaxing by the pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the king of Ping-Pong,'' Frazier said proudly.
</P>

LIBYA TO RESPOND TO PROPOSAL FOR PAN AM BOMBING TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With prominent international allies pressing Libya
to accept an offer to allow two Libyans to go on trial in the
Netherlands for the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet, the Libyan
government said Tuesday that it would announce Wednesday whether it
would agree to the U.S. and British proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Arab League and South African President Nelson Mandela,
a leading international defender of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi,
suggested that Libya would accept the plan. Under the proposal, the
two Libyans, identified by U.S. officials as intelligence agents,
would be extradited to The Hague and tried by three Scottish judges
under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American-British proposal is compatible with the previous
Arab suggestions, which Libya has accepted,'' Arab League Secretary
General Esmat Abdel Meguid said after a meeting in Cairo with the
British ambassador to Egypt, Sir David Blatherwick. ``We have been
seeking this solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela said he was confident that the plan ``should lead to the
resolution of this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gadhafi gave no indication of what his decision would be,
and senior Clinton administration officials would not hazard a
guess about the thinking of the notoriously unpredictable Libyan
leader. Still, the U.S. officials said they were pleased with the
statements from the Arab League and Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyan government news agency, Jana, reported Tuesday that
Libya's Foreign and Justice Ministries were closely studying the
proposal and that a decision whether to accept it was expected
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A Libyan lawyer for the two suspects was quoted Tuesday as
saying that his clients would voluntarily surrender to a special
court in the Netherlands ``if the conditions for a fair trial are
provided to protect their rights pending, during and after the
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   An agreement by Libya to allow the suspects to be tried in The
Hague, the Dutch city that is the headquarters for the
International Court of Justice, would be a milestone in the
decade-old search for justice by the families of the 270 people
killed in the explosion of the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland,
in December 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain, which had once demanded that the
Libyans be tried in the U.s. or British court systems, announced
Monday that they would agree to holding the suspects' trial in the
Netherlands instead.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The proposal effectively called Gadhafi's bluff, since his
government had suggested just such a plan. Libya had insisted that
the suspects, identified by the Justice Department as Abdel Basset
al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifa Fhimah, could not receive a fair trial
in the United States or Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain have vowed to seek to extend
sanctions on Libya. to include an oil embargo, if Libya turns down
the deal. If Gadhafi accepts, however, the existing sanctions on
Libya would be eased. The United States and Britain introduced a
resolution in the United Nations on Tuesday that would provide for
the suspension of the sanctions if the two suspects are handed
over.
</P>
<P>
   Although the end of the sanctions would be welcomed by Libya, a
trial of the two men risks exposure of evidence that could tie
senior officials in the Libyan government _ possibly including
Gadhafi himself _ to the decision to bomb the Pan Am jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he accepts, we'll be delighted, and we'll hold this trial
just as soon as we can,'' said a senior Clinton administration
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``But I still
find it hard to believe that he'll allow this trial ever to take
place. You may see Gadhafi accept this offer initially and then try
to quibble over the details. I hope I'm wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investigators have suggested that the Pan Am jet was
destroyed in retaliation for the U.S. bombing of the Libyan
capital, Tripoli, in 1986. President Ronald Reagan ordered the
bombing of Tripoli in response to evidence linking Libyan
intelligence to a terrorist attack on a Berlin disco in April 1986
in which a U.S soldier was killed.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing an indictment of the two Libyans in 1991 for the
Pan Am bombing, Justice Department officials said that they had
tracked a part of the bomb's timing device to a Swiss company that
had sold it to a senior Libyan intelligence officer.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said that Fhimah held a cover job as a station
manager for Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta. He is alleged to have
placed the bomb in a suitcase there that was routed to Frankfurt,
where it was transferred to the Pan Am jet. Megrahi, the indictment
said, purchased clothing and an umbrella in a store in Malta that
were put into the luggage to hide the bomb.

EX-PREMIER OF FRANCE INVESTIGATED ON FINANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Former Prime Minister Alain Juppe was placed under
investigation Tuesday in the latest French political party
financing scandal.
</P>
<P>
   It involves the inquiry into allegedly phony payrolls at Paris
City Hall while he was at the right hand of the mayor, Jacques
Chirac, who is now France's President.
</P>
<P>
   Justice officials cited Tuesday by Le Monde said an
investigating magistrate, Patrick Desmure, was looking into charges
from a former city official that about 200 people on the municipal
payroll in the 1980s did not work for the city at all but, in
reality, for Chirac's party, the conservative Rally for the
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Desmure, the newspaper said, had sent Juppe a letter informing
him that he was under investigation for charges including misuse of
public funds and abuse of public trust. He could be cleared of the
charges by the investigation or formally accused and tried.
</P>
<P>
   Juppe, interviewed on television tonight, said he had not done
anything that was illegal at the time, and denied that there had
been any swindle or that he had been taking public funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I arrived on the scene, in 1988, there was no law
regulating political parties,'' he said, referring to the absence
of effective legislation before then on how parties could finance
themselves. He added that ``the legislature stepped in after 1988''
and that by the time he left the party presidency, ``everything was
legal.''
</P>
<P>
   Michel Roussin, Chirac's chief of staff when he was mayor, was
also notified Tuesday that he was under investigation on some of
the same charges as Juppe.
</P>
<P>
   Juppe, secretary general of the party from 1988 until 1994 and
its president from 1994 to 1997, was finance director of the City
of Paris from 1988 until he became Foreign Minister in 1993. Chirac
resigned as mayor in 1995 when he won the presidency and made Juppe
prime minister, a post Juppe held until the conservatives lost an
election last year. He is now mayor of Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Socialists, conservative parties have come under
investigation in recent years for fund-raising practices that used
to be commonly accepted in France _ shakedowns, kickbacks and
padding the payrolls with no-shows in municipalities they
controlled.

<P>
   DEL RIO, Texas _ Pat Calderon was standing on tip-toes atop his
projection television console, the dark water in his living room so
deep it was licking the bottom of his chin, when his 82-year-old
disabled mother, who was floating nearby on an upholstered love
seat, asked if he would mind fetching her a dry blanket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Mom, look where we are, we're in a flood,''' said
Calderon, a fifth-grade teacher from Del Rio's predominantly
Hispanic San Felipe Estates. ``I was holding onto that love seat so
it didn't tip over and dump her in the water. I felt like that
Titanic guy.''
</P>
<P>
   For six hours, they were stranded like that, the water slowly
rising and then slowly falling, revealing a jumble of sopping
carpet, furniture, books, videotapes, electronic equipment, all
covered in gunk. One lone candle had bobbed all night long on a
floating end table while occasional lightning flashes revealed the
swift current tearing through what was left of his neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the middle of this stuff and I couldn't believe it
was happening,'' Calderon said.
</P>
<P>
   The huge swell that put two-thirds of Del Rio under water early
Monday _ some of it, like Calderon's neighborhood, more than 8 feet
under water _ had gushed down the San Felipe Creek and its normally
dry tributaries, into the Rio Grande River and was already halfway
to the Gulf of Mexico by Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   All that was left was a swath of town covered with mud and
debris, collapsed buildings, buckling pavement, chewed-up bridges
and cars scattered everywhere, upside down, on their side, on top
of buildings, on top of one another, like Matchbox cars in an
untidy toy box.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came so quickly,'' said Gloria Sotelo, a member of the Del
Rio city council who was helping hand out drinking water at a Red
Cross shelter Tuesday afternoon. ``By the time you crossed the
street, the water was up to your knees. By the time you turned
back, it was up to your shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sotelo, like many of the more than 600 people seeking
shelter in the Del Rio Civic Center because their homes were gone
or uninhabitable, had known some of the six people in town who
officials said had died or the dozen or so who were swept away and
are still missing, officials said. ``It's too sad to think about
now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the river, in Ciudad Acuna, Mexico, four people had died
in the floods and ten others remained missing, said Mario Neyra, a
Mexican disaster relief official.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sutherland, associate pastor at Grace Community Church,
which had been housing some of the flood victims, came into the
civic center Tuesday afternooon saying, ``We're out of food, can
you help us?'' Some food was found. An off-duty policeman delivered
a truckload of donated drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross doctors worked from folding tables on the civic
center's stage while hundreds of people sprawled on cots and foam
mattresses and children scampered through the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Porras sat on a pillow on a metal folding chair in the
civic center, her one-day-old daughter, Ruby, squalling in her lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband was at work and I started having contractions
around 11 o'clock Sunday night,'' she said. ``It was all of a
sudden the rain came and the kitchen started filling up with water.
The water kept going up and the contractions kept getting worse, so
I finally called an ambulance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Porras had her daughter at 2:14 a.m. while the water was
still rising and, when she returned to the neighborhood the next
morning, found her home flooded. Neighbors said she and the
ambulance had barely beat the deluge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you'd say I was lucky,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cyndi Wright, a Red Cross spokeswoman, said that 635 people had
slept in the center Monday night and at least as many were expected
Tuesday night. Two other shelters had been closed Monday night when
the rising water threatened to swamp them. In Eagle Pass, more than
700 people slept in five shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to have enough food, but water is still at a
premium,'' Ms. Wright said. ``The bigger problem is that there is
no rental housing or any kind of unoccupied housing in Del Rio.
There's no place for these people to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sotelo described the flood's victims as ``mostly poor, about
90 percent of them, and a lot of them without insurance, so I don't
know how we're going to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Rio is a remote town of more than 30,000 in the arid
scrublands along the Rio Grande River some 145 miles west of San
Antonio. Like the rest of Texas, it had been in the midst of the
biggest drought in at least four decades when the remnants of
Tropical Storm Charley dumped more than 17 inches of rain on Sunday
and early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Though there is some ranching nearby, and a few small farms,
most of the town's economy flows from its border crossing, the
factories just south of the border and nearby Laughlin Air Force
Base. ``We're basically a small, working community, and this flood
hit the poorest part of town,'' Ms. Sotelo said. ``The whole county
has come out to help with this, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Local fast food outlets had sent hamburgers, tacos and
sandwiches to the shelters. Churches were collecting old clothes.
The flood had swamped the town's water pumps, and the taps are
expected to stay dry for several more days, forcing people to use
swimming pool water to wash. Dozens of people walked with plastic
buckets down to the still-swollen creek to fill them with muddy
water to flush their toilets.
</P>
<P>
   At various spots around the city, lines stretched 20 or 30 deep
of people waiting for handouts of drinking water donated by the Air
Force and by local ranchers with untainted wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got a town that's full of precious people,'' said
Jackie Isenhour, a retired restaurant owner who was also helping
out at the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The swell that hit Del Rio early Monday had passed through Eagle
Pass, the next significant town downriver, by late Monday night.
Unlike Del Rio, Eagle Pass had some warning. Hundreds were
evacuated and, while the water did flood into many city streets,
there were no deaths or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Across the river, in Piedras Negras, one person was killed in
the flooding, Neyra said, and three people were still missing
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Farther downriver, at Laredo, all three international bridge
crossings were ordered closed and the swell is expected to sweep
through town around 1 p.m. Wednesday. Just beyond Laredo is Lake
Falcon, which officials said will swallow up most of the flood
waters and stop it from pushing further downriver toward McAllen or
Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Calderon said his mother, Leonore, was resting comfortably
at a relative's house. She had resisted leaving their house when
the water started rising. ``She was in her wheelchair, grabbing
onto the wall saying she wouldn't go,'' he said. By the time it was
clear that they ought to leave, the water was too high to get away.
</P>
<P>
   ``First I put my other on her bed, then watched the water come
up the bedpost,'' he said. ``Then the mattress started floating.
The water came up to my chest. I had to stand on a chair, and it
came up to my chest again. If that love seat hadn't floated by, I
don't know what I would have done with my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked around the wreckage of his house, mud smeared across
it like peanut butter on a sandwich. The current had picked up his
blue Lincoln, carried it 50 yards up the street and dumped it on
the roof of his brother's auto parts store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we never go through anything like this again,''
Calderon said. ``At least we made it. We're a little stinky, but we
made it.''

   TOMS RIVER, N.J. _ Perhaps it is the duty of a town's top leader
to be wise and calm amid pandemonium. And that's the role Mayor
Jerry Geoghegan was playing Tuesday afternoon at Mugsy's Bar and
Grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where your heart has to go out to the losers,''
Geoghegan said after Todd Frazier, Toms River's powerhouse
shortstop, blasted a two-run homer to give the team a 3-2 lead in
the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa. ``They are
trying as hard as Toms River is. It's just not happening for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But among the fans packed into Mugsy's, the mayor was in a
minority of one as the 12-year-old boys of Toms River East American
All-Stars went on to win, 5-3, picking up their third World Series
victory in as many days and clinching a spot in the U.S.
championship game on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amazing,'' said Frank Rosner, who is on the board of
directors of the Toms River East Little League and arrived at
Mugsy's to watch the last two innings. All around him, ecstatic
fans were hugging, clapping each other on the back and slapping
high-fives. ``This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for these
kids,'' Rosner said. ``And they are playing it to the hilt.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time in four years that Toms River, the
working-class seat of Ocean County, has sent a team to Little
League's field of dreams in Williamsport. But by beating a squad
from Greenville, N.C., on Tuesday, and securing a spot in the
tournament's final four, Toms River has surpassed the fortunes of
its 1995 predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   While the source of the team's strength continues to be the
subject of much debate, one thing is certain: In Toms River, Little
League is an extraordinarily big deal. There are two leagues, Toms
River, which has about 600 players, and Toms River East, which has
1,200 players.
</P>
<P>
   In Toms River East, enrolling in a season of Little League costs
$80, not counting the purchase of a baseball mitt. (The league
provides bats, balls, helmets and uniforms.) In addition , the
league conducts private fund-raising efforts, like candy sales, and
solicits corporate sponsorships in order to meet operating expenses
of about $200,000 a year. There are seven ball fields in Toms River
East, one of which is equipped with lights for night games.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a huge commitment of time and energy from parents
who coach. The Toms River East All-Stars began practicing daily in
early July and have been on the road playing games throughout the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   And the league has just finished an indoor facility that will
allow batting and pitching practice to continue through the winter.
``It will help us to compete against Florida and California where
they are outdoors all year round,'' said Kevin Fox, a United
Airlines pilot, who is also on the league's board of directors.
``We have tryouts in the snow.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is hardly surprising that World Series mania has taken
hold in Toms River. On the streets and in local stores, signs and
banners urge the team on. Tuesday morning, two charter buses set
out to get fans to Pennsylvania in time for the first pitch and
even more people are expected to make the trip, either by bus or in
car pools, for Thursday's game. On Saturday, the winner of that
games faces the international champion.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials were planning a welcome home celebration and a
parade, no matter how the team fares. ``I think if you talk to the
average person on the street, everyone is proud as hell of these
kids,'' said Geoghegan. ``These kids are fantastic.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They're pretty tough, too. On Sunday night, Toms River outlasted
Jenison, Mich., to win, 13-9, in 11 innings, the longest game in
Little League World Series history. Then on Monday night, Toms
River stunned a previously undefeated team from Cypress, Calif.,
beating them 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Both this year's squad and the 1995 World Series team were
managed by Michael Gaynor, the owner of a local chain of sports
apparel stores. In 1995, Gaynor's older son Colin pitched for the
team and played shortstop. This year, his younger son, Casey,
pitched a complete game Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Colin had been in Williamsport over the weekend, but was forced
to return to Toms River for the start of high school football
practice. Tuesday, he was in the crowd at Mugsy's as his brother
and father battled the North Carolina team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody thinks it's something in the water, but I don't
think so,'' he said. ``Toms River has got great programs and great
facilities down here. It just shows in our teams. They are
powerhouses every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in Mugsy's had other reasons to stay glued to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any kids playing Little League and I am so into
this,'' said Donna Asanza, who has two girls, ages 3 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my friends kids play in the league, plus my husband is an
orthodontist in town and if you notice,'' she said, gesturing at
the television, ``they all have braces on.''

LEADING TERRORIST KNOWN AS ABU NIDAL IS HELD IN EGYPT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for re-editing throughout) (See also: ATTACK-U.S., ATTACK-SUDAN, ATTACK-NIDAL) 
(sw) 
 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ One of the world's most wanted terrorists, the
Palestinian guerrilla chief, Sabri al-Banna, better known as Abu
Nidal, is being held by the Egyptian authorities in Cairo,
according to an Arab intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Nidal, 61, is accused by Washington of having killed or
injured 900 people in attacks in 20 countries since 1974. He is
wanted in the United States, Great Britain and Italy and was
condemned to death by the Palestine Liberation Organization, from
which he broke in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The story of his capture after years in which he had seemed to
vanish began emerging last week in the Arabic press and was as hard
to pin down as the man himself. The convoluted account is woven of
rumors of double-crosses, mysterious illnesses and murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab intelligence official, who spoke Tuesday on the
condition of anonymity, said Abu Nidal was arrested two months ago
in Egypt but had actually been there for nine months. The official
said Adu Nidal had been cooperating with Egyptian intelligence
agents who wanted to use his network to target terrorist groups
planning bombings and assassinations in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement collapsed two months ago, the intelligence
official said, when Egyptian agents successfully infiltrated the
Palestinian network and started using its operatives against
Egypt's fundamentalist enemies. When Abu Nidal realized this, the
official said, he stopped cooperating and was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   One report suggested that Abu Nidal operatives killed a chief
planner for the Islamic Group a few weeks ago in Yemen. The Islamic
Group killed 58 tourists in an attack on Luxor, the Egyptian
pyramid site, last November.
</P>
<P>
   The official's account could not be independently confirmed, but
it was supported on some points by a PLO official.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Egyptian officials denied that Abu Nidalwas on
Egyptian territory after two Arabic newspapers asserted he was
under arrest in Egypt. On Tuesday, Egyptian officials reached in
Cairo refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   PLO officials said Egypt would not confirm these reports to
them, but left open the possibility the arrest may have taken
place. Abu Nidal who has accused the group of betraying the
Palestinian cause by negotiating peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The news of his arrest first surfaced last week in London in two
Saudi-owned Arabic dailies. Al Sharq al-Awsat reported that he was
dying of cancer in an Egyptian hospital. Al Hayat asserted on its
front page last week that he had been arrested in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times reported on Tuesday that Abu Nidal had
been arrested by Egyptian authorities as he crossed into Egypt from
Libya.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab intelligence official speculated on Tuesday that
Egyptian intelligence planted the story of his terminal illness in
anticipation of getting rid of him, saying, ``he is bound to
disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Abu Nidal, whose name means ``Father of Struggle,'' is the
founder of the Palestinian opposition Fatah Revolutionary Council,
which has claimed responsibility for lethal attacks around the
world, mostly against Israelis and PLO leaders and partisans, but
also against Jews in Western Europe and moderate Arab states.
</P>
<P>
   The group is one of 12 whose assets were frozen by President
Clinton in 1995 for waging campaigns to undermine the Middle East
peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Abu Nidal group is smaller now than it had been in
the past, it continues to have cells in Lebanon, where it is said
to command several hundred members, as well as in Syria, Libya,
Iraq and several dormant organizations in Europe, according to
intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   Sabri al-Banna was born in Jaffa in 1937, and at various points
he operated out of Libya, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria. In the last few
years his whereabouts were unknown. Over the years he is said to
have ordered the killing of 150 of his own operatives on suspicion
of treason, and the elimination of his potential enemies accounts
for his ability to elude authorities around the world for so long.
</P>
<P>
   The PLO condemned Abu Nidal to death in 1974. Over the years,
his death has been reported widely in accounts often spun by the
man himself.

MICROSOFT MAY HAVE DETERRED INTEL FROM NEW INTERNET TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVE LOHR and JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. are so intertwined, so seemingly
dependent on each other for their success, that they are often
referred to as a single entity _ ``Wintel'' _ in recognition of the
degree to which Microsoft's Windows operating system and Intel's
microprocessors dominate the technology of personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   But the government is investigating whether Microsoft has used
its market muscle to force even Intel, its only real peer, to
shelve new technology efforts that conflicted with Microsoft's
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state investigators appear particularly interested
in an August 1995 meeting between Intel executives including
chairman Andrew Grove and Microsoft executives led by chairman Bill
Gates. At the meeting, Gates made ``vague threats'' about
supporting Intel competitors, according to one of many internal
Intel memos that the company was required to hand over to
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, according to a memo written by an Intel executive who
attended the meeting, was ``livid'' about Intel's ``investments in
the Internet, and wanted them stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, federal and state investigators have been
taking taking depositions from Grove and three other Intel
employees, people close to the inquiry said. The investigators are
pursuing additional evidence that might be included in the sweeping
antitrust case against Microsoft filed by the Justice Department
and 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government and the states accuse Microsoft of using
unfair business practices to protect its monopoly in operating
systems and to extend that monopoly into the new markets for
Internet software and commerce. The case, scheduled to go to trial
Sept. 23, focuses mainly on Microsoft's tactics in the market for
browsing software for navigating the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel employees' depositions could strengthen the case if
the evidence suggests a pattern of Microsoft's abusing its monopoly
power. The Justice Department and the states say that in addition
to thwarting competition, Microsoft has the clout to control the
pace of innovation in computing, which is the focus of the
investigation of Microsoft's dealings with Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The public policy implication of Microsoft's power, the
government says, is that technology makes its way into the
marketplace at the pace that is best for Microsoft instead of best
for the economy and for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replies that the antitrust suit is misguided, and that
the company is a champion of innovation, enriching not only itself
but much of the high-technology economy and benefiting consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Intel case and others, federal and state investigators
are trying to portray routine business meetings as attempts to
forge an anticompetitive conspiracy, Microsoft says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business partners like Intel and Microsoft occasionally have
minor disputes, and the fact that the Justice Department and the
states are apparently trying to shoehorn this into their case at
the last minute shows how desperate they are,'' said Charles Rule,
a partner at Covington &AMP; Burling and a former senior Justice
Department official who is an adviser to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department would not comment on its investigation of
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting between executives of Microsoft and Intel in early
August 1995 came only weeks before the introduction of Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was already well along in its plans for the Internet,
though it would not announce them until December 1995. None too
soon, for by early August 1995, Netscape Communications Corp., the
pioneer in browser software, was a hot startup about to sell shares
to the public, setting off an Internet mania on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 2, 1995, Grove met with Gates on Intel's corporate
campus in Santa Clara, Calif., according to the Intel documents.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour session in a windowless, second-floor conference
room was attended by several executives from each company. It was
mainly a confidential exchange of product plans and market
strategies _ not only for Microsoft's operating systems and Intel's
microprocessors but in areas like multimedia software and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There was a heated discussion of software, according to Intel
documents, but it was software that had been developed by Intel
rather than by Microsoft. Though its business is making
microprocessor chips, Intel also works on software, just as
Microsoft does research and development work on hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's silicon microprocessors are typically called the
electronic brains of personal computers, while Microsoft's
operating system is referred to as the central nervous system. Just
as the brain is part of the central nervous system, the line
separating the fundamental hardware and software technology of
computing is often blurred. Software instructions can be programmed
into chips, and hardware functions can be emulated in software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon is simply frozen software,'' Intel's Grove once said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's software work has long been done at its research center
in Hillsboro, Ore., the Intel Architecture Labs. Intel has mainly
developed the software that sits between the operating system and
the microprocessor _ ``under-the-hood'' programs that enhance the
performance of advanced tasks like Internet communications, video
or audio.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Intel gives such software to developers, including to
Microsoft, which has often added Intel-developed enhancements to
its operating systems. This kind of software development makes
business sense for Intel because the more people want
high-performance computing for work or games, the more they need
powerful new computers _ about 85 percent of which are powered by
Intel microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But at times, Intel's software development conflicts with
Microsoft's plans. At the August 1995 meeting, Gates expressed
concern about Intel's software work in two areas _ a layer of
multimedia software called native signal processing, or NSP, and
the possibility that some of Intel's Internet software development
might be at odds with Microsoft's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between Microsoft and Intel over NSP technology
were widely reported in the trade press in 1995, but the memos now
reveal that the two companies were also at odds over Intel's plans
for developing support for Internet features and a software engine
for Java, a programming language created by Sun Microsystems Inc.,
a Microsoft rival.
</P>
<P>
   A microprocessor that supported Java would have enabled programs
written in that language to run on any operating system _ a serious
threat to the dominance of Microsoft's Windows.
</P>
<P>
   According to an internal memo written by an Intel executive who
attended the meeting, Gates left no doubt that he wanted the
software development at the Intel Architecture Labs, or IAL,
curbed. And at the same time he publicly announced that Microsoft
would share technologies and spend up to $100 million to train
engineers to develop and service products on a version of Windows
written for a competitor's microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gates didn't want IAL's 750 engineers interfering with his
plans for domination of the PC industry,'' the Intel memo stated.
``Gates made vague threats about support for other platforms, and
on the same day he announced a major program to support the Alpha
microprocessor made by Digital Equipment Corp., an Intel
competitor. Gates was livid about IAL's investments in the
Internet, and he wanted them stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject of Netscape also came up at the meeting and,
according to Intel documents, Gates said it was fine for Intel to
support Netscape to the degree it would support any company
developing software for the Wintel technology. But the Intel
documents also say that Gates clearly delivered the message that he
wanted the most and closest cooperation for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   How evidence about the meeting might be used in the case against
Microsoft is not clear. At this point, the government can add
evidence only if it mirror charges already in the suit filed in
May.
</P>
<P>
   In that complaint, the government alleges that during two
meetings in June 1995 between Microsoft and Netscape executives,
Microsoft tried to persuade Netscape to divvy up the browser market
instead of competing. Microsoft denies the allegation. In any case,
Netscape says it declined the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, government lawyers could argue that the Microsoft-Intel
meeting was an effort to limit competition _ Intel's freely
distributed software, in this instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the least, this potentially reinforces the government's
argument that Microsoft is a monopoly _ if it can even push Intel
around,'' observed Robert Litan, a former senior official in the
Justice Department's antitrust division who is now at the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the legal implications, industry analysts say that
Microsoft exercises considerable control over the pace of
innovations in computing. For another company's hardware or
software to work, it must conform to Microsoft's operating system.
</P>
<P>
   That power, industry analysts say, cuts both ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to set standards for everything in your computer
to work, and Microsoft has assumed that role,'' said Richard
Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a research firm in Seaford,
N.Y. ``But it is also true that when Microsoft can't yet see a way
to gain some proprietary advantage from some new technology, it is
in Microsoft's interest to stall its introduction _ and it does. In
all sorts of ways, Microsoft can create a weather storm in the
industry, so the ships will not leave port.''
</P>
<P>
   After the August 1995 meeting, Intel pretty much followed
Microsoft's lead on Internet and multimedia software. In later
meetings, Intel made it clear it would back off on the technology
initiatives that Microsoft found objectionable, according to Intel
documents.
</P>
<P>
   In a September 1995 meeting with Intel, Paul Maritz, a senior
Microsoft executive, told Intel, according to an Intel memo, that
it was ``imperative we are in lock-step on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Intel shifted course for pragmatic reasons _ its
relationship with Microsoft was too important to jeopardize. And
the outcome of the dispute over Intel's multimedia program, NSP,
sheds some light on the business logic involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel-Microsoft confrontation over NSP in 1995 was closely
followed in the industry. A year later, in lengthy dialogue between
Grove and Gates, published in Fortune magazine as ``A Conversation
with the Lords of Wintel,'' the two men discussed the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said, ``Intel deserves a lot of credit for stepping
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Grove replied, ``We didn't have much of a choice. We basically
caved.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates objected to that characterization, but Grove stuck to his
line. ``We caved,'' the Intel chairman said. ``Introducing a
Windows-based software initiative that Microsoft doesn't support .
. . well, life is too short for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Grove declined to comment for this article. And Intel itself
faces a government antitrust suit; the Federal Trade Commission
charges that the company has abused its dominance in
microprocessors by retaliating against corporate customers and
competitors, withholding information on Intel technology needed to
make other products.

 &HT;    A maestro of the new media
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ James Oliverio, in his own way, answered the question
before it could be asked. Is he a technology aficionado disguised
as a musician, or vice versa?
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was a pianist, one of my favorite pictures is of me
in diapers trying to sound a note on a string, and I was the church
organist at 10, playing a Hammond B3,'' he said. Enough said. Next
question...
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech's first composer-in-residence is a man who loves to
talk music and technology, and that's why he's so right for his
job. He has accumulated a wealth of musical experience and credits
in Hollywood with his standalone pieces, such as his Concerto No. 1
for Orchestra and Timpani.
</P>
<P>
   But he is also comfortably at home with his colleagues in the
Interactive Media Technology Center at Tech, where he employs
electronics to extend the musical palette. Other specialists in the
cheerfully collegial media lab include authorities in education and
sports technology, and experts who know of ways to heal with a
combination of computer and human techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Oliverio's works are voluminous and varied. They include film
scores, a high-tech opera called Star Child that premiered from the
Olympic Village prior to the opening of the Games in 1996, and
various other works large and small.
</P>
<P>
   His works have been played by the Cleveland Orchestra and the
Atlanta Symphony, as well as by the DeKalb (Ga.) Symphony and the
orchestras of Chattanooga, Tenn., Albany, Ga., Macon, Ga. and Fort
Wayne, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Oliverio, a Cleveland native, who lived in Los Angeles before
moving to Atlanta, has won four Emmys and other awards for his
music.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe no piece was more important to Atlantans than his musical
score for the film ``Time and Dreams'' about the city. The film,
produced by William VanDerKloot, was instrumental in helping to win
the Olympics for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A truly modern artist, Oliverio's sketch pad is the computer.
Though, like some writers, he often indulges his need to be
physically in touch with his work by putting pencil to paper, as
often as not he starts with an electronic grand piano. It's a real
piano, but it plays into the computer.
</P>
<P>
   He then is able to build and augment with computer-generated
tones.
</P>
<P>
   Through the power of the computer, artists will be able to feed
the insatiable appetites for something new, Oliverio said.
Combining the sounds with visual values will be one of the avenues
for new excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Artists like Oliverio and Tech technicians have already produced
ballet performances that included a dancer miles away from the
active stage, projected onto a screen and performing in real time
with the ``live'' performers. The remote dancer at times was
portrayed in changing colorful garb, sometimes flaming, sometimes
ghostly, all by computer manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   With the greater bandwidths possible with newer technology,
Oliverio said, a world class pianist here in Atlanta may perform
live with, say, the Albany symphony. It will be a way of extending
the living presence of world class performers, and also creating a
new kind of experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live is important,'' Oliverio said. ``Unlike a pre-taped
performance, the combination remote performer brought by digitized
communication, and the orchestra in the auditorium allows
interaction among orchestra, conductor and the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliverio believes musical challenges ahead will simply be new
ways to create music, but also ways to pull together music and
communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music listeners, especially our young people, look for
excitement,'' he said. ``Orchestras will have to turn from their
fears of the new and at least include newer things to build their
following.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has been able to see firsthand, at Georgia Tech, the
possibilities of enticing smart young people to embrace new sounds
and production values in music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students I teach are mostly from traditional engineering,
and some from computer sciences, looking for a new kind of musical
experience to carry through their lives,'' Oliverio said. They are,
in effect, a sampling of the audience of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Oliverio do his thing at Tech, you realize he is an
embodiment of the audience he strives to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Though he teaches courses at Tech in the history of electronic
music, history is not his driving interest. Pushing the borders of
musical expression is. And he is not locked into computer generated
tones. It is an odd but instructive sight to see him turn from his
machines, and strike a note from the tuned kettledrum nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the timbre of the notes I'm listening for,'' he
explains. Though he looks to a horizon, he stays in touch with his
musical base.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest pending project, he said, is his second Timpani
concerto, which will not be completed until the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it will be one of the most talked-about pieces of the
late 20th century,'' he said with a smile, ``or maybe the first in
the 21st century.''

KABILA ARRIVES BACK IN CONGO'S CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ As the rebel threat to his government shifted
away from the capital to eastern Congo, President Laurent Kabila
returned here Tuesday after an absence of 10 days and, amid reports
that his allies' jets were bombing the country's third-largest
city, urged ordinary Congolese to take up spears and arrows to
crush the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels said jets belonging to Kabila's two allies, Angola
and Zimbabwe, had bombed Kisangani, injuring civilians. Aides to
Kabila in this city said the planes attacked only rebel soldiers,
who have controlled Kisangani since Sunday. But Western diplomats
and international relief workers with colleagues in Kisangani said
there was no sign of bombing in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday began with Kabila's plane touching down at the Kinshasa
airport. Before Angola and Zimbabwe sent troops and arms to help
Kabila in the region southwest of here, a rebel takeover of the
capital had appeared imminent and Kabila had directed the war from
the southern city of Lubumbashi in his home region.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday morning, state television captured his arrival here.
It showed Kabila, wearing a black cowboy hat and a Hawaiian-style
shirt, as he walked from the plane and shook the hands of his
generals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victory belongs to the Congolese people,'' Kabila said before
television cameras. As he urged the citizenry to use traditional
arms to fight, he added, ``The people must be completely mobilized
and armed to crush the aggressors.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the rebel-controlled eastern Congo, Bizima Karaha,
a rebel leader and Kabila's former minister for foreign affairs,
said Angolan and Zimbabwean jets had bombed Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   ``No military objectives were hit, only civilian targets,''
Karaha said, The Associated Press reported. ``They cannot recapture
Kisangani, only bomb it from the air. This is terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Sakombi Inongo, a senior communications adviser to
Kabila, said no civilians had been hurt. ``There has been intense
bombing at Kisangani since this morning by planes from Angola and
Zimbabwe,'' Sakombi said. ``They are targeting the rebels' men and
arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-week civil war began after Kabila cut his ties with
the ethnic Tutsi Congolese and the Rwandan Tutsi, who plucked him
from obscurity less than two years ago and made him the Congolese
face of a successful coup against Mobutu Sese Seko, the longtime
dictator of Congo when it was called Zaire. Kabila's closeness to
the Tutsi had made him unpopular among other Congolese, who regard
the Tutsi as outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila's aides, as well as most Western officials here, say that
Rwanda and Uganda, its close ally, are supporting the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the troops, planes and tanks from Angola and Zimbabwe,
Kabila's forces have almost eliminated the rebel threat southwest
of Kinshasa, government and Western officials said. The only
critical point still held by the rebels in the southwest is the
huge Congo River hydroelectric dam at Inga, whose supply to
Kinshasa and elsewhere the rebels still controlled Tuesday night.

SPORTS COLUMN: UP CLOSE, GOLFERS ARE AMAZING  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What I did on my summer vacation: I watched the best male
golfers in the world, from a few feet away. I have been raving
about my experience ever since, so now I want to rave in print.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody reading these gushing sentiments may very well say,
``Where have you been, you twit?'' But that's exactly the point. In
16 years of writing a column, I had never seen a single stroke in
person. We have good people who write about golf, and it just never
came up.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why I never cover the sport, I would flippantly say, ``I
don't do golf,'' but I never bashed the sport, ever. I have played
five times in my life, always visiting somebody, and I loved the
physical and mental challenge, but just couldn't see having the
time, the money, the psychic energy, to do it justice.
</P>
<P>
   The week before last, while I was visiting family in Seattle,
the PGA Championship happened to be nearby, so I volunteered to
write a column on the final day. On a drizzly Sunday morning, a
press official graciously handed me the yellow armband that allows
a handful of journalists to walk the course _ ``inside the ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   Unbelievable. The trend these days is to move reporters farther
from the action, to sell the seats to wealthy fans, but I was given
the visceral equivalent of standing on the sideline of a football
game.
</P>
<P>
   I could have followed Tiger Woods or Mark O'Meara, or watched
everybody play through one specific hole, but I opted to start with
the final pair, Vijay Singh and Steve Stricker, who were four
strokes ahead. Following my colleague, Fred Klein of The Wall
Street Journal, I ducked under the rope, and hunkered down a few
dozen yards from the tee.
</P>
<P>
   There was Stricker, a relatively lean, standard-issue
white-American-male golfer, and Singh, a more fleshy, seemingly
boneless man of Indian ancestry, who was born in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   I am used to being around the Jordans and McGwires, athletes who
use blatant grace and power to control a moving ball. Now I watched
two rather ordinary-looking humans turn themselves into compact,
tightly wound instruments of delivery of a stationary ball.
</P>
<P>
   Thwock. So great was their aim that thousands of people up close
felt in no danger of being skulled as the balls rocketed down the
narrow fairways lined with fir trees.
</P>
<P>
   Click-clack. Occasionally, a ball wound end up facing thick
trunks and branches looming like a forest full of the Chicago
Bulls. If Stricker or Singh needed to get below a Pippen-like
branch, they hit a vicious line drive with no arc at all. If they
needed to get above a Rodmanesque tree, they hit a soaring shot
that invoked the word ``parabola.'' And usually the ball would
land, plop, near some distant green, or maybe a few feet from the
cup.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing I noticed was the interplay between golfers and
caddies. Once, I heard Singh's caddy say, ``It's too far,'' and
shake his head negatively when Singh putted short, and at the end,
Singh would praise the man for his wisdom. Stricker used hand
gestures that could be taken as imperious to ask his caddy to make
a sighting for him.
</P>
<P>
   In the trek along the course, the reporters and officials were
careful to leave space for Singh and Stricker, but sometimes you
would hear a dainty little clatter, and you would scamper to the
side to let the caddies move ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Stricker seemed more tense, but also more friendly, occasionally
waving his arms in response to applause. Once during a lull, I
heard him chatting with a course official, asking him what he did.
Singh was more distant, barely acknowledging his surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   The fans in designer clothes, who had paid hundreds of dollars
to be there, were racially mixed _ including dozens of Indians, and
one man in a bright purple turban. I'm just guessing Tiger Woods
had a larger percentage of African-Americans, but I never caught a
glimpse of him. This was where the action was, as Singh won the
major title by two strokes over Stricker.
</P>
<P>
   As I wrote my column that afternoon, my legs tingled from
walking four miles, often on steep hillsides. I have great respect
for Casey Martin, the talented professional with a debilitating leg
ailment who has received legal permission to use a golf cart.
However, the pleasant ache in my legs confirmed my outsider's
opinion that walking is as much a challenge for top golfers as
bunkers and roughs.
</P>
<P>
   After the distinct privilege of walking in their spongy
footsteps, I will follow these athletes with even greater respect.
I doubt it will take another 16 years before I catch another round.

FORMER SUPREME COURT JUSTICE POWELL DIES AT 90 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr.,
whose landmark 1978 decision upholding the legality of
affirmative-action programs in higher education ignited a national
debate that still rages 20 years later, died of pneumonia in his
sleep Tuesday morning. He was 90 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who served on the court from 1972-87, also concurred in
the landmark 5-4 decision upholding the constitutionality of a
Georgia law banning sexual relations between homosexuals. After
retiring from the court, Powell said he ``probably made a mistake''
in that 1986 case.
</P>
<P>
   The justice's conciliatory style helped him forge majorities on
the court and earned him the praise of his peers. When he retired,
his fellow justices wrote in a letter: ``All of us admire your
extraordinary capacity to forcefully participate in our private and
public debates without ever allowing advocacy to degenerate into
contentiousness.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Monday praised Powell's judicial reasoning.
``He approached each case without an ideological agenda, carefully
applying the Constitution, the law and Supreme Court precedent
regardless of his own personal views about the case. His opinions
were a model of balance and judiciousness,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who joined the high court
the same day as Powell in 1972, offered his own tribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the very embodiment of `judicial temperament:'
receptive to the ideas of his colleagues, fair to the parties to
the case, but ultimately relying on his own seasoned judgment,''
Rehnquist said. ``He was also the epitome of a `Virginia gentleman'
in the very best sense of the phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell's power of persuasion was perhaps never stronger than in
the Regents of the University of California vs. Bakke case. Writing
the 5-4 decision for a sharply divided court, Powell said that
state universities' ``substantial interest'' in having a diverse
student body permits them to devise admissions programs that
consider the race and ethnicity of an applicant.
</P>
<P>
   However, he also found that the University of California at
Davis illegally discriminated on the basis of race when it rejected
white medical-school applicant Allan Bakke because it had reserved
a number of seats for black candidates. Powell concluded the
university had failed to demonstrate that it was advancing a
substantial state interest by discriminating against Bakke.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, the Bakke decision still resonates in Texas.
The University of Texas, despite a federal appeals court decision
to the contrary, continues to maintain that its now-suspended
program to increase the number of minority students is
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Powell's controversial opinions was his concurrence
that the constitutional right to privacy does not include intimate
homosexual activity. ``I cannot say that conduct condemned for
hundreds of years has now become a fundamental right,'' Powell
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   One week after deciding that Georgia case, the high court let
stand without comment a federal appeals court ruling upholding the
constitutionality of Texas' 1887 law banning homosexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University law Professor Laurence Tribe, who argued
against Georgia's anti-sodomy law before the justices, remembered
fondly an exchange he had with Powell during the oral arguments.
Tribe said his strategy was to avoid the controversial issue of
intercourse during the argument, opting instead to challenge the
statute as a violation of the constitutional right to privacy in
one's home.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, although eventually rejecting Tribe's position, leaned
forward and said, ```If I were you I would be arguing the case
exactly the way you are,''' the professor recalled. ``His demeanor
was always one of unusual civility.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell was a highly successful private attorney in Richmond,
Va., and a former president of the American Bar Association when
President Nixon tapped him for the high court in 1971 to succeed
Hugo Black, who had retired. At first Powell expressed reluctance,
saying that at age 64 he was too old to begin a new career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go onto the court with deep personal misgivings about
whether I will like it,'' Powell said then.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate confirmed Powell's nomination by a vote of 89-1. He
joined the Supreme Court on Jan. 7, 1972, and retired on June 26,
1987, his initial reluctance a distant memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``My respect for it (the court) as a unique institution has been
enhanced by the privilege of serving here,'' Powell said in
announcing his retirement. ``I will miss being an active justice
more than I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell's departure set off a volatile Senate battle over his
successor. The Democrat-controlled Senate rejected President
Reagan's first choice to fill the vacancy, conservative Judge
Robert H. Bork, after contentious Senate Judiciary Committee
hearings. The Senate's 58-42 vote against Bork on Oct. 23, 1987,
remains the largest margin of defeat for a Supreme Court nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's second choice, Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, withdrew his
name after disclosures that he had smoked marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's third choice, Judge Anthony M. Kennedy, won Senate
confirmation and joined the court on Feb. 18, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Franklin Powell Jr. was born Sept. 19, 1907, in Suffolk,
Va. He earned his bachelor's and law degrees from Washington and
Lee University in Lexington, Va., and married Josephine Pierce
Rucker of Richmond in 1936. She died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from law school and serving as a military
intelligence officer in World War II, Powell built up a thriving
law practice in Richmond. His career highlights before joining the
high court included a stint as ABA president from 1964 to 1965 and
overseeing the peaceful desegregation of Richmond's schools while
serving as chairman of the school board from 1952 to 1961.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by four children, Josephine Smith of Houston;
Pendleton Bowen of Whidbey Island, Wash.; Molly Sumner of Salt Lake
City; and Lewis F. Powell III of Richmond, as well as nine
grandchildren and a great grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements have not been announced.

BOEING SAYS POLITICS PLAYED KEY ROLE BRITISH AIRWAYS AIRBUS
PURCHASE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Politics _ and not who offered British Airways the best deal for
new jets _ was the deciding factor in Europe's largest airline
buying planes from Airbus Industrie for the first time, some Boeing
officials are privately suggesting.
</P>
<P>
   But British Airways says it was just a matter of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not about dollars and cents. It was about politics,''
said one person at Boeing familiar with the company's offer that
was on the table for its next generation 737. The airline announced
Tuesday that it will buy 59 single-aisle planes from Airbus, with
options for 129 more.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said it plans to stick with Boeing for its
longhaul fleet, and underscored the point by buying 16 Boeing 777
widebody jets while placing options for 16 more.
</P>
<P>
   But several Boeing people close to the neogotiations with
British Airways over the past several months said the appearance of
British Prime Minister Tony Blair at Tuesday's news conference in
Toulouse, the headquarters of Airbus, served to underscore how much
politics played a role in the decision by one of Boeing's most
loyal customers to become the last major European carrier to end
its exclusive ties with Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``How often does the British prime minister show up at something
like this? Never,'' one of those Boeing people said.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus consortium is made up of aerospace companies from
Britain, France, Spain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   BA chief executive Bob Ayling told reporters Tuesday that
politics did not enter the decision to go with Airbus for the
smaller planes. Airbus simply beat Boeing's price, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were significantly cheaper,'' Ayling said after flying in
an Airbus A320 to Toulouse for the announcement. ``The
Airbus-Rolls-Royce offer was a better value offer than the
competitive offer. If it had not been, we would not be here,'' he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought choosing a European supplier would help BA
get European Union approval for its controversial alliance with
American Airlines, Ayling indicated the decision was purely
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will make any difference,'' he said.
``British Airways bought these aircraft because they offered us the
best value.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair said the British government was fully behind the Airbus
consortium and he predicted Airbus would soon match Boeing with 50
percent of the world's commercial aviation market. Boeing now has
slightly more than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus officials would not say what kind of discount they gave
British Airways for the 188-plane order. Typically, Boeing and
Airbus give their best customers discounts of as much as 20 percent
below list price. This price war between the world's two remaining
manufacturers of passenger jets with more than 100 seats has
contributed to Boeing's poor financial performance in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say Boeing was smart by not trying to beat the
offer from Airbus if it meant taking a loss on its planes just to
keep market share.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways did say that its net costs for the 75 firm
orders from Boeing and Airbus will be $1.4 billion pounds, compared
with a list price of about $3 billion pounds. But that net figure
includes proceeds that the airline expects to get from selling
older 737s, as well as its plans to replace some 747s now on order
from Boeing with the less expensive 777.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Baseball again simple pastime when you're 6
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I got a different view of a baseball game the other
day. The eyes were 6 years old. I borrowed them for a few innings.
They belonged to my grandson, just catching on to the tricks of
life, like finding that if he goes to the ballpark, he can order
pizza and a thing called a slushy, and peanuts, which he doesn't
care for a lot. Too much work.
</P>
<P>
   What you go to a game with a 6-year-old it's a trip back to
basics. It turns into a review of all the things you've taken for
granted. Like when a batter is out at first. He hits the ball, a
fielder throws him out. James the Third wanted an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, when the batter hits the ball, the fielder must throw
it to first before the batter gets there, and the batter is out,''
his father explained.
</P>
<P>
   I guess I'd just never thought of it that way. It does make
sense.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were playing the Dodgers, and naturally the Dodgers
wore gray road uniforms. Little James wanted to know why. His
father came through again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players in the gray uniforms,'' he said, ``they are the
bad guys, the Dodgers. The team in white are the good guys. They're
the Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, no Dodger pitcher hit Andres Galarraga and started a
brawl, for I don't know how he'd have explained that. The
6-year-old had met ``Mr. Galarraga'' before the game and considered
him a close personal friend.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time I'd sat in one of the pews at Turner
Field, so most of it was as new to me as it was to him. We did all
the things tourists do. I'd never been closer to the big Coke
bottle than the press box. I didn't realize it's made of bases,
gloves, bats, balls, chest protectors and all kinds of equipment.
Little James took one look at the little patch of infield and
stepped into the batter's box. He took a big imaginary swing and
tore out for first base. Obviously he was safe, and thereupon
celebrated his triumph with a loud, ``Yay!''
</P>
<P>
   He inherited something from old grandad. He has a distinct
respect for heights. He showed no interest in looking over the side
at the field below. He sat in the fake dugout and crossed his legs
like Casey Stengel used to do. Once his tour was done, he took the
misty walk back, cooling his fevered brow, and there was triumph in
his stride.
</P>
<P>
   The museum was next, presided over by Carolyn Serra. He didn't
tarry long at the silver shovel old grandad had helped break ground
with at the old stadium, or at the Cracker uniform out of his
gallery at home. But there was joy at the sight of the Pullman car,
the way the Braves had traveled in olden days. He romped up and
down and in and out and played conductor, then it was time for
pizza, slushy and the game. Oh, and of course, the essential
tomahawk, which can be endangering to anybody near a free swinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is a strike, Granddaddy?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   That caught me tongue-tied. I'd been trying to decide what one
was since each umpire decided on his own. I stammered, then said,
``It's when a batter swings at a ball and misses, and sometimes
when he doesn't swing.''
</P>
<P>
   That quieted the curiosity for a few minutes, until he finished
his pizza. Then a Dodger fouled off a pitch, and of course, the
umpire signaled strike. He looked at me with a question in his
eyes, but finished his slushy and let me off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   We were leaving, still taking in all the glitter, remembering
back to Ponce de Leon Park, where his father was almost born.
``They've taken a plain old game,'' his father said, ``and turned
it into an experience.''

 &HT;    Graffanino defends batting positioning as slump continues
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Tony Graffanino's scouting report on Tony Graffanino:
</P>
<P>
   ''The stance is fine. The mechanics are fine. I don't know. Just
not hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the beauties of this stretch of the schedule is that
Graffanino has been granted several chances to get back on the
horse that just threw him. Houston's Mike Hampton was the third
straight left-hander the Braves had faced Tuesday night, giving
Graffanino a third consecutive start to straighten out a month gone
haywire.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some days, he looks like Bill Mazeroski out there,'' said
manager Bobby Cox. ''Other days . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Graffanino went into Tuesday's game hitting .133 (6-for-45) this
month with a strikeout every 2.6 at-bats. After batting .356 in
July and feeling his season had turned around, he is having the
worst month of his career. His Monday performance 0-for-5, four
strikeouts, an error he said was his worst game as a professional
player.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea what to do,'' he said. ''I've tried a bunch of
different things. It's just one of those things you go through. I
just got to keep going out there and playing. Something will
happen, I hope. That's the way it's always worked out in the past.
Something just happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The .220 average he took into Tuesday's game was a five-week
low.
</P>
<P>
   Now in right
</P>
<P>
   Danny Bautista reported to the clubhouse Tuesday worse for wear
after his collision at the plate Monday and was scratched before
the Braves took batting practice. Gerald Williams was moved to left
field to take Bautista's place and Michael Tucker was granted a
rare start against a left-handed pitcher in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Bautista took a full running leap into Los Angeles catcher Tom
Price in a botched safety squeeze Monday and was left with a sore
right knee. Tucker, who was hitting .273 (9-for-33) against
lefties, has actually fared worse against righties (.252,
81-for-321). More precisely, he had been hitting less than walking
lately, with 10 walks in his previous seven games. In his last 20
plate appearances, he reached base 11 times with only four hits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just taking a lot of pitches that I'd usually swing at,''
Tucker said. ''There are only certain times in the game, like when
you lead off an inning, where you can do that. But you get up there
with guys in scoring position, you can't do that when runs are out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   No word
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had still not heard from the National League offices
Tuesday about suspensions and/or fines stemming from last
Saturday's brawl with the Los Angeles Dodgers. First baseman Andres
Galarraga is a candidate for a minimum three-game suspension but
don't expect anything to happen once the NL president Len Coleman
acts. Galarraga will appeal any penalty, which would put him in
line for a hearing when the Braves visit New York in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   Dizzy Ryno
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko is trying to shake the effects of an inner ear
infection that has effected his equilibrium. He took batting
practice Tuesday and remains hopeful of playing tonight against
Houston right-hander Sean Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really hard to keep my balance (Monday),'' he said. ''I
was really dizzy. I'm feeling better. I'll try to get in there
(Wednesday) but we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Condolences
</P>
<P>
   First base coach Pat Corrales left the team Tuesday to attend
the funeral of his brother, who died of congestive heart failure in
Fresno, Calif., over the weekend. Hitting coach Clarence Jones
manned Corrales' spot in the coach's box. Corrales is expected back
tonight.

 &HT;    Braves on deck: Houston Astros
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ When: Today 8:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV: Fox Sports South.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: RHP John Smoltz (12-2, 3.44;
13-12, 3.12 lifetime vs. Astros) vs. RHP Sean Bergman (11-6, 3.44;
1-2, 7.11 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: After opening the season with a career 18-27 record and
a 5.22 ERA, Bergman has had a breakthrough in his fourth full
major-league season, flourishing under manager Larry Dierker.
Stranded in San Diego's bullpen last year, the Astros traded James
Mouton for him during the winter, and after earning a spot in the
rotation in the spring, he has been the team biggest surprise,
posting the lowest ERA by a starter, at least until Randy Johnson
showed up. A sinkerball pitcher, Bergman throws an excellent
slider, and the two pitches are enough to make an average fastball
seem better. The difference this year is probably under his hat,
where he has finally developed some confidence in what scouts have
long believed to be top-notch stuff. He abused the Braves in a May
17 start, in which he allowed three hits and one run while striking
out six and walking none in an 8-1 victory. Andres Galarraga will
be his acid test. The Braves first baseman has a .615 career
average (8-for-13) against Bergman with one homer. This is an
important test for Smoltz, who questioned last week whether he
should skip a start to let his body recover for a string of
12-straight starts since coming off the DL. Smoltz has won seven in
a row since the All-Star break, but he hardly has been untouchable
in his last three outings, giving up 11 runs and 21 hits in his
last 19 2/3 innings.

DON'T EVEN THINK OF TOUCHING DODGER STADIUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The fine people at Fox make entertaining movies,
put together a network in little more than a decade, and bought
enough regional cable sports outlets to leave sweat stains on the
suits at Disney-owned ESPN. They are the quintessential aggressive
entrepreneurs for the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But as owners of our favorite major league baseball team, they
remind me of Abu Nidal.
</P>
<P>
   Dodger fans have never been terrorized like this. In six short
months, Fox has traded the franchise's most popular player,
dispatched a key ambassador from the Pacific Rim, and gutted the
front office and roster. The series of the trades designed to make
something of the lost 1998 season may have a negative impact for
the next five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how we long for the simple days, when diversity and the
temperature of the clubhouse were the Dodgers' biggest concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes word that the initial cost projections of renovating
Dodger Stadium, bringing it up to revenue-producing snuff with
newer stadiums, was higher than anticipated, leading Fox to
acknowledge that it might make more sense to build a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Seismically speaking, this is The Big One. Fans and critics are
more likely to draw a line in the red clay of the infield over this
issue than any other.
</P>
<P>
   There is absolutely nothing wrong with the 37-year-old Dodger
Stadium, still pristine at middle age as it was the day it opened.
Better even, at least for those who remember the facility lacked
drinking fountains back in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   There is not a single bad seat among the 56,000. The park is
warm. The view to the foothills beyond center field remains the
best in baseball. Engineering-wise, the stadium that was built into
the side of a foothill is still a marvel. It sits atop Los Angeles
like a jewel.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about Dodger Stadium reminds one of our own Coliseum,
which needed renovation in 1978 as much as it does today, or Yankee
Stadium, which is literally crumbling due to age, or Fenway, which
is no longer functional. In Boston, the affection for Fenway is
balanced against the reality that its time has come.
</P>
<P>
   There is also no primary reason for change here from a fan's
point of view. New parks erupted in Baltimore, Cleveland, Texas and
Anaheim because the old parks were out of date. Fans and ownership
in all of those cities were in agreement that a new park made
sense.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, nothing Fox has done as owner has made sense, so
the concept of them paving paradise is just another reason for fans
to be wary.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Graziano, the Dodgers' likable new president, has earned a
degree in crisis management this season, but nothing will test him
like the public relations problem he'll face if he and the Foxies
order heavy machinery.
</P>
<P>
   It is so premature for anyone to speculate on this, Graziano
said Tuesday. Our focus is not on a new stadium. Dodger Stadium is
a great stadium. We just want to make it more competitive with
other, newer stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   The objective of any renovation would be to enhance the stadium
and make it competitive with Baltimore, Cleveland, Texas and
Colorado. When you're dealing with an existing facility, you have
to work within its confines, which is a different challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The initial dollar estimates for renovation were higher than we
expected. We needed to step back and make sure whether (projected)
revenue would support a renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano has been with the club since 1986. There was always
idle talk of converting the club level into luxury suites, but
there was never any real financial or architectural study
conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're looking at it thoroughly, he said. We brainstormed on
everything we could possible add to the stadium. We looked at new
stadiums and what they offered, and how we could design them into
the park -- not because we would make all these changes, but
because we wanted to know if we could.
</P>
<P>
   We haven't made any decisions to go forward. We're just looking
at everything. It's part of the process, and it's not going to
impact anyone this year or in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Fans could care less about how the Dodgers compete with the
Orioles in luxury suites or the D-Backs in retail outlets.
Attending games at an annual pace of three million a season, Dodger
fans aren't likely to take the bait that the team is losing a lot
of money, either.
</P>
<P>
   Fans are more likely to wonder if this is a dodge to get around
the team's tradition of low ticket prices. Every new stadium built
in the '90s, be it for a baseball, football, basketball or hockey
team, has been accompanied by higher ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying this is the Dodger plan. But based on their
recent history, let's say it's a concern. Maybe now is the time to
get Dodger Stadium classified as California historical landmark. If
the Dodgers can say adieu to Mike Piazza and friends so easily,
they're not likely to get misty over the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As Mulder might say, Trust No One.

MCENROE (PATRICK) DECLINES WILD CARD, THEN FAILS IN QUALIFYING
TOURNAMENT  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a hot wind swirling through the premises,
Tuesday was a difficult day to play for a living at the National
Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens. And the odd thing was,
Patrick McEnroe did not have to be out there on Court 7
unsuccessfully battling the conditions and Michael Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe could have been home in Manhattan preparing for next
week's U.S. Open. Despite his woeful ranking of 656 and despite
playing precious little tennis in the last two years because of two
shoulder operations, he was awarded a wild card into the main draw
by the U.S. Tennis Association.
</P>
<P>
   But McEnroe, like his more combustible and recognizable older
brother John, has a mind and plan of his own. On Sunday night, he
telephoned the tournament director, Jay Snyder, and said thank you
but no thank you. He preferred to try his luck in the qualifying
tournament and leave the wild cards to those who deserved them
more.
</P>
<P>
   Declining a wild card is not unprecedented. Zina Garrison did so
last year because she no longer felt she was competitive in
singles. Richey Reneberg did so this year because he did not feel
he had recovered sufficiently from a knee injury. But declining a
wild card to dive into the shark tank that is the qualifying
tournament had no precedent as far as Snyder could remember.
</P>
<P>
   And McEnroe will not see his name on the draw of the 1998 Open
after blowing a 4-1 first-set lead and losing, 6-4, 6-2, to Joyce.
Some fans at courtside immediately dubbed McEnroe's decision to
qualify a ``$9,000 mistake.'' First-round losers in the main draw
earn $12,000, while first-round losers in qualifying earn $3,000.
But as McEnroe sat and conversed somewhat glumly on a bench outside
the players' lounge, he made it clear that material concerns were
not primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to play some matches,'' he said. ``I know
myself, and I know that going into the Open without having any wins
was no way to feel good about myself. I was obviously glad and
appreciative they gave me the wild card. I feel like I was actually
hitting the ball well enough where I could win some matches, but I
had to prove to myself that I could. I wanted to feel like I
deserved that wild card, and so far I haven't done that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that hard a decision. If I had taken the wild card,
I might have gotten lucky and snuck through and won a round or
something with a good draw, but I felt like if I could have
qualified and had a few matches under my belt, I would have been a
dangerous player to play. But it didn't happen, and now I just move
on and figure out what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe, who turned 32 in July, still hopes to play doubles in
the Open with Brian Macphie (he will not turn that wild card down
if it is offered). But his singles career could soon be over. He
already has retired and reconsidered once, rejoining the circuit
this spring after retiring late last year. The reason for his
about-face was that he finally felt healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But tennis, as McEnroe or any club player can tell you, is much
more than a physical endeavor. ``Maybe I'm analyzing myself too
much,'' said the man who has made a second career of analyzing
tennis on television. ``I've got plenty of other things in my life,
but I still enjoy playing and competing. The thing that bothers me
about this match was that I didn't enjoy the competing part. For
some reason, my attitude was negative. I don't want to say that was
my last singles match, but I need to think over some things.''
</P>
<P>
   While McEnroe ponders, his fellow American Michael Russell will
prepare to play. Russell, ranked No. 302, is the player who was
given the wild card that McEnroe declined.

BACK IN PUBLIC, GORE GIVES NO HINT OF ANYTHING WRONG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Hawaii, Calif.)   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ Looking tan and relaxed after a two-week Hawaiian
vacation, Vice President Al Gore returned to full public view
Tuesday, giving little hint that anything of major consequence had
happened while he was away.
</P>
<P>
   In a daylong schedule here that included a rousing speech to a
convention of 5,000 civil servants, a stop at an elementary school
and a rally for the Hawaii Democratic Party, a noticeably energized
Gore emphasized the positive and the future, focusing on issues
like education, health care and the need for union members and
other Democrats to support the party in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's remarks were unusually fiery for someone who has openly
joked about his reputation as a stiff and sometimes awkward
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Through much of his address to the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees advocating the Clinton
administration's strong support for labor, he belted out many of
his points, lacing his remarks with jokes and gestures that ignited
the crowd on the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded with a challenge for the 1998 elections: ``Are you
willing to more than match the intensity that the right-wing
extremists will bring to the battles that lie ahead?''
</P>
<P>
   The response was a loud and long standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's remarks were equally notable for what he did not say,
leaving little doubt that the omissions were part of a calculated
effort to distance him from matters that roiled Washington last
week. He made no mention of President Clinton's acknowledgement of
a relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky nor
did he address new questions that have come up about his own
fund-raising activities in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In what a spokeswoman for the vice president indicated would be
the rule for at least the next few days as Gore and his wife,
Tipper, make their way back to Washington, he took no questions.
The Gores are scheduled to leave Hawaii on Wednesday for San
Francisco, where he plans to attend several more events before
leaving for Washington on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, whose allegiance to Clinton over the last six years
serves as a springboard for his own presidential aspirations, the
months ahead are full of political peril for him and the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the president, Gore has enjoyed a virtually spotless
public persona throughout his long political career.
</P>
<P>
   But an important question facing him is whether voters will
continue to be able to separate the two men, or whether Clinton's
problems have so sullied his administration they will damage Gore
as well. And while voters may see Gore as more trustworthy, if less
magnetic, than Clinton, the vice president may have his own
troubles down the road as Attorney General Janet Reno reconsiders
whether to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate fund-raising
telephone calls he made from his office.
</P>
<P>
   If she does so, the campaign finance investigation, which has
failed to capture much public interest so far, may become an
enormous liability for him.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence of Clinton's difficulties, Gore must maintain a
delicate balance between his loyalty to a close friend who has been
damaged but who has done more than any other president to lay the
financial groundwork for his running mate's ascension, and a
detachment that enables him to preserve his own integrity, his
sense of loyalty and, of course, his political viability.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to walk a fine line, the nature of which is pretty
clear,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, a political analyst in Washington.
``Bill Clinton has been Al Gore's No. 1 benefactor. He is also the
No. 1 reason Al Gore is the heavy favorite to become the party
nominee for president. So he needs to remain loyal to the president
but at the same time maintain a separate identity to avoid the
appearance he is Bill Clinton's toady.''
</P>
<P>
   The practical question for Gore is how to clutch all the
benefits of serving as Clinton's friend and adviser while avoiding
the obvious baggage of the president's relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   With elections 10 weeks away and the administration eagerly
seeking support for its proposals on education, health care, the
budget surplus and other issues, Gore might be most helpful for the
party and himself, aides said, by campaigning around the country
for Democratic candidates and stressing the urgent need for
Democrats to vote in November.
</P>
<P>
   Even the schedule of his first two days after vacation suggests
that he is keen to get started. Here in Hawaii, where the economy
has sagged for seven years and Democrats have controlled state
government for nearly 40 years, Gov. Benjamin Cayetano is trailing
in polls to a Republican challenger. Both Cayetano and Rep. Patsy
Mink accompanied Gore on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, Gore is scheduled to attend a reception
Wednesday night for Michela Alioto, a former Gore aide who is the
Democratic candidate for California secretary of state. Thursday he
will appear at a luncheon in Palo Alto for Gray Davis, the
California lieutenant governor who is running for governor.
</P>
<P>
   While many Democratic officials say that Gore might be an ideal
emollient to soothe any public disdain for a wounded president,
Republicans may be just as happy to have Gore out stumping _ but
for entirely different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Al Gore is coming to my state, I would have no problem or
hesitation raising the facts of the cloud of controversy about 1996
and his role in illegal or unethical behavior,'' said Republican
pollster Frank Luntz. ``If he comes to town, he becomes an issue
and a lightning rod to remind Republicans that they ought to take
the time to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   To many voters of both parties, the unresolved fund-raising
issues could prove far more problematic for Gore in 2000 than any
of Clinton's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Gore's role were once put to rest, last
December, when Reno said she had found no evidence that Gore had
raised money for direct aid to the campaign. His solicitations, she
concluded, were for general party purposes, known as soft money.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue rose again last week when it was disclosed that
the Justice Department had obtained a 1995 White House memorandum
with handwritten notations that appeared to contradict Gore's
account of his fund-raising telephone calls, according to
government officials. The notations indicate that Gore and several
campaign officials discussed how some of the large contributions
raised by the vice president for use only for general campaign
purposes would be diverted to accounts to directly finance the
Clinton-Gore campaign, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has until the end of the month to decide if she should
initiate a 90-day inquiry, after which she would make a decision on
whether a special prosecutor is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore have said that he was recently interviewed by
Justice Department investigators and that he would ultimately be
exonerated from any wrongdoing. But he has not commented publicly
on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has he said much about the president's problems. Shortly
after Clinton acknowledged relations with Ms. Lewinsky on Aug. 17,
Gore said in a statement that he was ``proud'' of Clinton as a
``person who has had the courage to acknowledge mistakes.''

STATES BRACING FOR NORTHWEST PILOTS' STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are stockpiling baby diapers, trying to line up extra buses
and appealing to other airlines for help, but authorities in
Minneapolis, Detroit and seven upper-Midwestern states from
Illinois to North Dakota admit that there is not much they can do
if pilots at Northwest Airlines strike on Saturday, shutting down
the region's largest airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact on us would be devastating,'' said Kevin Kramer,
the director of economic development for North Dakota, where
Northwest provides virtually all the state's jet service. ``We have
all our eggs in one basket.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is not much better in Detroit and Minneapolis,
which are home to the nation's 9th- and 13th-busiest airports. An
estimated 8 out of 10 flights in and out of both cities are
Northwest's.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to President Clinton earlier this month, the
governors of Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin and four other states
estimated that their economies would lose hundreds of millions of
dollars in the first week alone if Northwest, the country's
fourth-largest airline, stopped flying.
</P>
<P>
   No one can say for sure whether a strike will be averted before
the deadline _ one minute past midnight on Saturday morning. The
latest round of negotiations between Northwest and the pilots began
at an undisclosed location on Aug. 17 under the auspices of a
federal mediator, who has ordered both sides not to talk to
reporters. The negotiations are to continue right up to the strike
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides say publicly that they are eager to reach a
settlement, and Donald J. Foley, Northwest's chief spokesman, said
some progress had been made during the recent negotiations. But the
key issue of pay remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   As Saturday draws closer, the belief among politicians and
business executives that there will be a strike appears to be
increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest began notifying passengers Tuesday that it would
cancel about 100 domestic flights Friday to insure that its planes
are not stranded in far-off airports if the pilots walk out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made the appropriate preparations to pull down the
airline as of midnight on Friday night if we are unable to reach an
agreement at the negotiating table,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the pilots struck American Airlines, a unit of
AMR Corp., President Clinton intervened within minutes, ordering
the pilots back to work and the negotiators back to the table.
</P>
<P>
   But some believe that the president, in his politically weakened
state following his admission of an inappropriate relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, will be more reluctant to intervene now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told our clients early in the process that Clinton would
intervene,'' said Brent Garback, the chief executive of Total
Travel Management, the largest corporate travel agency in Michigan.
``But given his problems, we now think he won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may also be reluctant to interfere because the Air Line
Pilots Association, which represents pilots at Northwest and 49
other carriers, is a major contributor to the Democratic Party.
Earlier this month, 24 Democratic congressmen, including the
minority leader, Richard Gephardt of Missouri, and the Democratic
whip, David Bonior of Michigan, wrote the president, urging him not
to intercede.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official who insisted on anonymity said that, as
he had in the American strike, the president would not intervene
until after the strike deadline to maintain the pressure on both
sides to settle.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reich, who was labor secretary during the American
strike, said the president was not likely to act this time unless
it was clear that both sides were looking for a face-saving way
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the president doesn't want to be viewed as
powerless,'' said Reich, now a professor at Brandeis University.
``He especially doesn't want to look that way now.''
</P>
<P>
   The average Northwest pilot is paid $120,000 a year, according
to the union. Northwest says it is offering its 6,200 pilots a 10
percent pay increase over five years, placing them on a par with
their counterparts at United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta
Air Lines, the three larger domestic carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots counter that Northwest is not offering the hefty
stock options and profit sharing that the other airlines give their
pilots. They are asking for a 15 percent wage increase over five
years, greater job security and more generous vacation time.
</P>
<P>
   But the real issue is what the pilots and other Northwest
workers feel they are owed for the sacrifices they made in 1993, to
save the airline when it was near bankruptcy. Northwest's 45,000
unionized employees accepted wage cuts and work-rule concessions
worth $886 million.
</P>
<P>
   The largest share, worth $365 million, came from the pilots, who
agreed to cut their wages and other benefits 15.5 percent for 39
months in exchange for three seats on Northwest's board of
directors and more than 14 million shares of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the airline industry and Northwest have rebounded,
registering four years of record profits. The unions say they want
their share.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the pilots, Northwest also faces tough
negotiations with five other unions. Last month, the International
Association of Machinists, which represents 27,000 Northwest
workers, rejected a tentative contract that would have given them a
14 percent pay increase.
</P>
<P>
   Workers have been particularly embittered by $73 million worth
of stock sold by Northwest insiders earlier this year when the
share price was near its 52-week high of $65.3125. The group was
led by John H. Dasburg, Northwest's chief executive, who sold
322,000 shares worth $19 million, according to CDA/Investnet of
Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   With a strike looming, Northwest stock has since slid more than
50 percent, reaching a 52-week low of $28.50 a share on Friday. It
closed Tuesday at $29.50, up 56.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Buttrick, an airline industry analyst at Paine Webber,
estimates that Northwest will have lost up to $100 million in the
month before the strike deadline because of lost bookings. But he
added that Northwest had $3 billion in cash, more than enough to
weather the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most analysts say they believe that a strike could last
only a short time before the pain would be too great for either the
pilots or the airline to bear. While public opinion now appears to
favor the pilots, it could turn quickly if they stop flying.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Minneapolis and Detroit said their appeals to other
airlines to send in extra planes during a strike had failed
because, with the booming economy, most airlines are flying at full
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Omodt, a spokesman for the pilots' union, called
concerns about the impact of a strike exaggerated. ``It is kind of
ridiculous to think there are no alternatives,'' he said. ``If
there is a strike, there will be an initial shock to the system.
But then some airlines will pick up the routes. It is found money
for them.''

MUSEUM SHOW FEATURES INDIAN ARTIFACTS AND HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., August 30)  
(rl) 
 By PAULA DEITZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAR HARBOR, Maine _ In 1922, Dr. Robert Abbe, a New York surgeon
who summered in this coastal town, was struck by inspiration. He
had just bought a small collection of ancient stone implements that
had been found in the region, filling him with wonder about the
hands that had held them in prehistoric times. And rather than
leave the artifacts on a shelf in his house, he wanted to create a
place where others could see them. So he set about enlisting the
support of other local collectors, and on Aug. 14, 1928, the Robert
Abbe Museum of Stone Age Antiquities opened in a quiet glen near
here at the edge of Acadia National Park _ an event Abbe himself
did not live to see; he had died a few months before.
</P>
<P>
   Although originally devoted to prehistoric cultures, the museum
has broadened its scope over the years to include artifacts and
evocative dioramas tracing the history of Maine's Indian tribes _
the Maliseet, Micmac, Passamaquoddy and Penobscot _ up to the
present. Today, the museum houses 50,000 objects, ranging from a
10,000-year-old Paleoindian spearhead to contemporary bead and
basket work.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, 100 people gathered at the museum, a one-story
Spanish Colonial Revival building, to celebrate its 70th
anniversary and to view the exhibition ``Beads, Bones and Ancient
Stones: 70 Years of Collecting, 10,000 Years of History.'' If
nothing else, the show demonstrates how vital Indian culture has
been to Maine's social fabric.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which remains on view through Oct. 18, when the museum
closes for the year, was put together by the museum's curator,
Rebecca Cole-Will, and its exhibition designer, Betts Swanton, with
some selections made by others, including William C. Sturtevant
III, curator for Native American Ethnology at the Smithsonian
Institution, and members of Maine's tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the objects on view were acquired from archaeological
excavations, some sponsored by the museum's field school. Some of
the artifacts left by Indians who lived in the coastal areas were
found in shell heaps scattered along the many inlets and stony
beaches. Other objects were donated, many by local residents. A
19th-century coiled basket, for example, belonged to the famous
landscape gardener Beatrix Farrand, who designed Abbe's garden at
his summer house.
</P>
<P>
   Baskets, spanning 200 years, in fact, figure prominently in the
show. Made of birch bark, quill, ash or sweetgrass gathered from
the marshes, baskets were either utilitarian _ for storage or
harvesting _ or of the fancy variety, like one woven in 1861 for a
wedding present by Molly Molasses, an elder of the Penobscot tribe.
It is one of the earliest examples of the porcupine curly weave in
which ash strips are twisted into points, giving the basket its
prickly appearance. Molasses was so well known in her time that
Henry David Thoreau commented in ``The Maine Woods,'' after passing
her on the street in Bangor in July 1857, ``As long as she lives,
the Penobscots may be considered extant as a tribe.''
</P>
<P>
   Thoreau wasn't entirely correct. Watie Akins, a Penobscot who is
a structural engineer and who is on the museum's advisory board,
donated 70 baskets woven between 1930 and 1980, many by his
grandmother Philomene Nelson. Her sweetgrass sewing basket and
knitting basket, aged to a coppery patina, are as beautiful as they
are sturdy. Curly baskets made during the last decade by the
Passamaquoddy family named Neptune are of a whimsical bent, in the
shapes of strawberries, blueberries, pumpkins and corn. The day
after the anniversary celebration, the Neptune family took part in
the Maine Indian Basketmakers Alliance summer sale here, where 25
basket makers representing all four tribes demonstrated their art.
</P>
<P>
   Over thousands of years, Indian costumes were adorned with beads
made from shells, clay, bone, stone and native copper; the beads
used as currency, called wampum, were cut from clam shells. After
the Indians came into contact with Europeans in the 16th century,
glass beads became popular as a trading commodity and were more
easily worked into complex patterns on clothing and accessories
than traditional porcupine quills. A Penobscot beaded belt from
1807 in the show belonged to the mother-in-law of Thoreau's Indian
guide, and a beaded bag in a decidedly Victorian style with leaf
and curved-line designs was owned by the wife of Dr. Sockbesin, an
important Penobscot healer.
</P>
<P>
   Indian craftsmen left nothing to waste. The bone of a swan was
used to create a graceful flute, which could be 3,000 years old.
For fishing, there were netting needles from deer ribs and bone
harpoons that were attached to spears.
</P>
<P>
   Stone implements were fashioned either by flaking or grinding,
and a grooved gouge on view is shaped perfectly to fit any hand.
Even stone plummets used as weights on fishing lines possess a
streamlined elegance. Among these exhibits is a 5,000-year-old
stone abrader from Abbe's original collection.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is planning year-round quarters across from the
village green. The new complex, a modern structure that
incorporates one of the town's old shingled buildings, will offer
additional galleries as well as more space for storage and
educational programs. It will serve as a complement to the old
museum, and the two together will further Abbe's vision. Speaking
at the anniversary ceremony, Wayne Newell, a Passamaquoddy who is a
museum trustee, said the museum ``preserves not only the objects
but the breadth and spirit of our ancestors.'' &QR;

COMMENTARY: HIDING BEHIND SKIRTS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During a Democratic debate in Denver in 1992, Bill
Clinton was asked if he would want half his Cabinet to be women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might want more than that,'' he said eagerly. Coming in the
wake of the Gennifer Flowers fiasco, his unwitting double-entendre
drew laughter from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you laughing about?'' he asked defensively. ``Women
have held most of the important positions in my administration.''
</P>
<P>
   That drew more howls.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has always been good with women. And bad with
women.
</P>
<P>
   He kept his promise to appoint women to top jobs. And now it has
become the unsavory task of these high-level women to defend the
president's misalliances with low-level women.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is like a little boy, hiding behind the skirts of
his powerful women, hoping they can shield him from the effects of
his fatal attraction to big hair and big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In psychology, they have a term for a narcissist who never
emotionally matures, who throws tantrums and expects everyone else
to clean up his messes: the Highchair King.
</P>
<P>
   Our Highchair King is banging his spoon and screaming ``Enable
me or the Dow goes down to 500!''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's most authentic moment was his Monica speech. He
was unbound, unvarnished and true to himself. He resented
apologizing for his bad behavior. He did it sullenly, only because
all escape hatches were closed. He was still trying to blame others
and still expecting others to prop him up _ especially the strong
women in his life.
</P>
<P>
   It was a real upstairs-downstairs moment on Sunday as the
secretary of state tried to give the Highchair King some cover over
his affair with the Girl Who Delivered Mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an American citizen and as a friend of the president's, I
accept what he said on Monday,'' Madeleine Albright told Cokie
Roberts, adding, ``But you know what's interesting, Cokie, is I
have no problems whatsoever assuring other leaders about the
credibility of the United States and the president.''
</P>
<P>
   That may apply to our allies, but what about our enemies?
They're not exactly wowed by Clinton's credibility. Witness Saddam
and Milosevic both choosing this moment to spurn American dictates.
</P>
<P>
   When Cokie Roberts pressed about whether the dallying with
Monica was wrong, the steamed secretary of state shut down the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Just more Clinton wreckage. A role model for women forced to
defend scrofulous behavior toward women. A woman who knew the pain
of having a husband leave her for a younger woman forced to defend
a man having a fling with a younger woman. A man married to her
good friend Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's silence spoke loudly about how corrupting this
scandal is.
</P>
<P>
   She became the first female secretary of state with a boost from
women's groups. After a White House official anonymously told a
reporter that Albright was in ``the second tier'' of candidates for
the job, women's groups raised a fuss. Clinton took note.
</P>
<P>
   As a serious woman trying to pave the way for women in a whole
new field, didn't Albright have an obligation on Sunday to speak
one extra sentence that made it clear that it was wrong of the
president to have sex with an intern in the Oval Office and lie
about it, and send out his wife and Cabinet and aides to lie about
it?
</P>
<P>
   There is a long-term cost to the Democrats and women appearing
to be condoning Clinton's behavior _ or making strained arguments
trying to differentiate him from Clarence Thomas or Bob Packwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the Democratic Party, and Democratic women, the party
of consensual sex with interns and lying about it,'' says George
Stephanopoulos. '`And that's going to kill us for the next 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The president has a good record on women's issues. But he
doesn't deserve a lifetime pass.
</P>
<P>
   He has turned Hillary Clinton into Tammy Wynette, popular with
Americans now that she has been stripped of her swagger and
humiliated by her husband. She has been reduced to promoting the
millennium _ which is going to happen anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He has been lousy about returning the favor and defending women
who ran into trouble. Remember Zoe and Kimba and Lani and Dee Dee
and Joycelyn? He let them all go without lifting a finger _ or even
banging a spoon.

   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge's offensive line got a boost
Tuesday when Mike Barnes, a reserve guard at Arizona State, was
cleared by the NCAA to transfer to CSUN and play for the Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, a 6-foot-2, 276-pound senior, hasn't played for ASU
since the Sun Bowl last Dec. 31 and quit in the offseason, a school
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   A product of Norco High in Riverside County, Barnes played
sparingly at ASU, starting two games in 1997, one in 1996 and four
in 1995, each time filling in for an injured starter. But CSUN head
coach Ron Ponciano figures Barnes will make an immediate impact at
the Division I-AA level. Barnes will join the Matadors in training
camp within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be a huge benefit to us,'' Ponciano said. ``He's either
going to start or give us incredible depth. You would think he
could start here at Northridge if he can start at Arizona State.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Barnes will add experience to a line that, right
now, would be composed entirely of freshmen on the right side _ Tim
Shoffeit at guard and Keith Kincade at tackle.

 &HT;    Laredo prepares for Rio Grande floodwaters
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi and Ben Wear
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ As floodwaters threatened to destroy hundreds of
the area's poorest homes Tuesday, Magadelan Garcia grabbed only
what she could carry and left her humble home with her two sons and
only the clothes they wore on their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, 41, took one last look at the Rio Grande, just feet from
her back door, and headed to a nearby shelter, where she prayed
that the home she could not afford to rebuild would survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that I have in the world is there,'' she said through a
translator. ``What little furniture and clothes I have are there.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was one of hundreds of residents in low-lying colonias
north and south of the river who packed up and went in search of
higher ground Tuesday, as debris-filled floodwaters from Del Rio
and Eagle Pass headed downstream to Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   The floodwaters, which were expected to peak this afternoon near
38 feet, more than 30 feet above initial flooding levels, also
closed three international bridges spanning the river, halting the
brisk traffic of tractor-trailers that cross daily. Several Laredo
neighborhoods lying near the river and in two creeks feeding the
river were also expected to get some flood damage. The river's rise
is a result of torrential rains upstream in the Del Rio area. Those
rains, spawned by the remnants of Tropical Storm Charley, sent a
flood wave down the Rio Grande measuring up to a mile wide and more
than 100 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gradual thing,'' said Daryl Williams, a forecaster for
the National Weather Service. ``It's not like a wall of water
rolling down the river like a tsunami.''
</P>
<P>
   The river at Laredo could remain above flood stage for a few
days, weather service officials said. Some members of a National
Guard contingent previously dispatched to Del Rio have been
diverted to Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   The floodwaters are expected to enter Falcon Reservoir, between
Laredo and McAllen, on Thursday or Friday. The influx poses no
threat to the structural integrity of the dam, said Ken Rakestraw,
chief of water accounting for the International Boundary and Water
Commission, which oversees Falcon and Amistad Reservoir, upstream
from Del Rio. Amistad is also rising as a result of flooding in the
Devils and Pecos rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the deluge, the reservoirs are not expected to refill
enough to break a five-year drought along the lower Rio Grande,
according to the Texas Water Development Board.
</P>
<P>
   In Eagle Pass, the flood wave spurred city officials to evacuate
about 5,000 people Monday night. The river swelled to about 35 feet
above its normal level, the highest in more than four decades.
About 30 homes and some downtown bsuinesses were flooded, and there
were no fatalities or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Across the river from Eagle Pass, about 3,700 people were
evacuated and 35 homes were washed away in the Mexican border town
of Piedras Negras. The home of Mabel and Armando Lechler sat in
waist-high water Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here the government does nothing to help us recover from the
floods,'' Mabel said. ``Not like they do in Eagle Pass.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Laredo area, the flood wave was expected to inflict the
most damage on two colonias south of the city, Rio Bravo and El
Cenzio, where 7,500 people live. Half of the homes were expected to
be flooded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of these houses are in poor condition,'' said Magdalena
Gonzales, who works at El Cenzio's Community Center. ``They won't
withstand any flooding. People here, they don't have insurance.
They don't have money to rebuild. It will be devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   The colonias -- with mobile homes, plywood shacks and
pastel-painted stucco houses -- are home to the poorest of the
poor. Dozens of houses lay just feet from the banks of the river,
where water was rising a foot and a half per hour Tuesday night.
Three shelters in the colonias and one in Laredo sat ready for
those displaced from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In Laredo, city officials said power and water supply would not
be affected by the flood, since the water plant was situated 61
feet above ground, well above the highest estimates for
floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   But in the colonias, where some do not have running water and
open sewers run near streets, flooding is likely to make things
worse. And south of the border in Nuevo Laredo, officials expect
water supplies will be tainted by floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   At the C &AMP; C Kountry Store in El Cenizo, residents streamed in,
buying more bottled water than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been buying water by the gallons,'' said Izaguirre
Maricruz, 31, who works at the store and lives in El Cenizo with
her 4-year-old son. ``There are a lot of people worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were skeptical, refusing to leave their homes until they
saw the floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard in Laredo to tell people it's flooding, because it
has not rained here,'' said Betty Flores, Laredo's mayor.
</P>
<P>
   At Riverdrive Mall, whose bottom floor of stores will be flooded
if the water reaches 31 feet or so. Workers began nailing wooden
sheets over the McDonald's looking down at the river about noon.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Radio Shack, manager Hector Salazar, operating on the
owner's instructions, had moved only a few large speakers to higher
ground, leaving scores of small electronic devices subject to
submersion.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Laredo workers, Salazar lives across the river in
Nuevo Laredo. With the bridges closing, he won't be able to make it
to work today. With the mall closing Wednesday due to the flood,
though, he won't have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with many other workers, who were faced with the hard
choice Tuesday of finding someplace to spend the night or crossing
the river and missing work for at least one day. Laredo, with about
175,000 people, is connected to Nuevo Laredo's 250,000 people by
three automobile bridges and a train bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Alcala, 21, walking home on International Bridge No. 1 to
Mexico late Tuesday, had to pick between missing work at a U.S.
electrical repair shop or missing college classes in Nuevo Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boss, he gave me permission to don't show up tomorrow,''
Alcala said. But he will lose salary while he is stranded in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   They began closing bridges at noon Tuesday, beginning with one
direction of the Columbia Bridge about 20 miles upstream.
Commercial traffic _ about 5,000 truckers cross the river at Laredo
every day _ ceased at 3 p.m. Both downtown bridges closed
completely at 7 p.m. The only options now other than staying put
are to go 150 miles downstream to McAllen or 125 miles upstream to
Eagle Pass, where the bridge remained open.
</P>
<P>
   Although International Bridge No. 1 collapsed in a major flood
in 1954, Laredo officials say they're not concerned about one of
the bridges being washed away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have the dams that we do now,'' Flores said. ``It
was a different river. At the same time, the force of the river is
something to be reckoned with.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Russia searches for a new government and a program
to pull the nation out of a tailspin, fresh panic swept through its
financial institutions Tuesday as the currency plunged about 9
percent, three banks announced a merger to shore up their stability
and the government unveiled a plan to stretch out the repayment of
its debt.
</P>
<P>
   Coming at a moment when Prime Minister-designate Viktor
Chernomyrdin is still negotiating with the Parliament over the
makeup of his new government, the ruble's abrupt drop stoked new
fears of inflation similar to the spiraling rates that plunged
Russia into a depression in the early 1990s.

<P>
   ``The situation is worse today because then, the country was
dependent on domestic production, however bad it may have been,''
said Mikhail Berger, editor of the newspaper Segodnya. ``Now, big
cities are mostly dependent on imports, and traders can no longer
get credits, not from banks, not from abroad. So there is a danger
that supplies to the cities will fall short.''
</P>
<P>
   The drop in the value of the currency was the deepest in four
years, and it was stopped only when the Central Bank intervened to
hold its value at 7.8 to the dollar, after trading was twice
suspended. In the 10 days since the ruble's value was weakened from
its previous level of 6.2, the Bank has spent an estimated $1
billion to buy rubles in currency markets to keep it from falling
too far, too fast.
</P>
<P>
   The lunge for dollars was driven mostly by Russian banks that
scrambled to trade rubles for dollars and other foreign currencies.
The moves reflected a pessimism by bankers and investors about the
outlook for the ruble as well as the uncertainty over whether
Chernomyrdin can halt the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, in meetings Tuesday with parliamentary leaders,
said he was open to a coalition government that would necessarily
include members of a Communist opposition that has been a resolute
foe of Russia's now-sputtering economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
   Putting forward the Parliament's demands in unusually blunt and
bold terms, Speaker Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist, pressed for a
greater role for the legislature in a system that until now has
been dominated by President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   With Yeltsin now acting increasingly like a lame duck, space has
opened up on the political spectrum for new forces. Chernomyrdin,
whom Yeltsin all but anointed as his political heir in an address
to the nation Monday, is one beneficiary, but others include
members of Russia's powerful financial elite, many of whom support
the new prime minister, and the legislature itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot rule out the possibility that the president might
step down before his term is over, leaving the country in the hands
of a more predictable prime minister,'' Seleznyov said.
</P>
<P>
   At his press conference Tuesday, Seleznyov struck a defiant
note, warning Yeltsin to keep his hands off the new government and
saying the parliament will insist that Chernomyrdin follow the
legislature's own anti-crisis package _ now in preparation _ before
confirming him.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's deepening troubles came on a day when major investors
anxiously awaited Russia's plan to restructure about $40 billion in
Russian short-term domestic debt, of which about 25 percent is held
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, delayed Monday so it could be reviewed by
Chernomyrdin, will allow investors holding Russian short-term
Treasury bills, which were sold with maturities of up to three
years, to trade them for three new issues of Russian securities
that will mature over three to five years, with varying interest
rates and staggered redemption schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, investors can swap their ruble-denominated notes
for a new security, maturing in 2006, denominated in dollars but
paying a slender 5 percent annual interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the plan was cool at best, especially in the United
States. ``If the question is whether this package will secure
Russian access to capital markets in the future, then the answer is
no, it doesn't,'' said an American investor who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``This is sort of the slash and burn
approach to restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some analysts said the repackaging is a needed step
forward. ``No one would buy or sell Russian debt because no one
knew what price to put on it,'' said Charles Peabody, an analyst
with Mitchell Securities Inc. in New York. ``This is an attempt to
get the markets working again by establishing some price for the
debt, but obviously fiscal reforms are going to be equally
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some foreign analysts were already expecting losses as
high as 30 percent on treasury bills, or GKOs, given the loss of
faith in the Russian market after the tumultuous events of the
previous 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the turmoil has involved Russia's banking system, which
has faced a double-sided problem of a cash shortage and debts they
cannot fully repay. A 90-day moratorium has been imposed on bank
debt owed abroad, and three major Russian banks on Tuesday
announced a proposal to form a new banking company in a bid to
bolster their capital base. Some analysts saw the merger plan,
involving Uneximbank, Menatep and Most-Bank, as an attempt to
circle the wagons against the growing storm.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday night, Menatep chairman Alexander Zurabov
suggested the new consolidated banking group would join forces to
press the Central Bank to loosen its control on Russia's money
supply to pump more money into the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The softening of the tough monetaristic policy is an absolute
necessity understood by everybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Yeltsin replaced Kiriyenko with Chernomyrdin _
five months after he replaced Chernomyrdin with Kiriyenko _
Russians and foreigners alike were left waiting for a clear signal
of how the new government plans to pull the country out of its
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published Tuesday in the newspaper Komsomolskaya
Pravda, Chernomyrdin said his first priorities would be ``the
protection of the population's social interest, the payment of
wages and pensions. Next on his list, would an industrial policy
because, he said, ``Russia cannot be pulled out of the crisis by
purely monetary steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's choice of words, harking back to Soviet
terminology, suggested more government support for Russia's
flailing industries, and not the kind of tough measures proposed in
recent weeks by Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
   ``To predict what Chernomyrdin will do is very difficult,'' said
Boris Nemtsov, an outgoing member of the Kiriyenko government, in
an interview Tuesday. ``During his five years in government, there
have been seven governments. This time, in a best case scenario,
inflation will not be so big, 15 to 20 percent next year. In the
worst case, there might be hyperinflation, 100, 200 or even 1,000
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But with Russia's enfeebled banking system sinking deeper into
debt, leaving Russian companies and foreign creditors holding the
bag, others have warned that the country can not afford to waste
time arguing over rescue packages and ministerial portfolios. One
example of the country's spreading cash crunch emerged Tuesday when
distributors for the evening newspaper Izvestia said Tuesday
night's edition had been halted because the printing plant had run
out of money.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-crisis program adopted last week by the Kiriyenko
government in addition to the 90-day breathing space on bank debts
owed to foreign creditors, temporarily froze GKO trading, pending
Tuesday's announcement of the restructuring plan and seemed to only
worsened an existing cash crunch.
</P>
<P>
   The banks' liquidity problem was eased somewhat in recent weeks
by an extension of new credits by the Central Bank, which also this
week lowered the minimum capital requirement for banks, allowing
them to dip into reserves to keep afloat.
</P>
<P>
   But the heavy trading on currency markets Tuesday suggested that
many Russians banks were using their ruble reserves to buy dollars,
now the currency of choice in Russia. ``Of course, we are worried
that many banks are using their credits to speculate on the
currency market, not to pay their creditors,'' said Central Bank
spokesman Irina Yasina. ``But we cannot interfere with the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign analysts were appalled by the banks' actions, which
they said was a prelude to large-scale capital flight. ``Robbery is
going on, that is the only way to describe it,'' said Charles
Blitzer, the London-based director of emerging markets research for
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``The Central Bank has provided
liquidity to commercial banks which are using it to go to the
currency exchanges and get their money out. It seems Russia's
oligarchs are engaging in big-time capital flight, undermining the
ruble and fleeing the country. For the Central Bank to say they
can't control it is a total abdication of what a central bank's
responsibilities are.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger, the newspaper editor, noted that it was natural that
Russian banks, faced with a cash shortage that has put a squeeze on
the value of the ruble, would buy foreign currency. ``Right now,
the most liquid currency on the market is the dollar,'' he said.
``There are no GKOs, there are no bonds that are worth anything.''

   THE RUBLE FALLS STEEPLY, CAUSING NEW WAVE OF PANIC
</P>
<P>
   A fresh wave of panic swept through Russia's financial
institutions as the currency plunged, three banks announced a
merger to shore up their stability and the government disclosed a
plan to stretch out repayment of its debt. Coming at a moment when
Russia's newly designated prime minister is still negotiating with
the Parliament over the makeup of his government, the ruble's
abrupt drop stoked new fears of inflation similar to the spiraling
rates that sent Russia into a depression in the early 1990s. The
drop in the value of the currency was the deepest in four years. It
was stopped only when the central bank of Russia intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Most major market indexes were rallying strongly early
yesterday, but dropped slightly after hearing about the situation
in Russia. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 36.04 points, to
8,602.65. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index closed up 4.72
points at 1,092.86. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index
gained 7.35 points, to 1,798.17. But the Russell 2000 index of
smaller stocks hit a new 52-week low, falling 3.94 points, or 1
percent, to 389.76. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to
5.43 percent, from 5.46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   INQUIRY INTO MICROSOFT'S INTEL ROLE
</P>
<P>
   The government is investigating whether Microsoft has used its
market muscle to force even Intel to shelve new technology efforts
that conflicted with Microsoft's ambitions. The antitrust lawsuit
accusing Microsoft of using unfair business practices to protect
its monopoly in operating systems and to extend that monopoly into
the new markets for Internet software and commerce was filed by the
Justice Department and 20 states. The trial is scheduled to start
Sept. 23.

DEATH TOLL AT 6 AS BORDER TOWN SHIFTS FOCUS TO SEARCH AND RESCUE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: A tilde is needed over n in Pina) 
 
By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL RIO, Texas _ Maria Pina and her husband, Armando, stood on
the bed in their two-room adobe house at 203 Elm and prayed.
</P>
<P>
   It was late Sunday night, and water surging from San Felipe
Creek had broken down the front door. Armando considered trying to
cut a hole in the roof, but that was a long shot. By the time the
elderly couple realized their only way out was the front door,
foaming brown water was up to their necks.
</P>
<P>
   Then their tiny yellow house imploded, the roof caving in and a
side of the house buckling under the force of the swift current.
Armando heard his wife scream and then saw her vanish in the
furious water as their house split in two.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed to the surface by a piece of furniture, Armando was
rescued minutes later by a family who tossed him a garden hose from
their roof. Maria was washed some two miles away, where she was
found dead Monday. Her body was identified Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard her say, `Ayy,''' said the 63-year-old Pina, sitting
on a cot at the local civic center, his face swollen from a cut
that required seven stitches and his body badly scraped and
bruised. ``Then, no more.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pina is one of six confirmed dead in the flash floods that
ravaged this border town late Sunday and Monday, triggered by
torrential rains that came ashore on the Gulf Coast by Tropical
Storm Charley. Authorities said Tuesday that one man they listed as
a flood victim Monday died instead of a heart attack unrelated to
the floods.
</P>
<P>
   The water, which submerged much of this city at one point
Monday, receded almost as quickly as it came, and Tuesday the
town's focus turned to search and rescue and even some cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities confirmed the names of five of the victims and upped
the number of missing from 30 to 41. Known dead are Pina, 56;
Border Patrol trainee David Pyatte, 37; his mother-in-law, JoAnn
Schumann, whose age was not known; and Carmen Ruiz and Concepcion
Chacon, ages also unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they expected many of the missing to turn up
alive and well since as of late Tuesday they had still not
accounted for many of the people in temporary shelters. Among them
are as many as 700 weary souls bedding down at the civic center and
a local church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to determine who's at the shelters,'' said
Paty Mancha, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Border Patrol. ``We've had
groups of five coming in and only one person signing in.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, the floods killed 11 people from the Hill Country to the
Rio Grande and another three in Ciudad Acuna, across the border
from Del Rio in Mexico. But Tuesday, Leonardo Ayala Torres, Mexican
consul in Del Rio, told one U.S. official that nine people were
missing and presumed dead, though he said flood damage was light
compared to Del Rio and offered the city help on behalf of Acuna.
</P>
<P>
   The floods destroyed as many as 400 homes and businesses in Del
Rio, causing damages that are expected to soar well into the
millions of dollars. Among the property damaged is the city's water
system, which was knocked out in the floods and left Del Rio
without drinking water Tuesday for the second straight day.
</P>
<P>
   Officials predicted it would not be restored until late in the
week. In the meantime, 200,000 gallons are being trucked in per day
through a combination of public and private efforts. Electric power
and gas were restored to most of this city of 34,000, but many
stores and restaurants remained closed.
</P>
<P>
   Down river, the water that surged through Del Rio caused some
flooding in Eagle Pass and was expected to do the same in Laredo.
But most low-lying areas in those cities were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gov. George W. Bush, U.S. Rep. Henry Bonilla and
local leaders are expected to tour the flood damage. State
officials said they are considering whether to appeal for national
disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Del Rio received anywhere from 18 to 25 inches
of rain in a 24-hour period from Sunday to Monday. Combined with
water cascading south from the Hill Country, the rain caused severe
flooding all over Del Rio, with the worst coming at San Felipe
Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The creek, which snakes through downtown Del Rio, is what
attracted settlers when they first came to the city in 1860. The
San Felipe neighborhood, a poor but fiercely proud Hispanic
community, grew up around it. Tuesday, as some ventured back for a
glimpse of the damage, they found it destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   On the wall at Joseph Borrego's home the battery-operated clock
had stopped at 1:10 a.m. Monday. By that time, the water was about
6 feet high in the living room and the Borregos had moved to higher
ground. Tuesday, Borrego's daughter Jennifer slopped through the
muddy floors to recover a CD player she received last week for her
16th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't stay here,'' said Borrego, the father. ``You just go
on with your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the creek bed cars, including the local fire chief's
official vehicle, were wrapped around shady pecan trees. Many trees
were uprooted, much like the homes that had been literally jerked
from their foundations. The ground was littered with everything
from frying pans to phone books.
</P>
<P>
   While Texas Army National Guard and Border Patrol helicopters
hovered overhead, search and rescue teams worked the area, some
with dogs trained to find survivors. Locals Maria and Frank
Esquivel took it upon themselves to search for Frank's uncle, an
80-year-old man who they said is missing.
</P>
<P>
   But searchers, unofficial and official, were frustrated. By
early afternoon the only thing one of the search dogs, Falco, had
found was a soaked stuffed animal, which he held in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said 56 people were rescued, most of them Monday,
while 35 were treated at local hospitals. Those who made it out
alive, like Jovita Casares, a neighbor of the Pinas, said they had
only God to thank. Clinging to a piece of her home's roof, she and
seven others, including a local policeman, were washed some two
miles downstream. They were there found early Monday morning,
clinging to a tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children were saying, `We can't feel our legs,''' said
Casares, recounting the long, wet, nighttime wait in the tree while
water rushed by. ``I just told them, `Now you hang on, God's going
to save you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pyatte, the Border Patrol trainee, lost his life trying to make
a rescue north of town. The father of one and a native of San
Angelo, he drowned as he tried to pull his mother-in-law, Schumann,
from her house. A trailer home had been swept 1,500 feet across a
ravine into her home.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Casares laughed and cried as she told her tale in
the civic center. She recalled the cries for help as the water rose
and the bodies rushing by as she and her husband and their
grandchildren, ages 12 to 20, sought refuge on their roof, only to
have it splinter into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started praying to God and told the children, `If the roof
breaks, grab a tree,''' said Casares. ``It's a miracle.''

 &HT;    Floods highlight need for weather warnings
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The deadly floods on the Texas-Mexico border
point out an old problem for Texans: the need for timely warning of
severe weather while there's still a chance to get out of its way.
</P>
<P>
   Del Rio, ironically, had a few unusual advantages. It has an Air
Force training base with weather watchers and a weather radar, an
additional federal weather radar to the north in San Angelo and one
to the southeast in Brackettville, and two automated observation
sites that report conditions hourly to the National Weather
Service's forecast center in New Braunfels.
</P>
<P>
   So the forecast center was able to issue its first flood
warnings for Del Rio at 9:10 a.m. Sunday, based on reports of
swamped low-water crossings, and to extend them with ever stronger
language about evacuations and life-threatening conditions until
well after midnight. National Weather Service officials said the
worst of the flooding began between 9 and 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Most places in Texas have far fewer means of escaping disaster.
Only 45 of the state's 254 counties have federal weather
observation sites, either staffed or automated.
</P>
<P>
   Some Texas scientists hope to begin changing that this week,
when they ask the state Public Utility Commission to raise electric
rates to pay for the first complete statewide weather monitoring
system by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be at least one automated weather instrument site
in every county,'' said John Nielsen-Gammon, an associate professor
of meteorology at Texas A&AMP;M University and one of the organizers of
the proposed system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too expensive to put a radar in every county, but you can
augment the ones we have with (automated) observations,''
Nielsen-Gammon said. ``The National Weather Service would love to
do it, but they have to scramble for money from Congress just to
maintain the current setup.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed weather network is called the Texas MesoNet, a
reference to mesoscale, a meteorological term meaning a weather
event extending from 1 to 1,000 kilometers in area.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, which arose in 1995 at the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission, when officials watched Oklahoma put in a
similar system, is being pushed by the Lower Colorado River
Authority and coordinated by meteorologists at Texas A&AMP;M and Texas
Tech University in Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   Even the National Weather Service finds commendable the idea of
one or more weather observation sites in every Texas county to
monitor air temperature, humidity, precipitation, prevailing winds,
amount of sunlight, ground temperatures and moisture content of the
soil.
</P>
<P>
   The automated sites would report the information hourly, as
federal observation sites do now, to regional centers where the
data could be analyzed and passed on to whoever needed it.
</P>
<P>
   Once the system was up and running, its information would be
free to the weather service and the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to have a system with that kind of dense
information,'' said Larry Eblin, a meteorologist with the weather
service's Austin and San Antonio Forecast Office in New Braunfels.
``Our forecast models would be far better than they are right now,
especially in areas where there's not so many gauges or people to
call for information.''
</P>
<P>
   Eblin said the weather service now relies in many places on
volunteers such as ham radio operators and police and sheriff's
deputies to add additional visual information to what regional
radar and instruments can gather.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bigger than other states and we have more Nexrad radars
than any other state,'' Nielsen-Gammon said. ``But the coverage
tends to be better where the population is denser.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen-Gammon said the weather service operates nine Nexrad
weather radars in Texas and has information-sharing agreements with
additional radars at military bases.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their impressive television performance, radars
can't do it alone. Scientists say automated instruments such as
rain gauges are necessary to augment even Nexrad radar estimates of
rainfall rates. Research has found that intervening terrain may
block the radars and rain often occurs at lower levels of the
atmosphere than those at which the radars are aimed.
</P>
<P>
   The primary beneficiaries of a Texas MesoNet are expected to be
farmers and other agriculture producers. The information would help
their planning for planting, irrigating and harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   Local power companies also would be able to better determine the
power consumption needs of a region by pinpointing hotter or colder
areas. It's the potential power company savings, as well as the
benefits to agriculture, that the scientists expect to convince the
Public Utility Commission to use electric rates to finance the
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost would be a few pennies more on utility bills,''
Nielsen-Gammon said. ``But we fully expect it to save energy costs
in the long run, improve food production and improve public
safety.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The first comprehensive study of public higher education in the
19 states that once operated racially separate colleges presents a
picture of continuing segregation fueled by political fatigue,
court rulings, and admissions and financial-aid policies.
</P>
<P>
   Historically black colleges in those states are still
overwhelmingly black, the study finds, while whites dominate
flagship state institutions in numbers disproportionate to their
share of the population.
</P>
<P>
   And while the number of black freshmen in the 19 states has
grown since the 1970s, the percentage of blacks among freshmen has
barely inched up, to 17 percent in 1996 from 15 percent in 1976 _
small numbers, given that in all but four of those states, the
percentage of blacks among freshmen is significantly lower than the
percentage of blacks among all 18- to 24-year-olds. Nine states, in
fact, reported a decline from 1991 to 1996 in the proportion of
blacks in their freshman classes.
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``Miles to Go,'' was issued Tuesday by the Southern
Education Foundation, an Atlanta advocacy group that works to
improve educational opportunities for black and poor Southerners.
</P>
<P>
   The study follows by more than three decades the last of the
desegregation battles on Southern campuses, and by six years a
Supreme Court order that the states take ``affirmative steps'' to
dismantle vestiges of dual systems. In that ruling, United States
vs. Fordice, the court said that in the states that once had
segregated systems, merely instituting race-neutral admissions
policies did not end illegal discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   With the states in question _ 15 in the South, plus Delaware,
Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia _ accounting for
three-quarters of the nation's black freshmen at public
universities, the study's data, the authors said, have national
implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been a full commitment to leveling the playing
field,'' said Robert Kronley, a lawyer who is a senior consultant
to the foundation and who wrote the report with Claire Handley, a
foundation official. ``The key point we are trying to make is that
you can't change this educational inequality without dealing
directly with race. And what we found is not so much ill will as a
kind of fatigue with these issues. There is a desire not to have to
confront problems of race.''
</P>
<P>
   Support for that observation comes in a July survey by Public
Agenda, a nonpartisan public opinion research organization. In a
report titled ``Time to Move On,'' Public Agenda found that white
and black parents alike wanted the public schools to focus on
raising academic standards rather than promoting diversity.
</P>
<P>
   At the college level, Kronley said, officials are responding to
a growing political and legal climate against affirmative action as
evinced by a federal appeals court's 1996 decision in Hopwood vs.
Texas and by Proposition 209 in California, both of which bar
consideration of race in college admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Kronley said that as a Supreme Court ruling, Fordice trumped
Hopwood, and that to overcome past discrimination the 19 states
might take race into account in issues like admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Terence Pell, senior counsel at the Center for Individual
Rights, a conservative public-policy group in Washington, said
Kronley was reading the Fordice ruling too broadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fordice speaks only of getting rid of policies that affect
student choice rooted in de jure segregation,'' Pell said. ``It
does not say that anything that affects educational opportunities
for blacks is fair game. Besides, all the civil rights groups want
to preserve historically black colleges, so you can't integrate
higher education as was done in elementary and secondary schools.
As long as blacks want to go to all-black colleges, who is to say
they are less good, especially if funding has been equalized?''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago the Southern Education Foundation issued a
similarly gloomy study on 12 of the 19 states. Since then, the new
report said, most states have focused on ways to improve education
generally, without specific regard for African-Americans' problems.
The authors said those changes _ liberalized financial aid
policies, higher admission requirements and limits on remediation _
either did not help blacks or in fact worked against them.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, some changes in financial aid have involved tax
relief. But many black families in the 19 states earn so little _
on average less than two-thirds the income of the average white
family in 1995 _ that they have little or no taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report said, the 19 states distribute more than
one-third of all their financial aid without considering need (more
than 10 times the percentage of aid distributed on a non-need basis
in the 31 other states). Since schools in predominantly black areas
tend to be weaker, their students' chances of earning merit-based
scholarship aid have been low.
</P>
<P>
   Many state colleges have also adopted higher admissions
requirements, which can act as a barrier for students from poorer
schools. The new standards coincide with moves to abolish remedial
courses at state universities, making it even more difficult for
poorly prepared students to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that black students in disproportionate
numbers failed to graduate. In 1976-77, public institutions in the
19 states gave bachelor's degrees to 23,587 black students, 8.5
percent of all bachelor's recipients. By 1994-95, the number was up
to 36,402 black students, still only 10.3 percent of all those
graduating.
</P>
<P>
   And among blacks who do graduate, many do not go on to
postgraduate work. ``The higher the degree,'' the authors said,
``the lower the representation of blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, most graduate degrees earned by blacks are in just a
few fields. Nearly half of all doctoral degrees to blacks in the 19
states _ 47.2 percent in 1994-95 _ are in education, with fewer
than 5 percent in engineering or the physical sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, black faculty, seen as vital role models and mentors to
black students, are severely underrepresented, the report said. In
14 states, blacks made up fewer than 10 percent of full-time
faculty members in the 1995-96 academic year; in the 5 other
states, black faculty was largely limited to community or
historically black colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shared history of these states,'' the report said, ``has
spawned a common condition: opportunity in public higher education
for black students remains substantially restricted and far less
than that of whites. Progress, where present, has been ragged, and
efforts to promote it have been fragmented.''

RIO GRANDE FLOODWATERS FAIL TO DRENCH EAGLE PASS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAGLE PASS, Texas _ Down river on the Rio Grande from devastated
Del Rio, this community had girded itself for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   The worst never came.
</P>
<P>
   The rain-fed Rio Grande crested at 35 feet Tuesday morning, but
the floodwaters that killed half a dozen people in Del Rio never
entered downtown Eagle Pass or most of its residential
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest business casualty here was Mayor Pepe Aranda's
``chicharrones''' factory, which produces fried pork rind snacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens, that's just nature,'' Aranda said philosophically
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Only about two dozen houses were flooded and no lives were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the thanks for that can probably rest with the city and
its evacuation of 2,400 residents; 5,000 total were evacuated
across Maverick County.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south on the Rio Grande, in Laredo, the three
international bridges were closed and many residents were urged to
evacuate in preparation for the fallout of the remnants of Tropical
Storm Charley.
</P>
<P>
   About 7,000 people live in the Rio Bravo and El Cenizo areas
near the Rio Grande that were designated for evacuation, Laredo
Mayor Betty Flores told The Associated Press. Not all would be
required to leave.
</P>
<P>
   She said the city's water supply was expected to be safe since
its water plant is built at an elevation of about 60 feet. But
across the border in Nuevo Laredo, residents were encouraged to
boil water once the flood hits.
</P>
<P>
   The preventive actions in Eagle Pass and Laredo were prompted by
the frightening news from Del Rio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel bad for Del Rio. They were caught up before
anybody had time to react there,'' the mayor said. ``We feel very
lucky, we feel blessed. We were lucky that the water didn't go up,
and we had ample time to react.''
</P>
<P>
   State troopers and national guardsmen were called in to assist
in the evacuation of nine subdivisions. Aranda said 800 people
stayed in four schoolhouse shelters overnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the less fortunate was Eduardo Hernandez, a 52-year-old
cook and drummer, whose home was located on low-lying Ryan Street a
block south of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, covered in mud, carried out muddied furniture and
saturated mattresses to a growing pile behind his green
cinder-block home. He then carefully took the soaked dress-blue
Marine Corps uniforms of his twin nephews to higher ground. He laid
the uniforms out, still wrapped in plastic from the cleaners,
hoping he could salvage them for his nephews stationed in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is gone. Nothing is left,'' said Hernandez, who
spent the night with his wife and two grandchildren in his pickup,
parked up the street from his home.
</P>
<P>
   Though his house had been flooded twice before, in 1974 and
1982, he remained undeterred and planned to remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stay. It's our property,'' he said. ``We can't
leave our property.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the border in Piedras Negras, damage also
was light. Aranda said parts of Piedras Negras were without water
and he offered his assistance, but was told water was being trucked
in.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagle Pass Creek, which had risen over its banks and
threatened neighborhoods north of the Rio Grande, was a muddied
culvert in most places.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had warning _ &UR;  &LR; unfortunately through Del Rio _ we knew what
was happening and we were ready,'' said Mary Ann Contreras, Eagle
Pass High School principal, whose cafeteria sheltered about 450
displaced people Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Of the people sheltered at the high school, only four families
were looking for a place to spend the night Tuesday. Contreras said
she was particularly moved by one woman who had lost her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she was concerned most about was not her home,''
Contreras said. ``The main concern for this woman were the uniforms
for her children for school tomorrow.''

IMF LETS ITS RULE ON FULL REPAYMENT SLIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pummeled by Asia and now Russia, the International
Monetary Fund is gradually softening its policies, becoming more
tolerant of arrangements it would have rejected a year ago _ and
even allowing some Asian debtors not to repay all they owe to
foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Russian government is pushing this process favoring the
country in crisis a step or two further.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has announced that $40 billion in debt, scheduled for
repayment over 18 months, will be ``stretched out,'' and paid over
three to five years. Probable devaluations of the ruble over so
long a period raises the odds that foreign lenders, including Chase
Manhattan and Bank of America, will not be fully repaid in dollars.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, one of the great debates of the Asian crisis is
showing signs of being settled by events.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and its powerful mentor, the Clinton administration,
have faced criticism for months now that their policies are pitched
to assure full repayment of foreign lenders, at the cost of
economic growth. Rescuing these lenders and investors from their
risky actions only encourages more risky lending and more financial
crises. Or so the argument goes, even among some Democrats and
Republicans in Congress who oppose an $18 billion appropriation to
fund the IMF. But now events appear to be overtaking words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are basically reacting to the realities that are
unfolding,'' said John Boorman, the IMF's director of policy
development and review.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to revive the disastrous Indonesian economy, for example,
the IMF since May has encouraged corporate borrowers in that
country to renegotiate their debts to foreign lenders. The hope is
that with a lower debt load, these companies can return to more
normal operations. In some cases the foreign lenders are agreeing
to collect less than 100 cents on the dollar. It is the first time
that has happened with IMF blessing since the Latin American debt
crisis of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the fund has shifted away from demanding of the
Indonesian government one of its standard austerity measures: a
budget surplus. That demand ended last month when the IMF agreed
instead to enough extra government spending, particularly for
imported food, to run up the deficit to 8 to 10 percent of the
total budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have ever at the IMF had a program where we
targeted a fiscal deficit as large as 8 to 10 percent,'' Boorman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia puts the fund, and the Clinton administration, much more
on the spot. The fund had authorized a $22 billion loan to Russia,
only to have the Russians, earlier this month, devalue their
currency and change the repayment terms for much of its debt,
including the $40 billion in Russian short-term government paper.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors, converting dollars to rubles, had bought
about $10 billion of this total, and now that the repayment has
been prolonged, ruble devaluations are likely to wipe out some of
their investment. The stretch-out terms, announced Tuesday, provide
for interest payments in the 20 percent to 30 percent range,
annually _ probably not high enough to offset ruble devaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Fischer, the fund's first deputy managing director,
offered an angry characterization of the Russian initiative. ``The
IMF regards the fact that Russia was unable to meet its commitments
and has had to restructure them unilaterally as extremely
unfortunate and regrettable,'' Fischer said. ``The nature of the
international economy will change if this is the way business has
to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean the IMF won't make its next scheduled loan
payment to Russia of more than $4 billion, scheduled for next
month? Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   The fund does not pressure banks to swallow loan write-offs
against their wishes, but this time something like that could
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Russia must comply with some loan conditions, Fischer and
Boorman said. Above all, the Russian Duma, or lower house of
parliament, and Prime Minister-designate Viktor Chernomyrdin must
accept the IMF-imposed goal of a balanced budget in two or three
years. But repayment to foreign lenders, in full, may be allowed to
slip _ if the government can demonstrate that it has no choice in
order to revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If markets are going to operate properly,'' Boorman said,
``and if markets are going to price risk appropriately, then in
some circumstances that risk is going to materialize, in nonpayment
of some debt, as it is materializing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Such issues are almost certainly on the table in the continuing
discussions in Moscow between IMF and Russian government officials,
and in related talks involving David Lipton, the Treasury
Department's undersecretary for international affairs, who has
traveled several times to Moscow in recent weeks, and is returning
next week for President Clinton's summit meeting with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin. The two presidents spoke by phone Tuesday
and ``reaffirmed the importance of a clear, decisive strategy for
tackling Russia's economic crisis,'' a White House spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has relaxed its opposition to budget deficits. It has
pulled back on its endorsement of unrestricted short-term lending
across borders, recognizing that such loans set off the Asian
crisis, when the lenders tried to call them in. And it is
publishing, on the Internet, the texts of various agreements that
in the past were not made public.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's shifting stance is not without precedent. Years of
stagnant economies in Latin America followed the debt crisis of the
early 1980s when most Latin nations defaulted on debts owed to
foreign banks. After nearly eight years in which the banks tried to
force repayment of the entire debt, the Reagan administration and
the IMF brokered an agreement that guaranteed repayment, but of a
greatly reduced amount.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mexican debt crisis of 1994 met with stiff resistance on
the part of the IMF and the Clinton administration to any debt
write-offs or concessions in standard IMF practices. The same
reaction greeted the Asian crisis. When South Korean banks, for
example, renegotiated their foreign debt late last year, the IMF
blessed an agreement that stretched out repayment of short-term
debts over several years, but called for repayment of the full
dollar amount, with interest.

BARNICLE COLUMN RESEMBLED MAINE COUPLE'S STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Patricia Shairs of Sanford, Maine, cried when she read
the column that last week led to Mike Barnicle's dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded eerily similar to the story of her son, Joshua. Just
like the Oct. 8, 1995, column, ``Through Pain, A Common Bond,''
Joshua became close friends with another child patient while being
treated at Children's Hospital in Boston. Joshua later died, and
the family of the other patient, touched by the children's
friendship, sent the Shairs a check for a sizable amount.
</P>
<P>
   But there are more differences between the column and Shairs's
story than similarities. Joshua died of complications after heart
surgery, not cancer; Joshua was 5, not 9; Joshua's family is white,
not black; Joshua died in 1987, not 1994; the well-to-do family
gave $5,000, not $10,000; and the money was to be used for a
scholarship the Shairs founded for cardiac ward nurses, not for
personal use.
</P>
<P>
   To Barnicle, who spoke to Shairs Tuesday, Joshua's story ``comes
pretty close'' to his column. Like the boy in the column, Joshua
was a huge Red Sox fan; and like the family in the column, the
Shairs family had lost their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have consistently said this is a true story,'' Barnicle said
Tuesday. ``That column was not intended as a news report. Although
the facts are not all the same, the story is real, the people are
real and it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote it as a parable, a hopeful sign that we can live in
harmony,'' Barnicle said in an interview with the Journal Tribune
of Biddeford, Maine, which Tuesday published a story on the
similarities between the column and the experiences of the Shairs
family.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Globe editor Matthew V. Storin asked for and received
Barnicle's resignation Aug. 19, saying Barnicle had failed to
follow ``basic reporting requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle had been serving a two-month unpaid suspension for not
attributing jokes from a George Carlin book, when a former Reader's
Digest editor revealed that fact-checkers there could not verify
the Oct. 8, 1995, column, which the publication wanted to reprint
in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   When Globe editors asked Barnicle to help them find the
families, who were not named, Barnicle said he got the information
from a Dana-Farber nurse he met in a South Boston restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``That there is a story that bears some resemblance to the
Barnicle column of Oct. 8, 1995, does not change our view of the
ethical questions involved,'' Storin said Tuesday. ``The writer
never checked the facts, but wrote the column as if he had
interviewed the key figures.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the first anniversary of her death nears, Diana,
Princess of Wales, has become a powerful princess of sales,
unexpectedly developing into the equivalent of a strong worldwide
brand.
</P>
<P>
   The merchandising of Diana's memory has grown rapidly into a
multimillion-dollar business for scores of companies that are
busily churning out items at all prices bearing her name, likeness
or affectionate sobriquets describing her as ``the people's
princess'' or ``England's rose.'' Those products, of varying taste
levels, are being promoted in advertising campaigns that have run
almost continuously since her death last Aug. 31, appearing most
frequently in mass media outlets like Sunday newspapers and women's
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the consummate brand, available to everybody,'' said
Nick Shore, partner at a New York consulting company named Nick and
Paul The Brand Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of iconic aspects to what she was all about:
the name, the hair, the dress, the eyes,'' he added. ``And she has
been in our living rooms more than our own family members.''
</P>
<P>
   The deluge of ``Dianabilia,'' as the goods generated by the
phenomenon are described in Britain, includes dolls, coins, stamps,
collector plates, books, jewelry, candles, music boxes, videotapes,
flowers and compact disks. Still more collectibles _ exploitive or
commemorative, authorized or otherwise _ are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``As popular as Diana was alive, the outpouring since her death
has been mind-boggling,'' said Jay Coleman, president and chief
executive at EMCI, a company in Stamford, Conn., that specializes
in entertainment and celebrity marketing campaigns. ``There's a
whole industry out there, and it wouldn't surprise me if we see an
ongoing Diana presence.''
</P>
<P>
   By one estimate, sales of products inspired by Dianamania are
running at $200 million annually. That is already equal to the
yearly sales of licensed merchandise associated with Marilyn
Monroe, another blonde whose sudden demise at age 36 drew
international attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diana died a tragic death, somewhat similar to a Marilyn
Monroe or a James Dean,'' said Mark Roesler, chairman and chief
executive of CMG Worldwide in Indianapolis, which handles licensing
and merchandising rights for more than 200 stars like Monroe, Dean,
Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Greta Garbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the unprecedented media coverage of her death undoubtedly
made an impact,'' he added. ``People buy things to remember.''
</P>
<P>
   The estimate of Diana brand sales does not include the revenue
derived by television networks, magazines and newspapers that are
devoting special programs, issues and sections to the accident that
killed her and two others in Paris. Among those Dianaphilic media
are Good Housekeeping, MSNBC, NBC, The New York Post, People and TV
Guide.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for the Diana brand is also evinced by efforts to
cross-merchandise her with other puissant commercial properties, as
if she were a McDonald's or a Pepsi-Cola being linked with a Walt
Disney or ``Star Wars.'' For instance, Ty Inc. brought out a Beanie
Baby devoted to Diana, a purple bear with a white rose over its
heart. And a necklace by Asprey London inspired by the Heart of the
Ocean, the gem worn by Kate Winslet in the film ``Titanic,'' was
auctioned at a benefit for the Diana memorial fund.
</P>
<P>
   The interest in Diana as a brand is not completely unexpected
because in life, she also moved the goods. First there were items
issued for her wedding to Prince Charles, which were subsequently
followed by trinkets like tea towels, magnets and coffee mugs. Most
of that merchandise, however, was sold on a small scale in souvenir
shops; the post-death products are being distributed far more
broadly.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the prominence of the Diana brand extend beyond
the abrupt and well-publicized nature of her death. Otherwise,
consumers would have been buying Princess Grace products for the
last 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``People identified with Diana,'' said Jeffrey Lotman, chief
executive at Global Icons, a Los Angeles company that handles
licensing and merchandising for such celebrities as James Cagney,
Sammy Davis Jr. and W.C. Fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the first member of royalty in my time that you felt
you could touch,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Roesler of CMG Worldwide said: ``She was known as a glamorous
figure. And glamour sells.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman of EMCI listed several attributes that he said he
believed were burnishing the luster of the Diana brand. They
include her identification with fashion, charities, social causes,
music and musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Coleman likened Diana to Elvis Presley.
</P>

<P>
   Like other brands, Diana has not been immune from business
problems. The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund, which was
formed after her death, sued the Franklin Mint in May, charging
that the company was not authorized to use her image on dolls,
plates and other products. The mint, a unit of Roll International,
is fighting the suit and proclaiming in ads that it had ``pledged a
minimum of $4 million worldwide to charity in tribute to the
beloved Princess Diana.''
</P>
<P>
   Some decisions by administrators of the fund, which has raised
$132.8 million from fees from sales of authorized Diana
merchandise, have been second-guessed as being in questionable
taste.
</P>
<P>
   Critics in Britain decried lottery tickets and margarine tubs
bearing Diana's name even though proceeds from their sale were
donated to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair complained in February about
``inappropriate and tacky'' commercial exploitation of Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Will such difficulties, as well as the inevitable fading of
memories, take a toll on the Diana brand? The experts seem to think
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect there will be a market for a long time,'' said Marty
Brochstein, executive editor of The Licensing Letter, a newsletter
published by EPM Communications in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those killed at an early age, their images are frozen in
time,'' he added, invoking John F. Kennedy, who ``hasn't gotten
older in people's minds; he is still the youthful, vital
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Paula Scher, a partner at Pentagram, a design company in New
York, said: ``Diana's longevity as a brand depends on how
effectively she is managed. If the management of the brand is good,
Diana can go on forever.''

 &HT;    UT Law School admits more minorities in 1998
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In its second year of admitting students without
affirmative action, the University of Texas law school opens today
to more blacks and Mexican Americans than a year ago but to fewer
than in 1996, when race was still being considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still an improvement, and we're pleased with that,'' UT
law dean Mike Sharlot said, giving credit to stepped-up recruitment
efforts, alumni-sponsored scholarships and first-ever interviews
with hundreds of applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary data show that eight blacks and 30 Mexican Americans
were among the 465 first-year students enrolled by early Tuesday
afternoon. That's just 8.2 percent of the overall class, but up
from four blacks and 26 Mexican Americans who entered last year and
comprised 6.5 percent of the first-year class.
</P>
<P>
   UT officials pointed out there also could be more black and
Mexican American students ``hidden'' among an unusually large
number of enrolled students who did not reveal their race _ 70 in
all.
</P>
<P>
   Even if all of the black and Mexican Americans who had accepted
admission to UT actually enrolled this year, UT still would not be
abe to match the 1996 numbers. That year, 31 blacks and 42 Mexican
Americans enrolled in the first-year class.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, deans at Texas' three other public law schools, which
are less selective in choosing students, said they were thrilled to
enroll similar numbers of first-year black and Hispanic students as
in 1996. They also credited aggressive recruitment and outreach
efforts for the increases.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks and Mexican Americans have been historically
under-represented in Texas higher education and were targeted for
affirmative action until the federal court's 1996 Hopwood ruling
said race could no longer be considered in admissions.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which took full effect in 1997, stemmed from a
lawsuit brought by Cheryl Hopwood and three other white applicants
against the UT law school. It led to a dismantling of affirmative
action in all student programs, including scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the race of college students in Texas has received
national attention. California colleges also are in the spotlight
because of an affirmative action ban in that state.
</P>
<P>
   California's premier law school at UC-Berkeley reported last
week that Hispanic enrollees were up from 10 last year to16 this
year and that African American enrollments increased from one to
nine.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday afternoon, UT law school still had five to 10
admissions offers pending, but none was to a black or Mexican
American applicant, Assistant Dean Shelli Soto said. It will be
another 12 class days before enrollment figures are official.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the racial identities of the 70 students will remain
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 70 could hide a lot,'' Soto said. ``But unless they
disclose it to us, we're not counting them'' by race.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the law school won't know how to fully gauge the
effects of the intensely watched Hopwood ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he were troubled by that, Sharlot said: ``If the
suggestion is that these unidentified students would total the same
kind of enrollment we had in the past, I'm sure that isn't true.
I'd be willing to put a lot of money on it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that there are worse things than not having definitive
data on students by race. ``It would be (more) distasteful, if we
made them all line up and eyeball them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   W. Frank Newton, dean at Texas Tech School of Law, was surprised
that his school's minority enrollments exceeded 1996 levels. Just
two weeks ago, he said he was expecting minority enrollments to be
about the same as last year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, five blacks enrolled at the Lubbock school, compared
with one last year and four in 1996. Twenty-eight Hispanics
enrolled, compared with 17 last year and 23 the preceding year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really worried we couldn't do it,'' Newton said of the
increases. ``We simply got many more of the minority students we
accepted to enroll after having some personal contact with alumni,
faculty, students and the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Tech had rebounded from Hopwood, Newton said trends are
not made in a year. He also said he worried that private
scholarships and other help would fade if people thought Tech had
overcome the effect of the Hopwood ruling.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Houston Law Center, 10 blacks were enrolled
compared with nine last year and 11 in 1996, while 36 Hispanics
were enrolled compared with 32 in each of the two preceding years.
</P>
<P>
   The other public law school, Texas Southern University's
Thurgood Marshall School of Law, is historically black but
nonetheless experienced declines in black and Hispanic enrollments
last year. Preliminary data this year show the school enrolled 162
blacks compared with 145 last year and 161 in 1996. Sixty-eight
Hispanics enrolled, compared with 57 last year and 66 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the state's five private law schools also experienced
minority enrollment declines last year, but complete data was not
available this week.

SEX-OFFENDER LIST WITHHELD IN CONNECTICUT AFTER SLAYING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ When Trenton E. Wright Jr. heard that an
11-year-old girl had been slain while delivering newspapers in his
town this month, he immediately asked police for the names of
convicted sex offenders in the area _ a list available to any
resident under Connecticut's ``Megan's Law.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright has a son who delivers papers and a daughter who is 10,
so he was anxious to see whether they should change their routes or
avoid certain blocks.
</P>
<P>
   But he was a few days too late.
</P>
<P>
   The police in Willimantic, the village in northeastern
Connecticut where the papergirl was found dead of head and neck
injuries in woods near her home, refused to show him the list.
Although the police would not say whether the girl, Angelica
Padilla, had been molested, they said that everyone on the list of
sex offenders was now a suspect. The list, available before
Angelica died to anyone who walked into the Police Department, was
now a confidential part of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   From Wright's point of view, a powerful weapon for parents was
suddenly unavailable when it was needed most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember the last murder in Willimantic,'' said
Wright, 44, an administrator at a women's shelter. ``Then you have
it happen to someone down the street, you think: I do need to
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Wright is appealing for help from the Connecticut Freedom
of Information Commission and Attorney General Richard Blumenthal.
``This is an extremely serious personal and community safety
issue,'' Wright wrote in a letter to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Chen, a specialist on sexual-offender notification laws
at the Rutgers University School of Law, said the case was the
first of its kind he had heard of. He added that while he
sympathized with Wright, he thought the battle would be an uphill
one. ``In almost any case, preserving the integrity of an
investigation is going to outweigh the immediate need to know,''
Chen said. ``The police are going to win out.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelica's death on Aug. 13 has turned Willimantic, a town of
15,000, upside down. A boulder in a park near her mother's
apartment has become a shrine heaped with teddy bears, flowers,
poems and children's clothes, with candles burning at all hours.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve days after the girl's death, the Willimantic Police
Department and the Connecticut State Police still have 25 to 30
investigators working on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the investigators have young children themselves,''
said Trooper Richard Alexander, a state police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey lawmakers passed the first sexual-offender
registration and notification law in 1994, naming it for Megan
Kanka, a 7-year-old girl who was raped and strangled by a paroled
child molester in her neighborhood. The idea was a political
blockbuster, and the laws swept the nation, with more than 40
states adopting some version in just three years.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the laws say Wright's plight illustrates their
limitations. One of them, Steven B. Duke, a specialist in criminal
law at Yale University, contends that sexual-offender notification
laws can give parents a false sense of security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to protect your children from sexual predators is to
keep an eye on them,'' Duke said. ``Suppose he got a list of sexual
predators in his town. How would that protect his children from a
sexual predator in the next town?''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's Freedom of Information Commission has scheduled a
hearing on the matter for Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   But by January, the issue may be moot. Connecticut amended its
notification law this year to require the state police to keep a
statewide database and make it available to all on the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A leading proponent of the laws, New Jersey Attorney General
Peter Verniero, said that while he did not want to comment on
Connecticut's version, the laws were conceived with people like
Wright in mind.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Megan's Law' is about information,'' Verniero said. ``It's
premised on the simple notion that parents and communities are
entitled to have information so they make take lawful steps to
protect their families.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Kanka family, Geoffrey S. Berman of Manhattan,
said the Willimantic case shows that parent-teacher associations
and other community groups need to do more to spread the
information available under notification laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents shouldn't wait for a tragedy,'' Berman said. ``If the
parent is vigilant all the time, the law is effective.''

STRUGGLING ADOBE REJECTS BID BY QUARK

 (ATTN: Calif., Colo.)  (Eds.: This story was added to the New York Times business front

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Graphic software publisher Quark Inc. said
Tuesday that it had offered to acquire rival Adobe Systems Inc. at
a premium to Adobe's current stock price, but had been turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Quark, which makes QuarkXPress, an industry rival of Adobe's own
Pagemaker, said it was making the offer public after being rebuffed
by Adobe last week. Quark said that it was disappointed by Adobe's
response and that while it would seek a friendly transaction, it
held out the possibility of a hostile tender offer.
</P>
<P>
   An Adobe spokesman said Tuesday night that ``Adobe has advised
Quark that it is not interested in pursuing discussions'' with
Quark. Adobe, based in San Jose, Calif., has a current market value
of $1.65 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Adobe executives last week, Quark, a privately
held company based in Denver, said that it believed it had the
financial support to complete the transaction. The company said it
would sell off some of Adobe's products in the takeover to dispel
regulatory obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said they were skeptical about Quark's chances of
successfully acquiring the larger public company, which was a
pioneer in the desktop publishing industry. In the mid-1980s, Adobe
successfully developed the Postscript language which began a
standard for the publishing industry and was crucial to the early
success of Apple's Macintosh computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quark is a private company. How are they going to finance
this?'' asked Peter Rogers, a financial analyst at Volpe, Brown
Whelan in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers also noted that hostile takeover bids in high-technology
industries are rarely successful, principally because it is
difficult to insure that engineering talent will not leave in the
face of a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the offer comes at a time when Adobe, which is a dominant
force in the publishing business and which is approximately twice
Quark's size, has been retrenching financially.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Adobe announced a reorganization and layoffs and
said that its third-quarter earnings, which are scheduled to be
announced Friday, would fall below Wall Street expectation.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that it was cutting as much as $50 million to
$60 million in expenses that would lead to a staff reduction of
between 240 and 300 employees and contractors. Adobe also said it
was planning to take a one-time restructuring charge and as a
result income for the quarter could result in a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe has also struggled because of an industry shift away from
the Macintosh, which has traditionally been the foundation of the
company's graphics and publishing-oriented users.
</P>
<P>
   Quark announced its interest in Adobe after the stock market
closed. Earlier, share of Adobe closed up 12.5 cents, at $24.5625,
in trading on the Nasdaq market. Monday, Adobe shares touched a
52-week low of $24.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Adobe, which in 1997 had revenues of $911.9
million and about 2,700 employees, Quark was estimated to have
revenue of about $200 million. The company was founded in 1981 by
its current chairman, Tim Gill. Gill and Quark chief executive F.
Fred Ebrahimi each own 50 percent of the company. The company has
about 550 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe was founded by two computer scientists, John Warnock and
Charles Goeshke. Both men had been researchers at Xerox Corp.'s
Palo Alto Research Center during the 1970s. After working at Xerox,
they started Adobe based on the notion that the personal computer
would revolutionize the publishing industry.
</P>
<P>
   After its initial proposal to Adobe, Ebrahimi wrote a second
letter to Adobe. ``It is our desire to enter into direct friendly
discussions with Adobe,'' the letter said. ``However, because of
the response we have received to our August 18, 1998, letter, we
have decided to publicly disclose our proposal. Although we reserve
the right to proceed with an offer directly to your stockholders,
we strongly prefer to negotiate a transaction supported by the
Adobe Board.''

E.G. MARSHALL, 84, CHARACTER ACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   E.G. Marshall, a character actor who projected the image of a
knowledgeable professional or an elder statesman in plays, films
and television, died on Monday at his home in Bedford, N.Y. He was
84.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, an articulate, witty man with intense eyes and sharp
features, earned prominence in two weekly hourlong television
series that had both artistic merit and wide popularity: ``The
Defenders,'' which ran from 1961 to 1965, and ``The New Doctors,''
from 1969 to 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He won Emmy Awards in 1962 and 1963 for playing the father and
senior partner in the law firm Preston &AMP; Preston in ``The
Defenders,'' providing postgraduate training for his son, played by
Robert Reed, in the intricacies of the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in ``The New Doctors'' series of ``The Bold Ones,'' he
played the heroic chief of a hospital research institute dedicated
to achieving scientific breakthroughs. In later television
specials, his humane persona glowed in portrayals of two
Presidents, Harry S. Truman in ``Collision Course'' (1976) and
Dwight D. Eisenhower in ``Ike'' (1986).
</P>
<P>
   In his film roles, Marshall often found himself in and around
the legal profession. He played an implacable juror in ``12 Angry
Men'' (1957) and a stoic prosecutor in both ``Compulsion'' (1959)
and ``Town Without Pity'' (1961). Other roles ranged from a
restless patriarch in Woody Allen's ``Interiors'' (1978) to a
beleaguered president in ``Superman II'' (1980). His score of films
also included ``The Caine Mutiny'' (1954), ``The Bachelor Party''
(1957) and ``Tora! Tora! Tora!'' (1970). He played Attorney General
John N. Mitchell in Oliver Stone's 1995 movie ``Nixon.'' In 1997,
he was a philanthropist with a young wife in Clint Eastwood's
``Absolute Power.''
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, he appeared in ``The Skin of Our Teeth'' (1942),
``Jacobowsky and the Colonel'' (1944) and ``Red Roses for Me''
(1956). He played two venal brothers, successively, in a 1967-68
revival of ``The Little Foxes.'' He succeeded other actors in
leading roles in ``The Iceman Cometh'' (1946), ``The Crucible''
(1953), ``Plaza Suite'' (1968) and ``The Gin Game'' (1978). In
1980, he starred opposite Irene Worth and Rosemary Murphy in
Ibsen's ``John Gabriel Borkman.'' On occasion he worked Off
Broadway _ for instance, as Father Tim Farley in a 1984 revival of
``Mass Appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall scored a major success as a derelict philosopher in the
Broadway premiere of Samuel Beckett's ``Waiting for Godot'' in
1956. He took issue with detractors of the mystical, eventually
classic play by describing its theme not as pessimistic, but as
positive in affirming that ``no matter what _ atom bombs, hydrogen
bombs, anything _ life goes on: you can kill yourself, but you
can't kill life.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1958 interview, he extolled ``Godot'' as ``a real theater
piece _ not something that has to be molded and hacked to fit in a
theater.'' He continued: ``The theater today is too flaccid, too
passive, too dull. It is good to have it stirred up by a play like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall relished performing in regional theaters, where he
received his professional training and later starred in ``Macbeth''
and ``The Master Builder.'' Away from Broadway, he said in 1977,
``you have so much respect for serious theater; on Broadway they
want jokes and songs and razzmatazz, and a serious actor can die a
terrible death.''
</P>
<P>
   He also praised early television for taking chances and deplored
later trends like police shows and gag-strewn sitcoms. He rejected
offers from producers who wanted him only to portray what he called
``establishment daddies.'' He modestly termed himself a ``utility''
actor who ``fit in easily,'' while his authoritative voice made him
one of the most sought-after narrators on both television and radio
and in commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Though a charter member of the Actors Studio, he denied using
any specific acting method. ``I use anything that helps me,'' he
said in 1978. He added: ``I try to think what the character is
thinking. Then, hopefully, I begin to feel it. I act and react not
because I'm recalling a dog killed by a fire engine, but because
I'm concentrating on what the character is going through.''
</P>
<P>
   E.G. Marshall was born on June 18, 1914, in Owatonna, Minn., to
parents of Norwegian descent. In interviews, he was informative
about every subject except his background, which he considered
private. Published records listed his birth date as June 18, 1910,
but in a 1997 interview with The Associated Press he insisted that
he was born in 1914. His daughter Degen Sayer said last night that
she believed the year was 1914. Writers speculated that his first
name might be Everett, while he whimsically suggested that his
initials might, or might not, stand for ``Edda Gunnar'' or ``Enigma
Gregarious.'' Asked what E.G. stood for, Marshall's son-in-law,
David Sayer, said, ``It will go with him to his grave.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, his nickname was ``Eej.'' His father, Charles
Marshall, worked for a telephone company. He attended Carleton
College and the University of Minnesota and worked briefly for a
Minneapolis-St. Paul radio station. Soon after, he said, he
``joined a touring Shakespearean company in the Deep South and
spent three or four years playing Guildenstern and all the really
terrible parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he acted his way to Broadway, where he began doing
supporting roles for the Federal Theater Project. He honed his
skills mostly in the 500-odd plays he did on major television
anthology series, many of them in live productions.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall is survived by his wife, Judith; two daughters from his
first marriage, Jill Marshall of San Francisco and Degen Sayer of
Rye, N.Y.; two sons, Samuel, of Oxford, Ohio, and Jed, of
Providence, R.I., and a daughter, Sarah, from his second marriage,
and three grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   The actor, a liberal Democrat, savored ``The Defenders'' and
``The New Doctors,'' which tackled risky issues like political
blacklisting and narcotics. ``The Defenders'' included a 1962
episode in which his character defended an abortionist. CBS
broadcast that episode despite protests by viewers and
cancellations by sponsors. ``The Defenders'' deepened his personal
concern about American constitutional liberties. He took a course
in jurisprudence, pressed to add the character of a black judge to
the series, aided documentaries on deprived groups in society and
volunteered to help legal-rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Marshall was eager to bring back ``The Defenders,''
and in 1997 he starred in ``Payback,'' the first of what was
planned to be a series of movies for television. A second new
``Defenders'' was also completed. Once again he was Lawrence
Preston, now the patriarch of two generations of family lawyers,
with Beau Bridges as his son and Martha Plimpton as his
granddaughter. Thirty-six years after Marshall created the role,
Lawrence Preston was still a strong and uncompromising defense
lawyer.  &QL;

NEELY WORKING OUT AMID COMEBACK RUMORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ OK, Bruins fans, time to activate the dream machine.
</P>
<P>
   Cam Neely, forced into retirement two years ago by his aching
knee and hip, is back working out, leading to rumors around
Montreal Tuesday that he is contemplating a comeback with the
Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any conjecture about a comeback would be very premature,''
said Neely's agent, Jay Fee, who spearheads the hockey division at
Woolf &AMP; Associates in Boston. ``He is working out, but those
workouts have been aimed at affording him a better quality of life
on a day-to-day basis, providing him a better range of motion in
his hip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond that, whatever happens, happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Neely, who turned 33 in June, was not available for comment,
said Fee.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Neely began working out again at Sports
Acceleration North, the popular Burlington sweatshop owned and
operated by Mike Boyle, the Bruins' conditioning guru who aided
Neely in repeated comebacks earlier in the '90s. Neely now is
working with an exercise program designed by Dan Dyrek, the noted
Wellesley physical therapist who helped Larry Bird cope with a
cranky back in his later years with the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   According to Boyle, Neely has been helped considerably by the
Dyrek-prescribed program, which includes deep muscle massage,
stretching, and strengthening exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan's been really helpful in terms of helping Cam get relief
that, a year or two ago, he didn't think he'd get,'' said Boyle.
``When he retired, he thought he'd have to live with that pain the
rest of his life. Now, he's dealing with less pain, his gait is
better; Dan's helped him immensely.''
</P>
<P>
   Only minutes after Neely began working out in Burlington, said
Boyle, a number of the NHL players who work out there regularly
asked the former Bruin if he were considering a comeback. Boyle
would not answer that question, saying he preferred not to speak
for Neely.
</P>
<P>
   Question: So why was word circulating around Montreal about a
Neely comeback?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Celine Dion.
</P>
<P>
   The popular French-Canadian singer appeared at the FleetCenter
over the weekend, and according to a Montreal source, she was
presented with a memento from Bruins captain Ray Bourque and Neely
during a news conference Friday night that was broadcast on
Montreal television. Someone in the Dion party went home to
Montreal with the impression, after talking with Neely or Bourque,
that the former Bruins power forward was angling toward a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Fee confirmed that Neely did attend one of Dion's concerts at
the Fleet, but offered no other details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, there is nothing immiment here,'' said Fee. ``You
aren't going to wake up some morning and see Cam skating with the
Bruins. That's not what we're talking about here.''
</P>
<P>
   The official position from his agent is that Neely is just
trying to get his body feeling better. Boyle says much the same,
noting that Neely and his wife are expecting their first child this
fall, and Neely's primary aim is to be able to do all the running
and jumping that dads hope to do when their children are young and
active.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, neither Boyle nor Fee wants to say much. That alone
says something. They see and talk to Neely nearly every day. If he
didn't have even a remote thought of again playing someday, he
would have made that clear and they would have said that on his
behalf. The fact that they're hesitant in declaring a comeback a
non-issue would indicate that Neely at least hasn't dismissed the
possibility. He's feeling better, and he's thinking, if perhaps
only dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   Neely's career came to an expected and somber close Sept. 5,
1996, his hip too sore, his body too torn and tattered for him to
consider even one more shift as the game's one-time premier power
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. (Bert) Zarins and the many fine medical specialists ...
have concluded that my right hip injury,'' said Neely, his voice a
painful jumble of emotion that day at the FleetCenter, ``is a
severe disability that will prevent me from returning to
professional hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Neely is feeling better.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps, he is feeling differently about his future.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ Like a boxer trying to wear out his opponent,
Bob Davie wasn't easily cornered. Bobbing and weaving, he nimbly
maneuvered out of harm's way each time the questions hinted at an
ugly turn, and for the longest time no one seemed able to lay a
glove on him.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Notre Dame's 43-year-old head coach stood for all the pictures
and mugged with a player or two on the school's recent media day.
At one point, he even posed for a shot alongside offensive tackle
Mike Rosenthal, whose testimony helped swing a court case against
Davie and the school.
</P>
<P>
   Distractions? What distractions?
</P>
<P>
   Why, anyone could see that things were looking up. The
``Infighting Irish'' of summer were, in fact, one big happy family
again _ or at least one well-schooled in getting its story
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really followed it,'' quarterback Jarious Jackson
said in dismissing a tumultuous offseason. ``People ask me, but
they know more than I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Jimmy Friday, a senior from Missouri City, echoed the
theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who ask me know more about all that than I do,'' he
insisted. ``As a team, we really don't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Jackson and Friday could remain above the fray. They
weren't directly in the line of fire.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Rosenthal, who played a pivotal role in helping
former Irish assistant Joe Moore prevail in an age-discrimination
suit?
</P>
<P>
   He, too, claimed to be blissfully ignorant of the firestorm that
had engulfed the football program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really never got caught up in that,'' he said. ``I don't
know what was said or what was happening. I didn't read anything or
watch anything about the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his best efforts, Davie wasn't going to get by quite
that easily. Much of the former Texas A&AMP;M defensive coordinator's
summer, after all, had been spent dealing with the Moore trial and
its fallout. Particularly damaging were revelations that he had
openly cited age in dismissing the former assistant (a stunning
gaffe in these litigious times) and at one point had questioned the
mental stability of former boss Lou Holtz.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with his second season in the hot seat fast approaching,
Davie hopes the focus finally will begin to shift from courtrooms
and NCAA investigations to X's and O's.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this football season is over and all the dust settles
people on the outside will say if we're successful that we did a
great job of handling the adversity and distractions of the summer
and overcame that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And if not?
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll say it was a distraction and it lingered on and we
lost focus.''
</P>
<P>
   As fall practice began in anticipation of the Sept. 5 opener
against Michigan, plenty of distractions remained. Not the least of
them was the ongoing sniping from the ever-savvy Holtz, whose book
tour provided no shortage of opportunity to lament that there had
been ``something missing'' his last three years in South Bend _
which just happened to coincide with Davie's tenure on the staff.
</P>
<P>
   So how are relations between Bob and Lou these days?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of those things are personal,'' Davie said, a frown
crossing his face for the first time. ``There's no sense in me
going back and talking about all the things that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about Holtz's assessment that the trial would adversely
affect Notre Dame's image?
</P>
<P>
   ``That was Lou's comment,'' Davie said. ``Lou had reasons to say
what Lou said.''
</P>
<P>
   And
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's fair to this team and this coaching staff
for me to spend a lot of time talking about those situations,''
Davie said.
</P>
<P>
   Others seem more than willing to take up the debate, and many of
those same people who at first viewed Davie as a breath of fresh
air are beginning to take a second, more critical look. As if a 7-6
debut season hadn't been alarming enough, that incredible blunder
in the Moore case raises deeper questions about Davie's competence
to head college football's most lionized and scrutinized program.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to sum up Year One on the job, Davie shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything can really prepare you to be the coach
at Notre Dame,'' he said. ``I think by being here three years as an
assistant, I was pretty well prepared. No one knows what twists and
turns are going to happen, but if you're going to be head coach at
Notre Dame, there are going to be twists and turns.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, he knows, the bloom is off the rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team and this coaching staff,'' he said, ``have a lot to
prove.''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps not much time to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the news in South Bend has been bad. Just this week, in
fact, Notre Dame learned that the NCAA had cleared five players who
had been under investigation for taking gifts from a booster,
including a free trip to a Chicago Bulls basketball game. The
charge could have resulted in each being declared ineligible for
the coming season.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Irish aren't out of the woods quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   The program still faces potential penalties regarding the
activities of booster Kimberly Dunbar, whom the NCAA has deemed a
school representative while a member of the since-disbanded
Quarterback Club. An internal investigation determined that Dunbar
(who has a child with former player Jarvis Edison) gave gifts _
jewelry, clothing and trips _ to 12 current or former players,
including the Chicago trip.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar has troubles of her own: She faces up to 16 years in
prison and a fine of $20,000 after pleading guilty to embezzling
more than $1 million from her former employer, some of which went
to the gifts in question. Her attorney also has hinted that Dunbar
may go public with details of her relationships with those players,
perhaps creating more unpleasant headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Joe Moore affair remains unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   Already awarded $86,000 in damages, Moore (dismissed in December
1996, soon after Davie took over as head coach) has filed a motion
for reinstatement to the staff, along with a request for more than
$600,000 in attorney's fees. The motion also seeks about $375,000
in front pay should reinstatement be denied.
</P>
<P>
   As one storm passes, then, another seems to gather on the
horizon, keeping spin doctors busy under the Golden Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in a situation where the program has fallen apart,''
athletics director Michael Wadsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, at least. Michigan has yet to come to town.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in talent that began in Holtz's final years had
become too glaring to ignore. Speed and playmaking were in short
supply on both sides of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as he led his first Irish team onto the field last
September, Bob Davie assumed everything would work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know there are some problem areas,'' he recalls. ``But you
think because you're the head coach, things are going to be better,
that all the positives are going to undo the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's ego. I just think that's enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, you realize that some problems take time to solve. Now,
I know you take nothing for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Hints that things would not be easy came in the opener, a 17-13
squeaker over Georgia Tech. Losses to Purdue, Michigan State,
Michigan and Stanford dropped the Irish to 1-4.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame won six of its last seven before losing to LSU (a
rematch of an Irish win in Baton Rouge) in the Independence Bowl,
but the merits of the rally are debatable. The run included a
four-point win over Navy and a 23-22 escape at Hawaii, neither
likely to be celebrated in Irish lore.
</P>
<P>
   Jarious Jackson, who takes over from the much-maligned Ron
Powlus, may claim to know little of depositions and court
proceedings, but he has heard the boos at Notre Dame Stadium on
Saturday afternoons and understands the implication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the program is viewed differently because of our
record,'' he said. ``We were 7-6. People are used to 11-1 or 10-2.
We need to put Notre Dame football back where it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be even more difficult than winning lawsuits or fading
the heat of NCAA investigations. Davie talks about a renewed work
ethic, about getting bigger and stronger, but even he concedes a
lack of raw talent on a roster once routinely stocked with the
cream of the high school crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have to recruit speed,'' he says. ``We still have to
get game-breakers. Maybe some of the young kids can provide that.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, Notre Dame may struggle to improve on last's year's
tepid results. With the first five games against Michigan, at
Michigan State, Purdue, Stanford and at Arizona State, another 1-4
start is hardly out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, there already are concerns about how to convince the
next wave of potential difference-makers to come to South Bend.
Davie knows that any recruiting visit in the near future will
involve damage control.
</P>
<P>
   What about Joe Moore?
</P>
<P>
   What about a head coach who can't fire an assistant without
being sued?
</P>
<P>
   What about the NCAA?
</P>
<P>
   What in the name of Knute Rockne is going on over there?
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably won't let them ask,'' Davie says. ``I'll probably
just come out and address it. But I don't think that's going to be
the focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many other things at Notre Dame. Everybody's
going to make mistakes; everybody's going to have their problems.
But I really think our problems are minimal compared to what other
people may have.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempting as it may be to create a siege mentality, Davie says he
regards that strategy as shortsighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could almost paint the picture that it's this team and
this staff against the world,'' he said. ``And you may get some
short-range motivation out of that, but over the long haul I think
that's a negative way of looking at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't be motivated by looking back to last year by how
hard we worked then I think we have the wrong kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps, as some are beginning to suggest the wrong coach?
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame traditionally stands by its man, and Davie has four
years to go on a five-year contract. Even the hapless Gerry Faust
served out his full five-year term before departing with a 30-26-1
record.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the program struggles to restore its once-pristine
image, these are strange times in South Bend. Even now, Rosenthal
remains both adamant and vocal in his support of Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Moore is a great coach,'' he says. ``His actions speak for
themselves. The amount of guys he's coached and the respect they
have for him says it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Davie says he has talked to Rosenthal. The matter, each says, is
settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the personalities involved,'' Davie says. ``I know the
specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   Davie also knows things are different this time around. The
honeymoon is over, and Irish eyes no longer are smiling upon the
new man on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan is coming. Soon enough, Notre Dame will find out if a
painful and embarrassing summer was simply a prelude to the fall.

KENYAN IN-LAWS SAY BOMB SUSPECT LED A QUIET, RELIGIOUS LIFE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALINDI, Kenya _ The main suspect being held in connection with
the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi two weeks ago was
described by relatives in this seaside town as a simple fish
merchant and carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, 34, was also described, by
his wife's family here, as a conservative Muslim who prayed five
times a day without fail and who believed women should cover their
hair and avoid talking to men.
</P>
<P>
   Until his arrest in Karachi, Pakistan, two weeks ago, those who
knew him here say they had no inkling that he might have any
involvement in political groups that hated the United States, his
relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, his in-laws said, had they ever heard him mention Osama bin
Laden, the Saudi millionaire whom American investigators believe
financed and masterminded the twin bombings in Kenya and Tanzania
on Aug. 7 that took more than 250 lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just talked about religious matters,'' said Mariam Seif,
35, the aunt of Odeh's wife, who is a Kenyan. ``He never mentioned
Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very nice, very honest, very religious,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh, who also goes by the surname Howaida, arrived in Kenya in
mid-1994, Ms. Seif said. He said he was a Palestinian, from Jordan,
but never talked much about his family, she added.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1994, he married Ms. Seif's 18-year-old niece, Nassim
Nassor Salim, who goes by the nickname Amina. It was an arranged
marriage, set up by a man who knew Miss Salim's uncle, Hassan Omar
Hassan. Hassan is a Labor Ministry employee in Malindi.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage took place in Hassan's apartment in a working-class
neighborhood, Mawani. The next day, Odeh took his young bride to
the city of Mombasa, where they took up lodgings in a sprawling
slum known as Majengo Kingo'rani.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, Odeh worked as a small-time fish
merchant, Ms. Seif said. He traveled up the coast to Malindi, Witu
and Lamu, buying fish from local fishermen and transporting the
catch back to Mombasa to resell to restaurants, stores and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   He was kind to his in-laws, his wife's family said. He often
traveled with his wife, whose mother still lives in Witu. He would
bring fish and fresh vegetables to Hassan.
</P>
<P>
   He never mentioned where he was educated, though he appeared to
have had an Islamic education, they said. He spoke perfect Arabic,
broken English and a smattering of Kiswahili, his wife's tongue.
</P>
<P>
   When in Malindi, he kept to himself and seldom went out of the
Hassan home unless it was to visit a mosque, they said.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that he abhorred moderate Kenyan Muslims. He
considered smoking and watching videos or television to be sinful.
He often chided his wife's uncle for smoking cigarettes and scolded
the women in the household for not covering their hair and faces.
He never mentioned his home in Jordan, nor did he talk about his
parents, they said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he and his wife had a baby boy, Yasser, and the
financial burden troubled him. In February, Odeh told his relatives
he wanted to move away from Mombasa, where he said he was having
trouble making ends meet in the fish-mongering business.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan gave them a house in Witu and the family moved to the
remote town, north of Mombasa. It is a desolate area near the
border with Somalia where banditry, gun-running and smuggling are
common.
</P>
<P>
   In Witu, Odeh started a carpentry shop, with an eye toward
making the ornately carved Lamu-style furniture that is common in
Kenya. His relatives said, though, that he appeared to know little
or nothing about carpentry.
</P>
<P>
   The family lived in poverty, the relatives said. Their home in
Witu is a mud hut with a thatched roof.
</P>
<P>
   If Odeh traveled out of the country, as one of his passports
indicates, he did not tell Hassan or Ms. Seif. They said they knew
of him making only one trip, to Nairobi, about five months ago. His
arrest in Karachi came as a surprise. ``We are shocked,'' Ms. Seif
said.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh was arrested as he arrived in Pakistan on Aug. 7, the day
of the bombing, when he presented a forged Yemeni passport bearing
the name Abdull Bast Awadah.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani authorities say he confessed to having played a major
role in building the car bomb that devastated the American mission
and destroyed a bank building next door.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 14, he was deported to Kenya, and he has been in custody
in an undisclosed location since then. Sheila Horan, the special
agent in charge, says Odeh has not confessed to American
authorities that he took part in the bombing, nor has he implicated
others.
</P>
<P>
   But the American agents are clearly interested in Odeh's life.
Acting with the American investigators, Kenyan authorities have
detained Odeh's wife, who is now 22, as well as his brother-in-law,
Omar Nassor Salim, an accountant at the National Museum of Kenya
inside Fort Jesus, a 16th century Portuguese fort that is a tourist
attraction in Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents searched Salim's offices and seized some records.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh's mother-in-law and infant son are still living in the
house where he ran his business in Witu, his relatives said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In this Indian Ocean town, where many people say they have Arab
ancestry and the minarets of mosques rise like flowers on the
town's skyline, Odeh did not stick out, his relatives said. Many
young men from the Middle East come to the Kenyan coast to find
brides. Some stay on and join the legions of small businessmen in
the ports like Malindi, Mombasa and Lamu, which have been part of
the Arab trading world for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   For his wife's family, it was easy to accept an offer of
marriage from a man who seemed so industrious, honest and
religious. Miss Salim was also devout in her beliefs, they said, so
it seemed a good match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hassan saw him to be very religious,'' Ms. Seif explained.
``There is no love in these marriages.''

<P>
   DEL RIO, Texas _ Pat Calderon was standing on tiptoe atop his
projection television console, the dark water in his living room so
deep it was licking the bottom of his chin, when his 82-year-old
disabled mother, who was floating nearby on an upholstered love
seat, asked if he would mind fetching her a dry blanket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Mom, look where we are, we're in a flood,''' said
Calderon, a fifth-grade teacher from San Felipe Estates in Del Rio.
``I was holding onto that love seat so it didn't tip over and dump
her in the water. I felt like that Titanic guy.''
</P>
<P>
   For six hours, they were stranded like that, the water slowly
rising and then slowly falling, revealing a jumble of sopping
carpet, furniture, books, videotapes, electronic equipment, all
covered in gunk. One lone candle had bobbed all night long on a
floating end table while lightning flashes revealed the swift
current tearing through what was left of his neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the middle of this stuff and I couldn't believe it
was happening,'' Calderon said.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups of mud-streaked residents picked through what was
left of their soggy belongings in San Felipe Estates Tuesday as
hundreds remained homeless and the town struggled to return to
normal after the disaster that left 10 dead on both sides of the
river and more than 20 still missing. Five others had also died in
flooding farther north in the Texas Hill Country.
</P>
<P>
   The huge swell that put two-thirds of Del Rio under water early
Monday _ some of it, like Calderon's neighborhood, more than 8 feet
under water _ had gushed down the San Felipe Creek and its normally
dry tributaries, into the Rio Grande River and was already halfway
to the Gulf of Mexico by Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   All that was left was a swath of town covered with mud and
debris, collapsed buildings, buckling pavement, chewed-up bridges
and cars scattered everywhere, upside down, on their side, on top
of buildings, on top of one another, like Matchbox cars in an
untidy toy box.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came so quickly,'' said Del Rio City Councilwoman Gloria
Sotelo, who was helping to hand out drinking water at a Red Cross
shelter Tuesday afternoon. ``By the time you crossed the street,
the water was up to your knees. By the time you turned back, it was
up to your shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sotelo, like many of the more than 600 people seeking
shelter in the Del Rio Civic Center because their homes were gone
or uninhabitable, had known some of the six people in town who
officials said had died or the dozen or so who were swept away and
are still missing. ``It's too sad to think about now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the river, in Ciudad Acuna, Mexico, four people had died
in the floods and ten others remained missing, said Mario Neyra, a
Mexican disaster relief official.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sutherland, associate pastor at Grace Community Church,
which had been housing some of the flood victims, came into the
civic center Tuesday afternoon saying, ``We're out of food, can you
help us?'' Some food was found. An off-duty policeman delivered a
truckload of donated drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross doctors worked from folding tables on the civic
center's stage while hundreds of people sprawled on cots and foam
mattresses and children scampered through the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Porras sat on a pillow on a metal folding chair in the
civic center, her one-day-old daughter, Ruby, squalling in her lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband was at work and I started having contractions
around 11 o'clock Sunday night,'' she said. ``It was all of a
sudden the rain came and the kitchen started filling up with water.
The water kept going up and the contractions kept getting worse, so
I finally called an ambulance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Porras had her daughter at 2:14 a.m. while the water was
still rising and, when she returned to the neighborhood the next
morning, found her home flooded. Neighbors said she and the
ambulance had barely beat the deluge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you'd say I was lucky,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cyndi Wright, a Red Cross spokeswoman, said that 635 people had
slept in the center Monday night and at least as many were expected
Tuesday night. Two other shelters had been closed Monday night when
the rising water threatened to swamp them. In Eagle Pass, more than
700 people slept in five shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to have enough food, but water is still at a
premium,'' Ms. Wright said. ``The bigger problem is that there is
no rental housing or any kind of unoccupied housing in Del Rio.
There's no place for these people to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sotelo described the flood's victims as ``mostly poor, about
90 percent of them, and a lot of them without insurance, so I don't
know how we're going to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Rio is a remote town of more than 30,000 in the arid
scrublands along the Rio Grande River some 145 miles west of San
Antonio. Like the rest of Texas, it had been in the midst of the
biggest drought in at least four decades when the remnants of
Tropical Storm Charley dumped more than 17 inches of rain on Sunday
and early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Though there is some ranching nearby, and a few small farms,
most of the town's economy flows from its border crossing, the
factories just south of the border and nearby Laughlin Air Force
Base. ``We're basically a small, working community, and this flood
hit the poorest part of town,'' Ms. Sotelo said. ``The whole county
has come out to help with this, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Local fast food outlets had sent hamburgers, tacos and
sandwiches to the shelters. Churches were collecting old clothes.
The flood had swamped the town's water pumps, and the taps are
expected to stay dry for several more days, forcing people to use
swimming pool water to wash. Dozens of people walked with plastic
buckets down to the still-swollen creek to fill them with muddy
water to flush their toilets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At various spots around the city, lines stretched 20 or 30 deep
of people waiting for handouts of drinking water donated by the Air
Force and by local ranchers with untainted wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got a town that's full of precious people,'' said
Jackie Isenhour, a retired restaurant owner who was also helping
out at the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The swell that hit Del Rio early Monday had passed through Eagle
Pass, the next significant town downriver, by late Monday night.
Unlike Del Rio, Eagle Pass had some warning. Hundreds were
evacuated and, while the water did flood into many city streets,
there were no deaths or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Across the river, in Piedras Negras, one person was killed in
the flooding, Neyra said, and three people were still missing
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Farther downriver, at Laredo, all three international bridge
crossings were ordered closed and the swell is expected to sweep
through town around 1 p.m. Wednesday. Just beyond Laredo is Lake
Falcon, which officials said will swallow up most of the flood
waters and stop it from pushing further downriver toward McAllen or
Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Calderon said his mother, Leonore, was resting comfortably
at a relative's house. She had resisted leaving their house when
the water started rising. ``She was in her wheelchair, grabbing
onto the wall saying she wouldn't go,'' he said. By the time it was
clear that they ought to leave, the water was too high to get away.
</P>
<P>
   ``First I put my other on her bed, then watched the water come
up the bedpost,'' he said. ``Then the mattress started floating.
The water came up to my chest. I had to stand on a chair, and it
came up to my chest again. If that love seat hadn't floated by, I
don't know what I would have done with my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked around the wreckage of his house, mud smeared across
it like peanut butter on a sandwich. The current had picked up his
blue Lincoln, carried it 50 yards up the street and dumped it on
the roof of his brother's auto parts store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we never go through anything like this again,''
Calderon said. ``At least we made it. We're a little stinky, but we
made it.''

LEADING TERRORIST KNOWN AS ABU NIDAL IS HELD IN EGYPT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs grafs 5 and 6 for clarifications; inserts near the end a new
graf beginning `It was not clear ...')  (See also: ATTACK-U.S., ATTACK-SUDAN, ATTACK-NIDAL) 
(sw) 
 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ One of the world's most wanted terrorists, the
Palestinian guerrilla chief, Sabri al-Banna, better known as Abu
Nidal, is being held by the Egyptian authorities in Cairo,
according to an Arab intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Nidal, 61, is accused by Washington of having killed or
injured 900 people in attacks in 20 countries since 1974. He is
wanted in the United States, Great Britain and Italy and was
condemned to death by the Palestine Liberation Organization, from
which he broke in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The story of his capture after years in which he had seemed to
vanish began emerging last week in the Arabic press and was as hard
to pin down as the man himself. The convoluted account is woven of
rumors of double-crosses, mysterious illnesses and murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab intelligence official, who spoke Tuesday on the
condition of anonymity, said Abu Nidal was arrested two months ago
in Egypt but had actually been there for nine months. The official
said Adu Nidal had been cooperating with Egyptian intelligence
agents who wanted to use his information to target terrorist groups
planning bombings and assassinations in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement collapsed, the official said, when Egyptian
agents actually infiltrated the Abu Nidal group and started using
his own op- eratives against Egypt's militant fundamentalist
enemies. When Abu Nidal realized this, the official said, he
stopped cooperating and was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   One report suggested that Abu Nidal operatives killed a chief
planner for the Islamic Group a few weeks ago in Yemen. The Islamic
Group killed 58 tourists in an attack on Luxor, the Egyptian
pyramid site, last November.
</P>
<P>
   The official's account could not be independently confirmed, but
it was supported on some points by a PLO official.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Egyptian officials denied that Abu Nidalwas on
Egyptian territory after two Arabic newspapers asserted he was
under arrest in Egypt. On Tuesday, Egyptian officials reached in
Cairo refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   PLO officials said Egypt would not confirm these reports to
them, but left open the possibility the arrest may have taken
place. Abu Nidal who has accused the group of betraying the
Palestinian cause by negotiating peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The news of his arrest first surfaced last week in London in two
Saudi-owned Arabic dailies. Al Sharq al-Awsat reported that he was
dying of cancer in an Egyptian hospital. Al Hayat asserted on its
front page last week that he had been arrested in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times reported on Tuesday that Abu Nidal had
been arrested by Egyptian authorities as he crossed into Egypt from
Libya.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab intelligence official speculated on Tuesday that
Egyptian intelligence planted the story of his terminal illness in
anticipation of getting rid of him, saying, ``he is bound to
disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Abu Nidal, whose name means ``Father of Struggle,'' is the
founder of the Palestinian opposition Fatah Revolutionary Council,
which has claimed responsibility for lethal attacks around the
world, mostly against Israelis and PLO leaders and partisans, but
also against Jews in Western Europe and moderate Arab states.
</P>
<P>
   The group is one of 12 whose assets were frozen by President
Clinton in 1995 for waging campaigns to undermine the Middle East
peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Abu Nidal group is smaller now than it had been in
the past, it continues to have cells in Lebanon, where it is said
to command several hundred members, as well as in Syria, Libya,
Iraq and several dormant organizations in Europe, according to
intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear where Abu Nidal was staying before traveling to
Egypt or why he would accept an arrangement to provide information
to Egypt, but it is known that he was unwelcome almost everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Sabri al-Banna was born in Jaffa in 1937, and at various points
he operated out of Libya, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria. In the last few
years his whereabouts were unknown. Over the years he is said to
have ordered the killing of 150 of his own operatives on suspicion
of treason, and the elimination of his potential enemies accounts
for his ability to elude authorities around the world for so long.
</P>
<P>
   The PLO condemned Abu Nidal to death in 1974. Over the years,
his death has been reported widely in accounts often spun by the
man himself.

PURDUE CAN'T FIGURE UNTESTED USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ USC feels some uncertainty about its offense
heading into Sunday's game against Purdue, but it's probably
nothing compared to the stress felt by Boilermakers coach Joe
Tiller. With Trojans coach Paul Hackett in his first season, Tiller
has precious little information to prepare for the USC offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we'll try to guess,'' Tiller said Tuesday. ``Coach
Hackett's from the Chiefs, so I guess they'll use some of the
Chiefs' offense. Guessing is really what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe with their stable of running backs they
won't run the football,'' he said. ``Pull the guards, toss to the
tailback, run sweep. But Paul's not that type of offense; he's
going to that infamous West Coast attack, so we'll get ready to
play that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett disagreed, however, with Tiller's characterization that
there was any mystery surrounding his offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be a two-back running team,'' he said. ``That's
no secret.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hackett quickly reverted to Lou Holtz mode after he asked
about the point spread for the Pigskin Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Them or us?'' he said, when informed the spread was 6{ points.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, USC is the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   __ Dual player: Travis Claridge continues to work out at both
tackle and guard during practices. It's meant to give the Trojans
some depth on the offensive line, especially since starting right
tackle Matt Welch has been injury-prone. Welch strained his
shoulder during Tuesday's practice but is expected to be OK for the
game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Pearsall ready: Strong safety Grant Pearsall's knee remains a
concern; it's just not the knee everybody knows about. Pearsall,
who missed last season after having surgery on his left knee, has
been out for the past week with a twisted right knee.
</P>
<P>
   But after putting on a brace, Pearsall returned to practice
Tuesday and proclaimed himself ready to start against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's doing great. No pain at all,'' Pearsall said. ``I'm
anxious. It's been two years since I've played in a game. I'm just
looking forward and leaving my injuries behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Thomas hurt again: Freshman quarterback Jason Thomas limped
off the field during practice, his ankle wrapped in ice, as he
continued to be bothered by the chronic injury.
</P>
<P>
   Although Thomas is not healthy, he must be on call for Sunday's
game, because Hackett said he is the No. 3 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason Thomas is struggling,'' Hackett said. ``(The ankle) has
not responded. It gets fatigued. I would have to suspect we'll use
him in a game only if we have to.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happens if Mike Van Raaphorst and Carson Palmer get
injured against Purdue?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any choice (but to play him),'' Hackett said.

   MANTEO, N.C. _ The Outer Banks of North Carolina, an
elbow-shaped strand of barrier islands that have been battered time
and again by surging swells and withering gales, prepared Tuesday
for its latest assault from the sea, with hundreds of thousands of
residents and tourists evacuating ahead of the anticipated landing
of Hurricane Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m., officials with the National Hurricane Center in Miami
predicted that the center of the category 3 storm, with sustained
winds of 115 mph, would come ashore by midday Wednesday. Using
satellite imaging and computer models, the center forecast that the
eye of the storm was most likely to strike between Wilmington,
N.C., and the southern end of the Outer Banks, near Cape Lookout
National Seashore. Hurricane warnings were in effect from Cape
Romain, S.C., to Chincoteague, Va. High-level air currents could
steer the storm, and its strongest winds, toward the northeast on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lepore, a public affairs officer for the hurricane center,
said that the most intimidating feature of the hurricane was its
breadth, with hurricane force winds extending 145 miles from the
eye and tropical storm force winds stretching 260 miles from the
center. ``It's about four or five times larger than Andrew in area
of extent,'' Lepore said, referring to the 1992 hurricane that
devastated south Florida with winds that reached 145 mph.
</P>
<P>
   After several days of sluggish movement in the waters north of
the Bahamas, Bonnie's momentum more than tripled as it approached
the southeastern coast. The hurricane was moving at 16 mph Tuesday
afternoon, compared with 5 mph on Monday. The hurricane center
warned that storm surges could reach 11 feet above normal tide
levels and that expected rainfall of 5 to 10 inches could cause
heavy flooding.
</P>
<P>
   The governors of both North Carolina and South Carolina declared
mandatory evacuations from coastal counties Tuesday, affecting
about 310,000 people in North Carolina and about 220,000 in South
Carolina. Motorists leaving those areas, many in cars with
surfboards and fishing rods strapped to their roofs, faced creeping
bumper-to-bumper rides for dozens of miles. Shelters opened in some
counties well before the storm approached.
</P>
<P>
   Both governors dusted off their best doomsday rhetoric to try to
persuade coastal residents and visitors to seek safer ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really could be killed,'' said Gov. Jim Hunt of North
Carolina. ``This is not a time to be frolicking on the beach and
tempting fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. David Beasley of South Carolina acknowledged that officials
could not force residents from their homes. But, he said, ``anybody
who does not abide by the mandatory evacuation, our law enforcement
has been instructed to ask them their next of kin.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency management officials said that most residents and
visitors seemed to be heeding the call, influenced perhaps by fresh
memories of the two hurricanes, Fran and Bertha, that blasted the
Wilmington area in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are paying attention,'' said Dorothy Holt, a
spokeswoman for the emergency management office in Dare County,
N.C., which includes most of the Outer Banks. ``In fact, I've heard
quite a bit from folks who in the past may not have evacuated but
who say they are going this time.''
</P>
<P>
   By afternoon on a day of sunny skies and eerily placid seas, the
beaches along the Outer Banks were virtually deserted and
storekeepers were busy nailing sheets of plywood over their
windows. Workers at Seabreeze Florist in Kitty Hawk, just north of
here, adorned their plywood with a lyrical message: ``My Bonnie
lies over the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Red and black hurricane warning flags flew in front of fire
stations and real estate offices. Radio broadcasts buzzed with
announcements of school closings and postponements of PTA meetings
and Lion's Club bingo games. Deejays repeatedly offered
pre-hurricane advice from the Federal Emergency Management Agency:
Cut down dead limbs, drain half of the water from swimming pools,
leave toilet seats up so that pets left in houses will have water
to drink.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Harrison, a 41-year-old tourist from Walkersville, Md.,
who had to cut short her vacation in Nags Head, N.C., near here,
could not hide her disappointment while packing beach chairs and
unopened cases of beer into her truck. ''It's just awful,'' she
said. ``We just got here Sunday. We were crushed when we heard.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, some leathery residents vowed to ride out the storm
despite warnings from authorities. ``I've been through too many of
these to be nervous,'' said David Bragg, a sport-fishing boat
captain who lives in south Nags Head. ``We're having a poker game
tonight. I'm going to try to win some money.''
</P>
<P>
   But the military was taking the approaching storm quite
seriously. About 60 Navy ships at Norfolk, Va., were instructed to
leave port and ride out the storm some 300 miles at sea. And at
Pope Air Force Base, N.C., ``every plane that is flyable is
leaving,'' said Lt. Tisha McGarry, a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In Wilmington, residents could not help but remember the vicious
one-two punch delivered by Bertha and Fran two years ago. Michael
Queen, pastor at First Baptist Church there, said contractors are
still replacing the historic steeple that crumbled in the storm.
``We put up a 40-foot section last Thursday and we've got another
60 feet to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And in Buxton, N.C., residents worried about the potential for
damage to the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, which the National Park
Service has proposed moving inland because of the threat from
encroaching seas. ``The lighthouse itself has withstood the type of
winds we're going to experience,'' said Bob Woody, a park service
spokesman. ``The difference will come with the erosional impact,
and that will depend on what quadrant of the storm it's in.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther out in the Atlantic, meanwhile, Hurricane Danielle moved
toward the U.S. Virgin Islands with 80 mph winds, and forecasters
predicted it could be as strong as Bonnie within days.

   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ A member of the board of the principal
Cuban exile organization in the United States was indicted here
Tuesday with six other men on charges that they conspired to
assassinate Fidel Castro when he was on an official visit to
Venezuela last year.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said Jose Antonio Llama, one of the 28-man inner
circle that runs the organization, the Cuban-American National
Foundation, ``obtained a .50-caliber rifle'' and bought a boat for
his fellow conspirators and others who were not identified. Their
purpose, the document charged, was ``to kill, with malice
aforethought, Fidel Castro at a place outside the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Llama, those indicted were Jose Rodriguez Sosa, Alfredo
Otero, Angel Alfonso Aleman, Angel Hernandez, Juan Bautista Marquez
and Francisco Secundino Cordova. A former officer of the
Cuban-American foundation said most of the men had been affiliated
with the organization at one time or another.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment did not mention the foundation, but the
foundation took the indictment as an attack on itself, denouncing
the charges as a witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   According to the seven-count indictment, the would-be assassins
traveled last October to Isla Margarita, Venezuela, where Castro
was to attend a meeting of Latin American leaders, to scout a
location for the killing and picked a hilltop overlooking the
airport there. That same month, four Cuban exiles were arrested on
a cabin cruiser by the U.S. Coast Guard after one of them said they
were heading to kill Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators discovered that Llama owned the boat,
which had left from a private dock in Coral Gables, Fla., that was
owned by the business partner of another foundation official.
</P>
<P>
   One of the sniper rifles found on the boat was registered to
Jose Francisco Hernandez, president of the Cuban-American National
Foundation. Hernandez was notified late last year that he was a
``target'' of the investigation, a legal term that signifies that
he could face indictment, officials said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a lawyer for Hernandez held a news conference to say
Hernandez expected to be indicted in the case and denounced the
prosecution as a politically motivated attack on the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The group has tax-exempt status and has said since its founding
in 1981 that it espouses strictly peaceful means of effecting
change in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez was not indicted Tuesday. A Justice Department
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity called him ``not a
minor player'' in the affair, adding that he was still under
investigation, along with others in the organization whom the
official did not identify.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, lawyers for foundation leaders predicted that their
clients would be indicted on the relatively minor offense of
infringing the neutrality act, whose ambiguous language makes
obtaining a conviction difficult. But the charges announced Tuesday
were far more serious; they are based on a federal statute that
covers the murder of an ``internationally protected person'' such
as a head of state and carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Llama and Hernandez did not respond to requests for comment made
to the Cuban-American foundation headquarters in Miami on Tuesday.
But the group issued a statement saying its policy was ``that
violence is not the answer to the Cuban crisis'' and ``that is what
distinguishes us from Castro and his ruthless dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement late last week, the foundation maintained that
the Lewinsky scandal may have emboldened ``those in the
administration who look favorably upon the Castro regime'' to try
to ``advance an immoral policy of rapprochement.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Miami last Thursday, lawyers for Lama
and Hernandez echoed that contention. ``It seems to me that the
enemies of the embargo in this country are behind this action,''
said Manuel Vazquez, a lawyer for Llama. ``It seems to me that when
Castro snaps his fingers, our government jumps.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tuesday's indictments capped a series of events that began last
October when the Coast Guard stopped four Cuban exiles on a 46-foot
cabin cruiser for routine questioning in international waters off
Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. When a stash of weapons and ammunition was
found in a hidden compartment, one of the men, Angel Alfonso
Aleman, blurted out ``those weapons are to kill Fidel Castro,''
according to federal documents. ``My sole mission in life is to
kill Fidel Castro,'' he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators soon discovered that Llama owned the boat
and that a high-powered sniper rifle found on board was registered
in Hernandez's name. They also learned that the vessel had left
from the private dock in Coral Gables and that its course had been
set for Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso, leader of the failed expedition, is a former Cuban
political prisoner who works as a salesman at a clothing store in
Union City, N.J., that is owned by the former president of the
Cuban-American National Foundation's local chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was, am and consider myself a revolutionary,'' Alfonso said
in an interview this spring. ``We do whatever we can. The main
thing is to take Castro out, by any means necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Alfonso, Ricardo Pesquera, said he would seek a
change of venue to Miami and challenge the government's decision to
regard Castro as a protected person. Juries in Miami have in the
past proved far more sympathetic to anti-Castro activities than
those elsewhere, and Pesquera made it clear he planned to mount a
defense based at least in part on politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're opening a Pandora's box they're going to regret,'' he
said in a telephone interview, vowing to demand access to every CIA
and FBI document on nearly 40 years of plots, some of them
government-organized, to kill Castro. ``We're going to put their
whole foreign policy on trial.''

IS JOCKEY'S WHIP A USEFUL OR ABUSIVE TOOL? 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been five months since New York State issued its first
rules on the proper use of the riding crop by jockeys, and the
question still remains: to whip or not to whip?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use it, but not abuse it,'' said Jerry Bailey, the
leading rider in the country. ``I don't like to use the stick too
much. You never know how the horse will react. Some of them don't
like it. Some resent it. Some stop running.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to hurt the horse. So, the rules are clear: You
can hit him only on the shoulder and the rump. They're like people.
They have less padding on the shoulder, more on the rump. You
should wait until he extends to full stride, then flick him once to
see how he reacts. But there are no magic spots. It depends
entirely on the horse, and they're all different.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bailey, who is scheduled to ride Grand Slam in the Travers
Stakes Saturday at Saratoga and Skip Away in the Iselin Handicap
Sunday at Monmouth Park, speaks analytically about an issue that
often involves extremes of passion.
</P>
<P>
   And when the New York State Racing and Wagering Board issued its
rules on the proper use of the whip last March, the chairman,
Michael Hoblock, said: ``I think it's going to change the
perception, which often becomes the reality, about the racing
industry's treatment toward horses. Now, you can have something to
judge the offender.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of when the whip is required has one answer for
animal-rights activists: never. But for most trainers, jockeys and
racing officials, there is a critical distinction between ``use''
and ``abuse'' of the riding crop that jockeys carry. And that
distinction came under dramatic scrutiny during this year's Triple
Crown series, when television cameras focused on the horses and
jockeys in stark detail as they dueled down the homestretch.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kentucky Derby in May, a huge crowd of 142,215 at
Churchill Downs and millions more on national television watched
Kent Desormeaux make liberal use of his whip while riding Real
Quiet to victory during a homestretch duel. He did so again while
winning the Preakness at Pimlico and finishing second to Victory
Gallop by a nose at the Belmont Stakes in June. When jockeys see a
chance to win one of the racing classics as they turn for home,
what instinct or technique dictates how often they go to the whip?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll only spank the horse for encouragement,'' Desormeaux
said, ``and only if he shows any response. After a mile or so, any
horse might be too tired to respond. And when he is tiring, if he
is hit, he'll stop. You have to know when your horse won't
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Renowned veterinarian Dr. Alex Harthill of Louisville, Ky.,
said: ``Sure, it hurts a horse. Repeated whipping should be
outlawed. You don't know how a horse will react to the whip. Some
respond by running faster. Some stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Boland, who rode Middleground to victory in the Kentucky
Derby in 1950 and now serves as a paddock and patrol judge at New
York's tracks, thinks back and draws the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I won the Derby, did I use the whip?'' he asked. ``Yes.
Did I use it excessively? No.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule is clear. It says you can't hit a horse on the head
or the flanks or any other part of his body other than the
shoulders or hind quarters. And you can't use the whip if the horse
is clearly out of the race or has reached his best placing in the
race. The rule also bars excessive force _ without defining it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps with that in mind, the jockey colony in New York held a
series of briefings during the spring and summer at Aqueduct and
Belmont on when and where to apply the riding crop.
</P>
<P>
   Every Sunday morning at 11:30, the apprentice riders gathered in
their lounge at Belmont and watched films of the week's races, the
way professional football players do.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of a coach, the young riders were tutored by the
58-year-old custodian of the jockeys' room, who happened to be one
of the great jockeys of racing's past: Braulio Baeza, winner of the
Kentucky Derby in 1963 aboard Chateaugay and a man known for his
dignified, serene manner of sitting on a horse's back in a sport
often marked by physical contact and even violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stewards began the film meeting,'' Baeza said. ``The
riders watch and ask me questions about their technique. I advise
them how to ride. Like when and how to use the whip. It changes
with each rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know I was calm when I rode. I wasn't a stick rider.
Well, only when it was required.''
</P>
<P>
   Other riders were not as restrained. Boland, peering back across
the decades, said: ``We used to have two riders known as `stick
riders,' Ted Atkinson and Steve Brooks. Both used their sticks
repeatedly, almost constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Jockeys tend to develop reputations, the way baseball pitchers
do by throwing brushback pitches. Bailey, past president of the
Jockeys' Guild, is known as a gentlemen rider who rarely touched
the great Cigar. Jorge Chavez, on the other hand, uses his stick so
often that his colleagues call him Chop-Chop. Chavez is scheduled
to ride Raffie's Majesty in the Travers.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast, Corey Nakatani and Chris McCarron are
considered more aggressive with the whip. But in California,
jockeys tend to ride in closer bunches, making it harder for a
horse to break through.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux, in general, is regarded as a somewhat gentler jockey
who often hand-rides his mounts across the finish line. Stevens,
who used his whip relentlessly in last year's Kentucky Derby to
arouse Silver Charm, did not lay a hand on another of his star
mounts, Gentlemen. In the 1997 Derby, both Stevens and the rider of
Captain Bodgit, Alex Solis _ who is replacing the injured Stevens
aboard Victory Gallop in the Travers _ hit their horses at least 30
times each in their stretch battle, and some murmuring was heard.
In a much cheaper race three years ago, a claiming race at Santa
Anita, in fact, Nakatani rode a favorite who did not win, and he
was seen hitting the horse on the neck well past the finish line.
He said the horse was lugging out, and the trainer wanted to work
the horse more after the race. The case became a cause celebre in
Los Angeles. Nakatani was fined $500 and suspended for five days.

 UNDATED: five days.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``In Europe,'' said John Giovanni, a former jockey who now is
executive director of the Jockeys' Guild, ``you can hit a horse
only 10 times. But what happens when you're in the homestretch in
the fury of a race? How do you keep count?
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Stevens once was criticized in Great Britain for hitting
his horse more than 10 times. Gary said: `I ride 1,500 races a
year. I didn't realize I was over the limit. I'm a humane rider.'
And in this year's Kentucky Derby, I saw absolutely no abuse by
Kent Desormeaux. He knows the difference between use and abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in an attempt to clarify the difference that the New York
Racing Board adopted a stricter rule last winter to crack down on
abuses. The rule, based on one in force in California, gave the
stewards clearer ability to fine or suspend jockeys for excessive
whipping.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rule, jockeys are forbidden to hit a horse on the head
or flank and cannot use the whip during the post parade or after a
race, except to control the horse. Also, whipping is penalized if
it causes welts or breaks the skin, and cannot be used when a horse
is ``clearly out of the race or has obtained its maximum placing.''
The rule defines correct use of the whip as showing the horse the
whip before hitting him, using the whip in rhythm with the horse's
stride and using the whip as an aid to keep a horse running
straight.
</P>
<P>
   New York tracks added the stipulation that the whip must be dark
in color and should weigh no more than one pound and not be longer
than 31 inches, with one popper, or flap, to soften the sting and
magnify the sound.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ted Hill, the veterinarian and steward for the Jockey Club,
reported that the stewards briefed the jockeys on the rule in
March. ``They wanted us to define the line between excessive use
and what the public and trainers expected,'' he said. ``It's a thin
line.''
</P>
<P>
   John Joyce, the steward representing the Racing Board, added:
``In June, we fined Julio Pezua $500 for inappropriate use of the
whip. His horse veered wide on the final turn, and Julio tried to
steer him back with the whip, but got him on the side of the head a
few times.''
</P>
<P>
   So, it may be a thin line, but at least it's a line. &QL;

 &HT;    Resident remember Bertha and Fran
 &HT;    By Dawn Bryant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Most Hurricane Bonnie planning meetings
Tuesday didn't end without some mention of hurricanes Bertha and
Fran.
</P>
<P>
   The two storms wreaked havoc on Pitt County in 1996, knocking
out power, flooding streets and scattering debris. As officials
picked up the pieces then, they also picked up some pointers on
improving emergency plans.
</P>
<P>
   With Hurricane Bonnie expected to affect the area today, some of
those techniques are about to get their first test.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Bonnie will christen Pitt County's year-old Emergency
Operations Center, a consolidated communications hub housed in the
basement of the county's Fifth Street administrative building.
</P>
<P>
   During Hurricane Bertha in July 1996 and Hurricane Fran six
weeks later, county workers were scattered, with some in the
Administration Building, the courthouse downtown and in department
offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew what the other was doing,'' Pitt County Emergency
Services Director Bobby Joyner said. ``Now, it's a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The center, which opened in May 1997, houses the 9-1-1 dispatch
center, the emergency management office and a command center
equipped with more than 21 phone outlets and a computer that
receives National Weather Service updates.
</P>
<P>
   Even without that center, the county handled the effects of
Bertha and Fran well, County Manager Tom Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things worked really well. The main thing we needed was a
better facility. We said then that we wanted to have a better
system, better facility in place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt County Memorial Hospital also has moved its command center,
housed two years ago in a transformed waiting room. The new
headquarters will be in a larger room with more equipment, News and
Information Director Tom Fortner said.
</P>
<P>
   Handling hurricanes Bertha and Fran gave hospital personnel
experience, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having had those two very recently is very good preparation
for Bonnie,'' Fortner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenville Public Works Department also got disaster
experience, improving on its response during Fran's aftermath after
cleaning up from Bertha.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bertha was our first real test, and we probably learned a
bit,'' Public Works Director Tom Tysinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials now don't wait to arrange emergency plans or assign
crews to areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another important lesson for city and county leaders was
bookkeeping. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's
record-keeping rules are strict, and if locals want reimbursement
for mileage and manpower, crews must keep detailed information.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenville Utilities Commission reviewed its emergency
strategy Tuesday, reaffirming the tactics that have proven
successful, GUC Director of Electric Systems Roger Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through this before. We've got a good plan,'' he
said. ``We handled Bertha and Fran very well considering those type
of conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, just living through a hurricane is a learning
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who never saw a hurricane before Bertha and Fran ... do
have some experience behind them. They've learned from that,'' said
Greenville Fire-Rescue Chief Raymond Carney, the city's emergency
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk about it, but it's nothing like seeing it.''

 &HT;    Hotels provide safe havens for visitors and local residents
 &HT;    By Bobby Burns
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Even though hurricanes have interrupted three
Outer Banks vacations, Karen Chizmar feels lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland resident found seven hotel rooms in Greenville for
herself, several family members, friends and 11 children.
</P>
<P>
   Staying at the Holiday Inn Express on Moye Boulevard, Chizmar
and her party were among hundreds of tourists who fled Hurricane
Bonnie and found refuge at local hotels. Innkeepers say the exodus
has filled about every room in town at least through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our vacation with our kids so we're making the best of
it,'' said Chizmar, clad in a fluorescent green, one-piece bathing
suit, a white hotel towel wrapped around her waist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having fun at the pool and I've already had my first
margarita.''
</P>
<P>
   Hotel clerks began fielding calls as early as 6 a.m. today from
Nags Head, Atlantic Beach, Wilmington and points between where
Bonnie prompted evacuation calls and at least stalled vacations for
many beach goers. Hurricane warnings were issued Tuesday for the
entire North Carolina coastline.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday afternoon, hotel parking lots began to fill up with
cars and sport utility vehicles, many packed with bags and beach
chairs and topped with surfboards. County officials report that all
1,600 rooms are full. And clerks at the Ramada, Fairfield, Motel 6,
Red Roof and Holiday Inn attributed high occupancy to the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a lot of people checking in from evacuations and
we're having to turn people away,'' said Appie White, front desk
clerk at Red Roof Inn. ``As far as we know, the town of Greenville
has been booked tonight and tomorrow night.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenville is one of the first stops along coastal evacuation
routes. However, it is not immune from the storm's impact. Local
officials are preparing for the worst and say Greenville's guests
could face inland threats such as flooding, torrential rain, power
outages and high winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume they've heard Greenville is a safer place than the
Outer Banks and that's why they all are coming here,'' said Robin
Hardy, front desk supervisor at Holiday Inn Express. ``I hope they
are right.''
</P>
<P>
   Chizmar and her group simply hope the storm will blow back to
sea so they can return to their vacation. This is their fourth trip
to the Outer Banks in 15 years. The first was interrupted by Diana.
Two years ago, Felix sent them packing.
</P>
<P>
   The previous storm taught them lessons, however, such as get off
the beach before everyone else if you don't like traffic and want
to get a hotel room. They drove 70 miles in seven hours in the
evacuation from Felix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel safe here,'' Chizmar said. ``We couldn't stay at the
beach with the kids ... when you have the kids, you need to move
... We were in luck to get this.''

 &HT;    Resident bracing for the worst
 &HT;    By Clejetter Pickett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ With memories of hurricanes Fran and Bertha
still fresh on her mind, Renee Willis of Greenville wasted no time
Tuesday preparing for the arrival of Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting prepared. I think that's the only way to approach
this and hope it will turn toward the sea,'' she said as she
shopped for bread and water at Food Lion on 10th Street. ``After
Fran and Bertha, the reality is that it could very well strike. It
has made this one much more real.''
</P>
<P>
   Memories of Fran and Bertha may also explain why people stood in
line at the Greenville Lowe's store to buy power generators Tuesday
morning. Fran and Bertha, just two months apart in 1996, together
left nearly 40,000 local residents without electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were here to get generators at 7 o'clock,'' Lowe's
employee Robb Burgan said. ``People are going crazy about this
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's, which normally sells between 100 and 150 generators a
year, sold 40 in just an hour Tuesday. Store Manager Ron Bradshaw
ordered 250 more, which he expects to arrive today and also sell
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a lot of people who are coming in and are
purchasing them for people who are on oxygen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But power generators were not the only hot-selling items
Tuesday. Stores couldn't open early enough for people wanting to
buy food, bottled water and building supplies to hurricane-proof
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been crazy,'' said Food Lion Manager Diane Bednarz.
``People were piling in at 6 a.m. this morning wanting to get in
the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Delivery trucks had to make extra rounds to keep up with
customer demands, she said. ``We're putting out twice as much bread
in one round than we normally would,'' said Wonder Bread delivery
man James Long . ``People are buying it as quickly as I'm putting
it on the shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Before 5 p.m. Tuesday, Wal-Mart had sold out of such items as
D-size flashlight batteries, generators, bottled water and bread.
</P>
<P>
   An ``emergency'' truck was scheduled to bring more
hurricane-popular items to the local store late Tuesday or early
today, said Wal-Mart Manager Heather Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think everybody is just being very precautious,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite her efforts to prepare for Hurricane Bonnie, Mary
Peterson still wasn't optimistic that she had done enough Tuesday
afternoon. She has houses both in Pitt County and on the coast and
worried that at least one of them might bear the brunt of Bonnie's
wrath .
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sweating this,'' she said. ``Anyway it goes, I'm in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie, the Atlantic season's first Category 3 hurricane under
the Saffir-Simpson intensity scale, is 300 miles wide and is
expected to cause widespread damage as far inland as Greenville and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason Tony Mills, who was buying plywood to board up
the windows of his new home Tuesday, said he is wondering about his
decision to move here from Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through quite a few (hurricanes), that's why I
moved here. But it looks like we're going to go through one here.''

N.Y. GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE IS EVERYWHERE BUT ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ These days, Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross is
everywhere that a candidate for governor ought to be, from Long
Island to Niagara Falls, with one crucial exception: television.
</P>
<P>
   With just three weeks left until the Democratic primary, Ms.
McCaughey Ross has yet to begin a large-scale advertising campaign,
a lapse that has mystified political analysts and delighted her
opponents. It has also raised serious questions about the
willingness of her financier husband, Wilbur Ross, to spend
millions of dollars on the race.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Ms. McCaughey Ross led her primary opponents
in the polls, and the expectation in political circles _ fed by
some of her supporters _ was that she would try to bury the other
Democrats with a summertime advertising blitz. She and some of her
aides talked of Ross spending $10 million or more on the primary
and the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor has a larger war chest than any of her
rivals _ $2.6 million as of Aug. 15 _ but, even as she has fallen
behind her chief rival, Peter Vallone, in recent polls, her
campaign has been in no hurry to spend that money.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker,
began a major television and radio advertising effort Monday that
will continue through the Sept. 15 primary.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ms. McCaughey Ross expressed annoyance with
questions about when her television advertising might begin and
what her husband might be willing to spend. She refused to answer
and tried repeatedly to change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is anyone in New York state lying awake at
night wondering where my campaign ads are, but they are lying awake
if their children can't read,'' said Ms. McCaughey Ross, who this
week has been promoting her education platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a strategic decision,'' she said, ``and campaign
strategy is something that's kept very close to the vest, and when
I have an announcement to make about television advertising, I will
make it.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions are of more than the usual importance for Ms.
McCaughey Ross, whose primary opponents include Vallone, Brooklyn
District Attorney Charles Hynes and former state Transportation
Commissioner James Larocca.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that she is by far the best known of the Democrats in
the race. But her three opponents all enjoy a generally favorable
reputation among the Democratic voters who know them, while many
more voters rate Ms. McCaughey Ross negatively than positively.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom in politics is that such math would make
it difficult for her to expand her support, and imperative for her
to improve her image well in advance of the primary. In a state the
size of New York, the only effective way to do that, analysts said,
would have been to take to the airwaves early, before any of her
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaign Consultant School 101 says she should have been on
the air a long time ago, and heavily, to define herself before
others do it for her,'' said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the
Marist Institute for Public Opinion at Marist College in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ``Her strategy has left a lot of people
scratching their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lynch, a political consultant who is not involved in this
race but who supports Vallone, said, ``Waiting this long to spend
her money and do advertising doesn't make any sense if she really
wanted to win the primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Strategists for some of her opponents, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that whatever the motivation behind it, they are
pleasantly surprised not to be seeing Ms. McCaughey Ross' face on
their television screens.
</P>
<P>
   One way or another, Ms. McCaughey Ross will be on the November
ballot, because she has the Liberal Party nomination. But if she
loses the Democratic primary, her role on the Liberal line is
likely to be no better than that of a spoiler who will damage the
Democratic nominee by splitting the anti-Pataki vote.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor continues to suffer from the bumps in
her unusual, and relatively brief, sojourn in politics. A
Republican until she switched parties last year, she had never held
public office until Pataki picked her, an obscure academic, as his
running mate four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a year spent as a Democrat attacking the Governor,
she is still mistrusted by many Democrats, who do not quite trust
the sincerity of her conversion. And she is still dogged by her
long-running feud with Pataki and by the complaints of many former
staff members, which have left her with a reputation for flaky and
sometimes abusive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the long procession of fired or bitterly departed
McCaughey Ross aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
Wilbur Ross, the senior managing director of Rothschild Inc. in New
York, was never terribly serious about spending the amount of money
it takes to run a credible, statewide race.
</P>
<P>
   They said that, having gauged that his wife cannot win, he has
chosen to cut his losses, a decision that may have been bolstered
by the recent downturn in the stock market and Ross' financial
disputes with his former wife.
</P>
<P>
   Many political professionals subscribe to that view, though
there are other theories. One is that the lieutenant governor and
Ross naively believed that she could coast to the Democratic
nomination, saving her resources for the general election. Another
is that her campaign is in such disarray, with frequent turnover in
her cast of relatively inexperienced acolytes, that no coherent
strategy has ever been able to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. McCaughey Ross is stumping as hard as ever,
campaigning this week on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley to
talk about schools and health care, meeting with editorial boards,
flying to Buffalo to advocate casino gambling, returning Tuesday
night to New York City, where she spoke in favor of civil rights
for gay people to a gay group.
</P>
<P>
   She continues to hit her long-time favorite themes, that
government should provide better early-childhood education and arm
consumers to do battle with health insurers. ``This election is a
referendum on education and which candidate has shown the most
consistent and effective commitment to public schools,'' she
declared.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last year, Republicans and Democrats alike have
undermined the potency of those issues by co-opting them. State
lawmakers, including Pataki, have expanded prekindergarten
education and taken steps to lower early-grade class sizes _ based,
in part, on reports written by Ms. McCaughey Ross _ and they have
also created an appeals process for patients whose health insurance
companies deny them coverage for some procedures.
</P>
<P>
   And despite her obvious hard work, her campaign, late in the
game, still displays rough edges that have hurt her attempts to
draw attention to her appearances and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, she announced a news conference on the
steps of the State Capitol to lay out her health insurance
proposals. She then changed the location without alerting the
entire Capitol press corps, and then arrived for the event late.
Many reporters, thoroughly confused, gave up trying to find the
event, which received little coverage.

CHARLES DIGGS, 75, CONGRESSMAN CENSURED OVER KICKBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Charles C. Diggs Jr., a founder of the
Congressional Black Caucus whose 26-year career in the House ended
in disgrace when he was convicted and imprisoned for taking
kickbacks from his staff members, died on Monday at the Greater
Southeast Community Hospital here. He was 75 and lived in the
Maryland suburb of Hillcrest Heights.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Douglass, said the cause was a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs, a Democrat from Detroit, was an early and aggressive
congressional advocate for black causes and helped increase
American aid to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1978 he was indicted on charges that, among other things,
he had taken kickbacks from three of his congressional employees.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying on his own behalf, Diggs said the employees had made
their salaries available willingly when he was in ``very dire
financial straits.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury found him guilty of all 29 counts against him in
October 1978, but he was re-elected to his 13th term the next month
while awaiting sentencing. Later that month, he was sentenced to up
to three years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1979, the House voted unanimously to censure Diggs, who
had remained free on appeal, after half an hour of floor discussion
in which no one spoke in his defense. He resigned his seat in June
1980. A month later, he entered the minimum-security prison at
Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama and was released after serving
seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs' fall was in sharp contrast to his rise. He was elected to
Congress in 1954 at the age of 31, a victory that increased the
number of blacks in the House of Representatives to three from two.
</P>
<P>
   There are 39 members of the Congressional Black Caucus now. If
that organization had existed when Diggs arrived in January 1955, a
small room would have been big enough for a meeting of those
eligible for membership _ Diggs and Reps. Adam Clayton Powell Jr.
of Harlem and William Dawson of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Clay, D-Mo., recalled on Tuesday that the number of
blacks in Congress had risen to six by the 1960s and that Diggs had
organized them into the Select Democratic Group to lobby the
Democratic leadership on issues important to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   When Clay entered the House with Shirley Chisholm of Brooklyn
and Louis Stokes of Cleveland in 1969, the black members of
Congress, now numbering nine, converted the group into the caucus
and named Diggs as its first chairman. The black caucus is one of
the most influential such groups in Congress, and its annual dinner
is an almost obligatory drop-in for any politician seeking national
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie led us in the investigations of the Black Panther
killings in Chicago and the killings of the students at Jackson
State,'' Clay said of incidents in 1969 and 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In the Black Panther case, Fred Hampton and Mark Clark, two
leaders of the organization, were shot to death in a police raid on
their Chicago apartment in 1969. Supporters of the Black Panthers
called it murder; the police said they were returning gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs said at the inquiry: ``There are certain obvious
conclusions to a layman. All the projectiles were coming from one
direction _ going in.''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1970 at Jackson State College in Mississippi, two blacks
were killed and seven wounded when police fired into a dormitory
during a protest. The police said sniper fire had preceded the
shootings; blacks at the scene disputed that. Black leaders called
it an ``unprovoked massacre,'' and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation was called in.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clay and Rep. John Conyers Jr., another Democrat from
Detroit, said Diggs had pressed the United States to improve
relations with the developing countries in Africa and to provide
them with assistance.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Clay said, Diggs was a hero to many Africans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went on a trip to Sierra Leone,'' Clay said, ``and the
plane was due to arrive at 8 o'clock at night. We were delayed
until 1 a.m., but there were 10,000 people still there waiting at
the airport to greet us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until Muhammad Ali came along, Diggs was the most popular
American in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Conyers said that Diggs had been heavily criticized for his
many trips to Africa, but he insisted that they paid dividends to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was creating a support system for the United States in
Africa,'' Conyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs' father, also named Charles, was a wealthy real estate
investor and funeral director and served in the Michigan Senate.
Charles Diggs Jr. followed his father into both the funeral
business and the legislature. (Douglass Diggs, also a funeral
director in Detroit, lost in the Democratic primary for that same
seat this year.)
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son, Diggs is survived by his wife, Darlene; another
son, Charles C. III of Wayne, Mich.; four daughters, Denise Diggs
Taylor of Ann Arbor, Mich., Alexis Robinson of New York, Carla
Diggs of Washington and Cindy Diggs, also of Washington, and 13
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs attended the University of Michigan and Fisk University
before being drafted into the Army in 1943. He became a second
lieutenant and spent a year with the famed Tuskegee Airmen in
Alabama but never became a pilot because of poor eyesight, his son
said. He spent the rest of the war as an administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racism in the armed forces during World War II had a great
impact on him,'' Douglass Diggs said today. ``That racism and the
racism in the rest of the country moved him to get involved in
social activism.''
</P>
<P>
   Diggs resigned from the American Legion in 1959, for example, in
a public protest over the legion's refusal to integrate the 40 &AMP; 8,
a subsidiary that called itself a ``fun-making body.'' In 1960, he
joined four other members of Congress in a picket line at the Glen
Echo amusement park in the Maryland suburbs of Washington,
protesting segregation there.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Washington Star in 1972, Diggs said
that as an officer in 1944 he was forced to use the back door _ the
``colored carryout'' _ at an Alabama restaurant that routinely
served German prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the shock of recognition for me,'' Diggs said, ``that
an enemy was more welcome than a black.''

DECLINE IS SEEN IN LEGAL AID FOR MANHATTAN'S INDIGENT DEFENDANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three years after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
administration instituted changes it said would improve legal
services for the poor and save money for taxpayers, a
court-appointed panel has concluded that the quality of legal help
for indigent defendants in Manhattan is actually getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   The report said two factors have combined to overwhelm the
system: a record increase in the number of people arrested in
Manhattan under the city's crackdown on quality-of-life crimes and
a decrease in the Legal Aid Society's budget. The study said
services provided in Manhattan by Legal Aid, the nonprofit group
that handles roughly 60 percent of indigent defendants in the
borough, failed to meet minimum standards for good representation,
and it urged changes in the system.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that Legal Aid lawyers in Manhattan were
overworked, handling an average of 650 cases each in the 1997
fiscal year. Legal Aid lawyers frequently did not show up in court,
the report said, and indigent clients sometimes spent all day
waiting in a courtroom _ or jail cell _ only to have a substitute
Legal Aid lawyer arrive and postpone, or mishandle, the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a 1994 strike by Legal Aid lawyers, the Giuliani
administration set out to break what it called Legal Aid's monopoly
and invited other nonprofit groups to bid for contracts to
represent the city's poor as court-appointed lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, city officials have taken funds away
from Legal Aid and awarded them to a half-dozen new groups that won
contracts to represent about 30 percent of the indigent clients
across the city. The new groups each agreed to represent a set
number of clients, while Legal Aid agreed to handle the rest.
</P>
<P>
   But with a record number of court cases flowing into the system,
Legal Aid has ended up handling the same number of cases it did in
1994 with a budget that is 30 percent smaller. Working conditions
and morale are so poor at Legal Aid, the report said, that many of
its best lawyers are moving to the new nonprofit groups.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Maxian, director of Legal Aid's criminal division, said
the society was still providing quality legal services for the poor
but that the new system would not work without more financing. ``An
infinite number of cases for a finite amount of money is not
working for us,'' she said. ``We and the city need to look at how
we do our contract.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Fishner, Giuliani's criminal justice coordinator,
said the new system was working. The problem, he said, is a lack of
efficiency and a need for better management at Legal Aid. ``We
think the system is functioning very well,'' he said. ``Competition
is a good thing. It will make the Legal Aid Society into a better
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the report, an eight-member committee appointed
by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court, emphasized that
the problems the panel found involved defendants facing misdemeanor
charges and that clients facing more serious charges like murder
were being well represented by Legal Aid lawyers. They also said
that in the Bronx, the other borough studied, Legal Aid was
providing adequate services for all of its clients.
</P>
<P>
   City and court officials noted that the report was advisory and
said the city faced little threat in the short term of being forced
to modify its new system. The most likely source of a
confrontation, they said, would be a class action suit in federal
court by Legal Aid clients contending that the system effectively
deprives them of their right to a court-appointed lawyer, but no
such suit has yet been filed.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that along with its contract with Legal Aid, the
city pays New York Defender Services $4.5 million a year to handle
12,500 cases; the Bronx Defenders, $3.6 million to handle 10,000
cases, and the Center for Appellate Litigation, $1.4 million to
handle 200 appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Legal Aid Society spokeswoman Pat Bath said the group signed a
new contract this summer that commits it to handling all clients
not covered by other nonprofit organizations across the city until
2000. But each year the group renegotiates its budget, which has
shrunk from $79.3 million in fiscal 1994 to $52 million in fiscal
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
Legal Aid officials were divided over whether the society should
limit the number of clients it takes on in order to improve
service. If it set a limit, the society would be relinquishing its
role as the city's primary provider of court-appointed lawyers,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers have long asserted that the new system was an
attempt by Giuliani, a former prosecutor, to eliminate Legal Aid
and weaken the political power of court-appointed lawyers by
dividing them among several nonprofit groups.
</P>
<P>
   But Fishner said the administration's goal was to strengthen
both the system and Legal Aid. He said competitive bidding was
already making Legal Aid a more dynamic organization and praised
the group for management changes it has already made. But he said
the group needed to do more.
</P>
<P>
   Fishner said Legal Aid spends more per case than other nonprofit
groups, a claim that Ms. Maxian of Legal Aid disputed.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Eppler, the lawyer who headed the court-appointed
committee, declined to comment on the bulk of the report but said a
permanent staff should be set up to monitor the new system. ``It's
important that we keep our eye on the ultimate goal,'' he said,
``which is that every defendant not just have some minimal
representation, but quality, professional representation.''

OLD BANKS ARE NEW THEATERS, FILLING BILL FOR OFFBEAT SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's probably safe to assume that the builders of the
old American Savings Bank near Union Square never imagined this
scene: performers tethered to wires and pulleys dip and soar above
a standing audience. Balloons cascade from the 40-foot ceiling,
followed by soaking blasts of water and a shroud of fog. One
performer loses his pants and zooms bare-bottomed into the crowd,
joining his colleagues, who are clad but drenched. Later the
spectators get into the groove, dancing furiously in this theater
with no seats.
</P>
<P>
   This mad scene is ``Villa Villa,'' one of the summer's biggest
off-Broadway hits. Its producers have found what they consider a
perfect home in a building designed not for the wild and surreal
performance of an Argentine troupe known as De la Guarda, but one
intended to convey to bank depositors in the early 1900's a sense
of sober security.
</P>
<P>
   The building, now known as the Daryl Roth Theater, is one of a
growing number of unconventional spaces that are providing homes
for New York theater companies. The phenomenon reflects both the
offbeat demands of particular shows, like Villa Villa (pronounced
VEE-zha VEE-zha), which capitalized on the bank building's vaulted
ceiling and open floor, and a soaring demand for theater space both
off- and off-off-Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Off-Broadway is thriving,'' said Maria Di Dia, vice president
of the League of Off Broadway Theaters and Producers Inc. ``There
is almost the same number of off-Broadway productions as
on-Broadway productions. People are looking at new and interesting
places for space. Necessity is the mother of invention. As soon as
one show closes, there's someone else banging on a theater's door
trying to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Many producers have to wait before they can open a production
for lack of space. ``It happens a lot,'' said Daryl Roth, a
producer of ``Villa Villa'' and the owner of the former bank
building. ``You'll have a play ready to go and no place to put it
in. You lose momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Theaters have historically cropped up in odd corners of the
city, from the parlor floor of a brownstone (Provincetown
Playhouse) to the basement of a supermarket (Roundabout Theater).
New York's first historically significant theater to take up
residence in an unconventional place was the Castle Garden, which
had been a fortress near the Battery until the early 1800s, said
theater historian Mary Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   This recycling of buildings is especially pronounced in New
York, where space is limited and the cost of erecting a new
building is prohibitive, she said. Perhaps the most popular
unconventional spaces are churches, which have been converted into
theaters since the mid- to late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the banking industry contracting and the theater
industry booming, it makes sense that the Daryl Roth Theater would
inhabit the former American Savings Bank building and that Second
Stage Theater is preparing to do the same in an old Manufacturers
Hanover Trust building near Times Square, at 43rd Street and Eighth
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at storage houses, porn parlors, schools, libraries,
old recording studios, old video recording studios, churches, an
old Fedex office and the space under St. John the Divine,'' said
Carole Rothman, artistic director for Second Stage. ``Bank mergers
have made bank space available.''
</P>
<P>
   Theater companies covet old banks because they often have no
columns obstructing the floor space and have soaring ceilings. High
ceilings allow fly space (generous space from which to drop
scenery) and space to install balconies. They also offer better
acoustics, with the right sound designers.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Roth said she had spent two years looking at movie
theaters, a senior center and a church before finding the empty
bank at Union Square East and 15th Street. She paid $3 million for
the building, whose interior measures 50 feet by 100 feet and will
hold about 380 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Second Stage's new home in the old Manufacturers Hanover Trust
building is 17,000 square feet, including rehearsal space. Rem
Koolhaas, a Dutch architect who is overseeing the redesign of
Universal City in Los Angeles, and Richard Gluckman of Gluckman
Mayner Architects, a firm based in New York that did the Whitney
Museum expansion, have been hired to transform the space, which is
expected to open Feb. 22, after $6 million in renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rothman said the new theater would offer more artistic
flexibility to Second Stage, a nonprofit troupe that has performed
since 1979 in relatively cramped quarters on 76th Street and
Broadway, in what was once the gymnasium of a monastery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a larger space,'' she observed. ``We can do musicals if
we want. Because the ceilings are so high, we have fly space. We
can get more people up on stage. The theater uptown is more suited
to solo performances.'' That theater, which can seat 108 people,
will continue running, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another theater in the making is the old Biofitness Center, a
shuttered health club at 121 E. 24th St. Blue Heron Theater is
reconfiguring the 10,000-square-foot space, which itself had been
converted from a furniture store, into a performing arts center. It
will have two small theaters (with 135 and 60 seats), a rehearsal
space, a backstage office and an art gallery, said Gary Bernstein,
managing director of Blue Heron.
</P>
<P>
   ``How nice it will be to have our own space, and a permanent
home,'' said Bernstein, whose nonprofit company has had to rent
space from other companies for the last 10 years. ``Literally, at
times, we've gotten the last theater available,'' he said. ``It's
like finding the last jacket on the rack, even if it isn't the
right size.''
</P>
<P>
   The former health club has 19-foot ceilings and columns that are
spaced 23 feet apart. ``We would have preferred no columns,'' said
Adelle Striker, Blue Heron's artistic director. The company signed
a 10-year lease, and is expected to spend $300,000 to $400,000 to
remodel.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway theaters that
are settling into odd venues. ``Cabaret,'' the hit Broadway
musical, opened in a former disco in Time Square, Club Expo, in
February 1998. The theater, known as the Kit Kat Klub, is not set
up like other theaters. Small nightclub tables fill the room. Some
nights, after ``Cabaret'' closes, the place again turns into a
dance club or real cabaret.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Westside Theater Company's officers thought they had struck
gold last summer when they found the Hotel Riverview, at Jane
Street and the West Side Highway, where survivors of the Titanic
once took refuge. The hotel's old ballroom, they thought, would be
perfect for a new theater and a new production, ``Hedwig and the
Angry Inch.''
</P>
<P>
   But first seats had to be put in, the stage had to be raised and
extended, and the bar had to be scaled back.
</P>
<P>
   The new Jane Street Theater, as it was called, was designed
especially for ``Hedwig and the Angry Inch,'' a play about an East
German drag queen that became a cult hit and won an Outer Critics
Circle award for best off-Broadway musical.
</P>
<P>
   It took just two months to turn the former ballroom into a
250-seat theater. Eric Osbun, operations manager of the Jane Street
Theater, declined to say how much it cost to transform the space,
though the slightly tattered feel to the room was intentional.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Trask, an actor and the musical's composer and lyricist,
said that performing in what he called ``a derelict hotel and an
inexpensive tourist hotel'' lent character and authenticity to the
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the toilets in bathrooms above us overflow and the
ceiling leaks, people think that's part of the show,'' he said.
``We just bring up buckets and people assume there's a leak every
night. Sometimes pieces of ceiling fall on us _ just plaster,
nothing serious. It's perfectly believable that Hedwig stays there.
It's like the audience has entered another reality.''

HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS FLEE CAROLINA COAST AS BONNIE APPROACHES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TONY FREEMANTLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC BEACH, N.C. _ Residents and tourists along the Carolina
coast evacuated by the hundreds of thousands Tuesday as Hurricane
Bonnie, a potentially dangerous storm with winds of 115 mph,
churned toward the Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Mandatory evacuation orders were issued early Tuesday for more
than 250,000 residents in at least eight North Carolina coastal
counties, and the governors of both North Carolina and Virginia
declared states of emergency as the storm approached an expected
landfall Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   About 200,000 people were told to vacate coastal counties in
northern South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who does not abide by the mandatory evacuation, our
law enforcement has been instructed to ask them their next of
kin,'' South Carolina Gov. David Beasley told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predicted Bonnie, a large storm, would make landfall
in the vicinity of Beaufort near Cape Lookout around midday.
Hurricane warnings were issued for a lengthy stretch of coast from
South Carolina through Virginia. Beaufort is about 100 miles up the
coast from Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness approached Tuesday the storm was located 250 miles
south of Cape Lookout and was moving erratically to the northwest
at 16 mph. A day earlier, the storm's path had been so slow that
forecasters speculated that it might not move to landfall. But by
late Tuesday it began moving rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   On the coast, news of its size and newfound speed triggered a
steady stream of traffic headed inland.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for several of the threatened counties said many
people, still mindful of Hurricane Fran's landfall near here in
September 1996, heeded the call to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This storm has been out there for a while and we think that
also has had something to do with the fact that so many people have
evacuated,`` said Mike Addertion, emergency management coordinator
for Carteret County. ``Also, I think a lot of people remember
Fran.''
</P>
<P>
   Fran, with similar winds and carrying heavy rain, ripped through
the state and into Virginia, killing 17 as it smashed homes and
swamped lowland areas. Fran brought a 12- foot storm surge, and
officials warned Tuesday that Bonnie could pack an equally strong
surge. High tide occurs at about 11 a.m., and could exacerbate the
effect of the surge.
</P>
<P>
   On Atlantic Beach late Tuesday heavy surf pounded under a stiff
breeze, and light rain fell on mostly deserted and dark streets,
evidence that many had heeded the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   But Barbara Moulthrop, newly divorced and new in town, was one
of those who had elected to stay. Moulthrop, an assistant librarian
at a local elementary school, said she had moved to Atlantic Beach
in Carteret County only last Wednesday from Raleigh because she
``needed a new atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm petrified,'' she said. ``But I made the move here and I'm
not going to run from it. If the Lord wants me to go, he will come
and get me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents were still deciding whether to leave as darkness
fell. Dave Whitehead, a construction worker who had spent most of
the day fixing plywood to windows, was one of those.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't made up my mind yet,'' he said. ``I got a scared
little girl in there and so I might still get out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Addertion said that up to 95 percent of the people in seaside
and low areas of Carteret County, located in the projected path of
the storm, had evacuated as of 6 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Havelock, 20 miles inland in Pamlico County, several business
had taped and boarded their windows.
</P>
<P>
   On Ocracoke Island to the north, ferry operator Barry Austin
said he had been shuttling people off Cape Hatteras all day Tuesday
and that by sundown, all those who wanted off had gotten off.
Having lived his 55 years on the Outer Banks and after sitting out
other hurricanes, Austin himself had no plans to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``No sir, I'm not going anywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Austin said the eight or nine ferries that run between Cape
Hatteras and Ocracoke Island started moving at 5 a.m. Tuesday and
did not stop until 12 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we got everything closed up, and we're waiting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. declared a statewide
emergency in the early afternoon. The Federal Emergency Management
Agency and the North Carolina National Guard were mobilized and
waiting in staging areas, said Sgt. Jeff Winstead of the State
Highway Patrol who was manning a telephone at the state Emergency
Management Service in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation of the coastal counties and other low lying areas
had proceeded smoothly, Winstead said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far at least, people are taking this storm seriously,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Beasley of South Carolina also sought evacuation of low
areas and Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore declared a state of emergency,
authorizing communities to order evacuations if they chose. Navy
ships at Norfolk, Va., left port during the day to ride out the
storm at sea.
</P>
<P>
   At Pope Air Force Base, N.C., ``every plane that is flyable is
leaving,'' Lt. Tisha McGarry told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, forecasters are watching another Atlantic storm,
Hurricane Danielle, building near the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Forecasters said that storm could develop into another Bonnie
within days.

GRAF LOOKS JUST LIKE OLD SELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Steffi Graf has become almost as renowned for
her injuries and family misfortunes over the last two years as for
the accomplishments that have made her one of women's tennis
greatest players.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, playing in her ninth tournament of the year,
Graf, winner of 21 Grand Slam events, found herself matched against
Henrieta Nagyova _ a far lesser-known player who is ranked 14
notches above Graf _ in the second round of the Pilot Pen
International.
</P>
<P>
   But the ranking, which has the 19-year-old Nagyova 24th and Graf
38th, is misleading since the 29-year-old Graf has played sparingly
since coming back after knee surgery. And this year the once nearly
invincible Graf's best finishes have been as the runner-up in three
events.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night, Graf showed flashes of the form that enabled
her to be ranked No. 1 for a record 186 weeks between 1987 and 1991
as she crushed Nagyova, 6-1, 6-3, in 62 minutes before a crowd of
about 5,000 in the 15,000-seat Connecticut Tennis Center stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The victory by Graf, who returned in mid-February after being
sidelined for eight months, put her in the quarterfinals of this
28-player tournament. Her opponent on Thursday will be the winner
of Wednesday's match between seventh-seeded Amanda Coetzer, who
beat Graf three times last year, and 17-year-old Anna Kournikova of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely fine; there are no problems,'' Graf said after
overpowering and outsteadying the Slovakian teen-ager, whom she had
beaten, 6-0, 6-4, at Wimbledon in June in their only previous
meeting. ``I served reasonably well and did not make many
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagyova, by contrast, made many. Perhaps the most egregious was
enabling Graf to hit repeated inside-out forehand shots for
outright winners from the advantage court. Nagyova also had no
offensive weapon to hurt Graf, who kept her pinned to the baseline
most of the match with deep, penetrating ground strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, who never lost her service, moved well throughout and
later said that she had fully recovered from her knee injury but
still had a way to go to regain peak form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got the shots and I've got the strength,'' said Graf, who
is seeded eighth for the U.S. Open, which starts Monday and which
she has won five times. ``I just need the confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Her old match toughness was also still lacking, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``During practice I do all the right things, but then don't them
all during a match,'' said Graf who, before her knee injury, was
bedeviled by back, foot and hamstring problems. ``I really haven't
been very fit or played much now for the last year and a half.''

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A last-minute objection to the Texas tobacco
settlement sent lawyers scrambling like jet fighters chasing Iraqi
missiles to intercept who was behind the latest assault on the
multibillion-dollar deal.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing late Monday, lawyer Kenneth J. Chesebro gave notice
to the U.S. District Court in Texarkana, where Texas filed its
tobacco lawsuit, that he would appeal the settlement to the 5th
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. Chesebro contended in the filing
that a provision of the settlement illegally prohibited citizens of
Texas or people doing business in the state ``acting completely
independent of any party'' from challenging the tobacco settlement
in any court other than the one in Texarkana.
</P>
<P>
   Chesebro said Tuesday that he filed the notice of appeal for
himself and by himself, but he would not answer other questions
because he did not want publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is filed with me as the appellant,'' he said. ``I'm doing
this on my own behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   The special assistant attorney general in charge of the tobacco
litigation, Harry Potter, called Chesebro's challenge a ``very
strange set of events.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell where he's coming from,'' Potter said.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of Chesebro's challenge is to continue a delay in
transferring $335 million to Texas from the court registry that was
set to occur after the tobacco settlement became final at 5 p.m.
Monday. Chesebro's challenge was filed shortly before then.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco settlement _ at $17.3 billion, the largest civil
judgment in U.S. history _ has been challenged on so many issues so
many times by so many lawyers that the signature sheets to approve
changes ate a fair share of paper by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco lawsuit was filed by Texas in 1996 and settled in
January. It then was challenged on various issues by Republican
attorney general candidate John Cornyn; Sen. Troy Fraser,
R-Horseshoe Bay, and six other legislators; and by Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   All their objections challenged the prospect that private
lawyers Attorney General Dan Morales hired to try the suit might
collect more than $2 billion, based on the judge's 15 percent
award. That award reflected Morales' 15 percent contingency fee
contract with them, a contract under which they would collect only
if the state won the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Chesebro has been associated with Harvard law professor Laurence
Tribe, who assisted Texas in resisting challenges to the tobacco
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Tribe's litigation assistant, Jeff Jamison, said Chesebro still
works with Tribe on at least one active case.
</P>
<P>
   Chesebro, licensed in Texas to practice law since 1987, is a
Harvard law graduate. On his filing he listed an Austin address.
Records from Massachusetts show he owns a condominium in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Potter said Chesebro requested a copy of the tobacco settlement
from the attorney general's office Feb. 3. The language in the
settlement under the latest challenge duplicated language from the
original settlement reached in January. Chesebro's challenge, then,
was too late, Potter said, because it should have been filed when
he had first notice of it.
</P>
<P>
   Chesebro said the settlement did not become final for the
purpose of an appeal until July 24 and his notice was filed within
time limits.
</P>
<P>
   Potter also said Chesebro lacked standing to challenge the
settlement in part because he was a Massachusetts resident with
little contact with Texas. In his filing, Chesebro noted that he
could sue in the case because of the sweeping injunction against
challenges in state courts and federal courts other than where the
suit and settlement were filed.
</P>
<P>
   Challenges to a federal judge's authority to restrict lawsuits
in any other court, similar to Chesebro's in the Texas tobacco
case, were argued in an asbestos-recovery class action decided by
the U.S. Supreme Court in 1997. Chesebro's associate, Tribe, led
the unsuccessful challenge there.
</P>
<P>
   Chesebro himself argued a similar position as a ``friend of the
court'' in a class action against Agent Orange manufacturers,
decided in 1993. In that case, he was on Morales' side, along with
20 other states.
</P>
<P>
   Chesebro, Tribe and another attorney who has assisted Texas in
the tobacco litigation, Jonathan Massey, were sued by a lawyer in a
New Jersey case who challenged their fees for an appeal of the case
the other lawyer tried. They counterclaimed for sanctions, arguing
his claim was baseless. In 1994, a federal court in New Jersey
sided with Chesebro, Tribe and Massey and referred the other lawyer
for disciplinary proceedings and criminal investigation.

TO REDSHIRT OR NOT TO REDSHIRT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The decision to redshirt is rarely easy and often
agonizing. It is more difficult if you're an upperclassmen. It is
especially difficult if your name is Gabe Crecion and your athletic
future hangs in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of long nights thinking about it,'' said
Crecion, UCLA's junior tight end. ``It wasn't easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Crecion, a Chaminade High grad, discussed the situation with
Bruins coach Bob Toledo in the offseason and realized redshirting
in '98 would create the chance to start in the 1999 and 2000
seasons. The players ahead of him on the depth chart (Mike Grieb
and Ryan Neufeld) are seniors, and Crecion would retain two years
of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   But Crecion wasn't finished shaping his future. He also decided
to quit baseball after pitching for the Bruins for two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football didn't use to be my first love, but now it is,'' he
said. ``I've been doing both for two years and it hasn't given me
an advantage in either. In football, I'm not as strong, because I
don't lift weights for baseball. And then when I go to baseball, my
arm isn't in shape because I've been playing football.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said Crecion (eight career catches) will play if either
Grieb or Neufeld is injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tell the guys, `You aren't redshirting until after
the last game,' '' Toledo said. ``It's possible (Crecion) will end
up playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Crecion's decision means talented freshman Bryan Fletcher
becomes the No. 3 tight end, with junior college transfer Randy
Hakes the fourth-stringer.
</P>
<P>
   __ Movin' up, movin' down: The Bruins, who begin full-contact
work this morning, released an updated depth chart Tuesday. It
included some notable changes as the heralded freshman class begins
to make its presence felt.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Blake Worley is the second-string left tackle, behind
Kris Farris.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Mike Saffer is dueling Ed Anderson for the No. 2 right
guard spot, behind Andy Meyers.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Ken Kocher has passed Steve Sua and is challenging
starting Micah Webb for the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth-year senior Jayson Brown has passed Josh Webb as the
second-string defensive end, behind Kenyon Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Converted quarterback Ed Stansbury is the No. 2 outside
linebacker, behind Brendan Ayanbadejo. (Stansbury was recruited as
a linebacker by numerous schools, Nebraska among them, but chose
the Bruins because they let him try quarterback.)
</P>
<P>
   Converted safety Ryan Nece is the No. 2 inside linebacker,
behind Ramogi Huma. Freshman Robert Thomas trails Nece.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Whitfield is the No. 1 free safety _ Shaun Williams' former
position _ with Tod McBride and Jason Stephens competing for the
second-string spot.
</P>
<P>
   And Jermaine Lewis remains the starting tailback, ahead of Keith
Brown and freshman DeShaun Foster, who has missed several workouts
with a strained groin.

IN REGGIE LEWIS DEATH SUIT, DEFENSE LOOKS FOR DRUG USE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH AND STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lawyers and investigators defending the four Boston
doctors sued by the widow of Reggie Lewis are focusing on possible
drug use by the former Boston Celtic star as a contributing factor
in his heart attack in &UR;  &LR; 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A former acquaintance of Lewis has testified in a deposition
that he used cocaine with Lewis on two occasions while they were
enrolled at Northeastern University in the mid-1980s, according to
sources familiar with the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the acquaintance, who in the deposition acknowledged
selling cocaine, heroin, and other drugs on the Northeastern
campus, testified that he gave Lewis cocaine free of charge 15-20
times and saw Lewis at several parties where cocaine was being
used, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the damage to Lewis's reputation, the allegations about
drug use are significant because they raise the possibility that he
lied about previous use of drugs during the application process for
an insurance policy taken out by the Celtics when he signed his
$16.5 million contract in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The lead attorney representing the widow, Donna Harris-Lewis,
the executor of Lewis's estate, declined to discuss any allegations
and said that the case ultimately will be decided on the doctors'
diagnosis and treatment of Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that the doctors recklessly misdiagnosed Reggie
Lewis and he relied on their misdiagnosis and died,'' said Robert
G. Harley of the New York firm Harley and Browne.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. &UR;  &LR; and three other cardiac
specialists at Brigham and Women's Hospital have sought court
approval to depose Derrick Lewis, a friend and teammate of Reggie
Lewis when they were at Northeastern.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1995, Derrick Lewis told The Globe that he had used
cocaine with Reggie Lewis five or six times between 1985 and 1993.
Derrick Lewis made similar statements to the Wall Street Journal
but later recanted them.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations that Lewis had used cocaine surfaced soon after his
death but they were sharply denied by Harris-Lewis. Except for
Derrick Lewis, none of his former friends and teammates ever had
corroborated the allegations _ until the deposition of the
Northeastern acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   However, at least two others who have been deposed have also
testified about Lewis's alleged drug use. One, a former employee of
the Celtics' front office, told the lawyers that he was present
when Lewis used marijuana on several occasions in 1988, 1989, and
1990.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Irwin Cohen, former Northeastern athletic director,
testified that he had been told by the school's team physician that
Lewis had tested positive for cocaine in March 1987 when the team
was screened for the NCAA tournament. However, Dr. Job E. Fuchs,
the now-retired team physician, told the lawyers that he could not
recall whether Lewis had flunked the test for cocaine, but said he
trusted Cohen to have an accurate memory of the conversation. He
testified that Lewis passed a second, later test for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony has been given over the past several months in
depositions taken by Mudge's lawyers, William J. Dailey Jr. and
John P. Ryan, of the Boston firm Sloane and Walsh. Harley and
Bridget Asaro, lawyers for Harris-Lewis, also attended the sessions
and questioned the witnesses about their recollections. Lewis's
widow has also attended most of the sessions, including those of
the former Northeastern acquaintance and the former Celtics
employee.
</P>
<P>
   Following Lewis's death, the Massachusetts Medical Examiner's
office conducted an autopsy and found that his heart was severely
scarred, a condition they attributed to an ``adenovirus 2,'' a
simple virus spread by coughing and sneezing. In addition, they
found damage to the aorta and his heart's mitral valve.
</P>
<P>
   Other cardiologists have been quoted anonymously as saying that
similar scarring of the heart can be caused by cocaine use.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Mudge and Donna Harris-Lewis have questioned about
30 people in private depositions in the case, which is scheduled
for trial next spring. But Harris-Lewis's lawyers are concentrating
on whether Mudge and the cardiologists provided adequate treatment
to Lewis during the three months he was in their care.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge drew fire following Lewis's death in late July 1993 for
having diagnosed a far less serious heart condition than diagnosed
earlier by a team of cardiologists and other specialists, who were
drawn from hospitals across the city. Mudge said at the time he
believed Lewis suffered from a fainting condition and, with further
monitoring, could return to playing basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The other doctors, who were later nicknamed the Dream Team,
examined Lewis for three days at the New England Baptist Hospital
following his collapse during a Celtics' playoff game in April
1993, and diagnosed Lewis as suffering from cardiomyopathy, a
potentially life-threatening condition that would have ended his
basketball career.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Mudge's lawyers are focusing on the Lewises'
decision to transfer Reggie Lewis from the Baptist to the Brigham,
the sources said. They are trying to determine if one of the
reasons for the move may have been to avoid a drug test at the
Baptist. Donna Harris-Lewis has denied in interviews that the
doctors at the Baptist ever asked that a drug test be taken. No
such test was taken at the Brigham.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Reggie Lewis died, Harris-Lewis issued a statement
supporting Mudge and his efforts. However, in May 1996,
Harris-Lewis filed a malpractice suit against Mudge and his
associates, Drs. Peter L. Friedman, Mark A. Creager, and John D.
Rutherford, claiming their treatment of her husband was ``rendered
carelessly, unskillfully, and negligently.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mudge had said publicly that he believed that Lewis, under
medical supervision, could play basketball again, the Globe was
told in 1993 that the cardiologist in fact had given Lewis far more
cautious advice about his condition in private conversations. What
was said in those conversations and whether Lewis followed Mudge's
advice are issues also being explored in the lawsuit, sources
familiar with the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was 27 when he collapsed while working out at Brandeis
University, the practice facility used by the Celtics, with Chris
Havlicek, the son of Celtics star John Havlicek, and others. Three
months before, on April 29, 1993, he had collapsed while playing
for the Celtics in a game at Boston Garden, and the next day had
entered New England Baptist Hospital for tests.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of drug use by Lewis surfaced following his death, but
the issue erupted in March 1995, when the Wall Street Journal
quoted two cardiologists, not connected with the case, as saying
that such scarring was consistent with cocaine use. That report
prompted the state Medical Examiner's office to conduct a new
examination of Lewis's heart tissue.
</P>
<P>
   That month-long reinvestigation, conducted by eight independent
medical consultants, found no evidence that the scarring on Lewis's
heart was caused by cocaine use. Instead, the investigation
confirmed the original findings of the autopsy: that the scarring
likely was caused by the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern University also conducted an investigation in 1995
to determine if Lewis might have used cocaine or other illicit
drugs while at the school. That probe was ordered by Northeastern
President John A. Curry after Cohen told him of the conversation he
said he had with Fuchs about the results of cocaine testing of team
members.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis in 1991 signed a five-year contract with the Celtics,
he claimed he had never used cocaine or marijuana in his life.
Lewis checked off ``no'' in the box beside the question on drugs in
the insurance policy application.
</P>
<P>
   However, if it is determined that Lewis lied when he attested on
his insurance policy application that he never had used illegal
drugs, it is possible that the insurance company could seek to
reclaim some or all of its payments on the grounds that he
committed fraud.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC and ESPN vowed on Tuesday to make a profit from a new five-
year, $600 million television deal with the National Hockey League
that will begin in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bornstein, president of ESPN and ABC Sports, said he
expected to make money because of the cross promotion throughout
ESPN and ABC, the Internet and retail outlets that he said will
raise ratings and advertising rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll make money,'' he said. ``This is a marketing machine.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN will pay the rights fee then buy $50 million-a-year worth
of time on ABC for the games. Fox is paying $45 million for the
coming season, its last.
</P>
<P>
   But at $120 million a year, the new ESPN-ABC deal is 166 percent
higher on average than what Fox and ESPN are now paying. ``I didn't
attend the negotiations wearing a mask and a gun,'' said NHL
commissioner Gary Bettman.
</P>
<P>
   Despite falling ratings, ESPN sees value in the NHL for its
remaining strength among young male viewers; for the key
programming it provides ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPN Classic Sports, and
for distribution of games internationally.
</P>
<P>
   The new deal raises from three to four the number of weekly
games on ESPN2. ABC will carry up to seven weeks of regular-season
games, down from Fox's 11, but up to five Stanley Cup finals games,
more than Fox's maximum of three.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's key to profitability is the extra finals games, said Steve
Solomon, the league's executive vice president. ``The ad market for
those games is strong, very saleable'' he said. At $70 million a
year, ESPN will pay quintuple its current annual fee. ``But if you
look at the NBA on cable, Turner's paying $220 million a year. For
our rights, $70 million makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   One loose end for the league is dealing with Fox, which wants to
exit the coming last season of its deal and for the league to
compensate it for finals games it was unable to show because the
last four ended in four games.

1 BELIEVED DEAD AS BONNIE ROILS N.Y.-AREA WATERS

   Hurricane Bonnie made herself felt in the New York region with a
vengeance Tuesday, pounding beaches in New York and New Jersey and
apparently claiming at least one life.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard sea and air rescue teams resumed a search Tuesday
morning for Antonio Mandarino, 23, of Oakland, N.J., who was caught
by a riptide while wading in the surf at Point Pleasant Beach on
Monday evening, officials said. But by day's end Tuesday, the
search had been called off. Mandarino is presumed drowned, said
Coast Guard Lt. John Knotts.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions were so dangerous along the New Jersey shore that
four lifeguards swimming in the rough surf off Point Pleasant Beach
had to be rescued by the Coast Guard when they were unable to swim
against a riptide to get back to shore.
</P>
<P>
   Guards were imposing restrictions on beachgoers, ranging from a
ban on entering the water in Point Pleasant Beach to allowing
bathers in up to their knees in Atlantic City. Bathers in Cape May
were allowed to get in the surf ``but I wouldn't call it
swimming,'' said a lifeguard lieutenant, Harry Back.
</P>
<P>
   Malu Iozza had come to Point Pleasant Beach from Palisades Park
with her 5-year-old daughter, Adela, only to find swimming
off-limits. ``I knew the hurricane was farther south,'' she said.
``I didn't think it would affect anything here.''
</P>
<P>
   And Vinnie Dallicardillo of Brick Township, a Point Pleasant
Beach lifeguard, said some beachgoers ``don't like it and we're
bored with no one to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic
Preservation closed Jones Beach and Robert Moses and Hither Hill
State Parks. ``We've had strong undercurrents and riptides that
have formed and it is unsafe for people to be in the water,'' said
George Gorman, a department spokesman. ``Even at low tide it's very
deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   High tide had extended 80 feet beyond its normal line, Gorman
said. Employees had removed all lifeguard equipment and stands.
Bulldozers were trying to build a wall of sand to protect the
boardwalk from the rising tide.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service said waves off Fire Island were
seven feet high and were expected to swell to 10 feet as the storm
moves closer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nothing the hurricane has brought so far has come close to
the summer of 1996, when 17 people drowned off New Jersey in stormy
surf.

FLOYD HASKELL, 82, EX-SENATOR FROM COLORADO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Floyd K. Haskell, whose tall frame and rugged good
looks made him seem chiseled for his role as a U.S. senator but who
never felt quite comfortable in the part, died Tuesday at a
hospital in Washington. He was 82 and lived in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News correspondent Cokie Roberts, a friend of the family,
said the cause of death was pneumonia, a complication that arose
from a brain hemorrhage that Haskell suffered four years ago when
he slipped on an icy sidewalk and hit his head. He had been
vacationing in Maine with his wife, Nina Totenberg, a legal affairs
correspondent for National Public Radio and ABC's ``Nightline''
program, when his condition deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell, D-Colo., where he had once been a state legislator, was
considered by some an ``accidental'' senator because of his narrow
surprise victory over a longtime Republican incumbent, Gordon
Allott, in 1972. By the end of his term, he had carved out a modest
niche not only as a tax reformer but also as an advocate for the
environment, having helped create wilderness areas and encouraged
experiments with solar energy.
</P>
<P>
   A liberal in a Republican state, he was defeated for re-election
in 1978 by Rep. William Armstrong, a conservative who ran an
aggressive, well-financed campaign against Haskell, who disdained
showmanship and had angered special-interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Originally a registered Republican, Haskell said it was the
Vietnam War that drove him into the Democratic fold in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``I considered myself well out of politics at the time,'' he
said in a 1978 interview. ``I never planned to run for office
again. I had become more and more opposed to the war in Vietnam,
and when Nixon invaded Cambodia, that was it. I just felt I
couldn't stay in the Republican Party any longer. I went down to
the courthouse and changed my registration. It was a private act of
conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Haskell was born in Morristown, N.J., the son of an investment
banker. He graduated from Harvard and then Harvard Law School,
where he took a fancy to tax law. He served in the Army during
World War II, seeing action in the Asian theater and achieving the
rank of major.
</P>
<P>
   Later he married Eileen Nicoll and, intent on proving his mettle
out West, soon afterward moved to Colorado, where he specialized in
tax law. From 1965 to 1969, he served in the Colorado state House
of Representatives, becoming assistant majority leader in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   After his one term in the U.S. Senate, he worked as a lobbyist,
served on the board of the watchdog group Common Cause and was
active with a bipartisan group of retired lawmakers pushing for
changes in campaign finance laws and trying to break congressional
gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his second wife, Ms. Totenberg; by three
daughters, Ione Haskell of New York, Eve Maxwell of Colorado and
Pam Haskell of California, all the children of his first wife, and
by three grandchildren.

HARDCOVER REVENGE FOR A BROKEN MARRIAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Catherine Texier returned home from a visit to
her native France in the summer of 1996, her husband of 18 years _
Joel Rose, a novelist and screenwriter _ greeted her with the news
that he was packing up his books, clothes and photographs and
leaving. The marriage, he said, was over.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Texier, who is a novelist as well, persuaded her husband to
stay so they could try to work things out. But before you could
say, ``Hell hath no fury,'' she had decided to document the process
in a book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was either that or stick my head in an oven,'' she said on
a hot afternoon two years later and half an emotional universe
away. ``I became two people. One person was powerless and
humiliated. The other one was the writer who had control over the
story.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple divorced last November, and Ms. Texier's portrait of
the marital meltdown has just arrived in bookstores. Titled
``Breakup'' (Doubleday), it has received a lot of attention in
certain literary circles because in the early 1980s, Ms. Texier and
Rose founded Between C and D, _ a Lower East Side literary journal
that published promising writers, including Patrick McGrath, David
Foster Wallace and Tama Janowitz.
</P>
<P>
   In their ``C and D'' days (the journal died before the marriage
did, in 1990) the couple were considered the very soul of
impoverished artistic virtue, publishing their journal and
supporting themselves and two children on $10,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Rose finally left the marriage early last year for his editor at
Crown Books, who had paid him a handsome advance for his latest
novel, which came out last summer. It, too, is about a doomed love
affair _ but not about his failed marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Texier's memoir is unsparing in its detail of their
separation and divorce. It is laden with accounts of the poignant
sexual encounters between a separated husband and wife, and even
violent revenge scenarios Ms. Texier imagined. In
stream-of-consciousness prose, Ms. Texier chronicles the distressed
children and incredulous friends, the lost rituals and 3 a.m. phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   But at lunch on a recent steamy afternoon, Ms. Texier, 50,
fairly glowed with well-being. Wearing a black camisole top, 19
wriggly silver-wire bracelets and 4 silver rings, her corkscrew
hair glowing electric red in the sunlight, she was woman and she
was roaring.
</P>
<P>
   Born in a resort town on the Brittany coast to a single mother,
Ms. Texier was raised mostly by her grandparents in a suburb of
Paris. Her grandfather was the director of Bakelite in France. ``I
still collect Fiestaware,'' she said. ``Look, I am bourgeois.''
</P>
<P>
   She studied American literature at the University of Paris,
then, eager to get away from home, took a job at Women's Wear Daily
in New York for a summer. ``I remember stepping off the plane at
JFK,'' she said, ``and as soon as my foot touched the ground, I
knew. Within about two months I decided I was never going back.''
</P>
<P>
   She met Rose at a dinner party on New Year's Day in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was love at first sight, or something like that,'' she
said. They moved in together six months later and were married in
1981. She started writing in English _ of her three novels, only
the first was written first in French _ and has never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to shed my French identity,'' she said, in
English virtually devoid of an accent. ``Writing in English was so
liberating because it was not the language I grew up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly as an excuse to meet other writers, partly to publish
their own work, she and Rose started Between C and D, in 1983,
during what Ms. Texier calls the ``heyday'' of the East Village.
The magazine was even packed in glassine envelopes. ``The plastic
bag referred to the dope bags in the neighborhood,'' she said,
``and we played up that theme, because that's the kind of writing
we were getting, that we were writing. That rough, edgy,
sex-drugs-and-rock-and-roll thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, ``Breakup'' is just as rough; some reviews accuse
Ms. Texier of cashing in on the exhibitionist memoir boom, but she
defends her work. ``There was never any moment when I was pouring
out my feelings in a gratuitous way,'' she said. She said she
didn't know if her husband had read the book, and that their
conversation these days is limited to parenting responsibilities:
their two daughters, 17 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   Why write a book in which you fantasize about murdering your
husband's lover and which your children will probably read someday?
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the writer's responsibility to her children?'' she
asked. ``I don't know. My elder daughter has never read any of my
books, and she's not reading this one, by choice. Which is, I
think, a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Ms. Texier is dating, she said, ``to use that funny
American phrase.'' She still lives in the apartment on East Seventh
Street that she shared with Rose, and has put aside most of her
post-divorce anguish to concentrate on her next novel _ ``about a
woman who is having an affair with a man 20 years younger,'' she
said with a sly smile.
</P>
<P>
   And what's the theme? How Catherine Got Her Groove Back?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say it's close to my life,'' she said. ``And it's a
much lighter book. At least so far.''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: PREPARING FOR A STRIKE; SPECIAL PACKAGE DEALS

   As of Tuesday, Northwest Airlines was still holding out the
possibility of avoiding a strike by its pilots, but prudent
passengers should prepare for the worst. That means bracing for a
possible strike any time after midnight Saturday, unless there is a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest, travel agents and other airlines are offering advice
about how best to cope with a strike _ along with the caveat that
airline strikes, no matter how brief, are almost always frustrating
and disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   If booked on a Northwest flight that departs before Saturday,
the carrier said a strike would not disrupt your travel plans. In
addition, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Northwest's partner, said that
even in the event of a strike it intended to fly all scheduled
trans-Atlantic routes.
</P>
<P>
   If you are booked on Northwest, but decide to double-book on
another carrier to insure against being stranded, be advised that
almost all the other major carriers are temporarily making even
their first-class and business-class tickets nonrefundable on
flights to and from Northwest's hubs at Minneapolis-St. Paul,
Detroit and Memphis. That hard line on the part of Northwest's
rivals is to protect themselves from droves of no-shows in the
event there is no strike.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a strike, Northwest's nonrefundable ticket
restrictions remain in force. Then if Northwest cannot accommodate
passengers on another carrier, it will make a full refund.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of accommodating many Northwest ticket holders on
other carriers during a strike are slim. Almost all airlines
already have record passenger loads, and almost none has spare
planes or the ability to add extra flights. Also, the closer it
gets to the long Labor Day weekend, the more crowded all airplanes
will be.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many of the domestic routes flown by Northwest are to
small cities throughout Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa and
the Dakotas, cities where other carriers have few flights. And
Mesaba Airlines and Express Airlines I _ Northwest's principal
regional carriers, which will suspend operations in the event of a
strike against Northwest _ provide the only air service to many
cities in the Midwest and cities served from the Memphis hub.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the Pacific, where Northwest has been a major presence
for decades, the economic crisis in Asia has led almost all
carriers to reduce service to Japan and other nations, or to
substitute smaller airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   On a somewhat happier note, Northwest frequent fliers who
planned to use a free ticket that expires during the strike, if
there is one, will have the expiration date of those miles
extended.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Northwest is encouraging passengers with questions
about flights to get in touch with their travel agents or phone its
toll-free reservations line in the United States or Canada (800
225-2525). But keep in mind that flights are often canceled at the
last minute, and that reservations lines are often jammed for hours
during or just before a strike. &QL;

A SWIMMING COACH SAVORS HIS TITLE SHOT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the swimming and diving coach at Mount Vernon (N.Y.) High
School, Larry Barnes has no concept of being in over his head. So
to make that suggestion about his coming bout against Yory Boy
Campas, for the International Boxing Federation junior middleweight
championship, would be useless.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnes will be swimming in deep water for this fight,
because he normally fights as a 147-pound welterweight. Even so, he
believes he can stick with Campas, a hard-nosed slugger who has
lost just twice in 73 fights (71-2), at the higher weight. The
fight is on the undercard of the Oscar De La Hoya-Julio Cesar
Chavez welterweight championship fight at the Thomas and Mack
Center in Las Vegas, Nev., on Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 154 pounds with Yory Boy, I don't have to look for him and
he doesn't have to look for me,'' Barnes said during lunch in
Manhattan on Tuesday. ``We can dance.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be Barnes' second world title fight. Felix Trinidad
scored a fourth-round knockout against Barnes (44-2) in 1995.
Barnes' other loss came against Saoul Mamby on Aug. 23, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he felt he was in control against Trinidad before he
got knocked out. Campas has also been knocked out in the fourth
round by Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felix almost killed Yory Boy,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has always been a working boxer, which means that he held
a regular job between fights. About the time that Barnes lost to
Trinidad he had received a promotion at his alma mater to take over
as the swimming coach. As a student, he had been on the diving team
and was a place-kicker on the football team; soon after he
graduated in 1985, he took a job as the pool director and locker
room attendant.
</P>
<P>
   With the promotion came more responsibilities. He said he
decided to take some time away from boxing to help guide his team
in the state sectionals. He stayed away from boxing for nine
months, but Barnes didn't stop training. He would run around the
pool deck in the winter with the water temperature from the pool
heating the air to 80 degrees. He still works out in the pool by
throwing punches under water.
</P>
<P>
   After his layoff, Barnes returned with a sixth-round technical
knockout against Dave Clark on Aug. 16, 1996. Since the loss to
Trinidad he has won six straight bouts. He knocked Roger Brown out
in the fourth round on May 28 in his last bout.
</P>
<P>
   Right before he got the call for the fight against Campas,
Barnes was telling his wife, Annette, that he did not think he was
going to get another title shot, because he was 32 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock is ticking, tick-tock, tick-tock,'' Barnes said.
``It's now or never. It's sink or swim. I've had a lot of success
in this game. Nothing is promised in the sport of boxing. I'm very
fortunate to get this shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said a victory could lead to bigger and better things.
But a loss could force him to hang up his gloves and move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would want to register me as a journeyman fighter,''
Barnes said. ``I don't think my wife and my manager would stand for
that. If you stick around fighting for just washing machine money,
you're not going to have all your marbles too tight at the end.''

ABOUT NEW YORK: THE SERPENT IN THE GARDEN OF RENEWAL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Plump, green apples plopped to the ground as Jose
(Chema) Soto pried them loose from the branches. He climbed down
and caught his breath, a reminder that he should exercise more
since having a heart attack. He beheld the tree, which towered over
the Caribbean-style wooden shack that he and his friends built in
the middle of a Bronx community garden bursting with enough
vegetables and flowers to rival any greengrocer.
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, this was just an empty lot on the corner of 158th
Street and Brook Avenue. Soto and his friends turned it into Rincon
Criollo _ Down-Home Corner _ where they nurture more than just
plants. It is a place where the traditional Puerto Rican music of
bomba and plena has flowered. It is ground zero for folklore.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad for Soto that it is also near ground zero for the next
phase of the Melrose Commons urban renewal zone, where hundreds of
new homes have already arisen on surrounding blocks. For Rincon
Criollo and 14 other community gardens that have long thrived on
lots leased annually from the city, the future seems as
unpredictable as the weather. A few months ago, the city's
Department of Housing Preservation and Development took control of
the properties to allow for speedier development. Some gardens will
vanish under bricks and mortar. Soto is lucky, since borough
officials have proposed letting him start over a block south in
what is now a fenced thicket of weeds. Some luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we supposed to do, take our peach and apple trees out
by the roots?'' Soto said. ``Over there, the ground is full of
rocks. It took us more than 20 years to do this. Before we see
trees like this over there, we'll be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the proposed lot. ``Not even a curse would grow
there,'' he concluded. ``Don't move me anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The community gardeners have banded together to mount their own
urban land reform effort. They have met with politicians,
circulated petitions and enlisted the aid of advocacy groups. They
knew that their leases were temporary, but they wonder why the city
had to go after them, considering all the other lots that have lain
fallow and fenced in for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't they take it before, when it was dirty?'' said Luis
Gonzalez, whose garden is near Crotona Park. ``Are they showing it
to potential buyers because they saw how we cleaned it up?''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to their worries, they said they have yet to hear from
Housing Preservation officials to explain what plans lie ahead. A
spokeswoman for the agency did not respond to a reporter's
questions about the Melrose gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer said development plans,
still five years away from groundbreaking, are jeopardizing four
gardens. He said that a community effort to redesign the
neighborhood has included plans to relocate several existing
gardens and create three more acres of parkland. He suggested that
the city agency take a closer look at such local efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying very hard here to do the right thing for the
community so it can rebound with housing and gardens,'' he said.
``But with a plan. Not the way HPD does, which is, `Give me all of
it, and I won't talk with you.' It's mindless, to use a favorite
mayoral term.''
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen gardeners met at Rincon Criollo last week to map
new strategies. They were joined by residents of other communities
who were also fighting to preserve their oases. Some of them
munched on grapes picked from vines dangling above the maze of
spotless walkways between the garden plots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government never expected this,'' Soto said. ``This used
to have only rats, junkies and a hole that was 10 feet deep. Now it
is a place for deep culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Sierra, a plenero who has been active in Rincon Criollo
for 15 years, can attest to that. From the little shack on Brook
Avenue, he has gone on to perform at theaters and museums. In turn,
he has played host to countless musicians, athletes and politicians
who make sure they pay their respects at Rincon Criollo whenever
they visit the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the missing link between Puerto Rico and New York,''
he said. ``Here. We feel like we're in Puerto Rico.''
</P>
<P>
   The plenas that he sings add to that atmosphere. For years they
carried the news of the era in song. The gardeners' current plight
would seem like a logical topic for a plena. ``We are working on
one,'' Sierra said. ``It is our secret weapon. We will hold onto it
until the last minute.''

DESPITE SHAKY MOMENTS, RAFTER AVOIDS EARLY EXIT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMMACK, N.Y. _ Like an artist who suddenly finds his voice,
Patrick Rafter found his game at the Hamlet Cup a year ago. Before
he arrived, he was just another name, albeit 16th-ranked. Then
Rafter rode a devil-may-care serve and volley attack to the final
of the Hamlet and went on to capture the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter returned to the scene of his metamorphosis with mixed
results Tuesday night. Spraying volleys and backhands into the net
at inopportune moments, the second-seeded Australian, ranked third
in the world, still hung on for a 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 victory over
Spain's pesky Javier Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to scrap to get out of the rut I was in,'' Rafter said.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter's yelp, which he employs on bad shots, reverberated
around the stadium court at the Hamlet Golf and Country Club. But
when he hit a crosscourt backhand that nicked the net and fell away
from Sanchez's outstretched racquet on match point, he could
breathe a sigh of relief. It was his third match point of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter's resourcefulness and mobility also saved him from a
premature exit. He stabbed for balls as if his racquet were a
Ping-Pong paddle, and the shots made it over the net. He won most
of the long rallies, causing Sanchez to yell facetiously at one
point, ``I'm old, man.'' And Rafter had the lion's share of balls
that slapped the tape and trickled over the net.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Rafter needed no such help. But after his U.S. Open
triumph, he plummeted into an emotional trough, the victim of what
Australians call ``the tall poppy syndrome,'' his countryman Mark
Woodforde said. In another words, the poppy that grows the highest
must be cut the lowest.
</P>
<P>
   Besieged by critical fans and reporters, Rafter slumped badly
after the Open, compiling an ordinary 19-13 record in matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more the expectation than the press,'' Rafter said.
``People were disappointed but not mad at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodforde, a 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) loser to Filip Dewulf of Belgium
earlier Tuesday, said: ``He was dragging his feet. You could tell
he wasn't happy with himself. He's a pretty upbeat guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter's slide prompted John McEnroe to call him a ``One-Slam
Wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter did not appear Grand Slam ready Tuesday night, as Hamlet
organizers held their breath fearing that their biggest draw would
disappear. One fan, Sara Rand, of Roslyn, N.Y., focused on Rafter's
every move. She said if Rafter had been defeated, ``I wouldn't be
as excited but I would come back. However, I came primarily to see
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter's sloppy performance belied his momentum of late. Since
receiving a ``chin-up, mate'' fax from the Australian great John
Newcombe during Wimbledon, Rafter has compiled a 21-3 mark, winning
four tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he broke Sanchez's serve immediately in the first set,
then salvaged three break points to push ahead, 5-2. His set-winner
in the subsequent game was another backhand passing shot that hit
the net and went over.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez attacked Rafter's second serve to earn a break and take
a 3-2 lead in the second set. It was the final break of the set,
and Sanchez, remaining steady while Rafter self-destructed, tied
the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second set I felt bad, flat,'' Rafter said. ``I was
just trying to pull through. Then I felt good again in the third
set.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter's recovery on an off night bolstered his mission to
defend his Open title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go all the way here because it helps my
preparation,'' he said.

UMPIRE WAS PRESENT AS WELLS SIGNED BASEBALLS
</HEADLINE>
   (rl) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Al Clark, the American League umpire under
investigation in the sale of baseballs that were purportedly used
in David Wells' perfect game, acknowledged Tuesday night that he
was present when Wells autographed balls but disputed an account
that he received any of them.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Yankee employee said Tuesday that Wells had signed
two dozen or more balls for Clark when the umpire worked a series
with the Boston Red Sox at Yankee Stadium 11 days after Wells' May
17 performance.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark said before Tuesday night's Yankees-Angels game at the
Stadium that the balls were not for him.
</P>
<P>
   The balls, Clark said, were for Rich Gressle, a friend of his,
who subsequently sold six balls to a memorabilia dealer on Long
Island. The balls were accompanied by an authenticating letter that
bore Clark's signature and said he got the balls from John
Hirschbeck, one of the four umpires who worked the perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Gressle said in an interview that he wrote the
letter and forged Clark's name, adding that Clark had nothing to do
with the sale of the balls and knew nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who vehemently denied any involvement, said Gressle was
in the umpires' locker room with Clark because he had brought
photographs for Wells that the pitcher had requested. One of them
was a photo of Cal Ripken Jr. with Joe DiMaggio the night in 1995
that Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's consecutive-game streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Wells that Richie was here,'' Clark said. `I had
introduced Richie and David before. David wanted some pictures that
Richie had taken. I just put those two guys together. They made a
trade. What they did I don't know. Those guys were talking and I
was sitting there. He signed the balls for Gressle. I was not party
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he had asked Wells to sign the balls, Clark said
he had not.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Gressle took the balls with him, he said: ``I
would imagine. At no time did I have any of those balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells has declined comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the balls were not from the perfect game, even
though that was how Gressle portrayed them when he sold six balls
for $300 each to Mark Lewis, a memorabilia dealer in Centereach,
N.Y. A member of the Yankees clubhouse crew said that right after
the game ended, the ball boy took the ball bag containing 14 balls
and delivered it to Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who returned from a one-week vacation Monday night, had
been scheduled to work Tuesday night's game at third base, but he
was replaced by Terry Craft. Phyllis Merhige, the league's senior
vice president, said that a fifth umpire was added to the crew
because the Yankees and the Angels are scheduled to play a
day-night doubleheader Wednesday. &QL;

AFTER STRING OF FAILURES AT REVIVAL, ASBURY PARK LOOKS TO STATE FOR
HELP
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASBURY PARK, N.J. _ In the last dozen years this long-sagging
New Jersey shore city has seen an eclectic bunch of would-be
saviors, with plans ranging from the mundane to the sublime.
</P>
<P>
   There was the Indian tribe that wanted to open a boardwalk
casino. There were the followers of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi who
bought a beachfront hotel in a plan to create a transcendental
meditation center.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the developer who proposed a series of
entertainment pavilions along the boardwalk, saying the family of
Michael Jackson would operate one and Jacques Cousteau's
organization another.
</P>
<P>
   All of them ran aground, whether stalled by recessions,
bankruptcies or a pervasive skepticism over the city's ability to
reduce high rates of crime and poverty. But Tuesday a small group
of residents and business owners rushed yet again into the fray,
urging members of the City Council to accept a new offer from the
New Jersey Redevelopment Authority to take on the long-stalled
rebuilding effort.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the shadow of the hulking and incomplete Ocean Mile
Condominiums project, which was abandoned by a bankrupt developer
in 1992 and became a symbol of the city's plight, the group called
the Asbury Park Consortium called on other residents to join them
in putting away their fears of further disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   The state agency could offer funds and expertise for planning,
as well as help in attracting private development _ assistance that
members of the consortium said was crucial to any successful
rebuilding effort. But opponents of state involvement say they are
skeptical of the promises of outsiders, and wary that state
officials might press for more low-income housing development.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents said that ceding some control to the state was a
small price to pay to jump-start a redevelopment effort that has
languished for so long. ``It's a simple choice between something
vs. nothing,'' said John Hamilton, a councilman who supports state
involvement. He said that few if any desirable private developers
were pressing to help rebuild the mile-long stretch of properties
across from the beachfront and boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   The Council is slated on Friday to hold the first of two votes
on inviting the state into the city.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   William Best, the executive director of the state authority,
said the 18-month-old agency had so far spent $13 million in 17
cities in the state and leveraged more than $52 million in private
investments. Financed with about $425 million, the agency can offer
a range of help to 67 specially designated cities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This city of 17,000 people, just 60 miles from New York City,
probably last saw some luster in the 70s when a local star, Bruce
Springsteen, was packing them in at the Paramount Theater and
Convention Center on a boardwalk that was still lined with
amusements and carnival rides. It had already been declining as a
resort area for some years, and racial disturbances at the time
sped that decline.
</P>
<P>
   Today the city is 70 percent black and has an unemployment rate
of 18 percent _ more than three times the statewide rate. The
city's median income is $20,754, about half that of surrounding
Monmouth County. About 22 percent of its families have earnings
below the poverty level and 31 percent of its residents do not have
high school diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   In the 80s, the city adopted an ambitious redevelopment plan, of
which the Ocean Mile condominiums were a key element. But the
developer, Joseph Carabetta, who had the rights for the entire
waterfront, was swamped by the recession and was forced to declare
bankruptcy. Lawsuits by creditors and disarray among members of the
Council over what course to take further complicated the city's
efforts to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only ones who got rich were the lawyers,'' said Rita
Marano, owner of Kingsley Avenue Deli, as she displayed an
editorial cartoon of lawyers dragging sacks of money out of town,
from a local paper several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even as all of this was going on, Asbury Park's leadership was
undergoing a racial change from white to black. Long-smoldering
distrusts between whites and blacks mixed with the disappointment
and finger-pointing of the failed redevelopment efforts to make
movement even more difficult, said Henry Vaccaro, a former partner
in the bankrupted redevelopment effort.
</P>
<P>
   Coalitions have grown up and collapsed. Council members have
been elected only to be voted out in recall elections over promises
they had made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been deceived and disappointed so many times by so many
people that we don't know who to trust anymore,'' said a local
landlord, Norman Lemonde, with a world-weary shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Like Vaccaro and Ms. Marano, Lemonde says he is wary of state
involvement. Citing state efforts in the 70s and early 80s, they
equate state involvement with the building of low-income housing
rather than commercial development. They also say that they fear an
increase in people on government assistance and an ever-expanding
local government, which they say has become the city's employer of
last resort in the absence of private sector jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Best insisted that the state had no such plans, but Ms. Marano's
motto is once burned, twice cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sin to say it, but some people can make a lot of money
on poor people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, the council member pushing for the city to ally
formally with the state redevelopment authority, said he welcomed
the support of the people who held the press conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Vaccaro and other veterans of the heated and contentious
early years of the redevelopment effort, they were new, more
optimistic voices. One immediate result of the state involvement
would be the payment of some $6.5 million in back taxes on the
redevelopment acres held by Carabetta. In the absence of those
revenues, the city has been increasingly dependent on state aid to
meet its budget.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Hamilton's optimism is Wilbert Russell, the city's
fourth city manager in three years, who has been on the job for
just three months. He said he has been struck by how consumed
people were with the mistakes of the past as he has worked to help
the Council evaluate the idea of state involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see their disappointments,'' he said, ``but I just keep
telling them that if they keep looking back, that's where they are
going to wind up.''

COMETS SET THE WNBA STANDARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MELANIE HAUSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ ``Bring on da Bulls.''
</P>
<P>
   That sign, held high above the crowd at the Compaq Center here,
said it all Monday night. In a season in which the defending
champions of the Women's National Basketball Association have set
WNBA records for the games won in a season, winning percentage and
average winning margin, the Houston Comets could use some
competition.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to the winner of Tuesday night's series
between Cleveland and Phoenix, the 1998 Comets are looking a lot
like recent versions of the Chicago Bulls. All of which means that
this WNBA title is the Comets' to lose. As was the two-game
semifinal sweep of the Charlotte Sting, concluded by 77-61 Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Texas brag? More like fact.
</P>
<P>
   In two short seasons, the Comets have set the standard for
women's professional basketball and lived out a dream that once
belonged only to the boys. Perhaps, then, it's fitting that the
Comets are led by a player like Cynthia Cooper, who came from
nowhere to put a league on the map, whose idols included Magic
Johnson, Larry Bird and Norm Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, Cooper's team ranks above some of the best the
NBA has had to offer. Consider that the 1998 Comets won 90 percent
of their games in the regular season (27-3), while the 1995-1996
Bulls set the NBA regular season record of 87.8 percent (72-10). Or
that the Comets outscored their opponents by an average of 12.6
points per game, compared to the NBA's best of 12.3 set by the
1971-72 Lakers, or the 12.2 margin by those '95-96 Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Even Cooper, while sounding the apples-and-oranges refrain, was
surprised to hear the WNBA's numbers and how they compared with the
boys. ``That's really hard for me to think about,'' she said.
``Women's ball is so new. We don't have the history. We can't look
back and compare to anything. But I know it's something special.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you're associated with or compared to some great teams
in basketball history, that's awesome,'' Cooper said. ``A lot of
those guys were our role models growing up. That's who we
watched.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Comets lead their league in role models. Cooper, the
two-time league most valuable player, has been the heart and soul
of the WNBA in its first two seasons. She led the league in scoring
this year, but its her all-around game, developed in the European
leagues, that makes the Comets go. Add in Sheryl Swoopes, Tina
Thompson and the tiny defensive whiz Kim Perrott, and Houston sends
chills down the spines of opposing coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business is at hand,'' said coach Van Chancellor, whose
team opens its title defense Thursday night in either Cleveland or
Phoenix. ``We're playing for a championship. I'm not saying we're
going to win a championship. I'm saying were playing for one.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Cleveland and Phoenix have beaten the Comets once this
season (New York handed them their third loss), and either one
poses problems for Houston. Cleveland has a good inside game and
good depth, while Phoenix relies on good shooting and a physical
style.
</P>
<P>
   Who would Chancellor rather play? ``Whoever's not there,''
Chancellor said with a grin.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 26:
</P>
<P>
   Troops, planes and tanks from Angola, Zimbabwe, Uganda and
probably Rwanda are now intervening on one side or the other of
Congo's civil war. Their actions blatantly violate international
borders and set an alarming precedent for turning other civil wars,
like those in the Sudan and Angola, into regional conflicts. The
fighting could also hasten the breakup of the huge but fractious
Congo, creating a breeding ground for drug traffickers, warlords
and terrorists in the heart of Africa.

participants, has paid too little attention. South Africa's Nelson
Mandela has tried to negotiate a cease-fire, only to be rebuffed by
Angola and Zimbabwe and their ally, the Congolese president,
Laurent Kabila. All seem to think they have more to gain from
continued bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration should should use its influence with
Angola, Rwanda and Uganda to help Mandela's efforts succeed. While
Angola is cool to the cease-fire proposal, Uganda and Rwanda
support it, perhaps hoping to lock in the gains of their rebel
allies. Washington must insist that these countries halt their
assistance to the rebels and commit themselves to keeping Congo
unified.
</P>
<P>
   It should also press the U.N. Security Council to take a
stronger stand. Maintaining the sanctity of international borders
is supposed to be one of the United Nations' basic missions. More
active interest by the Security Council would make it easier for
Secretary General Kofi Annan to lobby African leaders for a
cease-fire and an end to foreign intervention when he travels to
South Africa next week.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four countries intervening are hoping to ease their
own security problems. Uganda and Rwanda are threatened by rebels
who find sanctuary on Congolese soil. They hoped that by sponsoring
a rebellion they could replace Kabila with someone who would do
more to keep Ugandan rebels and Rwandan Hutu militias from staging
cross-border raids into their countries. Angola then sent troops to
defend Kabila mainly because it fears a rebel victory would allow
Angola's own anti-government Unita movement to establish Congolese
sanctuaries. Zimbabwe's involvement stems from President Robert
Mugabe's ambitions for regional military leadership and his
jealousy of Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all these intervening countries, though they may be
temporarily blinded to it, have a transcending interest in allowing
an Africa now finally free of superpower proxy contests to develop
in peace. America, which shares that interest, should do more to
help end this dangerous conflict.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 26:
</P>
<P>
   The biggest bull market of the past 15 years has been in
capitalism itself, and no company has been better positioned to
profit from it than Goldman, Sachs, the investment banking firm
that has until now jealously guarded its financial details.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in preparation for selling stock to the public, Goldman has
lifted the veil a bit. Last year its profit came to fully 53
percent of the money its partners had invested. That is the kind of
performance that one might think could not be maintained, but in
the first six months of this year, Goldman did even better. It made
$2.1 billion, an annualized return of 65 percent on the $6.6
billion the partners have invested. It should be noted that because
Goldman is a partnership, the figures are before taxes and do not
take into account the substantial amount of money paid out to the
189 partners of Goldman. But they are still high by any standard.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's business is inherently risky. Its profits from trading
stock fell late last year, when markets briefly nose-dived in
October. And in 1994 rising interest rates took such a toll that
the firm could only show profits of 10 percent. But over all the
record has been remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for those contemplating Goldman as an investment, two
questions stand out. The first, which will be clarified before the
offering is made, is just how generous the firm will be with its
employees, and thus how much of the profits will be left for those
who buy stock in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   The more important is whether Goldman's partners have decided to
sell near the top of a great boom.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's successes, after all, have come with the wind at its
back. From 1982 through 1997, worldwide issuance of stocks and
bonds rose at a compound rate of about 20 percent a year, and
merger activity leaped at a 25 percent rate. It is obvious that
pace cannot be sustained forever, and the current problems in stock
markets from Russia to Mexico may be a harbinger of an early
reversal.

EDITORIAL: KEEPING NEW YORK CITY IN SHAPE  
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 26:
</P>
<P>
   The New York City comptroller has done a big and important study
on the cost of fixing the city's shaky infrastructure. The danger
is that the numbers are so huge that New Yorkers will simply throw
up their hands in despair and turn their attention to issues that
seem more manageable.
</P>
<P>
   Comptroller Alan Hevesi estimates that the city would need to
spend $90 billion to get the subways, water mains, schools and
transit system in good repair within 10 years. Government agencies
have budgeted about $52 billion, and although these numbers can and
should be raised in some cases, the city will never be able to come
close to Hevesi's target. But by spending wisely it can keep
problems under control and avoid sliding backward into a worse
state of disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   The news from Hevesi's report is not all bad. The city has come
a long way since the financial chaos of the 1970s, and most
agencies now do a decent job of keeping track of their inventory
and setting priorities. The prison and court systems, along with a
few other areas, are in good shape or moving toward that goal
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   There are some cases in which the poor state of aging facilities
poses an opportunity to rethink the way city services are
organized. For instance, many of the city's firehouses were not
built to handle today's heavy equipment. But these firehouses are
often in the wrong place anyway, based on ancient deployment
patterns that were locked in by community pressure to retain the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   The most disturbing point made by the comptroller was not about
capital spending at all, but the inadequacy of maintenance
programs. A study done for the city found that New York spends only
about 40 percent of the private-sector standard on routine upkeep.
The cost of inadequate maintenance in the past has been driven home
so forcefully that it seems amazing the city has not learned its
lesson. Repairs on the long-neglected Williamsburg Bridge have been
so expensive and time-consuming that the report estimates it might
have been just as cheap to build a whole new span 10 years ago when
the scope of the problems was first uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   The school system presents both the most expensive
infrastructure challenge and the one where bad management poses the
greatest threat. The buildings are in a terrible state, and the
School Construction Authority has yet to prove it can renovate
buildings efficiently. Maintenance spending has been only about 10
percent of the private-industry standard, although a recent suit by
the teachers' union has forced a modest improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller's report notes, sensibly, that the Board of
Education could solve some of its facility problems by going to a
year-round schedule in overcrowded districts. But unless the board
is prepared to spend more money on maintenance, the billions of
dollars that have been poured into construction and renovation of
school buildings will turn out to have been wasted over the long
run.

U.S. TO PAY FARMERS TO SHOO COWS OFF NYC'S WATERSHED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Ill., Minn., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move aimed at cutting the flow of pollution and parasites
into New York City's drinking water, the U.S. Agriculture
Department plans to unveil a $10.4 million program Wednesday that
will pay farmers to stop growing crops and grazing cattle along
streams feeding the city's upstate reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to transform the banks of 165 miles of watershed
streams from easily eroded cropland or pasture into
pollution-filtering buffer zones of grassland and forest,
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said in a statement to be
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers who abandon fields along streams will be paid a yearly
fee of $100 to $150 an acre for the loss of the use of their land,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Several dairy farmers living near the reservoirs expressed
cautious interest in the program Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   David Post, whose grandson belongs to the eighth generation of
his family to work their 200-year-old farm in Stamford, N.Y., said
he recognized the value of having forested areas, cool streams for
trout and banks untrammeled by cow hooves. If the money is
sufficient to compensate for the loss of prime land, he said, then
plenty of farmers will sign up.
</P>
<P>
   The money, to be paid to farmers under contracts lasting 10 to
15 years, is a tiny fraction of the $600 million New York City has
already committed to spending to prevent pollution of its far-flung
water supply. But by providing a strong financial incentive to
farmers to move plows and cows back from stream banks, the federal
project is expected to significantly improve water quality, city
environmental officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Anything that has the potential to eliminate the sight of a herd
of cows wading and defecating in water bound for city faucets is
welcome, said Joel Miele, the city's commissioner of environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, such sights have been commonplace around several of
the city's largest reservoirs, in rural regions west of the Hudson
River. ``I quiver when I think about it,'' Miele said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York program is a variant of a long-standing national
program, the Conservation Reserve Program, that encourages farmers
to leave some sensitive lands fallow. But the payments offered were
too low to attract farmers in upstate New York, where fertile
valley-bottom land for dairy herds has always been a coveted
commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Related efforts to reduce farmland runoff using Agriculture
Department money have already begun in Maryland, where farm
pollution has tainted Chesapeake Bay, and in Illinois and
Minnesota, where rivers are similarly suffering, officials said.

EDITORIAL: DRUGS FOR A NUCLEAR DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 26:
</P>
<P>
   While the risk of a nuclear power plant disaster is very small,
state and federal disaster agencies owe it to people who live near
reactors to help them guard against the health dangers of a nuclear
leak or meltdown. The availability of potassium iodide pills can
help that effort.
</P>
<P>
   There is clear evidence that potassium iodide, if taken shortly
before or after a nuclear accident, can block the absorption of
radioactive iodine, which can cause thyroid cancer. This effect has
been known for many years, and the drug was approved by the Food
and Drug Administration in 1978. But federal and state agencies
involved with disaster planning, uncertain about health risks of
the drug and perhaps not wanting to alarm residents living near
nuclear reactors, have not publicized potassium iodide. Data from
Poland in the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident, however, have
shown that benefits of the drug outweigh risks of side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Potassium iodide is not effective against all isotopes that can
cause illness. But coupled with aggressive evacuation plans, which
should remain the primary response strategy to a nuclear accident,
its use can be helpful. In June, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
endorsed a proposal that encourages states to make potassium iodide
available to the public and that provides federal funding for
supplies of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The current policy in many states, including New York, is to
distribute the drug only to emergency workers and to prisoners and
hospital-bound individuals who cannot be evacuated quickly. An
advisory committee appointed by the New York state health
commissioner has recommended that the state consider giving the
pills to people living near reactors. The logistics of distributing
pills and insuring they are available when needed have yet to be
worked out. But these are not insurmountable problems.
</P>
<P>
   One concern is that distributing the drug would give people a
false sense of security in nuclear emergencies and create
resistance to evacuation. This problem can be addressed by
educating the public about the benefits and limits of potassium
iodide. It should not be used as an excuse to avoid acting on this
public health measure.
