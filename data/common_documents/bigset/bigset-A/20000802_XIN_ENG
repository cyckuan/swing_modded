He said all links in Kinnaur were cut off as about 30
kilometers of National Highway 22 and 14 bridges were washed away
in Kinnaur while the Wangto bridge was hanging useless. The death

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Meets U.S. Commander on Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
on Wednesday met with visiting Commander-in-Chief of the U.S.
Central Command Gen. Tommy Franks for discussions on military
cooperation between the countries.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Abdullah appreciated U.S. assistance to
Jordan's armed forces in defense and training fields, and
attributed such aid to the close friendly ties between the two
countries, Jordan's official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by Jordanian Royal Court Chief
Fayez Tarawneh, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mohammad
Yousef Malkawi and U.S. Ambassador to Jordan William Burns, Petra
said.
</P>
<P>
Franks is the highest U.S. military official to visit Jordan
this year to assess the defense needs of the kingdom, which
Washington takes as an ally in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is also Jordan's major supplier of arms and military
equipment, including fighter and military transport planes, radars,
missiles, rifles, tanks and armoured vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government provided over 300 million U.S. dollars in
various aid packages to Jordan in 1999, including 46.5 million
dollars in military financing and training programs.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the largest recipient of U.S. assistance on per capita
basis, with Washington having given it over 2.4 billion dollars in
economic and military aid during the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese, Eritrean Defense Ministers Meet to Ease Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Defense Minister Bakri
Hassan Saleh held talks with his Eritrean counterpart Sebhat Ephrem
here Wednesday on easing tension between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting focused on ways of improving the tense bilateral
relations and removing all obstacles between the two sides,
according to the Sudanese News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expressed their desire to enhance and strengthen
the bilateral ties in line with the instructions of their leaders
to serve the common interests of their people and preserve peace
and stability in the region, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
They will continue the talks on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean minister arrived here at mid-day Wednesday on an
official visit, during which he will convey a message from Eritrean
President Issayas Aferwerki to Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir.
</P>
<P>
"This visit will pave the way for the continuation of dialog on
major issues between the two countries especially security," Ephrem
told reporters upon his arrival here.
</P>
<P>
On July 20 Saleh visited Asmara, capital of Eritrea, to discuss
with Ephrem the reported Eritrean military support for Sudanese
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean minister said his country did not harbor any
animosity against Sudan. "There is no Eritrean military build-up on
the borders with Sudan and all press reports on the issue are
groundless," Ephrem noted.
</P>
<P>
"Eritrea does not intend to invade Sudan," he said.
</P>
<P>
In July, governor of Sudanese eastern province of Kassala
Ibrahim Mahmoud Hamid accused Eritrea of backing a military
offensive the Sudanese rebels were planning to launch on the
eastern borders.
</P>
<P>
The tension reached its peak in May when Eritrea accused Sudan
of allowing the Ethiopian forces to cross its territory in order to
attack West Eritrea during the Eritrean-Ethiopian conflict.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Speaker Hails Lebanese Resistance Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament) speaker
Mehdi Karrubi here on Wednesday hailed the Lebanese resistance
movement against Israel, saying it created great epics during the
past two decades.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with his Lebanese counterpart Nabih Berri, Karrubi
congratulated the Lebanese nation and government on the Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli pullout on May 24, after more than 20 years of
occupation, was a great victory of the unbreakable Lebanese
resistance movement and the unity showed between the Lebanese
people and their government, Karrubi said, quoted by the official
IRNA news agency.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced Iran's readiness to help Lebanon's
reconstruction, which is a difficult task because of the lengthy
war against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Berri, who arrived here Wednesday for an official visit, thanked
Iran for its long-time support and assistance to the Lebanese
resistance movement.
</P>
<P>
Calling the Israeli withdrawal as the first big victory for
Arabs and Muslims, he urged Muslim countries to strengthen
solidarity in order to safeguard this great triumph.
</P>
<P>
Both officials expressed satisfaction with their bilateral
relations. They also called for more efforts to enhance
cooperation, especially between the two parliaments.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Foils Attempt to Smuggle Rare Antiquities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Wednesday foiled an attempt
by a furniture dealer to smuggle rare antiquities to the United
States, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The dealer, identified as Taha Ghanem, was arrested at
Alexandria port on the Mediterranean coast while trying to smuggle
the antiquities, which were estimated to be worth 30 million
Egyptian
pounds (8.7 million U.S. dollars), Egypt's official news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
The antiquities, which date back to various historical periods
from Greco-Roman times to the Egyptian monarchy of the 20th
century, were discovered hidden in a shipment of furniture, police
officials told the agency.
</P>
<P>
The police confiscated the pieces, including a column from a
Greek temple, 10 wooden chairs inlaid with ivory and mother-of-
pearl and portraits of two of the country's last kings, Farouk and
Fuad, in gold frames as well as copper pots, Chinese vases and a
stash of silverware, which the dealer confessed were collected in
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Investigations showed that the arrested man had a deal with a
company in Houston to smuggle antiquities from various periods to
the U.S., the officials said.

<HEADLINE> UAE Urged to Promote Use of Unleaded Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- An environmental group of the
United Arab Emirates has called for a hike in the price of leaded
fuel to make environment-friendly unleaded fuel more attractive to
motorists.
</P>
<P>
This demand is a response to a statement recently issued by
retailers that they are losing almost 1.40 dirhams (about 0.38 U.S.
dollars) on every gallon of fuel they sell because of the rising
price of crude oil on the international market, reported the local
media on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Habiba Al Marashi, chairman of the Emirates Environmental Group,
said this gap could be closed by increasing the price of leaded
fuel.
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time to act and kill two birds with one stone," Al
Marashi said, adding, "If they want to increase the price, then do
it on leaded fuel and leave the unleaded alone."
</P>
<P>
"I have always felt the government should step in and subsidize
unleaded fuel, but this will not be necessary if the price of
leaded is increased above it," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) has issued a directive,
saying all imported cars in the member states must be able to run
on unleaded fuel by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Al Marashi noted that it is time to change the price now in
order to speed the transition, saying that if the price of unleaded
is made cheaper than leaded, then more people will start using it
and they will be accustomed to it before this rule comes into
effect.
</P>
<P>
By last year, 36 countries in North America, Europe, East Asia
and South America had switched to unleaded fuel. Nine more are
switching this year, and another 20 are expected to do so by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Qatar led the way in the GCC member states, introducing unleaded
fuel in 1984. It became fully unleaded last June 1.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the only GCC country which doesn't offer
unleaded fuel at its petrol stations, but has pledged to do so by
the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Emissions from leaded petrol are known to cause environmental
pollution and have prompted a myriad of health and safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
The six-member GCC also include Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman.

<HEADLINE> Breakthrough Unexpected in Third Round of Cyprus Talks: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government spokesman
Michalis Papapetrou Wednesday expressed doubt over whether
breakthrough can be made on the Cyprus issue by the end of the
current phase of Cyprus peace talks in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reported remarks by U.S. envoy Alfred Moses on
possible breakthrough in certain issues of the Cyprus problem,
Papapetrou said "it would be utopian to expect that there can be a
full break in the impasse in the next few days by the end of this
phase of talks."
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou, speaking in Geneva, said the Cyprus government
welcomes any breakthrough in the peace talks but so far there is no
indication that this could be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks, during which
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash talked in an indirect way through United Nations officials
shuffling between them, have already been held since December 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, no substantive achievements have been made so far.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots insist that they will not hold direct talks
with the Greek Cypriot-dominated government unless their breakaway
regime in northern Cyprus, declared in 1983 and recognized only by
Turkey, gets international recognition and talks with the
government on parallel basis.
</P>
<P>
The third round, which is underway in Geneva, will end on Friday
and a fourth round is scheduled for September in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said the Cyprus government wishes to see something
substantive emerging from the talks by October and aims at
clinching a deal at any time.
</P>
<P>
He refrained from further comment because of the news blackout
the U.N. has imposed.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency, U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan's special adviser for Cyprus Alvaro de Soto on Wednesday held
separate meetings with Clerides and Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his meeting with de Soto, Clerides said that "
good work was done," adding that "I am happy that we are talking."
</P>
<P>
"Everything is going on fine," said Denktash after his meeting
with de Soto.

<HEADLINE> First Batch of Ugandan Troops Withdraw from Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A flight carrying the first batch
of Ugandan troops pulling out of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) arrived at the Entebbe International Airport near the
Ugandan capital Kampala on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
A grand ceremony was held at the airport to welcome 450
soldiers flying back from the Congolese town of Buta, 350
kilometers north of Kisangani, the third largest city of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
On June 21, Uganda ordered five battalions or some 4,000
soldiers, who assembled in Buta after withdrawing from Kisangani,
to return home.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops have withdrawn from Kisangani after
the two sides shelled each other in the city in early June,
causing heavy civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have their troops stationed in the DRC to
back rival rebel factions fighting against the DRC President
Laurent Kabila. The two former allies clashed three times in
Kisangani since last August.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Say Russian Permafrost Could Melt in 23rd Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The permafrost in northern Russia'
s Komi republic could melt in the 23rd century, a British research
center has warned.
</P>
<P>
The average temperature in the North European part of Russia
may rise by 4 degrees Celsius within the next 240 years due to
global warming, causing the melting to occur, the Interfax news
agency reported Wednesday, quoting Britain's Hadley Center for
Climate Prediction and Research.
</P>
<P>
The prediction was cited at a news briefing by German
researcher Otto Habeck Wednesday in the Russian city of Syktyvkar,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The observations of reindeer breeders in Komi republic and
Nenets autonomous district, Arkhangelsk region corroborate the
Hadley Center's data, Habeck said.
</P>
<P>
The German scientist conducted his research under the auspices
of the European Union's Tundra project. The project was carried
out by leading universities of Britain, Finland, Netherlands and
Denmark together with the Komi Scientific Center of the Russian
Academy of Sciences' Urals branch, Interfax said.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov warned Wednesday that the country will face a political
crisis in the autumn, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the declarations of the current authorities about a
strong state, Zyuganov said, Russia is increasingly moving toward
a right-wing liberal, pro-American economy.
</P>
<P>
"We see that a stubborn covert struggle is underway at the top,
which may develop into strong confrontation in autumn," Interfax
quoted Zyuganov as saying at a meeting with editors of several
regional left-wing opposition publications.
</P>
<P>
"A contradictory situation is evolving in the country. On the
one hand, the authorities proclaim ideas that we have advocated
for 10 years and have won support from the overwhelming majority
of the population. On the other, a right-wing liberal,pro-American
line is evolving in the economy and an offensive is underway
against the social rights of working people, which aggravates
social tension," Zyuganov said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Send Experts to Probe Illicit Diamonds Trade in Sierra Leone (Updated with more information) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNTIED NATIONS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Wednesday confirmed the composition of a five-member
panel of experts to look anew into the link between the diamonds
trade and the fighting in Sierra Leone, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Manoel de Almeida e Silva, the U.N. spokesman, told a press
conference that the confirmation was contained in Annan's letter
to the president of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The panel is expected to start the work later this month, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the U.N. Security Council Sanctions Committee
on Sierra Leone, Anwarul Chowdhury who is the permanent
representative of Bangladesh to the United Nations, announced at
the press conference here Tuesday that the panel will be headed by
Martin Chungong Ayafor of Cameroon and the other four members are
from Belgium, Canada, India and Senegal.
</P>
<P>
Other members are Ian Smillie, a diamond expert from Canada,
Johan Peleman, an expert on arms and transportation from Belgium,
Harjit Singh Sandhu, an expert from Interpol and an Indian
national, and Atabou Bodian, an expert from the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and a national of Senegal.
</P>
<P>
Diamonds are at the heart of tragedy in Sierra Leone, where a
thriving gems-for-guns business fan the hard-to-end warfare.
</P>
<P>
The panel will report back to the sanctions committee by the
end of October, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions committee is similar to one that looked into
conflict involving Angola's UNITA rebels and concluded a report
last May.
</P>
<P>
Chowdhury said his own committee would fully probe allegations
leveled Monday by U.S. and British diplomats that Burkina Faso and
Liberia were fueling Sierra Leone's civil war and profiting from
its accompanying trade in arms and diamonds.
</P>
<P>
The panel composition was announced at the end of the two-day
public hearing on illicit diamonds trade in Sierra Leone, which,
the first of its kind, were requested by a July 5 Security Council
resolution imposing an global embargo on diamonds exports from the
West African country for at least 18 months unless the gems are
certified by the government.

<HEADLINE> House Prices Slowdown In UK Eases Rate Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) - Property prices in the UK fell
during July, according to the latest monthly update from the
Nationwide, one of the largest building societies in Britain.
</P>
<P>
It said house prices fell 0.2 percent in July to stand 13.9
percent higher than a year ago. This compares with a rise of 0.4
percent in the month of June and an annual rise of 15.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide director David Parry said that on a regional basis
it appeared that prices in London had seen the most significant
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
"Part of the explanation for the weakening is that price rises
over the last twelve months were simply not sustainable and fewer
first time buyers are entering the market," Parry said.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in house prices could ease the dilemma facing the
Bank of England on the eve of its monthly review of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) gets together Wednesday for
the start of what has been described as the most difficult meeting
to predict in its three-year history.
</P>
<P>
Since the MPC has expressed concern in the past that rising
house prices may bolster consumer expenditure, as homeowners feel
more wealthy and are encouraged to spend, it will take comfort
from the latest data.
</P>
<P>
However, Parry said "although the housing market is reining
back the excessive growth of last year, with the economy strong
this could merely be a pause for breath."

<HEADLINE> Two Militiamen Killed in Shoot-out With U.N. Troops in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- For the first time, two
militia men were killed Wednesday by the United Nations
peacekeeping forces in East Timor in Maliana District, some 10
kilometers from the border of West Timor, Indonesia, the United
Nations said.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva,
peacekeepers from the Australian Battalion had been tracking
militia activity in Maliana District based on information given by
Timorese who live in the area since the day before.
</P>
<P>
"Shortly after noon today, they came across a group of four to
five militia, who were armed with rifles and grenades, and they
shot and killed tow militia members, while the others are still at
large," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
No U.N. peacekeepers were injured in the incident, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Dili, the head of the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor, Sergio Vieira de Mello, said that
the incident was important because "it indicates that the militia
remain active."
</P>
<P>
De Mello added that the rules of engagement in East Timor had
not changed, but were being applied at the border "without the
lightest hesitation."
</P>
<P>
The Force Commander of the U.N. forces, Lieutenant General
Boonsrang Niumpradit, said that today's events should "send a
signal across the border to make militia members think twice
before placing human lives in jeopardy."

The survey was conducted on the basis of the answers by the
managers of the companies in the three activity fields, the
official Rompres news agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As much as 37 percent of those interviewed expect the
industrial production to continue growing, while more than half of
the companies think the production bulk and the orders portfolio
are likely to keep the same level as that of the term before.
</P>
<P>
The current trend of the exports is expected to keep the level
during the third term as well. It will be higher for the ready-
mades, rubber processing, the plastics industry and the industry
putting out other non-metallic products. The prediction is made by
the big companies with more than 500 employees but also by the
small and medium size ones working in several industrial fields.
</P>
<P>
The building sector along with the state-run companies and
those owning private capital, will keep their ascending activity
trend. Managers of the specific companies predict an additional
stock of contracts and orders.

<P>
The retail is also expected to have a positive development
which means a rise in the commodities' sales, the survey says.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) - World drugs giant AstraZeneca has
posted better-than-expected first-half year profits of 2.1 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite having to overcome a slowdown in sales of its block-
buster ulcer treatment Losec, pretax profits rose 17 percent in
the six months to June 30, according to its interim result report.
</P>
<P>
Sales of Losec, the world's best-selling drug, rose 7 percent
to 3 billion US dollars in the first half but the figures masked a
one-percent decline during the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive of the Anglo-Swedish giant Tom McKillop said
the company's five main drugs, which include its anti-heart
disease drug Atacand and its Zomig migraine treatment, had "
contributed strongly" to profit growth.
</P>
<P>
AstraZeneca earnings per share came in at 96 cents against 83
cents a year ago and the company is to pay a 23 cents half-year
dividend, unchanged from a year ago as expected.
</P>
<P>
The company also said merger cost savings had exceeded
expectation, at 282.7 million US dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Organized crime in Britain is
growing and its threat could worth billions of pounds a year,
according to a report released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) said in a
report that fraud on the internet and trafficking in illegal
immigrants and drugs are particularly on the rise, the BBC
reported.
</P>
<P>
The detailed findings of the report are classified but the
director general of the NCIS John Abbott said organized crime was
"big business".
</P>
<P>
The report will be circulated to police forces and other law
enforcement bodies, such as Interpol.
</P>
<P>
"The activities of organized crime threaten the economic and
social fabric of the country, its tentacles reaching into the
deepest and most remote crevices of our way of life," said Abbott.
</P>
<P>
He added that there was nothing glamorous about organized crime
and that for far too long it had "benefited from the cover that
its murky activity provides".
</P>
<P>
Typical areas associated with organized crime, said the report,
were drugs, armed robbery, benefit fraud and revenue evasion, art
and antiques.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM Urges Support for Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Wednesday called on Muslim countries to back
Palestinians in their struggle for an independent state, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have the right to establish an independent
state with Jerusalem as its capital, Kharrazi told his Saudi,
Malaysian and Senegalese counterparts on separate phone calls, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversations, Kharrazi underlined the need
to mobilize support among Islamic countries for the legitimate
rights of Palestinians. He reiterated Iran's stance that Jerusalem
should be the eternal capital of Palestine and all Palestinian
refugees should be allowed to return home.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi termed the current situation in the Middle East as
sensitive, as the Palestinians and Israel have just ended their
Camp David peace talks without achieving any agreement. The 15-day
marathon talks mediated by the United States ended in failure due
to wide gaps over the fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi also urged the Organization of the Islamic Conference,
currently chaired by Iran, to adopt appropriate measures on the
Middle East issue at this sensitive juncture.
</P>
<P>
In response, the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and
Senegal also stressed the need for Islamic solidarity in support of
Palestine and welcomed Iran's initiative in this respect, IRNA
said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Kharrazi held separate phone talks with the foreign
ministers of Syria, Egypt, Qatar and Jordan to coordinate their
stands.
</P>
<P>
Iran refuses to recognize Israel and has opposed any peace talks
and agreements with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
It has always called for armed struggle against Israeli
occupation of Arab and Islamic lands.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Barak Faces Tough Political Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Qi Deliang
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Shortly after Foreign Minister
David Levy resigned on Wednesday from the government of Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, Israel's Knesset (parliament) passed in its
preliminary reading an opposition bill asking for early elections.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement at his office inside the Knesset, Levy said
he can not accept Barak's peace policies, accusing Barak of making
too many concessions to the Palestinians at the Camp David summit,
particularly on the Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the prime minister for the "complete failure
in the areas of education and welfare."
</P>
<P>
After announcing his resignation, Levy carried out the second
part of his threat, voting for dissolving the Knesset and holding
early elections.
</P>
<P>
Levy's resignation has dealt another political blow to Barak by
reducing the now 12-member cabinet to an absolute minority of 40
seats in the 120-member Knesset. Under such circumstances, it is
hard for the government even to run the daily business and get its
bills pass through the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Barak said he respected Levy's decision and that the resignation
will not affect his efforts to continue the peace process with the
Palestinians and to carry out necessary changes for strengthening
the future of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The opposition's early election bill has to pass another three
readings before turning into law.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset will start its three-month recess Wednesday evening.
During this period, no special Knesset session will be held unless
at least 61 members support such a request. Therefore, Barak has
three months to clean the political mess at home.
</P>
<P>
Barak said he intended first of all to form a new coalition
government with previous partners such as Shas and Meretz party,
which have jumped off the boat.
</P>
<P>
But the problem is that Shas will not support the peace
agreement with the Palestinians and the government would collapse
again if Shas leave the coalition when the peace deal is reached.
</P>
<P>
The second option for Barak is to form a national unity
government with the rightist Likud, as Levy and Yisrael Ba'aliya
leader Natan Sharansky asked for. But this coalition could hinder
his efforts toward reaching the peace agreement with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky has already suggested that Likud leader Ariel Sharon
and Barak devise principles for establishing a national unity
government by revising all the proposals and understandings raised
and discussed at Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
The third option for Barak is to strike a peace deal with the
Palestinian within three months. This agreement would receive no
majority support in the Knesset, and then Barak would call for
elections to let the people decide whether they accept the deal nor
not.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams U.N. Oil-For-Food Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations oil-for-food
program has failed to alleviate the plight of the Iraqi people
reeling under sanctions, Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammad Mehdi Salah
said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Salah made the remarks during his meeting with Benon Sevan, the
U.N. oil-for-food executive director who arrived in the Iraqi
capital Baghdad on Tuesday, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal has failed to meet the humanitarian needs
of Iraq, Salah said, adding that the deal has been turned into a
program for covering the expenses of U.N. activities and paying
reparations stemming from the 1991 Gulf War, triggered by Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Ever since late 1996 when the program was launched, the value of
goods delivered to Iraq has only totalled some 7 billion U.S.
dollars, while the U.N. has granted 8.6 billion dollars of
compensation to victims of the 1991 Gulf War, Salah said.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that further claims amounting to 276
billion dollars are in the pipeline at the U.N. Compensation
Commission in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's crude exports since 1996 have generated more than 25
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly accused the United States and Britain of
impeding the implementation of the U.N. accord, worsening the
humanitarian crisis of the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sweeping economic and trade sanctions on Iraq
after its invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions will not be lifted
unless U.N. arms experts declare that Iraq is free of all weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program, now in its eighth phase, allows Iraq
to export oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian needs.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Government Urged to Set Date for Bar Association Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Administrative Court on
Wednesday demanded that the government set a date for the elections
of the Bar Association board members.
</P>
<P>
Ali Shahata, a judge of the court, overturned a decision made by
the government on July 1 to indefinitely postpone the vote, and
ruled that the legal committee for supervising the elections must
fix a new date, the country's official Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling came after a lawsuit filed by opposition lawyer
Ahmed Nasser, who was a candidate for the 25-member board of the
association, and two other lawyers demanding a date to be fixed.
</P>
<P>
It would be the first election since the government froze the
Bar's activities in January 1996 on allegations of bad financial
management.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Cairo have said the freeze and delay of elections
were aimed at preventing the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood from
controlling the Bar Association. In the last board, 16 of its 25
seats were held by Brotherhood members.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim Brotherhood, which was banned in the 1950s, is
generally tolerated by the government as it advocates an Islamic
state by peaceful means.

<P>
PARIS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister Jean-
Pierre Chevenement Wednesday received a false bomb alert on his
train from Paris to Brittany, western France, most probably from
Brittany nationalists.
</P>
<P>
The high-speed train which Chevenement was riding in had to be
evacuated and searched when it arrived at the railway station of
Rennes, the capital of Brittany, but no bomb was found on the
train, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a nationalist group in Brittany named Emgann issued
a communique declaring the interior minister as ``persona non
grata'' in Brittany, a historically Celtic region.
</P>
<P>
``The coming of the interior minister in Morbidan (in southern
Brittany) for his vacation makes up a provocation,'' AFP quoted
Emgann as saying.
</P>
<P>
The group accused Chevenement of denying Britanny its cultural
identity, opposing ``democratization'' in Corsica and defaming the
German people.
</P>
<P>
Chevenement stunned the public opinion two months ago by
accusing Germany of being not ``cured of Nazism'' and always
dreaming of a ``Holy Roman-Germanic Empire.''
</P>
<P>
He also disagrees with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin over a plan
to give Corsica more political autonomy.

<HEADLINE> WHO Accuses Tobacco Firms of Undermining Battle Against Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
has accused cigarette manufacturers of trying to sabotage its
efforts to combat smoking.
</P>
<P>
Releasing a report entitled Tobacco Company Strategies to
Undermine Tobacco Control Activities at the World Health
Organization here Wednesday, WHO spokesman David Nabarro said that
the report was particularly worrying because "it suggests that a
small number of companies have attempted to subvert the process by
which the WHO is run".
</P>
<P>
In the report compiled by a WHO panel of experts, led by
Director of the Swiss Public Health Office Thomas Zeltner,
concluded that tobacco companies had engaged in "systematic
efforts" to "undermine and subvert" the WHO's anti-smoking
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The report is likely to provide the WHO with useful ammunition
in its attempts to persuade countries to sign up to the world's
first international treaty to curb smoking and ban cigarette
advertising.
</P>
<P>
The report states that "the attempted subversion had been
elaborate, well-financed, sophisticated and usually invisible". It
alleges that cigarette manufacturers tried to cut its budget, pit
other United Nations agencies against it, and distort results of
important scientific studies on tobacco.
</P>
<P>
Much of the information contained in the report comes from
tobacco company documents, which were made public after lawsuits
against the firms in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Derek Yach of WHO's anti-tobacco initiative, was quoted as
saying that the agency was shocked that "so much of this work was
done under cover. The scale of the intensity and the volume of all
these activities are really disturbing".
</P>
<P>
In a specific case, the WHO report alleged that top executives
from the tobacco giant, Philip Morris, had devised a plan to
contain, neutralize and reorient" the agency's anti-tobacco
initiatives, at a secret meeting in Boca Raton, Florida, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The WHO claims that many of the tactics agreed at this meeting
were still being implemented.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Earns Another 387 Million Dollars in U.N."Oil-for-Food" Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraq exported some 387
million U.S. dollars worth of oil last week, the latest figures
from the United Nations Office of Iraq Program said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Office, which administers the U.N. humanitarian "oil-for-
food" program, reported that humanitarian supplies and equipment
for Iraq's oil industry continued to arrive normally during the
period from July 22 to 28.
</P>
<P>
Food deliveries included wheat, cooking oil, sugar and tea, and
a range of pharmaceutical products was also delivered , along with
detergents, tractors, herbicides, fertilizers, a refrigeration van,
a firefighting vehicle, classroom furniture, sanitation equipment
and other supplies, the Office said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the United Nations Security Council sanctions
committee monitoring the sanctions against Iraq approved six new
contracts for the sale of oil, bringing the total number of
approved contracts to 86, with a volume of over 353 million
barrels at market value, the Office said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Security Council resolution establishing the oil-for-
food program, 66 percent of earning goes to fund the country's
humanitarian needs and 30 percent is directed to the Compensation
Commission which pays claims arising from Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The remainder goes to pay the costs of the U.N. Monitoring
Verification and Inspection Commission and U.N. operational costs.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions against Iraq cannot be lifted until the United
Nations clarifies that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. arm inspectors have been away from Iraq since the U.S.
-led military air strikes against the country in December 1998.

Manoel de Almeida e Silva, the U.N. spokesman, told a press
conference that the confirmation was contained in Annan's letter
to the president of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the U.N. Security Council Sanctions Committee
on Sierra Leone, Anwarul Chowdhury who is the permanent
representative of Bangladesh to the United Nations, announced at
the press conference here Tuesday that the panel will be headed by
Martin Chungong Ayafor of Cameroon and the other four members are
from Belgium, Canada, India and Senegal.
</P>
<P>
Other members are Ian Smillie, a diamond expert from Canada,
Johan Peleman, an expert on arms and transportation from Belgium,
Harjit Singh Sandhu, an expert from Interpol and an Indian
national, and Atabou Bodian, an expert from the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and a national of Senegal.
</P>
<P>
Diamonds are at the heart of tragedy in Sierra Leone, where a
thriving gems-for-guns business fan the hard-to-end warfare.
</P>
<P>
The panel will report back to the sanctions committee by the
end of October, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions committee is similar to one that looked into
conflict involving Angola's UNITA rebels and concluded a report
last May.
</P>
<P>
Chowdhury said his own committee would fully probe allegations
leveled Monday by U.S. and British diplomats that Burkina Faso and
Liberia were fueling Sierra Leone's civil war and profiting from
its accompanying trade in arms and diamonds.
</P>
<P>
The panel composition was announced at the end of the two-day
public hearing on illicit diamonds trade in Sierra Leone, which,
the first of its kind, were requested by a July 5 Security Council
resolution imposing an global embargo on diamonds exports from the
West African country for at least 18 months unless the gems are
certified by the government.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leading Economic Indicators Unchanged in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Composite Index of Leading
Economic Indicators in the United States was unchanged in June,
indicating that the nation's economy is cooling, The Conference
Board said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a prominent business research group, said
in a survey that the leading index remains at 106.00 in June,
after a 0.1 percent decline in May and no change in April.
</P>
<P>
"The leading indicators are cooling off from the rapid pace
registered at the end of last year," said Conference Board
Economist Ken Goldstein. "This is not the kind of performance to
be expected when Gross Domestic Product grows by 5.2 percent, as
it did in the second quarter of 2000."
</P>
<P>
Goldstein said some unusual influences are having an impact on
the leading indicators, especially the interplay between the bond
market and the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since
June last year in an effort to cool off the U.S. economy. The
latest number of the leading index may have a role in a decision
about whether the Central Bank will raise rates again at the
August 22 meeting.
</P>
<P>
The stronger-than-expected economic growth in the second
quarter, which runs against other indicators that showed the
slowing economy after six rate hikes, sparked fears of more rate
hikes.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said the flat pace in the leading
indicators in the recent months clearly pointed to moderating
momentum in the pace of economic activity. Among the ten
indicators that make up the leading index, only four rose in June.
</P>
<P>
The index, an important gauge of the U.S. economic activity for
next three to six months, stood at 100 in 1996, its base year.

<HEADLINE> Irish PM Says Won't Free IRA Killers of Policeman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The position is as it's always been. There's been no change in
the circumstances," a Reuters report monitored here quoted Ahern
as saying in Dublin, the Irish capital.
</P>
<P>
Ahern made the comment shortly after Sinn Fein, the political
ally of IRA, is arguing that the four should be freed as part of
an early release scheme for paramilitary prisoners caught up in
Northern Ireland's bloody conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Irish prime minister is standing firm on his refusal to
free the killers of police detective Jerry McCabe in what is a
highly emotive case in the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
He brushed off speculation of a legal challenge to try to
secure the release of the IRA men, saying it would be dealt with
if and when it happened.
</P>
<P>
A Dublin court in 1999 sentenced the four people into prison
after they pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of McCabe.
</P>
<P>
McCabe was shot dead while escorting a postal van carrying 81,
000 Irish pounds (about 94,350 United States dollars) in the
western Irish town of Adare in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The four killers in military fatigues jumped out of a jeep
which had rammed McCabe's police car. One fired a burst of shots
into the car without warning. Three shots hit McCabe, who died
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Last week, British police released a number of guerrillas, in a
bid to bolster Northern Ireland's peace drive.
</P>
<P>
The early release scheme applied to guerrillas belonging to
groups on ceasefire and supporting the landmark 1998 Good Friday
peace accord.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Strongly Deplores Violence in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Wednesday strongly deplored the violence in Kashmir
and urged for maximum restraint to prevent any further escalation.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the spokesman's office said " The
Secretary-General has learned with great dismay about the series
of overnight massacres in Kashmir in which reportedly 93 people,
mostly Hindu pilgrims and other civilians, have been killed."
</P>
<P>
"He strongly deplores this violence and calls for maximum
restraint to prevent any further escalation," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"He reiterates his call for an end to terrorist attacks
wherever they may occur," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief once again urged India and Pakistan to find an
early political solution to the Kashmir problem.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, a wave of violence that
began Tuesday evening with an attack by suspected Islamic
guerrillas left more then 90 people dead in less than in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
In the first and worst attack, gunmen opened fire on unarmed
Hindu pilgrims and Muslim porters on their way to a revered
religious shrine near Pahalgam, 55 miles south of Kashmir's
summer capital, Srinagar.

<HEADLINE> Central African Students Occupy Embassy For 5th Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Students from the Central African
Republic continued their occupation of their embassy in Moscow for
the fifth day Wednesday, demanding the payment of overdue stipends.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the action said they have not received stipends
for 18 months and they were forced to get obtain money from
relatives or borrowing from students from other countries, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
There are some 25 people in the embassy, which occupies two
apartments in an apartment block in southwest Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The students say they do not have any contacts with the
ambassador because "he has nothing to do with it." Instead, they
telephoned their education minister who allegedly promised to pay
at least part of the money "today or tomorrow, but in any case
this week."
</P>
<P>
The students, who started the occupation last Saturday, have
refused to disclose the size of their stipends or the total sum of
the arrears, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Raise Export Duties on Gasoline, Diesel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia will increase the export
duties on gasoline and diesel fuel to 25 euros per ton as of
September 15, Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The resolution on the increase has been drafted and the new
duties will take effect one month after Prime Minister Mikhail
Kasyanov signs the resolution, the Interfax news agency quoted
Khristenko as saying following a meeting of the commission on
trade and tariff policy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Khristenko said the government would not modify its
basis for monitoring crude oil prices and therefore the export
duty on crude oil will continue to be calculated based on the
price of Urals crude. Khristenko had said earlier that Brent crude
might be used to monitor prices.
</P>
<P>
The export duties on gasoline and diesel are being increased in
order to ensure adequate supplies on the domestic market. Exports
of those products are now so lucrative that a shortage could
result, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khristenko said the higher export duties will generate 20
million U.S. dollars a month in supplementary revenues for the
federal budget.
</P>
<P>
The current export duty is 20 euros a ton for gasoline and 15
euro a ton for diesel, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Venture Capital Investment Still Hot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A report released Wednesday
said that the effect of April's public market shake-out in the
United States on venture capital-backed company valuations as a
whole was relatively insignificant.
</P>
<P>
Venture-backed companies raised 17.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1,
054 rounds of financing in the second quarter this year, according
to the report from San Francisco-based venture capital research
firm VentureOne.
</P>
<P>
Although both deal flow and the amount invested decreased
mildly this quarter, by 3 percent and 6 percent, respectively-
overall venture investment for the first half of the year is close
to the total for all of 1999, and Internet-specific investment has
already exceeded last year's total, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Information technology (IT) companies had their strongest
quarter ever. Investment in this industry group rose 10 percent
from last quarter, to 10 billion dollars. Every segment within IT
saw an increase in activity, with communications, information
services and software setting particularly impressive records.
Venture capital investment in IT now stands at more than twice the
level it had attained at this time last year.
</P>
<P>
Venture-backed companies raised a record of 17.8 billion
dollars in 1,040 rounds of financing in the first quarter,
according to VentureOne.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Home Sales Fall in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new homes in the
United States fell 3.7 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 829,000 units, the lowest level in more than two
years as rising mortgage rates sapped home demands, the Commerce
Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The June decline was the third straight monthly drop in new
home sales, pushing the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate down
to the lowest since December 1997.
</P>
<P>
New home sales had fallen 0.9 percent in May and were off 8.2
percent in April, reflecting the impact of the Federal Reserve's
campaign to push interest rates higher in an effort to slow the
economy. Year-on-year, new home sales in June were down 12.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Mortgage rates hit a five-year high of 8.64 percent in mid-May,
although they have been dropping a bit in recent weeks. Last week,
the nationwide average for 30-year mortgages was 8.13 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline in home sales pushed the price of new homes down in
June.
</P>
<P>
The median sales price, the midpoint where half the homes sold
for more and half for less, dropped 1.4 percent to 159,000 U.S.
dollars in June, down from 161,200 dollars in May. That was the
lowest median sales price since August 1999, when it was 154,900
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The average price of a new home sold in June was 196,300
dollars, down 1 percent from a May average of 198,300 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sales were down in every region of the country in June except
the West, where they posted a 0.5 percent increase to an annual
sales rate of 220,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Sales fell the most in the Midwest, down 7 percent to a rate of
133,000 units, the slowest sales pace since September 1997. Sales
were off 5.1 percent in the South to an annual rate of 408,000
units and dropped 1.5 percent in the Northeast to an annual rate
of 67,000 units.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Firms Try to Foil U.N. Anti-Smoking Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Philip Morris and other
tobacco firms worked for years to discredit the World Health
Organization (WHO) and thwart its anti-smoking efforts, the agency
said in a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 240-page report accused the tobacco industry of working to
pit other United Nations-affiliated agencies against the WHO, of
trying to discredit the WHO and cut its budgets, and of hiring
supposedly independent experts who grossly distorted the results
of scientific research into the effects of smoking, according to
The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
It also charged that tobacco companies secretly placed their
own consultants at the Geneva-based agency to monitor its anti-
smoking activities, and even secretly monitored some meetings and
obtained confidential documents.
</P>
<P>
The report was written by a committee led by Thomas Zeltner,
director of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, that
included three other international experts on public health and
government relations. Much of its information came from tobacco
company documents made public through U.S. court proceedings.

<HEADLINE> Nepalese PM Invites Indian Industry to Set Up Base in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Nepalese Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala said here on Wednesday that the Indo-Nepal Trade
Treaty reflected India's understanding of Nepal's need to increase
exports and invited Indian industry to take advantage of the
treaty to set up production bases in the Himalayan kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"The Nepal-India Trade Treaty is guided by the principle of
mutual benefit and reflects India's understanding of Nepal's need
to increase exports through increased investments and expansion of
production base," Koirala was quoted by the Press Trust of India (
PTI) as saying in his address to the Confederation of Indian
Industry.
</P>
<P>
Koirala, who arrived here on Monday evening on a week-long
official visit, described his visit as a confidence-building
measure, said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
India-Nepal ties came under strain following the hijacking of
an Indian Airlines aircraft from Kathmandu to Afghanistan on
December 24 last year.
</P>
<P>
The trade treaty had given shape to a long-term mutually
beneficial economic cooperation between the two countries, Koirala
noted.
</P>
<P>
He assured Indian investors that Kathmandu would offer all
support and facilities to Indian subsidiaries in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The Nepalese prime minister and his delegation continued to
hold "intensive parleys" with Indian leaders and officials on
Wednesday, during which both countries reiterated their
determination to work closely to fight terrorism, a senior
official with India's External Affairs Ministry was quoted as
saying by the PTI.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also agreed to expedite the process of
border delineation and India has responded favorably to Nepal's
plea for a waiver of special additional customs duty of four
percent imposed by it on Nepalese goods, the official added.
</P>
<P>
On its part, Kathmandu has agreed to allow import of Indian
cars subject to self certification by Indian manufacturers and the
vehicles being Euro-1 compliant, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report by the PTI, official sources were quoted
as saying that Koirala had canceled his proposed three-day visit
to Bangalore, a booming hi-tech city in south India, which was
scheduled to begin on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Top-seeded Agassi Ousted in Canadian TMS Tournament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Top-seeded Andre Agassi was ousted
Tuesday in the first round of the Tennis Masters Series (TMS)
tournament at York University in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
The three-time champion failed to advance to the quarter-finals
as he suffered in a 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-6) loss to lightweight
Jerome Golmard of France.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time for the flamboyant American to suffer a
first round loss in 10 Canadian appearances since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The loss was his first against Golmard, who previously met
Agassi in the third-round Wimbledon in Rome last year and at the
Australian Open in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Whether you won last year or last week, it doesn't matter.
What matters is today, and today he played better than I did,"
said Agassi, who won the Canadian tournament in 1992, 1994 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
This was Agassi's first tournament since Wimbledon on July 7,
when he lost to Patrick Rafter in five sets. Agassi suffered a
back injury in a minor car accident after Wimbledon and withdrew
from both the U.S. Davis Cup semifinal and last week's Mercedes-
Benz Cup.
</P>
<P>
It was also a hard day for Pete Sampras as well, as the No. 2
seed dropped the first set before rebounding for a 5-7, 6-2, 7-6 (
7-4) decision with qualifier Michael Llodra of France.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, recovering from a shin injury, admitted that "it was a
match where I didn't feel I was in control."
</P>
<P>
"It's not an easy match, first one out. It's a match where I'm
not going to get a lot of rhythm," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sampras will face Karim Alami of Morocco in second-round action
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The TMS tournament, formerly known as the Canadian Open, was
opened Monday night and continues until Tuesday.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Jeff Tarango, 31, was named
Tuesday to join Andre Agassi as the oldest member in the U.S. men'
s Olympic tennis squad.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the U.S. men's team will range from Agassi who owns the
career Grand Slam, to Tarango, better known for his tantrums than
for his play.
</P>
<P>
Also going to the Sydney Olympic Games are two veterans of
Michael Chang, who won his only Grand Slam title 11 years ago, and
Todd Martin, who has struggled since reaching the U.S. Open final
last year. Jared Palmer and Alex O'Brien will play for the doubles.
</P>
<P>
Missing are Pete Sampras, who won Wimbledon last month, and Jan-
Michael Gambill. Both declined to play, leaving a spot for the
81st-ranked Tarango, the team's oldest player.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A Boeing 767-400ER airplane, the
newest member in the 767 fleet, landed tonight at Urumqi, the
capital of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, northwest China, with
more than 40 passengers on an around-the-world tour that will take
the plane to 17 cities and four continents.
</P>
<P>
As part of a month-long tour starting on July 10, the plane
will have flight demonstrations in Urumqi, Shanghai, Beijing, and
Haikou, capital city of south China's Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
The fuselage of twin-aisle 767-400ER is about 201 feet, 21 feet
longer than that of 767-300ER.
</P>
<P>
It can accommodate 245 to 375 passengers with the maximum
distance 10,460 kilometers. The plane features aerodynamic
improvements such as the innovative new raked wing tips, increased
takeoff weight capability, a new upgraded flight deck with liquid
crystal displays and all-new main landing gear. The first Boeing
767-400ER is scheduled to be sent to the Delta Air Lines of U.S.
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"Taking the Boeing 767-400ER directly to our customers gives
them the opportunity to experience the comfort of the new-look
interior, to see for themselves how well it performs and discover
how the 767-400ER can fit into their operations," said John
Quinlivan, Boeing 767 Program vice president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
As a leading airplane manufacturer in the world, Boeing Company
has customers in about 145 countries and areas. It has around 190,
000 employees with total revenue of 58 billion US dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
Boeing entered China's market in 1972 and has been carrying out
cooperation with China in different fields since then. It has
produced 334 planes for airline companies in mainland China,
accounting for 67 percent of the total owned by these companies,
according to statistics released in February this year.
</P>
<P>
So far, Chinese factories in Shanghai, Xi'an, Chengdu and
Shenyang can build assemblies and components.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the some portion of important assemblies
and components of about 3,100 Boeing airplanes now in service are
made in China.

<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Beijing police disclosed today
suspects from outside of the capital were 5.6 percent less than
the year-ago period, a decrease for the first time since the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, city police caught some 180,000
of China's "floating population" in the capital with no legal ID
cards, no long-contract jobs and no regular places to stay.
</P>
<P>
Police also intensified their surveillance on rented apartments.
During the investigation, the local police caught 6,903 suspects,
303 criminals, uncovered 373 criminal gangs and 4,487 criminal
cases.
</P>
<P>
While the city government has strengthened law publicity
activities of China's "floating population", crimes committed by
people from other provinces in Beijing accounted for 54.8 percent
in the first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
People from other provinces, especially those working as
temporary laborers in Beijing, have disrupted the city's social

<HEADLINE> Serious Drought Hits Northeast China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Drought has affected more than
three quarters of summer crops in Northeast China's Liaoning
province as rain fall dropped to only half the average level since
May.
</P>
<P>
The most severe drought in the century has destroyed 80 percent
of crops in the western part of the province, where more than two
million people and 900,000 cattle are short of drinking water.
Villagers have to go several kilometers to fetch water.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 small and medium-sized reservoirs in the province
have dried up. Almost all rivers in western part of the province
have dried up.
</P>
<P>
Water shortages have spread from rural areas to the cities. The
largest reservoir in the province has only enough water to sustain
Shenyang, the capital, and Fushun city for three months.
</P>
<P>
Water supplies for agricultural production have suspended.
</P>
<P>
Chaoyang, Fuxin, Yingkou and other cities in the province have
already imposed water restrictions. Huludao city in the eastern
part of the province will have no drinking water by mid-August if
there is no rainfall.
</P>
<P>
The province has spent 300 million yuan to sink wells and
transport drinking water. The provincial government has recently
allocated 46 million yuan of emergency funds to relief farmers in
drought-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Provincial officials said that the drought will greatly reduce
grain output this year and leave more than one million farmer
under on the brink of poverty.
</P>
<P>
They said that the province will face great difficulties in
keeping these farmers warm and fed in the coming winter.

<HEADLINE> Summer Camp Helps Overseas Children Learn Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 60 overseas Chinese
children gathered in Beijing today to attend a special summer camp
which will help them learn standard Chinese language and Chinese
culture.
</P>
<P>
They came from the United States, Canada, Germany, Britain, the
Netherlands and Japan to attend the activity, which is sponsored
by the Overseas Edition of the "People's Daily".
</P>
<P>
"It is the second time for us to participate in summer camp,"
said ten-year-old Angle Wang, who came to Beijing with her father
and seven-year-old brother.
</P>
<P>
"Both my brother and I enjoy studying Chinese here in the
summer camp, " said the girl. She was born in Beijing and went to
live with her parents in Canada when she was three years old. As a
result of regular practice, she can speak fluent Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"To provide opportunities for overseas children to learn two
languages and different cultures will help them become more
competitive in the age of global economic integration," said Angle
's father Wang Yaohui, who wrote a book to describe his struggles
to success in different cultural backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
One of the organizers of the activity said that overseas
Chinese families are very concerned with the Chinese education of
their children. More than 90 percent of overseas Chinese children
understand Chinese, but some can only speak and cannot write
Chinese. The summer camp will help them learn more about Chinese
language and culture.
</P>
<P>
During the coming ten days, children who have attended the
summer camp will take Chinese lessons, take part in parties with
local children, and visit the Great Wall, the Summer Palace and
other places in Beijing and Chengde, a summer resort city in Hebei
Province.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Iranian FMs Discuss Jerusalem Issue by Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of Egypt and
Iran on Wednesday held talks by phone on Jerusalem, a holy city
whose fate proved to be the stumbling block in the latest
Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Amr Moussa of Egypt and Kamal Kharrazi of Iran discussed the
fate of Jerusalem, especially after the Palestinians and Israel
failed to reach a settlement at the Camp David summit held in the
United States, said a statement released by Iran's interest section
in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers examined possible steps their countries may
take towards helping resolve the dispute within the framework of
the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the statement
added. It did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Iran, who currently holds the OIC rotating presidency, is
reportedly to send envoys to Arab and Islamic countries in the
world in the coming days for talks on the fate of Jerusalem. Tehran
has opposed the Middle East peace process and called for armed
struggle to liberate the "Arab and Islamic lands" occupied by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
This was the second telephone conversation in as many days
between Moussa and Kharrazi to deal with Jerusalem issue in
particular, as the two countries were making efforts to improve
their severed relations.
</P>
<P>
Arab and Islamic countries support the Palestinian stand that
Israel should return Arab East Jerusalem it occupied in the 1967
Mideast War. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of
their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has insisted that Jerusalem is its "eternal and
indivisible" capital, a claim not recognized internationally.

<HEADLINE> Bahamian-Flagged Ship Allowed to Cross Turkish Straits Conditionally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Authorities has allowed
the Bahamian-flagged ship "Enterprise", which was not permitted to
pass through the Turkish Straits, to cross the straits
conditionally, the Anatolia News Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The overlong ship, the flag of which is Bahamian not Romanian as
it was earlier stated, has been ordered to deposit one million U.S.
dollars as a safety guarantee and take necessary security measures
before crossing the narrow and traffic-busy straits.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish authorities said any ship whose length is more than
300 meters should get a report, which sets the conditions for a
safe passage, from either the Turkish Maritime Undersecretariat or
Istanbul Sea Traffic Control-Order Authority. "Enterprise" is 312
meters in overall length.
</P>
<P>
These conditions had been conveyed to the officials of the ship,
which was on its way from Australia to Constanta port of Romania,
transporting 192,554 tons of iron ore. But the officials on board
ignored the advice.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials clarified that "Enterprise", which began to
anchor in the sea off the Dardanelles on July 16, should be
accompanied by five tugboats and one fire boat and guided by a
pilot captain.
</P>
<P>
If the ship fulfils the conditions as required, the traffic in
the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits will be closed in two ways
during its passage, they added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is surrounded by the sea on three sides: the
Mediterranean in the south, the Aegean in the west and the Black
Sea in the north. The three seas are linked by the straits,
consisting from southwest to northeast, of the Dardanelles, the Sea
of Marmara and the Bosphorus.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Iran Sign Natural Gas Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkey signed here Wednesday a
protocol with Iran to buy natural gas from Iran, Turkey's Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the protocol, Turkey will start purchasing 3
billion cubic metres of gas annually from Iran as of July 30, 2001
through a pipeline linking Iran's northwestern Tabriz with Ankara,
which is still under construction.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was finalized by Gokhan Yardim, director general of
Turkey's state-owned pipeline company BOTAS and Iranian Deputy Oil
Minister Mohammed Nejat who is on a two-day visit to Ankara
starting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is trying to overcome its energy shortage by importing
natural gas from Russia, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Under a 1996 agreement, Turkey pledged to buy natural gas from
Iran over 23 years.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had planned to complete its section of the pipeline by
January 1, 1999. But it failed to meet the deadline and has said
the pipeline will not be completed by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
With U.S. backing, Turkey is pursuing a multi-million-dollar
pipeline project to carry natural gas from Turkmenistan through the
Caspian Sea to Western markets via a conduit through Georgia and
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, an arch rival of Iran, has voiced opposition
to the Turkish-Iranian deal on the grounds that it was a rival to
the trans-Caspian pipeline.
</P>
<P>
To appease Washington, Ankara has repeatedly said trans-Caspian
pipeline is a priority and even postponed the construction of the
Tabriz-Ankara pipeline.
</P>
<P>
But the trans-Caspian pipeline seems a long-term project whose
completion is nowhere in sight. Ever-growing energy demands
prompted Ankara to complete the project with Iran as well as
another one with Russia, which includes the construction of a new
gas pipeline beneath the Black Sea linking Russia and Turkey,
namely the Blue Stream.
</P>
<P>
The project, which started in February, was expected to deliver
365 billion cubic metres of gas from Russia to Turkey over 25 years
from 2001.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Turkey was rebuilding the Tarutina Compressor
station within its border with Ukraine to increase the capacity of
the current natural gas pipeline via Ukraine from Russia to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline carries 16 billion cubic meters of natural gas from
Russia to Turkey one year. With the operation of the compressor
station to be started in the fourth quarter of this year, the
capacity of the pipeline will increase by 3.8 billion cubic meters.

<P>
Caday underwent a successful operation at midnight Tuesday on
the multiple fractures and wounds he sustained in the explosion,
the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Joseph Estrada, who is on the last leg of
a 10-day working visit in the United States, in a press statement
said that he strongly condemned this barbaric act and expressed
the resolve to "fight terrorism in all forms wherever it might
take place."
</P>
<P>
"Once again the ugly head of terrorist forces has taken the
lives and injured hardworking diplomatic representatives of the
Philippines, "the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said formal reports from the Indonesian government are being
awaited from intelligence services as to who is responsible for
the despicable act.
</P>
<P>
He added: "I fully commiserate with the families of the
deceased and we are thankful to God that the life of Ambassador
Leonides Caday, one of our most senior and efficient diplomats,
has been spared."
</P>
<P>
The doctors of Caday performed on him a three-hour operation
where metal pins were inserted to connect the five leg fractures
he sustained, the DFA said.
</P>
<P>
The DFA also said Caday suffered bruises in his head, hands and
upper body, as well as burns in his hand and hair, adding the
ambassador was conscious all throughout the operation as only
local anesthesia was applied.

<P>
The governor of Jakarta as well as top military and police
officials visited Caday Tuesday night to extend all the support
and assistance that may be required, the DFA said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> ADB Funds Project to Repair East Timor's Water System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said Wednesday that it has approved a project to repair East Timor
's badly-damaged water supply infrastructure and to re-establish
institutions and systems to operate the sector.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here, the ADB said the project will
be
financed by a 4.5-million-U.S. dollar grant from the Trust Fund
for East Timor and managed by ADB. The Fund has been established
with contributions from many donors.
</P>
<P>
The project will establish a water sector management and
investment program, including setting up a project management unit
under the United Nations Transitional Administration's Water and
Sanitation Authority, the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
East Timor's recent conflict saw the extensive destruction of
most infrastructure, including town and village water supply and
sanitation facilities. Houses were burned down and water
connections and meters were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The total need for rehabilitating the sector is estimated at
almost 40 million dollars for the fiscal year 2001-2003, with
between 12 million dollars to 15 million dollars expected from the
Trust Fund, the Manila-based multilateral financial body said.
</P>
<P>
With current funds being allotted to various sectors, only 4.5
million dollars can be made available for the financial year 2000-
2001. As more funds become available, a follow-up project may be
developed, it added.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Russian general said
Wednesday that the country's federal troops have killed nearly 14,
000 Chechen rebels in the past year, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The announcement by Deputy Chief of the General Staff General
Valery Manilov coincided with the one-year anniversary of the
start of anti-terrorist operations in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The military campaign was launched after two waves of armed
Chechen incursions into neighboring Dagestan and a series of
apartment building explosions that left over 300 people dead in
Moscow and two other cities.
</P>
<P>
Manilov said the federal units were confronted by "a well-
manned, armed, equipped and trained terrorist army of about 26,000
men, of whom over 5,000 were mercenaries."
</P>
<P>
At the start of the operation, the rebels had nearly 30 tanks,
over 60 combat vehicles and armored personnel carriers, 15 self-
propelled anti-aircraft systems, a battery of multiple rocket
launchers, and over 20 pieces of large caliber artillery and
mortars, according to the general.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the rebel forces have been defeated, but small
rebel groups totaling nearly 2,000 men, about 500 of them
mercenaries, are continuing to fight against the federal units, he
said.

BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Archeologists said that the Han
Dynasty (206 BCE-220 AD) tomb under excavation in western suburbs
of Beijing may have been looted a long time ago as they found
today two tunnels dug by looters on the outer walls of the tomb.
</P>
<P>
However, the looters might have stolen only a few small-sized
relics from the tomb because both tunnels are wide enough for only
one person to squeeze through, said archeologists. They believe
that they will make some amazing discoveries when they open the
tomb's inner chamber.
</P>
<P>
The tomb was found as police seized several people who tried to
loot the tomb earlier this year. It is the second largest tomb of
the Han Dynasty found in Beijing, following the Dabaotai tomb in
southwestern suburbs of the city.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Financial Secretary of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Donald Tsang said
Wednesday that service sector is a great resource for overseas
companies wishing to do business in China's mainland, according to
report from Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Tsang is currently on a visit to Australia.
</P>
<P>
Services accounted for about 85 percent of Hong Kong's gross
domestic product (GDP) but only 40 percent of China's GDP came
from services, said Tsang in a keynote luncheon speech at a
seminar on opportunities arising from China's accession to the
World Trade Organization during his visit to Australia.
</P>
<P>
"There will obviously be a large shortfall of skilled
professionals and services staff in China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has flexible, well-educated and bilingual workforce
to make up the shortfall, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a robust and respected legal system, a level playing
field for business, and a free flow of information," said Tsang.
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary said Hong Kong would also be able to
leverage its position as an international financial center as the
mainland market became more open.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign direct investment in China is estimated to increase
from its current level of about 40 billion U.S. dollars to as much
as 100 billion U.S. dollars annually by 2005," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This huge increase will undoubtedly create opportunities for
funds to be raised in Hong Kong which is already an established
and sophisticated international financial center," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan held talks here today with three foreign ministers of the
Rio Group, Guillermo Fernandez de Soto of Columbia, Rosario Green
of Mexico and Soledad Alvear of Chile.
</P>
<P>
The two sides exchanged views extensively on the relations
between China and the Rio Group and international issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
Tang spoke positively of the important role of the Rio Group in
maintaining peace and stability in the Latin American region,
promoting the internal friendly cooperation among Latin American
countries, and in handling international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said China has always highly valued the important role of
the Rio Group, and considered the Group as an important political
force among developing countries and a reliable partner in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, China has maintained good cooperation
with the Rio Group, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of political dialogue relations between
China and the Rio Group in 1990, nine foreign ministerial-level
talks have been conducted. The two sides had a broad and in-depth
exchange of views on China--Latin America relations and
international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Tang said China feels that dialogue and cooperation with the
Rio Group over the past decade has been positive and the Chinese
side is fully satisfied with the result.
</P>
<P>
The three foreign ministers of the Rio Group expressed that
they are glad to have the opportunity to celebrate with China the
10th anniversary of the establishment of the political dialogue
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the political dialogue between the two sides
have been fruitful, that mutual understanding has been further
deepened and that dialogue and coordination have been widened.
</P>
<P>
The three foreign ministers noted that developing friendly
cooperation with China has become an important consensus among the
members of the Rio Group.
</P>
<P>
On international issues, Tang said the world is developing
toward multi-polarization, which is conducive to establishing a
just and reasonable international political order. All these
factors are helpful in developing and promoting world peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
It is also in line with the common aspiration of the majority
of the international community, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the developing countries are paying more and more
attention to unite themselves and safeguard their own rights and
interests, adding that developing countries are the major force in

helpful to the balance, peace, and development in the world.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the economic globalization will have a different
impact on countries at different stages of their development. He
added that because of the irrationality of the current
international economic order and different economic strength and
development stages, the "dividend" of globalization has not been
divided evenly between developing and developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Tang said a global economy needs the cooperation from the
international community, adding that all nations of the world,
especially developing countries, should have equal rights to
participate in international economic issues.
</P>
<P>
The three foreign ministers pointed out that the economic
globalization brings both opportunities and challenges to
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
They told Tang that the Rio Group is willing to work with China
to meet the challenges, to eliminate poverty, and make
international economic issues more democratic and open.
</P>
<P>
On the human rights issue, Tang stressed that China and many
countries in Latin America share common views and have kept good
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is willing to further strengthen
dialogue with the Rio Group and countries in Latin America on
human rights issues to further mutual understanding, enhancing
mutual cooperation, promote the cause of human rights, and join
efforts in safeguarding the interests of developing countries,
Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The three foreign ministers noted that they agree with Tang on
this matter, reiterating that the Rio Group is opposed to
unilateral actions taken by certain countries that harm the
sovereignty of other countries and human rights issues.

BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- China and Japan have launched a
joint project to strengthen vaccination work in China's west
provinces and autonomous region including Shaanxi, Shanxi, Qinghai,
Gansu and Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi and Shanxi will take the initial lead.
</P>
<P>
Yin Dakui, vice minister of Health said the project will help
rural doctors in the country's western regions provide vaccination
services.
</P>
<P>
He noted that western region's vaccination services lag behind
state standards with frequent outbreaks of epidemics such as
measles. Hepatitis vaccinations in poverty-stricken areas are few
and far between.
</P>
<P>
Japan will send experts to China to provide technology
consultation, training, facilities and other materials.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health asked health departments to take
effective efforts to ensure that there are adequate funds and
equipment, as well as maintaining contacts with Japanese experts.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the project will largely improve
vaccination in China's western areas, help the quality of work of
rural doctors and improve the overall health level of children.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Call for Implementation of U.N. Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians on Wednesday called
for full implementation of the United Nations Security Council
resolutions in a bid to end the half-century Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
The only way to peace in the Middle East is the "honest
implementation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions 242 and
338," Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt Zohdi al Qedra said after a
meeting between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat in Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
Al Qedra criticized Israel for not honoring the resolutions of
international legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
The problem with the Israeli government is that it has always
evaded the responsibility to carry out the resolutions, which
demand that Israel withdraw from the Arab territories it occupied
in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, he was quoted as saying by Egypt's
Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in the Mediterranean port city earlier in the day
to brief Mubarak on his ongoing tour of Arab countries to rally
support for the Palestinian stands in peace talks with Israel. He
has visited Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Following his tete-a-tete meeting with Mubarak, Arafat held a
90-minute session of talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa at Borg el Arab airport, just outside Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the talks, Moussa reiterated Egypt's
support for a Palestinian state, which Arafat has said he may
declare on September 13, the deadline for Palestinian-Israeli final
status talks, even without a peace agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat left for Gaza after the talks without making statements.
He frequently visits Egypt to consult with Mubarak on the Mideast
peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Passes Early Election Bill in Preliminary Vote 1st lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- In the preliminary reading,
Israel's Knesset, or Parliament, Wednesday morning passed a bill
calling for dissolving the Knesset and holding a new election ,
dealing another blow to Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his peace
efforts.
</P>
<P>
A total of 61 Knesset members voted for the bill, submitted by
the major opposition Likud legislators Silvan Shalom and Limor
Livnat, while 51 voted against it and six legislators abstained,
Israeli television reported.
</P>
<P>
Although three more readings are required for the bill to go
into effect, the parliamentary vote again showed that Barak's
political strength is further shrinking after the botched Camp
David summit talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S.
President Bill Clinton last month.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the vote, Foreign Minister David Levy announced
his resignation from the cabinet due to Barak's "too much
concessions" at the Camp David peace talks, which aimed to reach an
Israeli-Palestinian agreement but failed to deliver the good
finally.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Barak's presidential candidate Shimon Peres also
suffered a humiliating defeat by Moshe Katsav, the Likud's underdog
candidate, in the Knesset's presidential secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
Barak's government narrowly survived an opposition-sponsored no-
confidence bill Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The early-election bill had been expected to be passed in
Wednesday's preliminary reading, as Barak's government now only
holds 40 seats in the 120-member Knesset after the withdrawal of
Levy and his two-seat Geshar party from the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the Camp David summit, 26 MKs from three right-wing
parties in Barak's ruling coalition, Shas, Yisrael Ba'aliya and
National Religious Party, already withdrew their support for Barak
because of his readiness to go to Camp David for the talks.
</P>
<P>
The government defeated an identical early-election motion in
the first reading in June, and at that time, it was said that the
oppositions will not be able to re-submit such a bill in another
six months.
</P>
<P>
However, considering the massive resignation from the government
and the controversial Camp David talks, Knesset Speaker Avraham
Burg last month agreed to the opposition's demand to resurrect the
bill.
</P>
<P>
To Barak's relief, the Knesset will begin its summer recess
after Wednesday's session and will not reconvene until October 30.
So now the prime minister has three most-needed months to form a
new and more solid coalition or to prepare for new elections.
</P>
<P>
Likud's Shalom, one of the early-election bill's sponsors, has
pledged that he will ask the Knesset to hold special sessions
during the recess to prepare for the early-election bill's further
readings.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Army Kills MKO Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- At least five members of the Iraq-
based Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO) were killed by Iran's
army when they tried to infiltrate into the Iranian territory, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The "terrorist" MKO members who were intending to infiltrate
into the Iranian territory were killed during a cross-border
conflict with the army units stationed in the border region of
Dehloran, an army statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement further added the MKO fired several mortars
from across the border, which resulted in the death of two Iranian
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In the operations, a number of weapons and ammunition were also
confiscated by the army personnel.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, a major political and military group which had fought
against the Iranian Shah regime before the 1979 Islamic revolution,
was outlawed in 1981 and fled into Iraq following sharp differences
with the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
Labeled by Iran as a "terrorist group," the MKO has launched
numerous cross-border attacks inside Iran in recent years,
including assassinating senior Iranian officials.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Hails IMF Decision to Resume its Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government has
hailed the decision by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to
restore the country's membership in the organization as a big step
that will promote the government's efforts to normalize its ties
with world financing institutions and to attract more foreign
investments.
</P>
<P>
The El-Alwan newspaper Wednesday quoted Foreign Minister Mustafa
Othman Ismail as saying that the resumption of Sudan's IMF
membership reflects the government's seriousness in implementing
its economic policies.
</P>
<P>
The executive authority of the IMF decided Tuesday at a meeting
held in Washington to lift the temporary ban imposed on Sudan which
deprived it of the voting rights and other advantages.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has said the decision was made in appreciation of the
economic progress achieved by the North African country since 1997,
as well as the country's efforts to resume the repayment of some of
its debts to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
In August 9, 1993, the IMF decided to impose a temporary ban on
granting loans to Sudan after it failed to repay about 1.48 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Former Finance Minister Abdel-Rahim Hamdi said the IMF decision
helps to reschedule Sudan's commercial and banking debts as well as
the IMF debts, which amount to billions of dollars. Besides, Sudan
will be able to join the debt exemption projects decided by the
donors countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the most concrete result of the decision is that it
has sent a signal to investors and international financing
institutions that Sudan is not economically isolated any more.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Ruling, Opposition Parties Gear Up for Battle Over New Draft Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government of
ruling People's Alliance (PA) and opposition parties have geared
up for a major battle over the new draft constitution which is
expected to be presented to the parliament on Thursday, party
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Sinhala Urumaya (heritage) and former
parliamentarian Tilak Karunaratne said that several moves are
being made behind the scenes to prevent the government from trying
to get a required two-thirds majority vote in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "I cannot disclose some of our planned
actions for tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Petitions have been filed in Sri Lanka's Supreme Court by the
Sinhala Urumaya, the main opposition United National Party (UNP),
Buddhist monks and the Center for Policy Alternatives to prevent
the government from presenting the new draft constitution to the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga on Monday
approved the draft constitution during a special cabinet meeting
and decided to present the draft to the parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government on Tuesday submitted the draft to the Supreme
Court for advice on the process of adoption. The court said
Wednesday that they will convey their decision to President
Kumaratunga and Parliamentary Speaker K.B. Ratnayake on Thursday
on the proposed new draft constitution.
</P>
<P>
The General Secretary of the PA, D.M. Jayaratne said the draft
would be presented on Thursday at a special parliamentary sitting
and taken up for debate on August 8 (next Tuesday).
</P>
<P>
Jayaratne said most minority Tamil parties had pledged support
to pass the draft constitution while the UNP said they were
awaiting a copy of the draft to determine their own stand on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The parliament, which is situated at Kotte in eastern suburban
Colombo, is expected to be tense on Thursday as the Buddhist monks
and the left-wing People's Liberation Front have threatened to
protest in front of the parliament, party officials said.
</P>
<P>
There has been a wide spate of protests against the government'
s new draft constitution which is widely believed to grant greater
autonomy to minority Tamils in the north and east where Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels have been waging a bloody war
against government troops since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The draft constitution aims to end the long-running civil war
by devolving more powers to regional councils and partly meeting
LTTE demand for an independent state called Eelam.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Tamil Rebels Accused of Conscripting 7-Year-Old Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government on
Wednesday accused Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels
of conscripting child soldiers as young as seven years old to
fight for the long-running separatist war.
</P>
<P>
A 14-year-old Tamil girl named Indira was forcibly taken away
by a LTTE cadre known as Tanam Akka to a rebel camp in 1993 when
she was only seven years old and was studying in Grade 2 at
Padathurapalli in Mankulam area in northern Sri Lanka, said a
statement issued by the government's Special Media Information
Center.
</P>
<P>
It said the girl had been trained to handle T56 rifle and hand
grenades. She was also given the cadre number Ena 2173 by the LTTE
rebels who have been fighting for a separate homeland called Eelam
in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The girl surrendered to government troops last month at
Nagarkovil in the northern Jaffna peninsula, the scene of weeks of
fierce fighting during April and May between government troops and
LTTE rebels who want to retake their former stronghold of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
Indira was quoted as saying that most of the 15 women LTTE
rebels in her group had been around her age and died during
fighting with government troops.

<HEADLINE> Strike Called in Nepal to Protest Against Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A general strike is observed
Wednesday in Kathmandu and two adjoining cities by an opposition
party to protest against a controversial citizenship bill.
</P>
<P>
Shops, schools, factories and some offices are closed while
traffic in the valley are suspended, with almost all vehicles off
the road, during the one-day strike called by the Communist Party
of Nepal-Marxist and Leninist (CPN-ML).
</P>
<P>
The few vehicles that dared to appear on roads were stoned by
the supporters of the strike, but no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
CPN-ML has denounced the recent government act of pushing
through a controversial citizenship bill because it will entitle
large numbers of Indians Nepalese citizenship and at the same time
opens the floodgates to influx of Indians through the 1700km-long
open border between Nepal and India.
</P>
<P>
The strike is also aimed at urging the government to take tough
measures against a 13.6 km-long barrage built by India recently
along Nepal-India border that was reported to have flooded some
Nepali villages in the border area.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 people become homeless due to the flood while
more villages and land will be affected during the monsoon season
from mid-June to September every year.

<HEADLINE> New Technique to Treat Tooth Decay Shown in Brussels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Dentists attending an
international conference here have learned a new technique to
repair damaged or decayed teeth which incorporates the use of
lasers, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Belgian dental experts said the new laser technique will soon
be used to remove tooth decay. Dentists were told they would not
have to anesthetize the area surrounding the damaged teeth as
often as they do now.
</P>
<P>
The laser therapy for teeth is virtually painless unless the
cavity is near the nerve, in which case it will still be necessary
to numb the gums.
</P>
<P>
The laser technique can also work preventively, according to
the experts. Tests have also shown that the parts of a tooth that
have been treated by laser are more resistant to decay.
</P>
<P>
Of the 8,000 dentists in Belgium, about 200 already use the
laser technique. However, this kind of dental treatment is very
expensive. Experts expect that further development of the
technique will lower costs.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that use of the painless laser technique for
treatment will be widespread throughout the world within 10 years.

WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in U.S. leading newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Texas Governor George W. Bush secured an enthusiastic
endorsement Tuesday night from his toughest primary opponents as
the Republican National Convention prepared to welcome him as the
worthy heir to the party's strong tradition of international
leadership.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. tobacco industry has been waging a sophisticated,
secret campaign for years to undermine efforts by the World Health
Organization to combat smoking around the globe, the agency
charges in a scathing report.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Preparing for renewed international negotiations on cutting
levels of heat-trapping gases, the United States is proposing that
countries get just as much credit for using forests and farmers'
fields to sop up carbon dioxide, the chief warming gas, as they
would for cutting emissions from smokestacks and tail pipes.
</P>
<P>
-- An elite cadre of 739 contributors, donating more money than
in the past, has provided two-thirds of the Republican Party's 137
million U.S. dollars in so-called soft money, the unrestricted
party gifts.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Telecom firms and regulators are worried there will not be
enough airwaves to meet the demand for wireless communication. The
industry and government are having difficulties buying or
persuading broadcasters to give up the frequencies they use to
transmit analog signals.
</P>
<P>
-- Philip Morris and other tobacco firms worked for years to
discredit the World Health Organization and thwart its antismoking
efforts, the WHO said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China Takes Tentative Step in Capital Market Opening (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Analysts pointed out that China has postponed its plan to open
its capital market after the Asian financial crisis. However, the
expected WTO accession and the economy's internal demand for
foreign investment may have forced the government to open its
capital market on an experimental and limited basis.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment has been a major factor behind China's high
economic growth in the last two decades and will remain so in the
foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
However, it is noted that foreign investment in China dropped
12.8 percent in 1999, the first negative increase in two decades.
</P>
<P>
Economists attributed the slide to new changes in international
capital flow and said China needs to adjust its policies.
</P>
<P>
In a global economy, acquisition and merging has been the major
form of direct foreign investment. So far, such form of investment
is not encouraged in China.
</P>
<P>
Many economic sectors in China, especially the service sector,
including banking and insurance services, are still closed to
foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China Takes Tentative Step in Capital Market Opening (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's regulators have reached a tentative conclusion that
they could open the country's capital market slightly as far as
the regulatory capacity allows so without causing serious damage
to the economy.
</P>
<P>
CSRC chairman Zhou Xiaochuan noted recently that institutional
investors now only hold 0.03 percent of stock investment accounts
in China and less than 11 percent of the stocks in terms of their
market value.
</P>
<P>
He said China needs to use "non-conventional and creatively
means" to bolster its institutional investors, mainly the mutual
fund sector.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, when regulators are talking of opening the capital
market, what they mean is opening to institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts asserted that China's economic goals and
strategies to restructure State-owned sector through the sale of
government stakes would mean a rapidly expanding securities market.
</P>
<P>
A regulated opening to foreign capital would be very helpful
for the stable and healthy development of the market, they said.

<HEADLINE> Returning Farmland to Forest Bringing Prosperity to Tibetan Farmers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- "Landslides have diminished since
the logging of forests has stopped. Our incomes are also growing,"
said Yan Muchu, a Tibetan farmer in Miyaluo Town of Lixian Country
in Southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Miyaluo means "Happy Land" in Tibetan. Most of the farmers
there are Tibetans. Situated in the Zagunao River Valley on the
upper reaches of the Yangtze River, Miyaluo used to be covered by
dense forests.
</P>
<P>
However, due to years of logging, much of the mountain slopes
became barren, causing serious soil erosion. Farmers also became
poorer and poorer.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China banned natural forest logging in the upper
reaches of the Yangtze and last year, Sichuan led the country to
turn crop land on mountain slopes back to forests.
</P>
<P>
Yan's family has 17 mu (1.13 ha) of farmland on mountain slopes
and has planted 12 mu of trees. Yan said that one mu of his
farmland can yield 150 kg of corn a year, but the land would
become useless after years of soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that the state gives us 150 kg of grain for

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China Takes Tentative Step in Capital Market Opening (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Increasing signs show that China
is taking its first tentative step towards partly opening its
capital market to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Tu Guangshao, secretary-general of the China Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said last week that the government is
considering allowing foreign institutional investors to purchase
Chinese-listed A share stocks on a limited basis.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded enterprises, so far shut out of China's
securities market, may also be allowed to list their stocks on
domestic bourses, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tu is the latest but certainly not the first senior official to
indicate a limited opening of the capital market, on the eve of
the China's expected accession to the World Trade Organization (
WTO).
</P>
<P>
Early this year, senior government officials in charge of
financial affairs clearly expressed support for the above-
mentioned measures.
</P>
<P>
Other choices on the list are encouraging overseas listings by
domestic enterprises, setting up Sino-foreign joint industrial and
venture capital funds as well as joint venture fund management
companies, and introducing foreign stakes in enterprises in
competitive sectors.

<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The majority of the Chinese
public agree with the principle of monogamy and gender equality
and are highly concerned with problems of extra-marital affairs
and domestic violence, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
"Around 95 percent of respondents said that extra-marital
affairs and family violence should be punishable by law," said
Ding Lu, an official with the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF).
</P>
<P>
The four-month survey conducted by ACWF paves the way for the
revision of the country's 1980 Marriage law, which doesn't mention
domestic family violence, nor cover extra-marital affairs.
</P>
<P>
The survey covered 10 provinces and cities including Beijing,
Guangdong and Sichuan, and there were 103 questions ranging from
marriage, divorce, to property and domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
Of the 4,000 people surveyed, aged 18 and above, 48.1 percent
were men and 51.9 percent women.

More than 80 to 90 percent of the respondents said they know
the principles of monogamy and gender equality in marriage.
</P>
<P>
Some 8.2 percent Chinese have had illicit sexual affairs
outside of their marriage, 2.4 percent have a concubine. Sixteen
percent said that prostitution is a problem in China, and the
figure is higher in urban areas, up to 21.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Although the number of illicit sexual affairs in China is much
lower than in the West, which stands at 60 percent for men and 25
percent for women, but it is rising fast in China," said Ding
</P>
<P>
"Such affairs destroy the fabric of marriages and threatens the
statutory principle of monogamy," she said. "It is a legal issue,"
she stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, 99.4 percent said that couples are
obligated to be faithful to each other. Only 0.6 percent disagreed
on this point. 91.8 percent said extra-marital affairs damage
marriage relations; 94.2 percent said bigamy and taking a mistress

Domestic violence occurs in some 30 percent of Chinese families.
Statistics from the ACWF showed that domestic violence rose from
1998's 15 percent to 18 percent in the second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The rise in domestic violence is due to women's increasing
economic dependence on men as the economy moves from a state-
planned one to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
The increase of extra-marital affairs leads to more quarrels in
which women are invariably disadvantaged, she said.
</P>
<P>
She also blamed lack of public attention concerning the rights
and interests of women. "The situation is gradually changing," she
said.

Only 5.1 percent surveyed said that "beating one's wife is no
one's business except their own," while 94.9 percent disagreed.

<HEADLINE> 10 Farmers Choked to Death in Northeastern Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Ten young farmers in Iran's
northeastern Khorasan Province were choked to death on Tuesday when
they descended a well and tried to deepen it, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Two of the victims descended the well, in a small village of 40
households, in order to deepen it for water, but they were poisoned
to death by gas, a local government official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The eight others, who were waiting for their friends to re-
emerge, were also poisoned by the gas when they tried to descend
the well, he added.
</P>
<P>
Due to a widespread drought that has severely hit Iran, the
well, which the whole village depends on, was on the verge of
drying up and had gathered gas, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Iran is suffering from a particularly dry summer this year that
has worsened the drought problem, which the country has been facing
since last year.
</P>
<P>
Drought has hit most parts of the country, inflicting heavy
damages. In some areas, riots even broke out due to the lack of
potable water.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Gives UNIFIL Green Light to Extend Deployment in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and
Prime Minister Salim Hoss have decided to give the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) green light to deploy throughout
south Lebanon along the border with Israel, An Nahar newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL command and the Lebanese army command will discuss the
timing of the extended deployment on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's lieutenant for peacekeeping
operations Bernard Millet flew in Tuesday night to oversee the last
stage of the UNIFIL deployment.
</P>
<P>
Millet is scheduled to meet with Hoss Wednesday before heading
to Naqoura, the UNIFIL headquarters, which is about 100 kilometers
south of Beirut. He is due to discuss with the UNIFIL command on
the time frame for the extended deployment operation, after which
he will go to Israel on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL troops have already fanned out in six locations of the
liberated zone and have yet to roll into 13 other locations to firm
up their control along the Lebanese side of the Blue Line, which
was drawn by the United Nations to verify Israel's withdrawal from
south Lebanon on May 24.
</P>
<P>
The An Nahar newspaper noted that the Yaroun verification was
made possible after UNIFIL's Ukrainian sappers Tuesday night
finished dismantling a total of 101 anti-personnel mines and 11
anti-tank mines left behind by Israeli troops after the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Michael Murr told reporters on Tuesday that a
task force of 500 Lebanese army troops and 500 policemen was
standing by to be deployed in the liberated zone 48 hours after
UNIFIL extends its own deployment.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Resigns From Barak's Government 2nd lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy resigned on Wednesday from the government led by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement at his office inside the Knesset
(parliament), Levy said he has submitted his resignation letter to
Barak Wednesday morning, in which he detailed his reasons for
resignation.
</P>
<P>
"I can not accept Prime Minister Barak's peace policies
concerning the negotiations with the Palestinians, because Barak
had made too many concessions to the Palestinians at the Camp David
summit, particularly on the Jerusalem issue," Levy said.
</P>
<P>
"Under such circumstances, it is impossible for me to continue
to be the foreign minister in the government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under certain government regulations, Levy's resignation will
come into effect within 48 hours after submitting the letter of
resignation.
</P>
<P>
Barak told reporters at the Knesset that he respected Levy's
decision to resign from the government.
</P>
<P>
"I respected Foreign Minister Levy's decision, but his
resignation will not affect my efforts to continue the peace
process with the Palestinians and I will continue to try to reach a
peace agreement with the Palestinians," Barak added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, he will continue to exert his efforts in the
coming days to put together a new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Levy's Gesher (Bridge) party formed the political alliance of
One Israel with Barak's Labor party during the May 1999 general
elections. His party has two seats in the 120-member Knesset on the
slot of One Israel Knesset list.
</P>
<P>
Levy's resignation not only reduced the number of cabinet
ministers to 12 from 23, but also further put Barak's crippling
coalition into the absolute minority in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Barak asked Levy on Tuesday to delay his resignation by a week.
But Levy replied that if by Wednesday morning the prime minister
does not make serious efforts to form a national unity government,
he will submit his resignation and vote for the bills to dissolve
the Knesset which comes up for preliminary reading Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Levy was at odds with Barak since May, when Barak ordered Public
Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, instead of the foreign minister,
to conduct secret peace talks with Palestinian Legislative Council
Speaker Ahmed Qurei.
</P>
<P>
Levy also refused to attend the Camp David summit with Barak,
citing the Palestinian side was not ready to make concessions on
all key issues in the final-status talks and the timing was not
ripe for the summit.
</P>
<P>
Levy's resignation will cause more political hardship for Barak,
who is in fact facing a political mess at home.

JAKARTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Following a deadly bomb blast
occurred at the Philippine Embassy to Indonesia on Tuesday, the
Indonesian authorities has issued an order to tighten security for
foreign embassies in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Antara news agency quoted Chief of the National Police (Polri)
Gen.Roesdihardjo and Commander of the Indonesian Military (TNI)
Adm.Widodo as saying here Wednesday that security will also be
tightened around the offices of foreign companies in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Roesdihardo said that he has instructed Chief Inspector of the
Jakarta Police Gen. Nurfaizi to check foreigners in Jakarta,
particularly those coming from the Philippines, adding that the
bomb blast incident might have been organized by Filipinos as well
as Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
"I have instructed the chief inspector of the Jakarta police to
check all guests from our neighbors in the north (the Philippines)
staying in all hotels here," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday noon, a powerful bomb exploded in front of the
Philippine Embassy building in Central Jakarta, killing two people
and injuring at least 23 others including Philippine Ambassador
Leonides T Caday.
</P>
<P>
The bomb, the second explosion in the capital for less than one
month, damaged a wall of the residence of the Philippine
Ambassador and the fence of the Bulgarian Embassy. The explosion,
which left a huge orifice near by the Philippine Embassy and also
was felt up to 500 meters from the location and formed a huge
black mushroom-shaped smoke, was believed to be TNT (trinitroluene)
bomb, a kind of a powerful bomb.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid and Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab
said that the Philippine Muslim separatist could have been behind
the incident. While various sides have voiced suspicions that the
bombing was work of the Muslim separatist group in the southern
Philippine of the MILF (Moro Islamic Liberation Front) or
Indonesians who are trying to discredit the government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Speaker of the People's Consultative Assembly Amien
Rais suggested that the culprits of Tuesday's bomb blast might
involve people who were in Jakarta. "It would be too much to
accuse foreign parties. I think the perpetrators came from around
here," he was quoted by Antara as saying.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Darkest Day of Kashmir  By Zhou Xiaozheng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- For many years to come, August
1 might be remembered as the darkest day of Kashmir: within less
than 24 hours, nearly 90 people, most of them innocent civilians,
fell at the gunpoint of ruthless militants across the region.
</P>
<P>
The Kashmir valley is in no case unfamiliar with mass bloodshed,
not after it has triggered two wars between India and Pakistan and
has witnessed thousands of deaths in the past decade of militancy
and border skirmishes. However, it is still extremely rare for
this land to see so much innocent blood being shed overnight.
</P>
<P>
Newsmen in the Indian capital were kept busy all Wednesday
morning updating their stories with latest casualty reports from
Kashmir. While the morning newspapers put the death toll at a mere
23 to 27, the latest figure released by the quasi-official Press
Trust of India (PTI) in the afternoon sharply raised the number of
victims to 88.
</P>
<P>
Even Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee failed to catch up
with the rocketing death toll. While briefing the Lok Sabha, or
the lower house of the Indian parliament this morning, he said
there had been 60 victims of militant attacks in Kashmir since
Tuesday, though conceding that the figure was only "tentative".
</P>
<P>
According to media reports seen here, the first of a series of
bloody attacks, or, to be more exactly, massacres, occurred at
around 6 p.m. Tuesday at Pahalgam town in west Kashmir. A group of
militants broke into a pilgrim camp in the suburbs of Pahalgam and
fired indiscriminately at the crowd, who were cooking their
dinners.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two people, including 21 pilgrims heading for north
India's holy Amarnath Cave and local shopkeepers and porters, were
killed and dozens of others injured. This has been the heaviest
civilian casualty in one single militant attack since March 20
this year, when 35 Sikh residents were massacred in south Kashmir
amid U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to India.
</P>
<P>
Just four hours later, another group of heavily-armed militants
descended on a brick kiln at Mir Bazar in west Kashmir's Anantnag
district. They brought 18 male laborers out of their residences
and shot them in the face of their wives and children.
</P>
<P>
The militants' killing spree continued throughout the night. In
the wee hours of Wednesday, they entered the house of a
surrendered former militant and killed all seven members of the
family in the frontier district of Kupwara in north Kashmir; they
also gunned down 11 Hindus in a remote village in Doda district in
southwest Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the aforementioned incidents, the militants had
attacked at least three other places late Tuesday night and early
Wednesday morning, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
A mixed feeling of shock, sorrow and fury gripped the Indian
capital as the news of the massacres reached here. Indian
President K R Narayanan, Vice President Krishan Kant, Prime
Minister Vajpayee and Home Affairs Minister L.K. Advani all
condemned the killings, calling them "heinous acts" representing "
the height of barbarism and inhumanity".
</P>
<P>
The news also caused uproar in the Indian parliament, which is
in its monsoon session here, as the legislators stopped normal
discussions and examination of bills and demanded the government
to explain on the Kashmir situation. The Lok Sabha had to be
adjourned for two hours.
</P>
<P>
Both Vajpayee and Advani, as well as local officials in Kashmir,
believed that Tuesday's massacres were conducted by militants who
wanted to sabotage the central government's recent peace
initiative in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Hizbul Mujahideen, a major militant outfit in
Kashmir, announced a unilateral ceasefire, to which the Indian
government responded on Sunday with cessation of all military
operations against the outfit and an offer for peace talks with it.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday afternoon, Hizbul Mujahideen took a positive step
further by naming its negotiator, and at the same time called for
a complete ceasefire between all militant groups in Kashmir and
the Indian government. Many believe this has cast the first light
of hope on a possible end to the decade-long militancy and
violence in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
However, there were obviously quite a few other militant
outfits who didn't want to see peace in Kashmir at all. Following
the Hizbul Mujahideen announcement, the region just enjoyed one
day of relative peace and tranquillity, with only one minor
incident of violence reported. Starting on Monday, militancy-
related violence has drastically stepped up across the region.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, an army transit camp in north Kashmir was attacked
by militants with rockets and grenades, with six army personnel
killed and seven others injured. Then on Tuesday evening, as if to
slam the door at Hizbul Mujahideen's ceasefire call, the large-
scale killing of civilians.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that some of the militants are frightened of the
prospects of peace and chose these innocent pilgrims as soft
targets," Advani said after learning the first massacre in
Pahalgam.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the parliament, Vajpayee also virtually
accused Pakistan of being behind the killings in Kashmir, claiming
that the killings were the handiwork of elements "operating at the
behest of Pakistan or getting directions from it".
</P>
<P>
However, the Indian side didn't seem to be able to submit any
hard evidence on any Pakistani involvement in the killings. There
was even no militant outfit to claim responsibility for them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some diplomatic analysts here asked if it was wise
and practical for the Indian government to pursue peace in Kashmir
without taking Pakistan into account, especially as New Delhi had
always accused Islamabad of backing and directing militants in the
region.
</P>
<P>
To the great relief of most Kashmir people longing for a
peaceful and calm life, the Indian government promised on
Wednesday it would continue with its current efforts to restore
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"It (the killing) is a desperate act and it only proves that
the government is proceeding on the right track," said Advani, who
is seeing to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Nothing would deflect India from pursuing the path of peace in
Kashmir, Vajpayee told the legislators, adding: "We will overcome
all these difficulties."
</P>
<P>
But for the families and relatives of those massacre victims,
they might just hope their kinsfolk's blood was not shed in vain
and the dark night of August 1 was just one of those darkest hours
before a bright dawn.

<HEADLINE> Election Politics Should not Affect Sino-U.S. Relations: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- China today urged political
parties in the United States not to bring election politics into
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
In response to a request for comment on the Republican Party's
campaign platform put forward at its recent national convention,
which mentions its China policy, and contains criticism of China,
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said, "We have
taken note of the fact that in the U.S. election campaign, the
platform a certain party put forth at its national convention
contains some content criticizing China, we are concerned about
and express regret over it."
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China and the United States are two important
countries in the world, and developing smooth and stable bilateral
relations is in the fundamental interests of the two countries and
their peoples and is also conducive to promoting stability and
prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the U.S. party concerned will have a clear
understanding of the overall situation of Sino-U.S. relations, and
show due sense of responsibility and far-sight, abide by a series
of commitments the successive U.S. governments have made on
bilateral relations, and do more things conducive to stabilizing
and improving Sino-U.S. relations, and not to bring U.S.
presidential election politics into Sino-U.S. relations," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> FIVB Chief Welcome to Be IOC Member: Samaranch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, Spain, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the world
sport of volleyball got on Tuesday a nice surprise that he will be
welcome to be a member of the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
The news was broken out by the IOC President Juan Antonio
Samaranch himself who attended the opening session of the 27th
International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) congress.
</P>
<P>
"Last week the IOC Executive Board decided to propose some new
candidates for IOC membership from among presidents of the
international federations and the national Olympic committees,"
said Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
"The president of the FIVB was among them and we are ready to
welcome your president as an IOC member," the IOC chief told the
FIVB congress.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said that his institution would also like to increase
the number of seats in its executive board but he would rather
respect the autonomy of the FIVB.
</P>
<P>
The IOC chief told the world volleyball congress that changes
are needed to make sports more fantastic. He said that he
approved the recent changes regarding the rally point system, the
introduction of the libero, colored balls, the net fault and rules
on the player uniforms.
</P>
<P>
"If the international federations don't change their rules for
television, their sports will be in trouble," said Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
The FIVB has just signed a television rights deal with five
networks from Japan, the United States and Brazil, worth 150
million U.S. dollars in total. The deal was part of the FIVB's
400-million-dollar package for the next decade of development.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Inventor Lowers Tobacco's Tar Content </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese inventor claims that
he has developed a technology that can drastically lower the tar
content in tobacco.
</P>
<P>
The technology is considered to be of great commercial value to
cigarette manufacturers, experts said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the technology, which has attracted worldwide
attention, 70-year-old Chen Chuting, a retired technician in east
China's Zhejiang Province, also made a number of other inventions.
Chen has started six enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Using hydroxide ion, light wave, acoustic wave, positive and
negative pressures, Chen succeeded in altering the ingredients of
tobacco, thus lowering its tar level.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco firms use conventional means such as filter tips or
medical elements to reduce tobacco's tar emission, which contains
carcinogenic substances such as nitrosamine and benzopyrene.
</P>
<P>
Last November, U.S. cigarette maker Philip Morris conducted a
test on the tobacco treated by Chen's technology, and was
surprised to find that the per cigarette tar content was 11
milligrams, compared with an average of 13-16 mg. The carbon
monoxide from the cigarette was also much less.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, a Taiwanese research institute found that the
tar content in tobacco treated by Chen further dropped to 7.43 mg.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who studied chemical equipment design and manufacturing
at Zhejiang University in the 1950s, said he was confident that
with advanced technical means he can further lower the tar content
to below 5 mg.
</P>
<P>
Chen used to work at a government agency in the city of Rui'an
in Zhejiang. He has been working for years to control tobacco tar,
a leading health hazard for smokers.
</P>
<P>
Using Chinese medicinal herbs, he succeeded in eliminating
nicotine in tobacco in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Health experts from the University of California have appraised
the technology.
</P>
<P>
Chen estimated that with his technology, a production line that
costs one million yuan (about 120,000 U.S. dollars) can process
100 tons of tobacco a day.
</P>
<P>
Six leading tobacco companies in the United States have shown
interest in Chen's technology.
</P>
<P>
A number of U.S. and Chinese cigarette makers have told Chen
that they wished to use the technology.

<HEADLINE> Arafat in Egypt for Talks With Mubarak on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- President of Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat arrived in Alexandria, Egypt on
Wednesday to consult with President Hosni Mubarak on ways of
pushing forward the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat went into a meeting with Mubarak in the Mediterranean
port city, 220 kilometers northwest of Cairo, upon arrival from the
Sudanese capital of Khartoum during his ongoing tour of Arab
nations.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit is intended to keep Mubarak posted on the latest
developments of the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations and
brief him of the outcome of his current Arab tour, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has visited Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Morocco, Tunisia and
Algeria in a bid to rally support from Arab brothers for the
Palestinian positions in the peace talks with Israel, especially on
the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He will also brief Mubarak on his recent visit to France, where
he held talks with President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
France is holding the rotating presidency of the 15-nation
European Union, which is keen on playing a key role in mediating
the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat frequently travels to Egypt for consultations with
Mubarak on the Mideast peace talks. He visited Egypt a week ago on
his way back from the Camp David summit with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The 15-day Camp David talks ended last Tuesday without an
agreement on the most difficult issues, including Jerusalem,
refugees, settlements and borders.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Wednesday condemned
the reported loss of many civilian lives in an attack on August 1
in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
A Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman said here that at the
present important juncture, "when India is beginning to realize
the futility of its efforts to impose a military solution on
Kashmir, it is attempting to divide the Kashmiri freedom movement
which has shown great determination and has remained united in the
face of years of brutal Indian repression."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that initial reports do not rule out the
possibility of killings resulting from firing by the Indian forces.
</P>
<P>
On previous occasions, terrorist acts aimed at civilians have
been carried out by renegade elements, at the behest of the Indian
security forces, to malign the Kashmiri freedom struggle
internationally, he observed.
</P>
<P>
At least 32 people including 5 Hindu pilgrims was killed and
several dozens injured on Tuesday when India-claimed "a group of
Mujahideen" opened fired at a crowded marketplace in Pahalgam, 97
kilometers south of Srinagar, capital of India-controlled Kashmir.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's opposition
alliance Wednesday rejected an offer of amnesty from the supreme
leader of the ruling Taliban militia, saying his words were hollow
and their fight would go on.
</P>
<P>
Opposition spokesman Mohammad Habeel said Taliban chief Mulla
Mohammad Omar's call on the opposition forces to surrender was "
just hollow words and a waste of time to hear."
</P>
<P>
"This is not something new. Our people have fought a jehad (
holy war) against the Russians," he said, quoted by reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Omar Tuesday offered amnesty to his opponents and guaranteed
the safety of those who joined his regime, the Islamic Emirate of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan will protect life and
property of all those who join the government," Omar said in a
statement from his headquarters in southern Afghan city of
Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban now control about 90 percent of the country, except
small pockets in rugged northeastern areas controlled by former
Defense Minister Ahmed Shah Masood.
</P>
<P>
Omar's call to surrender follows Taliban advances in
northeastern Baghlan and Takhar provinces last week, where the
militia captured two opposition-held towns slashing Masood's
supply lines from Tajikistan to key positions near Kabul

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Capital Outflow Accelerated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's capital outflow during
the first five months this year has been accelerated, which
amounted 7 billion U.S. dollars, compared with a total 8 billion
dollars for the whole of 1999, according to an official report
issued here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, released by the Bank of Thailand (BOT), said that
the capital outflow is likely to persist as the private sector and
public agencies will have to continue accelerating their debt
repayments of foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
Foreign capital flight from the Stock Exchange of Thailand is
also another factor aggravating the situation as foreign investors
have continued to sell stocks for some time, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The net outflow of funds is largely due to the debt repayments
of foreign loans. In a situation where local interest rates are
less than those in foreign markets, local funds inevitably lose
when mobilized," a local analyst noted.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the outflow, he believed that the country would
continue to witness the trend for some time. This is due
especially to the U.S. Central Bank's increasing of its interest
rates to tame its economy, which would result in a widening
interest gap between local and overseas markets.

last year and Indonesia at 240,000 units or 155.7 percent increase
from last year.
</P>
<P>
She attributed Malaysia's excellent performance to the fact
that it was the first country in the region to recover from the
economic crisis and the increased consumer confidence was
supported by the country's political stability.
</P>
<P>
The AAF comprises eight out of 10 ASEAN countries namely Brunei,
Indonesia Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam. The other two ASEAN members are Cambodia and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
According to the AAF president, total sales of new motor
vehicles sales for the whole region in the first half of 2000
stood at 498,086 units, just 32.8 percent less than the whole of
last year.
</P>
<P>
"As the region's economies continue to record strong growth
this year, confidence is now building up among the people and they
are buying more cars," she said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the encouraging picture in the first half of this year,
she said total sales of new motor vehicles for the whole of 2000
in this region would reach the projected 1,059,913 units.
</P>
<P>
"The figure continues to support the global belief that the
ASEAN region is still a very important market with great growth
potential," she said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Launches Plan to Ensure Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has drawn up a five-year
Health Sector Strategic Plan to ensure a core package of health
care services for all Ugandans, according to a press release
available on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The principal aims of the plan are to improve access of the
population to the Uganda National Minimum Health Care Package (
UNMHCP), improve the quality of delivery of the package and reduce
inequalities in accessing health services," said the release
issued by F. G. Omaswa, director general of Uganda Health Services.
</P>
<P>
Particular attention will be paid to training, recruitment and
motivation of qualified staff, the release said, noting that
rehabilitation and improvement of the performance of existing
facilities will be stressed.
</P>
<P>
The release said that communities will be mobilized to
participate in the management and monitoring of health services.
</P>
<P>
Better health is an essential contribution to poverty
eradication, the release quoted Minister of Health Crispus Kiyonga
as saying. "Ill health is expensive and people who are sick can
not produce wealth," said Kiyonga.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the economic loss from malaria alone ranged
between 1 to 3 percent of the annual Gross Domestic Product. "This
loss translates into millions of dollars annually," said the
minister.

<HEADLINE> 13 on Trial in Switzerland for Financial Cheating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Twelve Swiss and one Italian went
on trial Wednesday for their role in the European Kings Club "
pyramid" scheme which collapsed five years ago, Swiss Radio
International reported.
</P>
<P>
The 13 men were accused of defrauding 94,000 investors in
Switzerland, Germany and Austria of 360 million U.S. dollars, with
some facing additional charges of violating Swiss banking law and
membership of a criminal organization, court official Peter Alex
Mueller was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the 13 were low-ranking figures in the
scheme's Berne branch, and that they had helped to con more than 1,
500 investors out of 17.5 million Swiss francs (about 11 million U.
S. dollars) in the Swiss capital. Their bosses were jailed for
fraud in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Swiss investigators, who have led inquiries into the scheme in
12 cantons, believe that as many as 30,000 people in Switzerland
have been defrauded of between 200-300 million francs (about 125.7-
188.6 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Kings Club was founded in Germany in 1991 and set out to
exploit fears about giving up the Deutsche Mark for the euro, by
offering staggering annual returns of up to 72 percent. As more
investors were drawn by the high rates of interest, the scheme
snowballed, spreading to Switzerland a year later.
</P>
<P>
Kings Club representatives sold investment certificates for 1,
400 francs (about 880 dollars) with the promise they would be
worth 2,400 francs (about 1508.6 dollars) within a year. But
investors were only granted the privilege to "join the club" on
condition they signed up 15 new members within a month.
</P>
<P>
Pyramid schemes rely on existing investors to recruit new
members to finance high yields with their initial outlay. The
Kings Club collapsed in late 1995, when it failed to find enough
new recruits to finance the returns of those higher up the pyramid.
</P>
<P>
Berne's Economic Criminal Court will try the 13 defendants in
two stages. The Italian and six Swiss appeared in court on
Wednesday with the verdict expected on August 15. The others will
go on trial a week later and the verdict is scheduled for August
29.

<HEADLINE> East China Combats Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A severe drought affecting one-
third of crops in east China's Jiangxi Province, a major grain
producer, has eased thanks to two weeks of cloud seeding efforts.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said the cloud seeding operations have brought
rainfall to more than 66,600 ha of crops in 66 counties and cities.
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Anhui Province, farmers are fighting the worst
drought in 50 years. About 400,000 pumps are being used and
millions of dollars spent for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
The drought began to affect Anhui in the winter of 1999, and
the northern part of the province has had only half as much
rainfall as in normal years.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 853,000 ha of farmland has been affected,
and 638,000 people have had difficulty getting drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that dry weather will linger for about two more
weeks in the two provinces.

Barak Wednesday morning, in which he detailed his reasons for
resignation.
</P>

off it and investors took the opportunity to buy stocks hit by
recent falls.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Lance Armstrong, a cancer hero
who won two consecutive Tour de France in the past two years, will
lead a five-member U.S. men's road racing squad for the Syndey
Olympic Games, said the U.S. Cycling on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to win a gold medal. I've been there twice before and
been disappointed twice before, so this will be a nice opportunity,
" said Armstrong in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Also on the team are Antonio Cruz, George Hincapie, Tyler
Hamilton and Fred Rodriguez, with Armstrong and Hamilton racing in
the individual time trial and all five in the road race.
</P>
<P>
Coach Jim Ochowicz hoped that the Americans should be medal
favorites, saying that "we are definitely going into Sydney with
one of the favorite teams on the road and probably the favorite in
the time-trial event."
</P>
<P>
While cycling remains largely unknown to most Americans,
Armstrong has become famous for his comeback from cancer to win
the Tour de France the last two years.
</P>
<P>
He was diagnosed with testicular cancer in October 1996,
shortly after placing sixth in the time trial and 12th in the road
race at the Atlanta Olympics.

<P>
He also rode in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, finishing 14th in
the road race.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China's Steel Giant Makes More Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Anshan Iron and Steel Company (
Group), a steel giant which has long been mired in difficulty,
scored 160 million yuan of profit (19.3 million U.S. dollars) in
the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Angang, as the northeast China-based steel giant is also known,
has met the goal for the whole year ahead of schedule. Its profit
in the January-June period is twice as much as its annual profit
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the achievement indicates that this steel giant
is now revitalizing.
</P>
<P>
Angang increased its output of iron, steel, billets and rolled
steel in the first half of this year, and its total output was
within the quotas set by the State. It earned 122 million U.S.
dollars from exports,a rise of seven times from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it has shifted to exporting more steel sheets from
selling primary steel products.
</P>
<P>
Angang currently is the biggest producer of cold-rolled steel
products in China, with an annual output of over two million tons.

<P>
HEFEI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province has
selected 115 projects to open to overseas investment, and a
promotional campaign will be launched in Shenzhen later this month.
</P>
<P>
Anhui's vice governor Zhang Ping said these projects cover such

<P>
More preferential policies, including tax breaks and easy loans,

Anhui approved the establishment of 83 overseas-funded
enterprises during the first five months of the year, with
combined contractual overseas capital of 76.52 million U.S.

</P>
<P>
The enterprises are related with infrastructure, agriculture,

Anhui has already issued a series of new policies to attract
overseas business people since the beginning of last year, and
they include measures to protect the legitimate rights and
interests of overseas investors.

<HEADLINE> China Preparing for 2001 APEC Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- China is making intensive efforts
to ensure the 2001 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
Conference a success, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu Hailong, China APEC senior official and deputy director of
the Department of International Organizations and Conferences of
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a seminar on APEC trade
and investment, which began here today, that the preparations for
the 2001 APEC Conference are now in full swing.
</P>
<P>
China has set up a special work team for the preparations.
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and Minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Shi Guangsheng jointly head the
preparatory committee.
</P>
<P>
The secretariat of the committee, which handles coordination,
protocols, the press, security and other logistic affairs, has
begun operation, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
China and other APEC members are now negotiating the theme of
the 2001 APEC Conference. Wu said the theme and topics are
expected to be finalized in October this year.
</P>
<P>
"The theme and topics of the conference should represent the
development trends of global economy and the Asia-Pacific economic
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will be the main venue for the 2001 APEC Conference,
where the informal summit meeting and the ministerial meetings for
foreign ministers and foreign trade ministers will take place. The
senior officials' meetings of the conference will be held in
Beijing, Shenzhen, Dalian and Shanghai, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Yi Xiaozhun, director of the Department of International Trade
and Economic Affairs of MOFTEC, said the Chinese government pays
great attention to the first ever APEC conference to be held in
China. He said the conference will be important to the country and
the APEC as well.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to expand cooperation with other members of APEC
and help accelerate the balanced and sound development of APEC's
cooperation process, he said.
</P>
<P>
China joined the organization in 1991 and has taken an active
part in its activities ever since. President Jiang Zemin
participated all the seven annual informal leadership conferences

<HEADLINE> China Lifts Ban on ROK Products After Garlic Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- China announced today the lifting
of its two-month ban on import of mobile phones (including
vehicular mobile sets) and polyethylene from the Republic of Korea
(ROK) after the two countries reached an agreement on garlic trade.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made as the ROK side has substantially revised
its high-tariff measures against Chinese garlic, said Hu Chusheng,
a spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement two sides signed on Monday, the ROK will
import 32,000 tons of Chinese garlic at low tariffs this year, and
the amount will grow by 5.25 percent annually within a term of
three years, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The two countries exchanged a note today, confirming that the
agreement enters into force, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
China announced suspension of the import of ROK mobile
telephones (including vehicular mobile sets) and polyethylene on
June 7 after the ROK decided to impose a high tariff of 315
percent on Chinese garlic on June 1.
</P>
<P>
This unilateral measure seriously obstructed China's garlic
export and affected the normal development of bilateral trade,
from which China had sustained huge amount of deficits for a long
time, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Hu stressed that the Chinese government has always highly
valued its trade and economic cooperative relations with the ROK
and has made vigorous efforts to that end.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the settlement of the garlic issue will help
promote cooperation and mutual understanding for a balanced and
healthy development of two-way trade," he said.

JERUSALEM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said Tuesday night he
will make an announcement Wednesday on whether he is to quit the
cabinet and vote in favor of a legislation to dissolve the Knesset
(Parliament).
</P>
<P>
Levy met again Tuesday with Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
demanded that an "honest effort" be made to form a national unity
government with the major opposition Likud.
</P>
<P>
"The necessary step has not yet been taken," Levy told
reporters, "If it turns out that it is not happening, I will
announce what has to be announced."
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- As of Foreign Minister David Levy's ultimatum, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak reiterated Tuesday that he has sent emissaries
to Likud Chairman Ariel Sharon in the past few days to examine
whether the Likud party is ready to join the government.
</P>
<P>
Sharon continued Tuesday to deny vehemently that any messengers
had been sent to him by the prime minister, practically charging
the prime minister with lying.
</P>
<P>
"The door to the Likud is open," Barak said in a television
interview. "Let everyone decide which of the two of us he believes
and that will spare me the necessity of embarrassing Sharon."
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- An Israeli Air Force F-16 warplane crashed Tuesday in the
Negev. The pilot ejected from the aircraft and parachuted to
safety. It was the third F-16 crash this year in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place Tuesday afternoon, about half an hour
after the pilot, a lieutenant doing his compulsory service, took
off from Mt. Ramon base in the Negev on a routine training flight.
</P>
<P>
Following standard procedure, Air Force Commander Dan Halutz
appointed a commission of inquiry to investigate the incident.
Until initial results are received, the Air Force has grounded all
the F-16s of the model that crashed.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Moshe Katsav, who was sworn in as Israel's eighth president
Tuesday, pledged to avoid getting involved in politics during his
seven-year term, and warned of the turbulence in society expected
to accompany decisions in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Social harmony comes before any peace process," Katsav said
during the Knesset (Parliament) ceremony, adding he is very worried
about the growing gaps between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
"I have promised to mute myself for seven years on political
issues, and I will keep that promise," Katsav later told Israel's
Channel One television, in his first interview as president. "
However, when it comes to social issues, I will not be silent. I
will take up the cause of bridging the gaps in this society even if
it means speaking out."

</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a luncheon hosted by the FP for the
foreign press members, calling for foreign media's objective
reports on the party.
</P>
<P>

</P>

Condemning the killing of innocent people, Vajpayee said that
the design behind these killings was to sabotage the peace

hold talks with Hizbul Mujahideen, a major militant outfit in
Kashmir which announced a unilateral ceasefire last Saturday, the
Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said that he wanted to make it clear to perpetrators
of these heinous acts that nothing could deflect India from
pursuing the path of peace in Kashmir, the PTI added.

According to media reports here, the 60 victims included 30
pilgrims and civilians massacred at a pilgrim camp at Pahalgam
town in west Kashmir on Tuesday evening, 18 laborers shot dead in

HELSINKI -- Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tumioja said Monday
that no attempt should be made to solve international conflicts
unilaterally without the authorization of international
organizations such as the United Nations and the Organization for
Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
Tumioja made the remarks at the Sixth World Congress for
Central and East European Studies held in Tampere, Finland, to
mark the 25th anniversary of the signature of the Helsinki Final
Act. The act, signed in 1975 by 35 countries including the United
States and the former Soviet Union, laid the foundation for what
later became the Vienna-based OSCE, which now groups 55 states of
Europe, Central Asia and North America. It is an important task
for the OSCE to ensure that international crises are solved
through multilateral actions in the first place, said Tumioja. (

KUALA LUMPUR -- The Federal Court of Malaysia Wednesday
dismissed an appeal by former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim
against an earlier ruling by the High Court here that Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad need not testify at Anwar's sodomy trial.
</P>
<P>
A three-member panel led by Chief Justice Eusoff Chin made the
decision. Anwar, who discharged his seven counsel, made an
application himself Tuesday to disqualify the Chief Justice from
hearing his appeal, saying Eusoff could not be impartial because
of his relationships with the Prime Minister. His application was
dismissed by the court. (Malaysia-Anwar-Appeal)

BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese medical experts have
developed an effective therapy of lungs lavage for curing the
fatal disease of pneumoconiosis, a typical occupational illness
threatening miners.
</P>
<P>
The therapy, which laves both lungs of a patient one and a half
hours, was developed by doctors with the Beidaihe Sanitarium of
Chinese Coal Miners in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2,000 patients have been cured by the therapy, which the
doctors say is "effective and safe".

<P>
Medical workers could remove most of the dust in patients'
alveoluses and bronchuses.
</P>
<P>
China has about one million people suffering from
pneumoconiosis, accounting for half of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
The therapy has won a national award for technological
advancement.

<P>
Medical groups from Russia and the United States visited the
sanitarium, located in the famous Beidaihe summer resort, to seek
cooperation in the field.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Common Muslim Stand on Mideast Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has called on the Muslim world to adopt a common stand on
issues concerning occupied Palestinian lands and the status of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made separate phone calls to his Syrian, Egyptian,
Qatari and Jordanian counterparts Tuesday evening to coordinate
their stands on the Middle East issue, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move came only a few days after the U.S.-mediated Camp David
Middle East peace talks failed to reach any agreement. Iran blamed
Israel for the failure of the talks, accusing it of not willing to
make the minimum concessions and adopting delaying tactics in
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the possible decision of the United States to move
its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Kharrazi said such an act
is "unacceptable" to the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
The occupied Palestinian lands and the status of Jerusalem are
two principal concerns of the Muslim world, and Muslim countries
have to adopt a common stand in dealing with those issues, Kharrazi
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, as chairman of
the Organization of the Islamic Conference, will send delegations
to Muslim capitals to brief Muslim heads of state on Iran's
position toward the Middle East issue and also to encourage
cooperation between Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
In the phone calls, the foreign ministers of Syria, Egypt, Qatar
and Jordan appreciated Iran's concern over the Palestine issue, and
expressed readiness to cooperate and exchange views with Iran in
that connection, the report said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Population Inches Towards Four Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The estimated resident population at June 30, 2000 was around 3.
83 million, representing an increase of 20,300 or 0.5 percent over
the figure at June 30, 1999, according to a Wednesday's media
release of Statistics New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The current growth rate is under half of the 1.1 percent
average annual growth rate of the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
The slower growth was due mainly to a net loss in external
migration, which partially offset the natural increase of
population (excess of births over deaths). Permanent and long-term
departures exceeded arrivals by 9,800 during the year from July
1999 to June 2000, compared with an average annual gain of 23,000
over the period from 1995 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
Half of the New Zealanders are now over 34.3 years of age, up
nearly three years over the median age of 31.4 years in 1991.
Children under 15 years now make up 22.9 percent of all New
Zealanders, while the population aged 65 years and over accounts

The slaughter occurred at around 10 p.m. Tuesday, just four

Pahalgam town in west Kashmir, killing 30 people and injuring
dozens of others.

<P>
Although no militant group has so far claimed responsibility
for the two massacres, but officials in Kashmir believed that
those opposed to a ceasefire and possible peace talks between
Hizbul Mujahideen, a major militant outfit in Kashmir, and the
Indian government may be behind the attacks. The ceasefire deal,
reached during the last weekends, cast a hopeful light on the end
of violence in Kashmir.
</P>

The slaughtered laborers, who worked in a brick kiln, were
mostly from the northern states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh
and Bihar, said the police.

<HEADLINE> ILO Moves to End Child Labor in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- International Labor
Organization (ILO) Kathmandu has signed new agreements with a
partner organization in Nepal to renew its commitments to phase
out child labor in Nepal's carpet industry, ILO said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed Tuesday between ILO and National Society
for the Protection of Environment and Children (NASPEC) intends to
implement the consolidation phase of the action program entitled "
phasing out child labor from the carpet industries in Nepal", a
press release issued by ILO said.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate aim of this program is to make the carpet sector
free of child labor, it said.
</P>
<P>
Under the consolidation phase, 400 children working in the
carpet factories have been targeted for rehabilitation through the
action plan. Among them, 300 will be enrolled into formal schools
and 100 will be engaged in vocational training programs.
</P>
<P>
In the first three phases of the action program, NASPEC has
already rehabilitated 1,063 children from the carpet factories
through its Child Rehabilitation Center.
</P>
<P>
The center provided non-formal education, skill training,
counseling and health care to the rehabilitated children and
hundreds of children were reunited with their families and
enrolled into formal schools.
</P>
<P>
The action program also aims to develop a "code of conduct" for
the carpet manufacturers to prohibit child labor in their
establishments.
</P>
<P>
In collaboration with the Central Carpet Industries Association,
NASPEC will progressively phase out child labor from carpet
factories, which absorb a large portion of child laborers in Nepal.
It is estimated there are at least 2.5 million child laborers in
the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A group of Fiji rebels Wednesday
stormed the office of the country's top union official, holding
him and seven other officials captive, the Australian Associated
Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Fiji Trade Union Congress General Secretary Felix Anthony said
the men, who were part of the rebel Taukei Movement, accused him
of failing to support the interim government.
</P>
<P>
"They threatened me and made accusations but I was not harmed,"
Anthony told the AAP in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
"They said I was anti the interim government and that I was
causing trouble," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anthony said the men were not armed.
</P>
<P>
Anthony said he was sitting in his office with several other
union officials when the men entered and locked them in the room.
</P>
<P>
He said he recognized the men as being part of the rebel Taukei
Movement.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred as Fijian unionists Wednesday held a one-
day strike over the ongoing instability there.
</P>
<P>
"We are calling for peace and democracy to be restored in Fiji,
" Anthony said.
</P>
<P>
Anthony said the national protest had closed schools, shops

side.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first in nearly four years, is expected to
address the criminal jurisdiction over accused American soldiers,
environmental contamination by United States Forces Korea (USFK),
labor rights of South Korean employees at USFK bases and
inspection of agricultural products brought in by U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
The meeting began amid strong anti-U.S. sentiments in South
Korea after it was discovered that the USFK had been discharging
poisonous chemicals formaldehyde into the Han River at its
headquarters in downtown Seoul recently and the U.S. bombing
practice in Maehyang-ri along the west coast had caused great
damage and wounds to local residents.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held between Song Min-soon, director general of
the North American Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and Trade, and Frederick Smith, deputy assistant secretary
of defense for international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side has suggested possible revision of the clauses on
criminal jurisdiction in the counterproposal presented to South
Korea on May 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
It has also expressed its willingness to deal with
environmental, labor rights and other issues in the face of strong
criticism of the Maehyang-ri situation and the illegal dumping of
toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
In an arrival statement Monday, the chief U.S. negotiator,
Smith said he expected that productive and sincere talks could be
made on the SOFA revisions.

<HEADLINE> Turkmen President Calls for Speeding up Afghan Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, August 2 (Xinhua)-- Turkmen President Saparmurad
Niyazov has expressed the hope that the peace process in the
neighboring Afghanistan would be accelerated to bring a final end
to 20 years of war there, said a Turkmen news agency report
monitored here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark Monday when he met with U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan's personal representative to Afghanistan,
Francesc Vendrell, the agency said in a dispatch from Ashkhabad,
capital of Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
Niyazov and Vendrell, who was on a mediation tour in the region,
exchanged views on the present situation in Afghanistan and
measures for quickening the process aimed at solving the Afghan
issue peacefully.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, Niyazov said that his country is earnestly hoping
for a paced up peace process in Afghanistan, where Islamic
fundamentalist group Taliban and the anti-Taliban group led by ex-
president Burhanuddin Rabbani have been fighting over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
Early in July, the two warring sides fought two pitched battles
near the strategic Bagram airbase, 50 kilometers north of Kabul,
capital of Afghanistan, in which hundreds of solders from both
sides were killed.
</P>
<P>
The Turkmen president said that the conflicting parties in
Afghanistan have come to realize that they must create a peaceful
environment for the Afghan people.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan supports any peace effort as long as it is made in
light of respecting the choice of the Afghan people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vendrell, whose views on the issue were not mentioned in the
report, came to Ashkhabad after a one-day stay in Kabul, where he
said that he hoped there will be no renewed fighting between the
two warring groups in the war-torn landlocked country.
</P>
<P>
If there is no more fighting, there is a greater chance for
peace, the U.N. mediator said.
</P>
<P>
His tour plan also included a visit to Uzbekistan and
Tajikistan.

The number of sizable offenses totaled 18,729 in the period, a
drop of 507 cases or 2.6 percent compared to the 19,236 cases
recorded in the same period of last year while the six-month crime
rate per 100,000 total population fell from 498 cases in the first
half of 1999 to 481 in the first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Federal Court Dismisses Anwar's Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A three-member panel led by Chief Justice Eusoff Chin made the
decision.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who discharged his seven counsel, made an application
himself Tuesday to disqualify the Chief Justice from hearing his
appeal, saying Eusoff could not be impartial because of his
relationships with the Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
His application was dismissed by the court.
</P>
<P>
Eusoff also dismissed Anwar's adopted brother Sukma Darmawan
Sasmitaat Madja's appeal after his counsel Gobind Singh Deo told
the court that his client also did not want to proceed, adopting
Anwar's reasoning for doing so.
</P>
<P>
Anwar and Sukma appealed to set aside the Court of Appeal's
decision made on June 5 to uphold the High Court ruling not to
call Mahathir to testify.
</P>
<P>
They applied to the High Court to have Mahathir as a defence
witness in his personal capacity, but it was dismissed by the
court judge Arifin Jaka.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, 52, is jointly tried with Sukma, 39, on separate charges
of sodomizing his former family driver Azizan Abu Bahar.
</P>
<P>
Sukma, a businessman, faces another charge of abetting Anwar to
sodomize Azizan.
</P>
<P>
The High Court has tentatively fixed Friday to give its verdict
on the case.
</P>
<P>
Anwar is currently serving a six-year jail sentence on
conviction on four counts of corrupt practice of interfering in
police investigations into allegations of his sexual misconduct.

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Rage in Western U.S. States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. military Tuesday began
deploying soldiers to bolster firefighters who are battling with
stubborn wildfires that have consumed more than half-million acres
of timber, bush and brush in 10 western U.S. states, press reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 50 blazes have blackened more than 538,000 acres in
Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico,
Utah, Washington and Wyoming in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
With some 20,000 firefighters deployed in the western states,
the Pentagon ordered soldiers from Fort Hood, Texas, and Marines
from Camp Pendleton, Calif., to help the firefighters in the
coming days.
</P>
<P>
Michelle Barret, spokeswoman for the National Interagency Fire
Center in Boise, Idaho, said that about 500 soldiers were expected
to arrive in Idaho on Tuesday for on-the-job training while
another 500 Marines are expected to arrive Friday.
</P>
<P>
The largest wildfire in California, a 63,270-acre inferno in
Sequoia National Forest, was burning on the eastern side of the
Southern Sierra, 200 kilometers north of Los Angeles. There are
six wildfires still burning in the state.
</P>
<P>
In Idaho, 13 wildfires were burning, including the 77,000-acre
Salmon-Challis National Forest blaze. In southeast Idaho, the 850-
acre West Fork blaze, threatened 10 homes and 10 commercial
structures in Lava Hot Springs.
</P>
<P>
Montana firefighters battled nine fires, including a giant six-
blaze complex that has blackened 48,700 acres five miles (8
kilometers) east of Ashland in the southeast corner of the state.
</P>
<P>
In northeast Nevada, homes were threatened by the lightning-
caused 65,775-acre South Cricket grazing land fire 15 miles (24
kilometers) northeast of Wells. In the southeastern area, another
fire burning in 15,500 acres of pinion pine and juniper northeast
of Pioche, Nev., also threatened structures.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that this is shaping up to be the worst fire
season since 1988, when 7.4 million acres were scorched nationwide.
</P>
<P>
"There were 2.2 million acres burned year-to-date in 1988.
We're already at 3.5 million and we're just coming into fire
season in most of the West," Barret said.
</P>
<P>
Fire experts also said it would be weeks before some of the
blazes are contained. Dry lightning forecast for Montana, Idaho,
Nevada and Oregon was expected to ignite even more fires.
</P>
<P>
Conditions were expected to remain unchanged for the next three
or four days and possibly more than a week, said Ed Waldapfel,
information officer for the fire center in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
"We're at the end of a La Nina weather event this year and
everything is critically dry," he said. "We've had virtually no
moisture this spring and summer. ... It's just a very combustible
situation."

<HEADLINE> Two Killed, Eight Injured In U.S. Mining Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Two workers were killed and
eight others injured Tuesday when a fire broke out and a methane
gas exploded in central Utah, a U.S. western state with a long
history of coal mining and mining tragedy.
</P>
<P>
One worker was in critical condition with burns and a head
injury, and another in serious condition with fractures and burns
from the blaze at the Willow Creek Mine, about 200 kilometers
southeast of Salt Lake City, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
All 99 miners who were on duty at the time have been accounted
for and the cause of the fire was still undetermined, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
Investigations suspect the fire started when the ceiling of
part of the mine shaft was allowed to collapse -- a normal part of
the mining operation, said Ron Spangler, a spokesman for mine
owner RAG Coal International of Essen, Germany.
</P>
<P>
But the roof collapse apparently created sparks that started a
fire and ignited a secondary explosion that may have been fueled
by a pocket of methane gas, Spangler said.
</P>
<P>
It was the mine's second serious fire in the past two years.
Methane ignited in November 1998, closing the mine for a year.
Forty-six miners escaped that fire unharmed, and safety officials
credited a system that uses pagers to alert miners of the danger.
</P>
<P>
Federal Mine Safety Health Administration investigators were on
the scene and a preliminary report was expected in several days.
</P>
<P>
The Willow Creek mine is a mining community of a county with a
long history of coal mining and mining tragedy.
</P>
<P>
One of the nation's worst mining disasters occurred 100 years
ago in nearby Scofield when more than 200 miners lost their lives.
Utah is one of the biggest coal producing states in U.S. West.

SHANGHAI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Doctors in Shanghai have
successfully removed a 640-cubic-centimeter tumor from the skull

<HEADLINE> Illustrated Book on Plagues in China Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- An illustrated book on the
history of plagues in China and the latest research achievements
on the infectious disease has been published, the first of its
kind in China.
</P>
<P>
The book, titled "Illustrated Book on Plagues and the
Environment in the People's Republic of China", features the
making, development and distribution of sources of the disease and
ways to prevent and control the epidemic, using 284 maps and
graphics.
</P>
<P>
According to the book, the source of plagues usually contain
high levels of calcium and iron, a discovery which they say will
help prevent and control the epidemic globally.
</P>
<P>
It says the calcium and iron-rich areas are semi-arid desert
grassland in tropical areas and temperate zones, semi-wet
grassland (including those in high and cold areas), and some wet
and hot coastal forests.
</P>
<P>
Tan Jian'an, a research fellow with the Geographic Science and
Resources Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)

<TEXT>
<P>
The political environment in these two countries is conducive
to investment, Thailand's Ambassador to South Africa, Bandhit
Sotipalalit, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bandhit led a delegation to the two countries between July 22
to 31 as part of the government's efforts to strengthen trade and
investment in the region.
</P>
<P>
Delegation member, a senior executive of Thailand's biggest
agro-industrial conglomerate Charoen Pokphand (CP), was quoted by
the paper as saying that Namibia has great potential for chicken
farming due to its close proximity to major markets.
</P>
<P>
CP has been looking for investment opportunities for some time,
as it first opened an office in South Africa six years ago and has
captured 80 percent of the frozen chicken market.
</P>
<P>
New investment will add value to the company's local activities
by cutting out transport costs and create jobs for local people.
</P>
<P>
Thai Chamber of Commerce director Olan Viravan was quoted as
saying that Thai textile and garment firms, faced with excess
capacity because of export quota restrictions imposed by the
United States and the European Union, could relocate part of their
operations to Namibia and Botswana, where they can take advantage
of SADC's trade privileges.
</P>
<P>
Incentives provided by the Botswana government to foreign
investors, such as labor cost rebates for the first five years,
are very attractive, he added.
</P>
<P>
Namibia and Botswana each has a population of less than two
million, but both are members of the SADC, the regional group of
14 countries with a total population of 194 million and a combined
gross domestic product of 170 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Lankan Govt. to Talk With Main Opposition on Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While President Chandrika Kumaratunga will preside at the talks,
opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe will not attend and instead
party Chairman Karu Jayasuriya will head the UNP delegation.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe decided to boycott talks last week alleging that
the government controlled media were falsely accusing him of
having ties with the Tamil Tigers.
</P>
<P>
As the government has decided to present the new constitutional
reforms in Parliament on Thursday, the UNP is still to reveal its
stand on a couple of issues on the draft constitution.
</P>
<P>
A party official said that his party is due to take a decision
regarding the legislation at its next working committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
The draft constitution aims at ending the country's long-
running war between government forces and separatists since 1983
by devolving powers to regional councils including one
administered by ethnic Tamils.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga has said that she is confident that the
draft constitution will be adopted by the Parliament before its
dissolution on August 24.

<HEADLINE> International Conflicts Should be Settled Through International Organizations, Says Finnish FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, August 1 (Xinhua) - Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki
Tumioja said Monday that no attempt should be made to solve
international conflicts unilaterally without the authorization of
international organizations such as the United Nations and the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
Tumioja made the remarks at the Sixth World Congress for
Central and East European Studies held in Tampere, Finland, to
mark the 25th anniversary of the signature of the Helsinki Final
Act.
</P>
<P>
The act, signed in 1975 by 35 countries including the United
States and the former Soviet Union, laid the foundation for what
later became the Vienna-based OSCE, which now groups 55 states of
Europe, Central Asia and North America.
</P>
<P>
It is an important task for the OSCE to ensure that
international crises are solved through multilateral actions in
the first place, said Tumioja.
</P>
<P>
Multilateral action is much better than unilateral action and
could possibly be the only sustainable approach that can settle
international conflicts, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Such multilateral action would involve all parties concerned,
provide transparency to the settlement, increase the respect for
international law and reduce the dangers of using force, he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the OSCE, the United Nations and the European
Union will strengthen cooperation so as to prevent and control
crises effectively. He held that the situation in the Balkans has
exposed the weakness of the international community in controlling
crises.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 scholars from more than 40 countries attended
the congress.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Landslides caused by heavy rains
have killed at least 20 people and left thousands homeless in
northeast Brazil, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Downpour starting Saturday and continuing through Tuesday has
already caused more than 100 landslides which have affected Recife,
capital of the state of Pernambuco, and neighboring cities.
</P>
<P>
Lots of shops, schools and other public buildings as well as
hospitals had been shut down Monday, and Pernambuco has been
declared a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
Since the climate phenomenon will continue for over 48 hours,
which means more problems and deaths, authorities recommend people
to take necessary precautions against the rainstorm said to be the
worst in the past 40 years in the area.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian President Fernando Enrique Cardoso has ordered the
army to take part in the rescue work.
</P>
<P>
At Recife, with over 1.35 million inhabitants, more than 1,000
people have had to leave their houses, most of them located in the
city's outskirts. Rescue teams are fighting against heavy downpour
to withdraw victims from the destroyed houses.

<HEADLINE> Pipeline Burst Causes Slick in British Columbia, Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The pipeline running between
Taylor and Prince George in Canada's British Columbia burst early
Tuesday to form a 21-kilometer-long slick into the Pine River in
the northeastern part of the province.
</P>
<P>
The provincial Environment Ministry confirmed later in the day
that up to 10,000 barrels of crude oil spilled into the river to
threaten the water supply of Chetwynd, about 100 kilometers
downstream from the pipeline break.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline was shut off after the spill was detected, while
booms were set along the river from the town of 4,000 people to
contain the oil.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 workers are skimming oil off the river and pumping
it into trucks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chetwynd Mayor Charlie Lasser declared "severe water
restrictions" to ensure that the town's water reserves could last
four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have not yet determined what caused the break of
the pipeline, which belongs to the Calgary-based Pembina Pipeline
Corp.
</P>
<P>
A rain storm was reported Monday night to cause power outages
and shut down some pumps in the area.

<P>
OTTAWA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras won his first match
on Tuesday since winning Wimbledon for the seventh time by beating
Michael Llodra of France 5-7, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) in the first round of
the $2.95 million Tennis Masters Series-Canada, while top seed
Andre Agassi was knocked out with a 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (8-6) loss to
Frenchman Jerome Golmard.
</P>
<P>
Playing for the first time since injuring his back in a car
accident, Agassi committed nine double-faults in the loss to
Golmard, who is ranked 61st on the ATP Tour.
</P>
<P>
After the match, Agassi complained about his back injury,
saying he had not fully recovered from the injury.
</P>
<P>
He continued that he hoped to be game fit when the U.S. Open
started.
</P>
<P>
Due to his back injury, Agassi was already forced to miss the
United States' semifinal loss to Spain in the Davis Cup and last
week's Los Angeles Open .
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Agassi's loss, second-seeded Sampras survived
early shock of yielding the first set to 20-year-old Llodra, and
controlled the second and third sets.
</P>
<P>
This is their second encounter, with the first also won by
Sampras at the Queen's tournament in mid-June, a Wimbledon warm-up.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Changes Northern Military Command Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Island newspaper reported that the position of Senior Naval
Officer Commanding Northern Naval Operations held by Rear Admiral
H.R. Amaraweera has been scrapped with Amaraweera being
transferred to the navy headquarters in Colombo as Director of
Naval Administration.
</P>
<P>
With the scrapping of the post, Commander of Northern Naval
Area Commodore S.P. Weerasekera has been made the navy's top man
in the north. However, he has also been transferred and replaced
by Rear Admiral W.K.J. Karannagoda, who has just returned after a
year's training in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The latest command change follows last week's scrapping of the
position of overall Operations Commander of the North, which was
held by Major General Janaka Perera since March. Perera has been
transferred to the army headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said the government's move was in response to
the stabilizing situation in Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
However, the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
rebels, fighting for a separate state in Sri Lanka's north and
east since 1983, are reportedly planning for a major assault on
the government troops deployed in the Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
After ferocious fighting in April and May in the Jaffna
peninsula, a lull in the fighting ensued but analysts see it as
simply the calm before the storm. Government troops and LTTE
rebels have cashed in on the lull to prepare for war and a
showdown is on the cards.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has launched a massive recruit drive and the latest
batch of recruits believed to number over 1,000 are expected to be
battle-ready by mid-August.

<P>
The strategies, aimed to lift 9.9 million Thais above the

</P>
<P>
For the long-term strategies, they would involve reforms of
economic and social mechanisms, as well as of natural resource
management and laws to promote the rights and social empowerment
of the poor, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Government agencies and parties concerned are required to put
the short and medium strategies into action by the year 2002, the

<HEADLINE> Thirty Killed in Kashmir Massacre by Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first major attack on pilgrims in Kashmir, militants
fired indiscriminately on the pilgrims at the camp at around 6 p.m.
Tuesday, killing eight of them on the spot and injuring 20 others,
the PTI had reported late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers on Wednesday morning, however, put the
casualties much higher than the PTI report. AT least 23 people
were feared killed and 70 others injured, said the Indian Express,
adding that the dead included at least a dozen pilgrims, and local
shopkeepers and porters who were camping there at the service of
the pilgrims. The Hindu put the death toll at 27.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest PTI report, the death toll in Tuesday's
attack had risen to 30 as eight more people succumbed to injuries
in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Home Affairs
Minister L.K. Advani condemned the massacre and required necessary
measures to be taken to provide adequate security for the pilgrims.
There are currently 10,000 to 12,000 pilgrims in Pahalgam, who are
heading for the holy Amarnath Cave for pilgrimage, said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
Advani also asserted that the Indian government's efforts for
restoring peace in Jammu and Kashmir would continue.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that some of the militants are frightened of
prospects of peace and chose these innocent pilgrims as soft
targets. It is a desperate act and it only proves that the
government is proceeding on the right track," Advani was quoted as
saying by the Hindu.
</P>
<P>
On last Saturday, Hizbul Mujahideen, a major militant outfit in
the Kashmir valley, offered a unilateral ceasefire, to which the
Indian government responded with a cessation of all military
operations against Hizbul Mujahideen and an offer of peace talks
with the militant group. On Tuesday Hizbul Mujahideen named its
negotiator. All these have brought about hope for an end of
bloodshed in Kashmir, which has been haunted by militancy for a
decade.

<P>
URUMQI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
in northwest China has over the past few years confiscated and
destroyed some 300,000 maps containing errors, a local official
said.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid development of local tourism industry, some

approval of relevant authorities and many maps they printed were
found to contain serious errors, the official said
</P>
<P>
The errors include wrong border lines between China and
neighboring countries and wrong boundary lines between Chinese
provinces and autonomous regions, missing important islands, as
well as marking place names in wrong locations.
</P>
<P>
These maps have "harmed" the national sovereignty of China and
resulted in negative political influences in addition to causing

<HEADLINE> Anti-Smuggling Effort Pays Off In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai customs cracked down
419 smuggling cases during the first half of this year, a 7.1
percent decline on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
The smuggled goods were worth 58.65 million yuan, a fall of 61.
2 percent compared with the 1999 figure.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, taxes collected by local customs grew by 30.6
percent year-on-year to a record high of 22.61 billion yuan,
accounting for 22.9 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The taxes included nearly 8.26 billion yuan of tariffs, a 32.3
percent rise on the 1999 level.
</P>
<P>
Anti-smuggling efforts, together with the enforcement of trade
order, the increase of domestic demand and the high rise of
imports by general trade contribute to the big increase of taxes
collected by local customs from January to June this year.
</P>
<P>
During the six-month period, imports and exports declared at
the local customs amounted to 50.05 billion US dollars, accounting
for 23.3 percent of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
Local imports by general trade soared 61.1 percent to 10.08
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
China started a nationwide campaign to combat the rampant
smuggling activities in 1998, which has been paying off.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Ecologists Eye on Changbai Mountains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Research fellows from Taiwan,
Chinese mainland, U.S., Canada and Austria have cooperated in the
research of soil, hydrology, meteorology and zoology in the
Changbai Mountains.
</P>
<P>
Changbai mountains in north east China's Jilin Province is well
known as an "international genepool of species" and an area with
the most intact ecological system internationally featured by over
70 species of trees, 90 kinds of ferns, over 1,250 species of
plants, some 50 species of wild beasts, more than 200 kinds of
birds and some 1,000 kinds of insects.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Hao Zhanqing, a research fellow in charge of the mountains'
ecological research, said, "The Changbai Mountains is a typical
research base for East Asia's ecology. It is also an ideal global
base for the integrated study of three hot research topics:
creature variety, climate changes and sustainable development."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more zoologists and botanists from overseas
have turned their eyes to the research of the mountains. To date,
China has set up co-research programs in the mountains with
research institutions from over 20 countries, including the United
States, Britain, Germany, Canada, Japan. And hundreds of
scientists and scholars from more than 40 countries would come
here to conduct study tours in the mountains and academic
exchanges with Chinese experts.
</P>
<P>
The Changbai Mountains Ecological System Research Station
established in 1979, has joined the United Nation's Man and the
Biosphere Program (MAB). In 1992, the research station was
approved as a key station in the research network of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences and became a member of the International Long-
term Ecological Research program of the United States in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Newsprint Prices Go Up: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The newsprint prices are expected
to go up further in the second half of this year, boosted by
rising material costs and increasing domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Two newsprint makers in north China announced a raise in prices
by 10 percent on Tuesday, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The price was pushed up to around 6,000 yuan per ton Tuesday,
according to sources with the two firms in north China's Jilin and
Qiqiha'er.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made just after newsprint makers in south
China's Yibin, Guangzhou and Yueyang raised their prices to about
5,800 yuan in June and July this year.
</P>
<P>
"We have given newsprint makers freedom to adjust their prices
according to the market demand," said Zhao Wei with the China
Association of Papermaking Industries.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said the price hike is reasonable and expected. "Cost for
newsprint makers have been rising as prices for papermaking
materials on the domestic and overseas markets have surged."
</P>
<P>
China is expected to use 1.6 million tons of newsprint this
year, compared with 1.4 million last year.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Rice Export Falls by Over Half in Fiscal 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1999-2000 year, Myanmar produced 19.92 million tons of
paddy out of 6.25 million hectares cultivated.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Myanmar's rice export was at a trend of down-
sliding. To meet the daily increasing food demand, the country has
since January 1999 leased out 400,000 hectares of vacant and
virgin lands for cultivation to private entrepreneurs, and
introduced policies including those exempting the import duties on
agricultural implements.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's cultivated land
covers 18.22 million hectares, of which 9.31 million hectares have
been utilized and 8.91 million remain to be reclaimed.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's agriculture accounts for 37 percent of the gross
domestic product and 25 percent of the export value.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Soldier Given Life Sentence For Killing Girl in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. soldier on Tuesday was
sentenced to  imprisonment for life without parole for the murder
of an 11-year-old Kosovo Albanian girl.
</P>
<P>
An American military court based in southern German city of
Wuerzburg handed down the maximum sentence on Staff Sgt. Frank
Ronghi, 36, who was found guilty of raping and murdering the girl,
Merita Shabiu, in mid-January this year, while he was on
peacekeeping duty in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Merita was raped and murdered in the basement of a house near
the town of Vitina, and her bruised and slashed body was found in
the snow outside the town on January 13.
</P>
<P>
According to the DPA, the German News Agency, there was
evidence that Ronghi had planned the raping and killing. Ronghi
had told his comrades he had a plan to "grab a little girl and
rape her, but would have to kill her to cover up the crime and
shift the blame to the Serbs," the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
In testimony, prosecutors detailed how Ronghi lured the girl
into the basement, where he raped her and killed her to stop her
cries. He went back for the body later, stuffed under a stairway
in two U.N. flour sacks, and buried it beneath the snow on a
hilltop, according to other media reports.
</P>
<P>
His sentence is the most severe one available to the American
military court in Germany, where the death penalty does not exist.
</P>
<P>
Ronghi, from the U.S. State of Ohio, was a weapons squad leader
assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment
in North Carolina. He was sent to Kosovo last summer.
</P>
<P>
Media reports quoted Ronghi as saying: "I don't know what went
wrong that day. I apologize from the bottom of my heart to the
family. I ask them for forgiveness."
</P>
<P>
The girl's father, Hamdi Shabiu, told reporters that while the
family was satisfied with the verdict and the U.S. Army's handling
of the case, they would never be able to forgive Ronghi.
</P>
<P>
"If he had accidentally killed her, we would forgive him on the
spot. But not only did he do what he did to her, he wanted to
hide her body, so that we would not even have a grave for her," he
was quoted as saying.

</P>
<P>
This is Bayern's fourth consecutive final victory in the

</P>
<P>
Iceland defender Eyjolfur Sverrisson put Hertha 3-0 down with
an own goal under pressure from new Bayern signing Ciriaco Sforza
in the 57th minute.
</P>
<P>
Striker Kai Michalke restored hope for the Berlin club by
pulling one back in the 61st minute, but Bayern hit back soon and
Zickler scored his second goal with a swift counter-attack in the
67th minute.
</P>
<P>
Zickler finished his hat-trick when there remained five minutes
to go.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Trade of NBA Players on First Day Signing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A heavy trade of NBA players
was witnessed Tuesday, the first day when NBA allowed the signing
of any contract with free agents and other players in the league.
</P>
<P>
A nine-player trade was finalized between Miami Heat and
Charlotte Hornets, and Chicago Bulls eventually got Ron Mercer,
while two other free agents changed teams as Tony Delk went from
Sacramento to Phoenix and Bobby Jackson went from Minnesota to
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
Also, Tim Thomas re-signed with Milwaukee, Kurt Thomas re-signed
with New York, Anthony Carter re-signed with the Heat, Sam Perkins
re-signed with Indiana, Scot Pollard re-signed with the Kings,
Dallas re-signed Hubert Davis and Gary Trent, and John Starks said
he was ready to sign with Utah for two years.
</P>
<P>
The Orlando Magic, the team to make the biggest splash, is
expected to formally announce the signings of Grant Hill and Tracy
McGrady on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Miami-Charlotte trade sends All-Star guard Eddie Jones and
forward Anthony Mason to Miami for forward P.J. Brown and guard
Jamal Mashburn. Also traded were Otis Thorpe, Tim James and Rodney
Buford to Charlotte, and Ricky Davis and Dale Ellis to Miami.
</P>
<P>
Charlotte avoided losing Jones without compensation by signing
him to a seven-year deal worth at least 86 million US dollars,
then trading him. He considered a free-agent offer from Chicago
but preferred to play in South Florida, where he grew up and has a
home.
</P>
<P>
Coach Pat Riley kept his backup point guard Carter, by re-
signing him to a one-year, 1.2 million dollars exception. But
Riley decided to dismantle the core of a Heat team that has won
four consecutive Atlantic Division titles, only to flop each year
in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
The Indiana Pacers reportedly reached an agreement with free
agent forward Austin Croshere on a seven-year, 51 million dollars
deal.
</P>
<P>
Mercer, who agreed to terms with Chicago, will be with his
fourth NBA team in four seasons. He played his first two years
with the Boston Celtics, was traded to Denver and then dealt to
Orlando last season, averaging 16.9 points.

<HEADLINE> Australian Government Supports Traditional Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the Australian Associated Press, Prime Minister
John Howard said Wednesday that there was overwhelming support in
his cabinet for the decision to ban single women and gay couples
from in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Australian Federal Court made a decision that
a ban on single women wanting to use a Victorian IVF program was
in breach of the Sex Discrimination Act. The cabinet discussed the
issue on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government wants to move an amendment to the act to ensure
that states such as Victoria and Western Australia can continue
their legislation which bans single women and gay couples from
using IVF technology.
</P>
<P>
Howard said Tuesday that children have the right to have a
father and a mother.
</P>
<P>
Traditional family in Australia is in trouble. The young
generation see family as a burden. Meanwhile there are around one
million gays and lesbians in the country who believe they have the
right to have children. The existing welfare system encourages the
life style as single parents enjoy more social aid.
</P>
<P>
Howard's plan is to touch a stormy debate. Both the Labor Party
and Democrats have stated they will vote the amendment down in the
Senate.

<HEADLINE> Technology Improving Crops' Photosynthesis Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist has developed
a kind of technology which can greatly improve crops'
photosynthesis efficiency, and helps upgrade crops' quality and
raise their output.
</P>
<P>
The Gene Phenotype Induction Technique (GPIT) was developed by
Na Zhongyuan, director of Yunnan Provincial Research Institute for
Ecological Agriculture, who spent 10 years on related experiments.
</P>
<P>
Trial use of this technology in Harbin, capital of northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province, shows that the per unit output of
cucumber is doubled and its quality markedly improved.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Dongbei (Northeast China) Agriculture
University confirmed that the cucumber's photosynthesis efficiency
is increased by 409 percent, vitamin rose by 28.7 percent and
amino acid up by 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Improving the photosynthesis efficiency is one of the methods
used to raise the grain output. Field crops in China, such as rice
and wheat, have a very low efficiency for absorbing light energy,
said experts.
</P>
<P>
Many countries have experimented with the development of
techniques for improving the crops' photosynthesis efficiency, and
none of them is successful.
</P>
<P>
Chinese government plans to invest 50 million yuan (6.02
million U.S. dollars) in a project which is aimed at unveiling the
secrets how green plants effectively transfer the solar energy
within five to ten years.
</P>
<P>
The GPIT technology has for the first time in the world solved
the problem of how to improve plants' photosynthesis efficiency,
according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Reports coming from Tibet Autonomous Region, and provinces of
Yunnan, Shandong, Heilongjiang and Jilin show that the
photosynthesis efficiency of different crops has risen by 50
percent to over 400 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Trial use of the technique also shows that it can greatly
improve crops' capability against low and high temperature,
diseases and insects.
</P>
<P>
In highlands and places with low temperature, the technology
can shorten the growth duration of crops, for example, wheat by
seven to 15 days, rice by 10 to 20 days, and maize by 30 to 40
days, experiments show.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by 2030, China has to increase its grain
output by one-third of its current quota to feed its huge
population. About two-thirds of the country's total land area are
highlands and places with cool and low temperatures.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, a total of 1.4 million hectares of crops were planted
with the GPIT technique, and the acreage is expected to be
expanded to more than two million hectares this year.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Seeks Investment for LNG Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province is seeking investment for constructing a gas receival
terminal and auxiliary transmission pipelines which are part of a
liquefied natural gas (LNG) project that will be built in the
province.
</P>
<P>
With approval from the State Council, the LNG project will be
built in two phases and will requires construction of one gas
receival terminal, gas transmission pipelines, two gas-firing
power plants, other minor works for supply of gas as fuel to urban
families in Guangdong and to Hong Kong, said sources from
Guangdong Provincial Development Planning Committee.
</P>
<P>
The terminal will be situated near Dapeng Peninsula in Dapeng
Gulf of Shenzhen and will be able to receive three million tons of
gas annually upon completion of the first phase construction.
</P>
<P>
The pipelines, with a total length of 509 km, will traverse
nine cities in the Pearl River Delta where 2.45 million urban
residents will benefit from the LNG project. The pipelines will
be erected in two stages.
</P>
<P>
The entire LNG is estimated to cost 36.8 billion yuan. The gas
receival terminal and the auxiliary transmission pipelines alone
will cost five billion yuan, 70 percent of which will be provided
by the Chinese partners, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
By now, feasibility study on the first phase of the LNG project
has just begun and is expected to be finished before October 2001.
The LNG project will start construction in the first half of 2002
and will be completed and put in service in late 2005, the sources
added.

<HEADLINE> Businessmen Benefit from Name of Ancient City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Buddhist city of Loulan had
been buried underneath the Taklimakan Desert for more than 1,500
years. Today, however, smart businesspeople of Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, northwest China, have brought the city back to
life by using its name for promoting their products.
</P>
<P>
The trademark "Loulan" has been widely used in the catering
service, recreational centers and tourism sector, and in naming
agricultural products, light industrial products and many others,
according to the trademark management office under the Xinjing
Uygur Autonomous Regional Bureau for Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
A group of hotels, restaurants and plants named after Loulan
have been built in Ruoqiang County where the ancient Loulan city
was located.
</P>
<P>
Liu Sanhai, a melon farmer from the county, registered a
trademark "Melon King of Loulan" in Beijing last year. As a result,
his melons sell very well in more than 20 provinces and autonomous
regions across the country.
</P>
<P>
Experts on history said that it is the rise-and-decline-history
of the Loulan Kingdom that has made the name of the city so
attractive.
</P>
<P>
"'Loulan' is very special, it's mysterious and you can always
be moved by something," said a consumer who loves to drink "Loulan
" grape wine. The wine was first produced in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Though the city of Loulan disappeared in the boundless desert,
its glorious past has been in the people's mind from the ancient
time to today.
</P>
<P>
Many poets in the Tang Dynasty (618-917) cited Loulan in their
poems to embrave soldiers who safeguarded the frontier.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the ruins of this ancient city, the "Loulan
Beauty" and other relics in the area since the beginning of this
century make the city more famous and attractive both at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Many people from business circles in Xinjiang said that they
will use "Loulan" as the edge tool to explore domestic and
international market.

<P>
LANZHOU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) will adopt
more preferential policies to support China in developing its vast
western region, a World Bank official said recently after an study
tour of Gansu province in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
China's development of its western region will provide more
opportunities for cooperation between the Chinese government and
the World Bank, the official added.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, Gansu has already implemented 21 WB-
financed projects which use loans totaling 653 million U.S.
dollars. And nine of the projects have been completed.
</P>
<P>
These projects covering Gansu's 14 prefectures and cities
involve agriculture, water control, forestry, education, public
health, transportation and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, World Bank will focus on supporting
the construction of water supply, environment protection, and
pollution-control projects in western China in the future.
</P>
<P>
World Bank is believed to have granted nearly 35 billion U.S.
dollars in loans to facilitate some 220 projects in China over the
past two decades.
</P>
<P>
These projects involved effort in poverty-relief, water and
soil erosion control and resettling of people residing in poor

<HEADLINE> Income Gap Between Urbanites, Peasants Bigger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Price reduction of farm produce has
led to a bigger gap of income between urbanites and peasants in
east China's Shandong Province, the country's No. 3 economic
powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
Cash income of peasants in Shandong saw a year-on-year 3
percent rise during the first half of this year, against the 15.1
percent increase for that of local urbanites, according to the
latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The provincial statistics did not tell how the high growth rate
of urbanites' income came from, but said urbanites now have had
multi-channel sources of income and that salary accounted for
smaller proportion of the actual income.
</P>
<P>
The half-year income of local urbanites reached 3,302 yuan per
capita, compared to 1,206 yuan per capita for peasants during the
period, which account for 70 percent of the population in the
province.
</P>
<P>
The 3 percent rise of peasants' income is mainly attributed to
the income from animal husbandry and vegetable growing.

<HEADLINE> No Casinos in Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- No casinos will be allowed to be
set up in western China despite the country's hope for more
foreign investment into the underdeveloped regions, China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The central government will absolutely not allow the
establishment of such amusement facilities as casinos, although it
is wooing more foreign investment into the western provinces,"
said an official from the Office for Western Development under the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
The idea to open casinos in the western regions goes against
the aspirations of most Chinese people. "We can't depend on such
ideas to develop the west," the official said.
</P>
<P>
There have been wide reports that local officials in the west
are pushing for greater authority and autonomy by encouraging a
flow of direct overseas investment into the area.
</P>
<P>
Proposals to build China's Las Vegas has also been put forward
as a major effort to promote the flow of foreign funds into the
region, sources claim.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Say Genes Can Cause Nerve Center Malfunctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have found out
that the activities of animal's nerve center are controlled by
certain genes.
</P>
<P>
A group of scientists from the No.4 Military Medical College in
this capital of northwest province of Shaanxi announced that they
have recorded nerve center malfunctions of a mouse after they
eliminated some genes from its genome.
</P>
<P>
The mouse soon died of brain hydropsy and hydrocele accompanied
with the death of a large number of nerve cells and a massive
transformation of never center, showing that the eliminated genes
had participated in the growth of the animal's nerve center.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that human beings identified genes
relating to the growth and functions of nerve center, according to
Professor Han Hua, who led the research group.
</P>
<P>
The malfunctions of nerve center can result in dementia among
the aged people and other serious nerve diseases. The scientists
believed that the breakthrough would help find out ways to cure
the diseases.
</P>
<P>
The scientists also discovered in a separate experiment that
the elimination of certain genes can cause arthritis and lymph
diseases.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Liberalize Auto Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- China is considering to further
liberalize the auto sector to prepare for the imminent entry into
the World Trade Organization (WTO), according to a front-page
story on "China Materials News".
</P>
<P>
Related departments disclosed that China will further abolish
restrictions on the sector to allow auto makers to manufacture all
varieties of automobiles and auto products and liberalize prices
on the car market.
</P>
<P>
Auto producers are encouraged to merge to promote scale
production in order to lower costs and enhance efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China is also considering to stop levying irrational
taxes, such as consumption tax imposed on auto factories and
license tax imposed on car-purchasers.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, a price war has been raging across the
country as a number of auto makers slashed their prices to promote
sales.
</P>
<P>
The Dongfeng-Citroen Automobile Co Ltd based in Wuhan, capital
of central China's Hubei Province, announced that it will cut the
price of its Fukang cars by 6,000 yuan (722.9 US dollars) to 15,
200 (1,831.3 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The unexpected announcement came just days after the company
said that it does not plan to follow Shanghai Volkswagen, which
cut the price of its Santana 2000 by more than 10,000 yuan (1200 U.
S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Jetta, a Changchun-produced Volkswagen model and Xiali,
produced in Tianjin, will be very likely to follow suit in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Industry observers commented that even though China will loosen
control on the sector and auto makers will try every means to sell
their products, consumers are still very cautious on buying cars.
</P>
<P>
Price cuts have not stirred up a wave of purchasing as many had
expected. Insiders said that price cuts will continue in the short
term.

HARARE, August 2 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki said here Wednesday that his country is ready to send troops
to the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), where the conflict entered its third
year the same day.
</P>
<P>
"Our forces have been ready for some time now as requested by
the U.N.," Mbeki said. "The only problem is that deployment is not
our matter, but a U.N. work."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki told reporters after meeting Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe that South Africa had an obligation to keep peace and
stability in Africa.
</P>

The U.N. has been dragging its feet on the planned deployment
of 5,500 peacekeepers to the third largest African country on
ground of ceasefire violations.

Troops from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have been fighting
alongside DRC President Laurent Kabila who is under attack from

Mugabe said that he will not withdraw Zimbabwean troops from
the DRC until peace comes to the war-torn country.

"We will not withdraw until conditions for peace are there."

<HEADLINE> Worldwide DVD Player Market to Expand This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Driven by the launch of DVD-
based games consoles, this year's worldwide market of DVD players
will experience a big expansion, with shipments hitting 22 million
units, according to a new research released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Retail revenues across the three major markets of the United
States, Europe and Japan will rise by 220 percent from last year
to reach 7 billion U.S. dollars, said U.S. market researcher
Strategy Analytics in the research report.
</P>
<P>
According to the research, DVD will become the standard home
video format within five years, largely replacing VHS cassettes.
DVD video disc shipments this year will reach nearly 400 million
units worldwide, and continue to soar to 2.3 billion by 2005,
worth 44 billion dollars. Including other DVD formats such as
games, ROM and audio, shipments will reach 3.7 billion units by
2005, worth nearly 100 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rising hardware sales are being offset by falling prices, said
the research firm, adding that Chinese-sourced players in
particular are having a noticeable impact.
</P>
<P>
"The content industry will ultimately benefit the most from DVD
's success," said the report. "Manufacturers will continue to
suffer from falling prices and declining margins, but DVD's
superiority will tempt many consumers to buy more video and to
replace their existing VHS collections."
</P>
<P>
Overall consumer sales of DVD devices will reach 46 million
units this year, including 21 million in the U.S. and 17 million
in Europe. Basic DVD players will account for two-thirds of set-
top shipments in 2000, the remainder being DVD games consoles,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 2000, the report said, 14 percent of U.S. and 5
percent of European homes will own at least one TV-based DVD
player. In addition, many homes are acquiring DVD-capable PCs, so
that overall household access to DVD is 25 percent in the U.S. and
14 percent in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Strike Again At San Francisco Hospitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The strike, the latest in a string of labor problems to hit San
Francisco hospitals, involved more than 3,500 employees
represented by the Service Employees International Union, ranging
from licensed vocational nurses to laboratory technicians,
secretaries, housekeepers and food service aides.
</P>
<P>
"Management of the multibillion dollar corporations will not
allow workers to have a real voice in decisions about staffing
levels and is refusing to ensure a stable and experienced
workforce to care for patients," the union said in a statement
announcing the strike.
</P>
<P>
The union said it was unable to reach an agreement with Sutter
Health, which operates five of the affected hospitals, and
Catholic Healthcare West, which operates three. Catholic
Healthcare West had left the bargaining table last Thursday, and
Sutter left Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The workers struck at 6 a.m. Wednesday and plan to walk picket
lines for 48 hours. Some of the hospitals plan to cut the number
of patients or canceled some elective surgeries.
</P>
<P>
The sticking point for the union is staffing. Union members say
they want a voice in determining staffing levels, which they say
are too low.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Robert Polzoni said Catholic Healthcare West had
offered a 12 percent raise over four years to the workers. He said
the union's demands amount to a 24 percent raise the first year,
which he called "outrageous." Management also called the union's
desire for lifetime job guarantees unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said they had taken steps to minimize the
impact of the work stoppage, and hoped it would not be necessary
to reschedule elective surgeries or move patients.
</P>
<P>
The two-day strike follows a one-day stoppage at many of the
same hospitals early last month. About 4,000 union members staged
a one-day strike July 6 at the eight hospitals, as well as two
independents, forcing many facilities to transfer patients, hire
replacement workers and cancel elective surgeries.
</P>
<P>
Labor problems have hit other local hospitals as well. Late
last month, about 1,700 nurses from the Stanford Medical Center
and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital ended a 50-day strike and
agreed to a contract providing a 10 percent pay hike over two
years.
</P>
<P>
At an Oakland hospital, a handful of anesthesiologists recently
quit their jobs in a protest over work conditions and pay.

<HEADLINE> British MPs Urge Caution on U.S. Anti-Missile Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A group of British members of
parliament (MPs) Wednesday urged the government to try and steer
the United States away from its National Missile Defense (NMD)
plan.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Affairs Select Committee in the House of Commons, a
cross-party group of MPs, said in a report that the U.S. plan is
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
"We are not convinced that the U.S. plans to deploy NMD
represent an appropriate response to the proliferation problems
faced by the international community," the committee said in the
report.
</P>
<P>
"We recommend that the government encourage the USA to seek
other ways of reducing the threat it perceives," the report said.
</P>
<P>
In a scheme fiercely opposed by China and Russia, the United
States said the NMD would offer some defense against "rogue"
states with nuclear capability.
</P>
<P>
But after two of the three U.S. experiments to shoot down
missiles over the Pacific have failed, there have been growing
calls in the U.S. Congress and from national security specialists
for President Bill Clinton to delay making a decision on deploying
the controversial 60 billion U.S. dollar system.
</P>
<P>
Britain is in a sensitive position because the first phase of
the U.S. plan requires an upgrading of a strategic radar base at
Fylingdales in Yorkshire, northern England.
</P>
<P>
The British government says it has had no direct request from
the U.S. and so does not have to make a decision.

<HEADLINE> Berlin Assumes Leading Role In Germany's Media Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Berlin, the new seat of the
German federal government, has also emerged as the country's media
capital, it was reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A study prepared by the Bremen-based BAW Institute for
Economic Research showed Berlin is leading other media centers of
the country in terms of employees' size in the media industry.
</P>
<P>
Berlin had 51,200 people working in the media industry in 1998,
just ahead of Hamburg, which had 51,100 employees in the media
sector, while in Munich, Cologne and Frankfurt, the number varied
from 49,800 to 28,000.
</P>
<P>
The study also showed that information technology plays an
ever important role in the media industry as it will generate an
additional 350,000 jobs for the sector by 2002.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Fingerprint Immigrants, Asylum Seekers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- British Home Office (interior
ministry) announced on Wednesday plans to introduce new system of
taking and storing fingerprints of asylum seekers coming into the
country, aiming to "clamp down on abuse" of immigration rules.
</P>
<P>
The new system,under which automated fingerprinting equipment
will be set up at immigration and asylum screening units, would
allow information to be shared with Britain's European partners,
the Home Office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The system is to be introduced in Britain in two phases, the
first scheduled to be complete by December this year and the
second by March 2001.
</P>
<P>
The new sysytem will speed up the processing of immigration
cases and improve detection of multipile applications, initially
within Britain, and longer term across the European Union.
</P>
<P>
It will also feed into Eurodac, a planned EU central database
to contain fingerprints of asylum applicants and certain other
third-country nationals.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office said the new fingerprinting system would force
EU member countries to take responsibility for illegal immigrants
they find and to discourage "asylum shopping" --where potential
immigrants go from state to state trying to get in.
</P>
<P>
"The automated fingerprint identification system will help us
to cooperate with other European countries to tackle illegal
immigration effectively," said Immigration Minister Barbara Roche
as the plan was announced.
</P>
<P>
She said Britain had "a long tradition of providing refuge to
those fleeing persecution" but added: "We are determined to clamp
down on abuse of the system."

<HEADLINE> L.American Balance of Payments Deficit To Be 50 BLn Dlrs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The current account deficit of
the balance of payments of Latin America and the Caribbean will be
some 50 billion dollars by the end of 2000, similar to that of
the previous year, according to a study made by the Latin America
and the Caribbean Economic Commission (CEPAL).
</P>
<P>
The study published Wednesday here said that the current
account deficit of the balance of payments will increase this year
in Colombia, Mexico and some Central American countries, while
Chile will have a moderate deficit after an equilibrated result in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Other countries will not register important variances, or will
have a lesser deficit than in the previous year, as in the case of
Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The regional deficit reduced variance will be the result of two
counteracting trends: the recovery of the growth rate of imports
associated to the reactivation of the activity, which reverted the
1999 drop, and a strong expansion in the value of exports,
attributed to the growth of the volumes and to the recovery of the
prices of many basic products, especially those of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
The region will show, for the first time since 1997 and the
start of the global crisis, a positive global result of the
balance of payments, and will not have to recur to reserves to
cover the deficit.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade shows a clear upward trend, recovering after the
1999 drop. This recovery was attributed as much to the factors
that determine the prices of the exported products, as to the
world and regional economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The economies' reactivation resulted also in a significant
increase of imports.
</P>
<P>
The CEPAL said that the world economic activity accelerated in
comparison to last year's, promoting the foreign demand of the
products of the region. The growth was especially rapid in the
United States, which benefited Mexico and the Central American and
Caribbean countries.

<HEADLINE> Greek Industry Continues Recovery in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Greek industry continued its
recovery in 1999, with a big increase in production, sales and
profitability, according to a study conducted by Greece's market
research company ICAP Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, which was based on a sample of 4,561 industrial
firms over the past two years, showed a 10 percent increase from
1998, and a favorable factor accounting for the improvement in
results was a larger gross profit margin, which increased to 23.6
percent in 1999 from 23.3 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Of the companies included in the sample, 3,482 were profitable,
compared to 3,437 in 1998, while those businesses which recorded
losses were fewer in number, reducing to 1,079 from 1,124 in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for End to Hostilities in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday called upon all parties to the conflict in Burundi to
end hostilities "without delay," and stressed the importance of
resuming development aid to the war-torn Central African country.
</P>
<P>
The call came in a press statement after the 15-nation Council
held closed-door consultations, which included an update from the
U.N. Secretariat on the outcome of the Arusha summit and its
follow-up.
</P>
<P>
The statement, read to the press by Security Council President
Agam Hasmy of Malaysia, said that Council members strongly
supported the facilitation efforts of Nelson Mandela, former
president of South Africa, and urged the parties to engage
seriously in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Council members also supported the holding of a donors
conference which would facilitate the relaunching of the Burundian
economy, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On the humanitarian front, Council members expressed concern
about the current situation and stressed the importance of
ensuring access to the population in need, as well as safeguarding
the security of workers, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the importance of the complete
dismantlement of Burundi's regroupment camps -- sites where
Burundian authorities have interned civilians despite widespread
opposition from the humanitarian community.
</P>
<P>
The army has forced hundreds of thousands of mainly Hutu
farmers into regroupment camps around the country in a bid to
flush out the rebels, and frequently tells villagers that anyone
found outside the camps will be treated as rebel, reports said.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in seven
years of civil war between the army and the Hutu rebels. Neither
the Burundian government nor rebels have accepted a peace plan put
forward earlier this month by mediator Mandela to end the war.

<HEADLINE> Britain Expresses Concern on U.S. NMD Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain said Wednesday that it is
concerned about the United States' National Missile Defense (NMD)
plan.
</P>
<P>
Following the publication of a British report on weapons of
mass destruction, prepared by a special committee in the House of
Commons, Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain said Britain would
continue to make clear Britain's concern in discussions with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to make clear to the U.S. in discussing our own
concerns," Hain said in a statement issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We agree that the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABMT) should
be preserved," Hain said.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, a cross-
party group in the parliament, said that the U.S. NMD plan is
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
"We are not convinced that the U.S. plans to deploy NMD

<HEADLINE> FORATOM Welcomes French Choice of Nuclear Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- European Atomic Forum (FORATOM)
said here Wednesday it welcomes a conclusion by a study for the
French government that nuclear power is likely to retain its
economic viability in France over the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The Brussels-based trade association for the European nuclear
industry said the French report concluded that existing nuclear
power stations should retain their cost advantage over gas-fired
plants,provided they are not closed down prematurely, and that
nuclear is likely to retain its economic edge when it comes to
building new generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
The 288-page report compiled for French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin, covering the period up to 2050, was produced by senior
officials from three separate organizations - a key public policy-
making forum, France's national scientific research center and
French atomic energy commission.
</P>
<P>
France started its major nuclear power program after the oil
crisis in early 1970s. Now, about three-quarters of electricity is
nuclear generated in France.
</P>
<P>
The authors of the report have stressed that their study is not
designed as a guide for policy-makers or an attempt to influence
public opinion, but provides technical, economic and ecological
information needed for a public debate on France's energy options
in the future.
</P>
<P>
"The French example now also shows that nuclear can maintain
its cost competitiveness, even when there is the attraction of low
gas prices. The new study demonstrates that nuclear is a viable
and desirable option in terms of both hard cash and environmental
protection," said FORATOM's Secretary General Wolf J. Schmidt-
Kuster.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S President Ford Suffers Mild Strokes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President Gerald
Ford was hospitalized Wednesday with slurred speech, dizziness and
arm weakness after suffering two small strokes during the
Republican national convention.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said the 87-year-old former president appeared to
suffer no brain damage or permanent disability and chances for a
full recovery were good.
</P>
<P>
The former president was in stable condition and his wife Betty
Ford was by his side. Ford walked into Hahnemann University
Hospital under his own power, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
"His thinking is perfect," said Dr. Robert Schwartzman, chief
of neurology at the hospital. "He'll have to be on medication but
I think he'll do very well."
</P>
<P>
Ford, America's 38th president, was saluted by the Republicans
at the national convention Tuesday night for his services during
his term.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton spoke with Mrs. Ford by telephone and
expressed his concern. Texas Governor George W. Bush, who arrived
Wednesday morning in Philadelphia to accept the Republican
presidential nomination, also spoke to Mrs. Ford by telephone and
conveyed "his prayers and love."
</P>
<P>
Ford was appointed vice president by Richard Nixon, and sworn
in as president in August 1974 after Nixon's resignation in the
midst of the Watergate scandal. He was defeated in the
presidential election in 1976 by Jimmy Carter.

<HEADLINE> Russia Remains Moldova's Number One Economic Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia remains the number one
economic partner of Moldova in spite of the latter's pledges to
turn to Western markets.
</P>
<P>
The former Soviet republic in the first half of this year
exported goods worth 94 million U.S. dollars (42 percent of the
total) to Russia, 22 million dollars more than those in the same
period of last year, the Moldovan Basa-press news agency reported
Wednesday, quoting sources of the Economics and Reforms Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine comes next with 19 million dollars worth of Moldovan
imports absorbed; Germany and Italy rank the third with 16 million
dollars each; and Romania imported Moldovan goods worth 14 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ministry said the exports to Romania
dropped two-three-fold compared with the previous years.
</P>
<P>
Romania is the number one country in terms of imports, with
Moldova absorbing goods worth 60.8 million dollars; Russia
accounted for 60.7 million dollars of Moldovan imports; Ukraine
for 48 million and Germany for 32 million.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, Moldova registered a 125.
7 million-dollar trade deficit, or 72.7 million dollars up from
last year's similar period.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign trade valued a total of 563 million
dollars in the first half of the year, of which the imports
amounted to 344.4 million.
</P>
<P>
An increase in exports was behind a 24.7 percent increase in

WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States is asking
Australia and Mexico to help fight the wildfires that have burned
close to 660,000 acres across nine Western states, U.S.
Agriculture Undersecretary Jim Lyons said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Australia could supply people with experience managing
firefighting operations and Mexican firefighting crews could help
control blazes in the southwest, relieving tired American crews,
Lyons told a news conference.
</P>

Canada has already supplied firefighting crews and aircraft to
support about 20,000 U.S. firefighters working across the West.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Official Defends Neutral Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's High Commissioner for
Peace Camilo Gomez Alzate defended Wednesday the neutral zone as a
mechanism for peace talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC).
</P>
<P>
Gomez took part in a discussion in the Senate about the 42,000
square kilometer neutral zone established at the end of 1998 in
the south of the country, where many charges of human rights
violations by the guerrilla have been made.
</P>
<P>
He said that the creation of the neutral zone not only has
facilitated dialogue and generated confidence between the parts,
but has also made it possible for the parts to discuss the
possibility of a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
With some 17,000 members, the FARC is the biggest insurgent
force in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We have entered a stage in which I expect concrete agreements
in a short time that will permit advance in the discussion of the
agenda and of the cease-fire and the end of the hostilities," said
the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Gomez Alzate said that it is necessary to make "prudent and
discrete" the discussion of a truce to avoid frustrating the
citizens' expectations.

<TEXT>
<P>
In Sequoia National Forest, 200 kilometers north of Los Angeles,
firefighters aided by rain increased the containment level of a 67,
000-acre blaze - one of the region's largest and most destructive -
from 15 percent to 40 percent, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman
Geri Adams said.
</P>
<P>
But the weather didn't help everywhere. Most of the
thunderstorms Tuesday night provided no relief, and experts
predict hot, dry conditions to continue across most of the region
for the next three or four days.
</P>
<P>
It wasn't immediately clear how many new fires lightning
triggered across the U.S. West, but the fire center reported that
more than 100 small fires in Montana's Bitterroot National Forest
were ignited just on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
One of the lightning fires was in Reno, Nev., and residents
were urged to flee several subdivisions. Crews hoped to have it
under control by late Wednesday. People also had been forced out
of homes in Montana and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
Other lightning-caused fires were reported in California and
Utah. More than 60 fires still burned in the U.S. West states
Wednesday and the forest was closed to all public use.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were at work Wednesday in southwestern Reno, where
the lightning fire burned through 2,500 acres, said Nevada
Division of Forestry spokesman Steve Frady, adding that residents
were urged to leave their homes in Reno's Huffaker, Lakeside,
Dryden and Holcolmb areas.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 residents and campers had been forced to evacuate
because of a fire 25 kilometers east of Jackson, Wyo. The fire was
started by lightning last week and more than doubled in size
overnight to 1,800 acres.
</P>
<P>
Forty-two large fires had burned close to 660,000 acres in
Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas,
Utah and Wyoming, according to the National Interagency Fire
Center in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
Across the U.S. West, more than 20,000 federal, state and local
firefighters were deployed to various fronts--thick forests, steep
canyons and desert range lands. Each fire was fostered by the same
twin devils of extreme temperatures and low humidity--exacerbated
by lightning strikes and gusting winds spawned by dry
thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
"The next 10 days are going to continue to be active, and the
prognosis doesn't look good," said Bob Valen, a fire information
officer for the Interagency Fire Center.
</P>
<P>
Cold fronts out of the Northwest, he said, aren't helping any
because they are delivering "gusty winds from thunder cell
buildups that aren't dropping rain but are throwing down lightning
bolts."
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of the nearly 61,000 fires that have occurred so
far this year were triggered by lightning, he said. "Most of them
were addressed with an initial [firefighting] response, but some
big guys got away from us."
</P>
<P>
The largest blaze in the West on Wednesday was, in fact, a
combination of 11 fires growing into one another in southeastern
Idaho. By Tuesday night, they had burned across 186,340 acres of
sagebrush, grass, juniper and big timber including fir, spruce and
lodgepole, officials said.

<P>
NAIROBI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- More Rwandan refugees in Imbuba
and Rukore camps in Tanzania have voluntarily registered for
repatriation despite threats from those who refuse to return home,
Rwanda News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Registration for repatriation is made secretly because camp
leaders and other Rwandans who do not want to return home threaten
to harass and kill those intending to voluntarily return home," a
returnee was quoted as saying in Rwanda's southeastern town of
Kibungo at the Rwanda-Tanzania border.
</P>
<P>
According to Eugene Barikana, Prefect of Kibungo Prefecture,
the major reason that has led people to flee Rwanda is rumors that
have circulated alleging that the Tutsi are planning a genocide-
like revenge on the Hutu population.
</P>
<P>
Sixty refugees have willingly returned home in two weeks time
following government efforts to sensitize all refugees to return
home.

More have been repatriated from the Democratic Republic of the

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Intensifies Efforts to Help Relieve Drought Victims in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Country Office of the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has accelerated and
intensified programs to prevent vulnerable children and women in
drought-hit areas in Kenya from falling victims of infectious and
waterborne diseases.
</P>
<P>
The office said in a statement here on Thursday that the agency
is pre-positioning essential drugs, water purification materials,
water equipment and parts, and supplementary food in Turkana, one
of the most affected districts in northwestern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF has shipped a consignment of 211 cartons of drugs worth
more than 3,200 U.S. dollars for combating a cholera outbreak in
Kisumu district in southwestern Kenya, the office said, adding
that emergency health kits and medical equipment valued at about
84,000 dollars have been dispatched to district hospitals in 19
drought-hit districts.
</P>
<P>
Since the onset of the drought later last year, UNICEF has
supplied a total of 900 tons of food at a cost of 404,100 dollars
to Turkana and Marsabit districts in northern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the European Union, the office said, the
agency's water and nutrition experts participated in a assessment
mission to three drought-hit districts, and one of the findings by
the mission is the need to increase supplementary feeding for
children in pre-primary schools.
</P>
<P>
In the water and sanitation sector, the agency said it is
currently installing boreholes and swallow well pumps in more than
50 water supply points in Turkana and other districts, and
supporting maintenance of boreholes in pastoral areas in northern
and northeastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The office noted that UNICEF is now supporting a 21-million-
shillings (about 280,000 dollars) multiple indicator cluster
survey to 9,000 households in 50 districts in the country to
generate new data on child survival, development and protection,
and other indicators including infant and maternal well-being.
</P>
<P>
The data is expected to be documented at the end of October
this year, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Meets S. African Foreign Affairs Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat was holding private talks with South African Foreign
Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma in Pretoria, the South
African Foreign Affairs Department said in a statement on Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is also to hold talks with South African President Thabo
Mbeki and former president Nelson Mandela, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader earlier on Thursday told journalists
when he arrived at Waterkloof Airforce base in Pretoria that he
wants Mandela to mediate in the Middle East peace talks and he has
envisaged a particular role for the former South African president.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that Arafat asked Mandela to assist.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela is still mediating in the Burundi peace
process and has expressed several times that he does not plan to
become directly involved in the Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
After the failed U.S.-brokered peace talks last month between
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in Camp David, the
Palestinian leader is again seeking support from his allies to his
strong position of unilaterally declaring a Palestinian statehood
on September 13 even if there was no peace accord by then.
</P>
<P>
Arafat previously paid a five-day visit to France and several
Arab states, including Egypt, during which he briefed the leaders
on the latest Camp David talks.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Denies Attacks on Eritrean Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has categorically
denied an allegation by the Eritrean side that its troops attacked
Eritreans on the border.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government spokesperson's office said in a
statement Wednesday evening that the Ethiopian army, which is now
in control of Senafe and its surrounding areas, was in fact
providing humanitarian assistance from its own nations.
</P>
<P>
Senafe, a border town of Eritrea, has been under control of
Ethiopian army since a new round of border conflict broke out in
mid-May between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Instead of attacking on Eritrean civilians, Ethiopian army is "
distributing fertilizer inputs and agricultural implements to
enable the farmers in the area to make the best use of the rainy
season and plough their plots", the office said.
</P>
<P>
While accusing the Eritrean side of refusing a planned United
Nations team visit, which was to undertake humanitarian missions
in the Senafe area, the office said that Ethiopia agreed that the
humanitarian situation in Senafe area be addressed within the
framework of the mission of the U.N. reconnaissance team to
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The office also appealed to the international community to
exert enough pressure on the Eritrean authorities to
unconditionally release the thousands of Ethiopian citizens taken
in captivity and held in very hostile and inhabitable camps.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Supports Palestinians to Declare Statehood: Mbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki said on Thursday that his government supports the
Palestinian Authority to declare an independent Palestinian state
on September 13.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference in Pretoria after meeting
with Mbeki, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reiterated that
September 13 is the last possible date for independence.
</P>
<P>
"On that date we have the right to declare an independent state,
" Arafat said. "I'm still committed to the hope that we still may
conclude the peace process by September 13 through the help of U.S.
President Bill Clinton."
</P>
<P>
He said the main obstacles to reaching a final peace agreement
are Palestinians' right to get back East Jerusalem, as well as the
right of Palestinian refugees to return or get compensation.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Israeli troops have been deployed in many areas of the
Palestinian territories, Arafat said. "This is a real menace to
the peace process and our future. We have conveyed this to the
Americans and our friends."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said: "We hope Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
recognizes the flexibility shown by the Palestinian leadership to
find solutions to address all the concerns."
</P>
<P>
He noted that South Africa's support for Palestinian statehood
is a long-standing policy, which is also the policy of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Non-Aligned Movement (
NAM).
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the two leaders followed Arafat's five-day
visit to France and several Arab states in the wake of the failed
U.S.-brokered peace negotiations between him and Barak at Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said the Palestinians need South Africa's help, both as
a country and as chair of NAM.
</P>
<P>
He added he has again mentioned to Mbeki that he wants former
South African President Nelson Mandela to act as international
mediator in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Post, Telecommunications Workers Continue Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's post and
telecommunications workers Thursday vowed to continue a
countrywide strike over pay cut which entered the fourth day.
</P>
<P>
The workers went on strike on Monday following the decision by
the management to reduce their salaries by up to 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
President of Zimbabwe Post and Telecommunications Workers'
Union Lovemore Matombo told the Zimbabwe News Agency that the
management had infringed the rights of the workers.
</P>
<P>
"We had not yet concluded our negotiations and all of a sudden
the management unilaterally decided to cut our salaries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The workers were awarded salary increments of up to 300 percent
last February.
</P>
<P>
Matombo dismissed claims by the management that the strike was
illegal, saying what was illegal instead was the action by the
management to reduce salaries without consulting the workers.
</P>
<P>
The strike has paralyzed postal and telecommunication services
countrywide.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela said on Thursday that he was prepared to
do everything possible to help find a peaceful solution to the
Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his home in Johannesburg after talks with visiting
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Mandela confirmed that the
Palestinian leader had asked him to act as a mediator in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mandela called for collective effort involving the West and
other Arab states to solve the Palestinian issue, saying he could
not bring about a solution on his own.
</P>
<P>
He said the reason why the U.S.-brokered Camp David talks
between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak last month
had failed was that it had not been a collective process.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he had warned U.S. President Bill Clinton in
October last year that peace in the Middle East had not been
brokered for 25 years because nations had failed to act
collectively.
</P>
<P>
He said it was important that countries like the U.S., Britain,
France, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Russia worked together to broker
peace.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he would phone the heads of states of these
countries in an attempt to revive the peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Burundian President Pierre
Buyoya arrived in South Africa on Thursday for talks with former
President Nelson Mandela in a bid to break a deadlock in peace
efforts in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya was scheduled to hold talks later Thursday with Mandela,
who has been trying to broker a peace plan aimed at ending a seven-
year civil war in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian government and opposition leaders have been at
loggerheads over the release of political prisoners, the
announcement of a cease-fire and problems related to the
implementation of a proposed accord.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the proposed peace plan has been scheduled for
August 28.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya, however, wanted hostilities to cease before the 109-page
accord could be signed. Mandela expressed the belief that this
could follow the signing. Mandela has also proposed that a
transitional government be set up, Hutu anti-government forces be
integrated into the Tutsi-dominated army and political prisoners
be released.
</P>
<P>
The conflict erupted in October 1993 when the country's first
democratically elected president Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, was
assassinated by Tutsi troops. At least 200,000 people, most of
them civilians, have been killed.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The value of goods imported
by East African Community (EAC) countries in 1998 was over twice
the value of their exports in the same period.
</P>
<P>
According to an economic report issued Thursday by the EAC
secretariat based in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha, its three
member countries, namely Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, exported a
total of 3.05 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods in 1998, while
imported goods worth 6.18 billion dollars in the same year.
</P>
<P>
The principal exports included tea, horticulture, coffee,
cement, cotton, tobacco and diamond. Others were fish and fish
products, soda ash, gemstones, limestone and gold.
</P>
<P>
As far as imports were concerned, the report said, the major
products included machinery, industrial supplies, motor vehicles
and chassis parts and accessories, and refined petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
As for tourism, the three countries under review received a
total of 1.6 million tourists compared to 1.2 million in 1993. The
industry brought them an income of 948 million dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the total foreign debt for them amounted to 703
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda signed in Arusha last
November the East African Community Treaty, which is aimed at
gradually forging the block into a monetary union and later a
political federation.
</P>
<P>
The regional block, with a combined area of 1.8 million

LAGOS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Ministry of Agriculture
has proposed an "egg-in-mid-day meal" scheme for the country's
school kids.
</P>
<P>
The scheme is aimed at supplying free of charge at least one
egg to every primary school pupils per day to ensure the basic
nutrition they get, the Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper,
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has included the expenses on the scheme in its

</P>
<P>
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), in its bid to

four states of the federation to encourage them to attend classes.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a source from the Ministry of Agriculture as

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Hostages to Be Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The multinational oil company,
Royal Dutch Shell, said that it has reached an agreement with
representatives of armed men holding 165 workers hostage on two of
its oil rigs in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcast Cooperation (BBC) Thursday reported that
a spokesman for the company said late on Wednesday that members of
a local community in the Niger Delta, who had stormed the rigs on
Monday, had agreed to vacate them on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the hostages, including 144 Nigerians, seven
US citizens, five Britons and some Australians and Lebanese, were
safe.
</P>
<P>
The armed men were demanding employment with the company and
unspecified "compensation" for taking oil from the area, according
to the company.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Dutch Shell spokesman said that the group's demands
would be discussed at a meeting next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Militants in the Niger Delta region have frequently taken
foreign workers hostage in order to draw attention to their cause,
demanding money or jobs.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Faces Difficult Task of Alleviating Poverty: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said South Africa still lags behind most other middle income
countries in key human development indicators such as life
expectancy, infant mortality and adult literacy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of this year's United Nations Human
Development report in Johannesburg, Skweyiya said statistics on
South Africa did not present the full picture of the human
suffering experienced in communities on the margins of a society.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa, as we all know is characterized by persistent
and deepening poverty, which is accompanied by social alienation
and related pathologies," he said.
</P>
<P>
The poorest 40 percent of households received only 11 percent
of the country's total income, while the richest 10 percent
received more than 40 percent, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The age, gender and racial characteristics of the population
indicated that the most vulnerable households were in the rural,
peri-urban and township areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The realities ... demand that we seriously find ways of
turning the rhetoric of democratic governance and human rights
into concrete action as a world community," Skweyiya said.
</P>
<P>
"Let us remember that beyond the confines of these cloisters
are real people with real and urgent need," he said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Leader to Visit S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat will arrive in South Africa on Thursday for talks with
President Thabo Mbeki and former president Nelson Mandela, South
African Foreign Affairs Department announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the department was not able to give details of Arafat'
s visit, only saying that the Palestinian leader will seek support
from South Africa to declare an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is expected to meet Mandela in Johannesburg on Thursday
afternoon, the department added.
</P>
<P>
Before last month's failed U.S.-brokered peace talks between
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Arafat's Palestine
Liberation Organization pledged to implement Palestinian statehood
on September 13 even if there was no peace by then.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who hosted the latest Camp David
talks which broke down on July 25 in a dispute over control of
east Jerusalem, has threatened to review his government's
relationship with the Palestinians if they go ahead with the
declaration.
</P>
<P>
Arafat on Wednesday said he has won strong support from Arab
nations for his stance presented at the Camp David.
</P>
<P>
Arafat stressed Jerusalem belongs not only to Palestinians, but
to all Arabs, Christians and Muslims, and he has no mandate to
make compromises without their approval.
</P>
<P>
Since last Saturday, Arafat has visited France, Saudi Arabia,
Yemen, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Sudan and Egypt for briefing the
Camp David talks.

<HEADLINE> Another Burundian Rebel Group Refuses to Sign Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Another main Hutu rebel
group in Burundi has declared that it will not sign the peace
accord scheduled for later this month, the independent Guardian
newspaper in Tanzania reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bihute Bernard, spokesman of the Hutu People's Liberation Party-
-the National Liberation Force (PALIPEHUTU-FNL) in East Africa,
was quoted as saying in Tanzanian capital on Wednesday that his
party has nothing to do with the anticipated signing of the said
peace accord, therefore they will not sign it.
</P>
<P>
"How can we take part in a deal in which we were not involved
since it started about four years ago? " the spokesman asked.
</P>
<P>
Bernard said his group was ready to take part in the talks from
the beginning, but some personalities inside the mediation team
became hurdles to its participation.
</P>
<P>
He said the accord would be meaningful if the group, under
Commandant Kabura Cossana, held talks with President Pierre Buyoya
's government.
</P>
<P>
The talks would be on the merger of "our armies," he said. "
This is the only way we can end the 7-year-old war. Otherwise, let
them sign but the war will continue," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
The group is the third party to declare that it will not sign
the accord.
</P>
<P>
Last week, another major armed rebel group CNND-FDD (the
National Council for the Defense of Democracy --Forces for the
Defense of Democracy) and the military government under President
Pierre Buyoya said they will not sign the accord, which is being
discussed by warring parties involved in the peace talks held in
Tanzania's northern town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Despite efforts made by peace facilitator, former South African
President Nelson Mandela, PALIPEHUTU-FNL did not attend the last
round of peace talks held two weeks ago in Arusha, which brought
together 19 parties and groups involved in the peace process and
CNDD-FDD which attended for the first time as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Mandela had announced earlier last month that a peace deal
would be signed on July 20. However, the date was later postponed
to August 28 because of "some material details" related to a
ceasefire and the implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the power-sharing draft accord, the Tutsi minority, which
has dominated Burundi's political and economic life since
independence, would have to hand over power to a democratically
elected government in three years' time.

be free and those on trial will be supported fully until the

KAMPALA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Vice-President Specioza
Kazibwe is to pitch camp in Karamoja in the northeastern Uganda
for 10 days to discuss strategies to tackle the food crisis in the
region, the New Vision newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe and Minister of Disaster Preparedness Tom Butime made

<HEADLINE> Zambian Former Minister Faces Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian Environment
Minister Ben Mwila is facing arrest as the state house is scheming
to implicate him in a military coup, The Post newspaper reported
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted officials from Zambia Intelligence
Security Services (ZISS) as saying that Mwila would soon be picked
up and detained on allegations that he is planning to unlawfully
topple President Frederick Chiluba's government.
</P>
<P>
"It's possible there could be a declaration of a state of
emergency so that even Mwila's supporters are all picked up and
detained," said the officials, adding, "All this is aimed at
totally frustrating his presidential ambitions."
</P>
<P>
Mwila was quoted as saying that he has heard something like
that and is ready for anything.
</P>
<P>
He said that getting rid of him would not solve the problems
Chiluba and his ruling party are facing, adding that time would
vindicate him because he is not a violent man by nature.
</P>
<P>
Mwila lost his ministerial portfolio in early July days after
he was expelled from the country's ruling Movement for Multi-Party
Democracy (MMD) on a charge of involvement in anti-party
activities.
</P>
<P>
Mwila announced his candidature for the MMD presidency last May
in a bid to run for the country's presidency in the general
elections to be held next year.
</P>
<P>
Mwila, one of the country's richest magnates, helped incumbent
President Chiluba defeat former president Kenneth Kaunda in the
1991 elections. He is seen as one of the leading candidates to
replace Chiluba in the next year's elections.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Rehabilitates International Airport in Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Jomo Kenyatta International
Airport in Kenya's capital Nairobi is undergoing rehabilitation to
cater for passenger movement ranging between 2.5 million and 2.7
million annually, according to the Kenya Airports Authority (KAA).
</P>
<P>
KAA Managing Director Stephen Muriithi Wednesday said in a
statement that the airport has recorded unprecedented traffic and
passenger growth, leading to a saturation capacity at the terminal
building, the East African Standard newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Further traffic growth will result in considerable congestion
in transit lounges and check-in counter among other facilities,"
Muriithi added.
</P>
<P>
A Belgian company, L M Chapeaux, won the bid to undertaken the
rehabilitation project at a contract sum of 2.6 billion shillings
(about 34.8 million U.S. dollars), said Muriithi, adding that the
company provided the authority with more flexible sourcing and
procurement for equipment from various countries such as Britain,
the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the development of the airport as a hub, Muriithi
said, there is need for all constraints to traffic growth to be
eliminated and facilities be refurbished to meet set standards in
safety, security, operational efficiency and passenger comfort.
</P>
<P>
The managing director said between 1990 and 1997, passenger
traffic using the airport grew at an average rate of 5 percent
annually.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Resumes Loan to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has approved a
loan of 150 million U.S. dollars to Kenya in recognition of the
country's reform efforts last year, according to a World Bank
official.
</P>
<P>
The new loan would be released in three portions of 50 million
dollars each in the next nine months and the first portion was
available immediately, Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper Thursday
quoted the bank's country director to Kenya Harold Wackman as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank suspended its budgetary support to Kenya in 1997
soon after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) halted its loan,
citing corruption and mismanagement in the government.
</P>
<P>
The other two portions of the loan approved on Wednesday would
be given when Kenya meets specific performance targets, Wackman
said.
</P>
<P>
The loan is to support poverty reduction, retrenchment in civil
service, privatization of state-owned enterprises and budget
support, according to Wackman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kenyan Finance Minister Chris Okemo said
negotiations with the bank for a 75-million-dollar power emergency
loan were progressing. The sum of money will be used to buy an
emergency power generator to alleviate the current severe power
shortage.
</P>
<P>
The IMF resumed its loan to Kenya last Thursday, saying that
the east African country had made a clear improvement in anti-
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's economy has been in the doldrums since 1997 when most
international financial institutions withdrew aids from the
country. The economic growth declined to 1.4 percent in 1999 from
4.3 percent in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Publish New Petroleum Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has drafted
a new petroleum bill containing tough penalties against those
violating rules governing the sale of petroleum products in a
liberalized market.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Energy Minister Francis Masakhalia disclosed here
Wednesday that the new bill has covered key areas not included in
the existing legislation while fines and penalties have been
enhanced, the East African Standard newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry had finalized the draft on petroleum bill
which has been forwarded to the Attorney-General to be enacted
into an Act of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the new law will address the issues of
adulterated fuel products in a liberalized market, and the
existence of sub-standard retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
The bill requires all petroleum facilities to carry out an
environmental impact assessment of their undertaking, indicating
possible hazards emanating from their operations, Masakhalia said,
adding environment polluters and local authorities are required to
designate parking places for petroleum road tankers.
</P>
<P>
Under the new legislation, he said, companies will also be
required to report to the ministry all significant accidents which
may occur during their operations.
</P>
<P>
"Failure to comply with these provisions will attract
substantial fines," the minister warned, saying the new bill has
been enacted over failure by the current law to address some of
the problems in the petroleum sub-sector.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Herdsmen Told to Be out of National Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) has
told drought-striken pastoralists to drive their livestock out of
Mount Kenya National Park, saying that the herdsmen were an
additional threat to the forest park.
</P>
<P>
Herdsmen were aggravating the menace to the park posed by
illegal timber merchants and bhang-growers, Kenya's major
newspaper Daily Nation Thursday quoted KWS director Nehemiah
Rotich as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If they are allowed into Mount Kenya, it will create the
impression that it is all right for other drought-striken herdsmen
to move in Amboseli and Tsavo national parks," Rotich said.
</P>
<P>
Mount Kenya National Park, situated near the Equator, abounds
in a wide variety of plants and animals of temperate and cold
zones. The park is one of natural treasures designated by the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's national parks, with its unique plants and wild animals,
allure many foreign visitors to the country. The tourism sector is
the third biggest foreign currency earner after coffee and tea.
</P>
<P>
Rotich also urged local officials to help keeping the herdsmen
out to the park, saying tourists do not come to see cattle.
</P>
<P>
However, the failure of last two consecutive rainy seasons has
led to a severe drought, which is pushing Kenyan pastoralists to
the brink of starvation. Livestock have died in large numbers due
to lack of pasture.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Reduces Communities' Education Contributions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has reduced
communities' contributions to education under the Micro Projects
Unit (MPU) from 25 percent to 15 percent, Zambia Daily Mail
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Godfrey Miyanda was quoted as saying to the
parliament on Wednesday that, the decision to cut contributions to
the construction, upgrading and rehabilitation of schools followed
complaints from lawmakers and the general public that some
communities were failing to raise the 25 percent contribution
under the old MPU arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said that the previous administrative
cost of 1.5 million kwacha (about 500 U.S. dollars), which was
demanded by MPU, is no longer a requirement for the disbursement
of funds.
</P>
<P>
He said since November 1999 his ministry has released about 4.5
million dollars to MPU for disbursement to projects throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 classrooms will be built and 2,000 will be
rehabilitated between 1999 to 2005 and 2,000 teachers' houses will
be built within the same period, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Chile To Announce Pinochet Ruling Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The decision will not be given today and I think neither
tomorrow, but I expect to have it ready on Tuesday. So, I repeat
that the cause is being discussed and there is nothing concrete
yet on the matter, said the Chilean justice.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean Supreme Court ended its plenary session Tuesday
afternoon with no pronouncement on Augusto Pinochet's immunity
privation case.
</P>
<P>
In May, a Santiago court voted 13-9 to strip Pinochet, 84, of
his immunity from prosecution. Pinochet appealed against that
ruling in the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, judges heard testimony from lawyers
representing the families of victims of Pinochet's 17-year rule
and from lawyers defending him.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet ousted socialist President Salvador Allende in a
bloody September 1973 coup. More than 3,000 people died or
disappeared while Pinochet was president and tens of thousands of
other Chileans fled the country.
</P>
<P>
One of the most infamous incidents of the era involved the so-
called "Death Caravan," a military helicopter unit that blitzed
through northern Chile in October 1973 in search of union leaders
and left-wing supporters of Allende. At least 72 people were
killed.

<P>
LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- British Gordon Brown Chancellor
Gordon Brown will marry his girlfriend Sarah Macaulay in Scotland
Thursday, it was reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The couple will tie the knot in Brown's parliamentary
constituency of Dunfermline East Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The pair will leave for their honeymoon after the wedding
although their destination has not been revealed.
</P>
<P>
Brown and Ms Macaulay met six years ago when her PR firm,
Hobsbawn and Macaulay Communications, was involved in arranging
Labor party events. They began dating in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Despite widespread speculation about their relationship, there
was no hint that wedding plans were being drawn up before
Wednesday's surprise statement.
</P>
<P>
Brown is said to have proposed to Ms Macaulay in January and
the couple fixed a date for the wedding shortly afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Following the announcement, Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a
statement congratulating the couple but it is understood that he
and his wife, Cherie, will not attend the wedding.
</P>

<HEADLINE> L. American Economy To Grow 4 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The economy in Latin America and
the Caribbean will record this year a 4 percent economic growth
and a 10 percent inflation, the Economic Commission for Latin
America and the Caribbean (CEPAL) forecast Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Latin America and the Caribbean are gradually recovering this
year from the recession that affected many economies of the region
in the second half of 1998, said the CEPAL in a report.
</P>
<P>
The organization, with its headquarters in Santiago, said that
the 10 percent average inflation of the region will be similar to
that in the 1997-1999 period, and that there will be a slight
recovery in the labor markets.
</P>
<P>
The CEPAL foresees in the study a current account deficit for
this year close to 3 percent of the gross domestic product, a
percentage that does not mean a major variance from 1999, but that
is much less than that of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Latin America and the Caribbean have started a new cycle of
growth in the last 10 years at a bigger rate than that in the
previous years, and from a global point of view, added the CEPAL.

<HEADLINE> Italy Calls For Turkey Tighter Anti-immigration Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Italy renewed its call on Tuesday
for Turkey to keep a closer eye on its ports, in the wake of the
arrival on the Italian southern coast of Calabria of an immigrant-
laden ship of Turkish origins.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Foreign Ministry sent for Ankara's Ambassador to
Rome Necati Utcan to inform him of Italy's "great concern" over
the incident of the ship, the Kalsit, which ran aground near
Crotone on the Calabrian coast early last Sunday morning with 418
illegal immigrants aboard, Italian news agency Ansa reported.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Ministry Secretary General Umberto Vattani told
Utcan that Rome "hoped that the Turkish authorities would show the
greatest vigilance in order to prevent similar episodes recurring.
"
</P>
<P>
Vattani stressed the importance of close bilateral co-operation
on illegal immigration issues, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It said that Utcan had underscored Turkey's awareness of the
seriousness of the problem and its willingness to collaborate
fully with Italy and other neighboring countries in order to
combat criminal activities such as immigrant smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Utcan also told Vattani that the Turkish authorities were eager
to glean as much information as possible about the Kalsit and its
itinerary, in order to track down those responsible for any lax
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Illegal immigration has become a burning social and political
issue in Italy, particularly in the wake of a fatal incident on
July 24,when four people, including two Italian police officers,
were killed when immigrant traffickers in a high- powered rubber
dinghy rammed a coast guard boat just off the coast of Puglia
region.
</P>
<P>
The incident caused a huge public outcry and Opposition demands
that the government take a firmer line against smugglers and those
countries from which the traffickers set out.

<HEADLINE> CEPAL Sees Good Signals in Chilean Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Chilean economy has good
perspectives for this year in an atmosphere of higher
international economic movement and especially of Asia,  said a
study of the Economic Commission for Latin America (CEPAL) on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A six-percent growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) is
foreseen for Chile this year, despite the rise in the oil prices,
which have a strong influence on the internal prices. The
authorities estimate that the rate of inflation will move within a
range close to four percent.
</P>
<P>
An equilibrated balance of trade is foreseen for the external
sector and a slight deficit in the current account of about two
percent of the GDP, said the study of CEPAL.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed In Second Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The blue chip stocks on Wall
Street rose again Wednesday as the new economic data eased
uncertainty about higher interest rates. But the tech shares fell.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 80.58 at 10,687.53,
extending its gains of 84.97 points Tuesday and 10.81 points
Monday.
</P>
<P>
But the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 27.06 at 3,
658.46. The composite lost 81.47 points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 0.60 at 1,438.70.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip stocks rose as the Conference Board said in a
survey that its Composite Index of leading Economic indicators was
unchanged in June, indicating that the U.S. economy is slowing
after six rate hikes in the past 13 months. In addition, the
government reported that U.S. home sales fell in June to their
lowest level in two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
The new data raised hope that the Federal Reserve will leave
rates unchanged at the August 22 meeting. Later last week, a
stronger-than-expected economic growth of 5.2 percent at an annual
rate in the second quarter sparked fears of more rate hikes and
therefore hit the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Among the rate-sensitive stocks which moved up in the financial
sector today were Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. IBM and
Hewlett Packard, both are the Dow's components, were also higher.
</P>
<P>
But the Nasdaq index fell as Wall Street analysts said earnings
forecasts for a number of big tech names will be unsustainable in
the second half of the year. Dell Computer and Cisco System fell
on fears of future profits.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 2.35 at 650.31 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 0.82 at 912.74. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 2.45 at 500.22.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,594 up, 1,295 down and 473
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 983.05 million shares from 917.29
million in the previous session.
