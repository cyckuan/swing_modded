<HEADLINE> Wenger Struggles to Keep Kanu on FA Cup Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
club Arsenal mananger Arsene Wenger has refused to abandon hope of
losing Kanu from this weekend's FA Cup fourth round tie.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal are still locked in talks with the player's agents and
Nigerian coach Amodu Shaibu, who has threatened to invoke FIFA
sanctions to get the Gunners kicked out of the FA Cup if Kanu isn'
t released on time.
</P>
<P>
FIFA rules state Kanu should join his Nigeria team-mates on
Sunday to prepare for the African Nations Cup but the Londoners
want him to play in the FA Cup tie with Leicester on the same day.
</P>
<P>
An Arsenal spokesman said: "We are pursuing the possibility of
Kanu playing in Sunday's FA Cup clash with Leicester and are
currently trying to resolve the matter with the relevant parties."
</P>
<P>
Nigerian coach Shaibu hit out at Wenger's delaying tactics but
the parties are still involved in a series of talks about when the
player will leave Highbury.
</P>
<P>
Shaibu has even threatened to invoke FIFA's 14-day rule which
governs clubs releasing players for major tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Shaibu said: "If Arsenal play Kanu in the FA Cup we will invoke
FIFA sanctions against them. If it was a league game they would
lose the points, so if it's a cup tie they must lose the tie."
</P>
<P>
FIFA regulations state that all players should be available 14
days before a major tournament starts.

<HEADLINE> Charlton Hit Back at Man United Director  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Bobby Charlton has hit back at
claims by chairman Martin Edwards that the club would rather be
back in England playing in the FA Cup than competing in the
inaugural World Club Championship in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Manchester United director and former England star
believes United should grab the chance to create a slice of
footballing history.
</P>
<P>
Charlton said: "History will show, once again, that we were
right to accept the new challenge - we have the chance to write a
new page in history by becoming the first winners of the World
Club Championship."
</P>
<P>
He added: "When Sir Matt Busby saw the importance of competing
in Europe in the 1950s it did not go down well with the little
Englanders who thought we should stick to domestic football.
</P>
<P>
"And it is sometimes forgotten that England did not enter the
early World Cups and I cannot believe that there is anyone today
who would defend that decision."
</P>
<P>
But Charlton believes United's task shouldn't be underestimated
as they prepare to face Mexican side Necaxa in the first of their
group games on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Winning in Brazil will not be easy as the hot and humid
conditions will be alien to the English style of play.
</P>
<P>
"But I cannot believe anyone in England would not take some
pride when an English team can truly say it is the best in the
world - in any sport, not just football," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pak Border Authorities Said to Be Alerted to Arrest Hijackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan reiterated Wednesday
that it has alerted its border authorities to be vigilant and
arrest the hijackers of an Indian airliner if they attempt to
cross into its territory.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman said, "Pakistan remains firm on its
intent to try the hijackers in accordance with the law. Border
authorities have been alerted to maintain strict vigilance in
order to arrest the hijackers if they attempt to enter Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, since the end of the hijacking on
the last day of the past millennium, the Indian government has not
made any contact with the government of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the episode, the government of Pakistan has
condemned all acts of terrorism including hijacking and provided
all assistance to India which was initially appreciated by India,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
However, he charged that India has failed to provide any
evidence or any relevant information to Pakistan which would
facilitate the arrest of the hijackers or prove that they had any
links in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of any information regarding their identity has so far
frustrated attempts to find them," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also asked New Delhi to make available the transcripts of
the negotiations conducted with the hijackers by Indian
negotiators at Kandahar Airport of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has repeatedly
accused Pakistan of involvement in the hijacking of the Indian
Airlines plane which had been stranded in Afghanistan for seven
days with more than 150 hostages on board.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called such accusations an "Indian propaganda
campaign against Pakistan" and "a crude attempt to externalize her
own problems."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Afghanistan's ruling Taliban, who dealt with the
hijacking drama along with India, had refuted the Indian
allegation that the hijackers were Pakistanis and they had left
for Quetta, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Beats Fernandez at HK Millennium Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- World top-ranked player
Martina Hingis of Switzerland got a flying start in the new year
Wednesday when she outclassed American veteran Mary Joe Fernandez
in straight sets in the Hong Kong Millennium Cup.
</P>
<P>
"It's quite OK. Winning the first match gave me confidence in
the coming Australian Open," said Hingis.
</P>
<P>
The first set turned out to be a breaking game when the two
players broke each other in the first six games before Hingis took
the first set 6-3.
</P>
<P>
The second set saw the world number one attacking with more
powerful returns and sound movement in the court while Fernandez
began making more unforced errors and could not cope with Hingis'
speedy and angled returns.
</P>
<P>
Hingis won the second set 6-1 and the match in just one hour.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Fernandez, who stayed out of the WTA tour for a
long time because of her health and was broken in every serving
game, said Hingis played very well.
</P>
<P>
"She (Hingis) was hard and powerful in the court today," said
world number 38 Fernandez who has been playing on the WTA tour
for 15 years and reached a career high ranking of four in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, 19 years old, vowed to defend her status as world
number one player in the new year.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other match, 27-year-old French veteran Sandrine
Testud met strong resistance from 15-year-old Russian Lyna
Krasnoroutskaya, world junior number one player, who won with a
score of 6-4, 5-7 and 2-6.
</P>
<P>
Hingis will face Testud in the semi-final on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The four-day invitational tournament features four other world
top-ranking star players, including Mary Pierce and Virgnie
Razzano from France and Jennifer Capriati and Chanda Rubin from
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Iranian National Team Leaves for U.S.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian national team left here
on Wednesday for the United States to play in three preparatory
matches after the U.S. Football Federation promised to waive
finger printing procedure.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time for the Iranian national football
team to visit the U.S. since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
President of the Iranian National Football Federation Mohsen
Safaeie Farahani, who headed a 9-man delegation, is accompanying
the Iranian team, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The 21-man Iranian team will have a 7-hour stopover in
Frankfort, Germany in order to obtain U.S. visas before leaving
the German city for Chicago, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian team will first play against the Mexican national
team at the Oakland stadium on Monday and then face the Ecuadorian
national team in Los Angeles on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It will finally play against the U.S. national team at the Rose
Ball stadium in Pasadena on January 17, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The French top seed collapsed 6-0, 6-1 to in-form Bulgarian
Magdalena Maleeva.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Kournikova was rolled in three sets by Croatia'
s top player, seventh-seeded Silvija Talaja, in the packed 1500-
seat stadium at Royal Pines Resort.
</P>
<P>
Kournikova took the first set 6-4 Wednesday, winning the last
five games after being down 4-0.
</P>
<P>
She struggled to hold serve in the second set, which went to
Talaja 6-4 in just over half an hour.
</P>
<P>
The Russian then gave away a 2-1 lead in the final set to let
the 21-year-old Croatian cruise home 6-2 -- an unforced error, a
shot wide of the baseline, delivering the final nail in her coffin
as she served to stay in the match.
</P>
<P>
In the four years since turning professional, the Russian has
been a finalist twice, semi-finalist seven times and, after
Wednesday's capitulation, a quarter-finalist eight times.
</P>
<P>
And the prospects for her Australian summer are not bright with
the field at next week's tournament in Sydney featuring three of
the world's top 10.

DHAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A blinding fog and a moderate cold
wave that gripped different parts of Bangladesh have caused

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Has Surplus Rice in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia is expected to have
a surplus of 144,000 tons of rice in the 1999-2000 fiscal year,
the largest for several years, the Evening News said Wednesday,
quoting the Agriculture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's paddy production for the wet and dry seasons during
the 1999-2000 fiscal year is estimated at more than 3 million tons
which can produce 1.96 million tons of rice.
</P>
<P>
The unit paddy production averaged 1.65 tons per hectare in
Cambodia. With its 11.4 million people needing a total of 1.8
million tons of rice per year, Cambodia will have a surplus of 144,
000 tons of rice.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia cultivated about 1.89 million hectares of paddies in
1999, 135,000 hectares more than in 1998. Of the total, about 20,
000 hectares of paddies were hit by flood or insects.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's wet season lasts from May to November every year
while the dry season comes between December and April.
</P>
<P>
The good harvest is attributed to adequate rainfall and the
extension of cropping areas as well as the minimal damage from
flooding, drought and insects.

<HEADLINE> Damascus Radio on Syrian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Syria considers peace elements
as an integrated indivisible whole based on the principle of total
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and south Lebanon,
Damascus Radio said in its political commentary Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has to know that Syria embarked on the peace talks
because it wants to establish a fair and comprehensive peace," the
radio said, noting that Syria can not compromise on its territories
since peace can not coexist with occupation.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday in Shephersdtown, West Virginia of the United
States, Syrian and Israeli negotiators started negotiating on such
crucial issues as the demarcation of the June 4, 1967 border lines,
the water, security arrangements, the normalization of Syrian-
Israeli relations and the time-table of the implementation of the
expected peace deal.
</P>
<P>
"Peace will not be achieved except through Israel's withdrawal
from the Golan Heights and south Lebanon" and peace talks on the
Syrian and Lebanese tracks are parallel, said the radio.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, a power broker which deploys about 30,000
troops in Lebanon as peace-keepers, have insisted on the
integration of their talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to undermine such equilibrium will not serve the
desired peace and will rather abort the peace efforts," the radio
added.
</P>
<P>
It underlined that Syria did not ask Israel to make any
concession during the ongoing talks which started on Tuesday.
However, Syria insists on its legitimate rights to restore its
occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Israel is now in control of Syria's Golan Heights captured
during the 1967 Mideast war. It also has been holding a border
strip in south Lebanon of about 1,100 square kilometers since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Syria sticks to the principle of equal footing while working out
the security arrangements with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria is very serious about its pursuit of peace. In the
meantime it can never accept any attempt by Israel to foil "the
peace equation" or to foul up the priorities of the peace talks,
said the radio.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday Syrian and Israeli negotiators continued their
talks in Shepherdstown after U.S. President Bill Clinton managed to
remove the obstacle of the first day of the talks. The dispute was
related to the talks agenda issues.
</P>
<P>
While the Syrian side insisted on putting the Israeli withdrawal
from the Golan Heights atop the agenda, the Israeli side insisted
on discussing the security arrangements first.

<HEADLINE> Russian Commission Adopts Presidential Elections Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officially, campaigning for the race for the Kremlin started
Thursday, said Olga Zastrozhnaya, secretary of the commission.
</P>
<P>
The polls, originally scheduled for next June, were moved up
following the abrupt resignation of Former President Boris Yeltsin
on New Year's Eve. Yeltsin has named his preferred successor,
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, as acting president.
</P>
<P>
Putin, already the most popular politician in post-Soviet
Russia, will almost certainly win the elections, as the
abbreviated campaign left him with the advantages of incumbency
and his opponents with much less time to act.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will now last for 81 days, and applications for
nomination of candidates must be filed "no earlier than January 18
and no later that 18:00 local time on February 13," Zastrozhnaya
said.
</P>
<P>
Canvassing is to stop at midnight on March 24, and candidates
must provide information not only about their incomes, but also
about those of their spouses and other family members, she said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Putin, others that have declared their readiness
to run include Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, liberal
Yabloko leader Grigory Yavlinsky, and ultra-nationalist Vladimir
Zhirinovsky.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who had declared his
readiness to run for president before the December 19 State Duma
parliamentary elections, an attempt to win more votes for the
Fatherland-All Russia election bloc that he heads.
</P>
<P>
However, the All Russia movement of regional leaders that made
up the Fatherland- All Russia, has indicated it would support
Putin's bid for the Kremlin, and urged Primakov to vie for speaker
of the State Duma instead.

<HEADLINE> United Nations Concerned Over Cambodia Draft Law on Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations still
has concerns about Cambodia's draft law on the trial of members of
the Khmer Rouge, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said Hans Corell, the United Nations Legal Counsel, met
this morning with the Permanent Representative of Cambodia,
Ambassador Borith Ouch, to hand over the United Nations' comments
on the second draft of a Cambodian law concerning the trial of
members of the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was timed to permit these comments to be forwarded
to the Cambodian Cabinet, which was to meet shortly after, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
" The thrust of those comments was that the United Nations still
had concerns about the draft law," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same meeting, Corell transmitted a letter to the
Permanent Representative inviting the Government of Cambodia to
send as early as possible its representatives to New York to
resume discussion of the outstanding issues, and the intention is
to agree on a text that would meet international standards of
justice, fairness and the due process of law, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that discussions can continue, and eventually we can
agree on a draft that meets international standards," he added.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Removed From Moscow Apartment Block </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Security agents removed a bomb
Thursday evening from an apartment block in central Moscow, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Two TNT charges with detonators were planted on the ground
floor of a four-story building on Bolshoi Kozikhinsky Pereulok,
Interfax said, citing law enforcement sources.
</P>
<P>
Tenants were evacuated from their apartments and traffic along
the road was suspended after the bomb was found.
</P>
<P>
Moscow witnessed several major apartment bombings last year.
Over 200 people were killed in two separate blasts in the capital
city on September 8 and 12. Authorities said terrorists with links
to Chechen rebels were behind the attacks.
</P>
<P>
The blasts and similar attacks in two other Russian cities were
eventually followed by a federal military campaign against rebels
in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Security has since been beefed up in Moscow and around the
country, especially near vital installations such as nuclear power
plants.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Economic Growth Slows Down in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean economy is forecast to
grow at a lower rate in 1999 than expected, because of the
unstable macro- economic environment, poor commodity prices and a
decline in agricultural output.
</P>
<P>
The economy was estimated to grow by 1.2 percent in 1999
compared to 1.5 percent recorded in the previous year, Finhold, a
leading local finance house, said in its 1999 annual report
released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The expected lower growth was attributed specifically to high
levels of inflation and interest rates as well as foreign currency
shortages arising from depressed commodity prices of the country's
major exports.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the remainder of the 176-million-U.S. dollar
International Monetary Fund (IMF) stand-by arrangement in the last
quarter of 1998 compounded the problems afflicting the Zimbabwean
economy.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated additional foreign currency inflows from other
bilateral and multi-lateral donors largely failed to materialize.
</P>
<P>
"Consequently, the 1998/99 financial year witnessed a further
depreciation of the Zimbabwean dollar which in turn had a negative
effect on those sectors of the economy that are import-intensive
in terms of inputs," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Finhold urged the Zimbabwean government to pursue policies that
 stimulate growth in the real sectors of the economy in order to
boost overall economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Such policies include the implementation of contradictory
fiscal policies that are supportive of the tight monetary policies
of recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government was also recommended to be prudent to
 accelerate the privatization of parastatals and use the proceeds
to reduce the stock of domestic debt.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Parliament Speaker Asked to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The speaker of the Rwandan
parliament Joseph Sebarenzi Kabuye has been asked to resign by 86
percent of the parliamentarians, Rwanda News Agency(RNA) reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a nine-page letter signed on Wednesday by 60 out of 70
deputies that make up the National Assembly enumerated several
mistakes attributed to the speaker, advising him to "immediately
resign instead of losing his reputation if normal procedures are
to be followed".
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians accuse him among others, of dictatorial
tendencies, flouting procedure in the conduct of house business,
inducing unnecessary disagreements between the Parliament and
other political institutions, and mismanagement of Assembly's
funds.
</P>
<P>
According to the Assembly's Internal regulations, the speaker
upon receipt of the letter is supposed to call an extraordinary
session within 7 days to debate on the content of the letter
before a vote is carried out to determine whether he retains or
lose confidence of the parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts in the capital Kigali say Sebarenzi Kabuye
will not escape this move because the majority of deputies have
expressed no confidence in him. But a parliamentary source close
to the speaker who asked for anonymity told RNA "there is some
possibility of the situation to reverse because a vote in the
Parliament is secret".
</P>
<P>
If his resignation is realized, be it by passing vote of no
confidence or by his own initiative, Sebarenzi will be the second
speaker to have lost confidence of the parliamentarians and
subsequently asked to resign since the Transitional Assembly
started operating on November 25 1994.
</P>
<P>
Sebarenzi, from the Liberal Party was appointed speaker of the
National Assembly on March 3, 1997 after his predecessor Juvenal
Nkusi was also forced to resign.

<HEADLINE> 20 Namibian Villagers Missing After Mass Abduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- There are some 20 people
missing from Muitjiku village in Namibia last Saturday and so far
there's no information about their whereabouts, a Namibian Defence
Force official said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be named, told the Namibian Press
Agency that the Angolan rebel movement UNITA had abducted the
villagers.
</P>
<P>
He said the defense force had asked the chief of the Khoe
community in the village to provide it with a list of names of
those missing.
</P>
<P>
After the abduction, an unknown number of people fled the
village, fearing that they would also be kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local government in the Kavanga region said
residents in the area were involved in criminal activities,
possibly in collaboration with UNITA rebels.

<P>
KAMPALA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the three main rebel
groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are meeting

</P>
<P>
The meeting is taking place in Kabale town in southwestern

<HEADLINE> Uganda Peaceful Despite Rebel Incursions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Inspector General of
Police John Kisembo said Thursday the country is relatively calm
and peaceful in spite of incursions of small groups of rebels in
the northern and western parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the ninth police training course at
Kibuli Police School here, Kisembo said the relative instability
in some parts caused by the recent incursions of small groups of
rebels would not destabilize the whole country.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces and the Lord's
Resistance Army in the western and northern parts of the country
respectively would be wiped out by the government troops, he said.
</P>
<P>
To reinforce the police force, a total of more than 3,000 new
recruits will be made this year, he said. Some of the new
recruits are already undergoing necessary training, he added.
</P>
<P>
The police chief also urged the 15,000-strong police force to
improve their image marred by rampant corruption.

<HEADLINE> Swearing-in of Reelected Mozambican President Set on January 15 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The swearing-in of incumbent
President Joaquim Chissano for another five-year term will take
place on January 15, the Mozambican Supreme Court said in a note
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the note, Chissano will be sworn into office by
President of the Supreme Court, Mario Mangaze, at a public
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The National Elections Committee on December 22 announced that
Chissano beat his sole rival Afonso Dhlakama by winning 52.29
percent of the votes in the December 3-5 elections.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama, leader of the opposition Mozambican National
Resistance (Renamo), renewed his demand for a recount of the poll
results despite the Supreme Court's ruling that validated the
announced results.
</P>
<P>
Renamo Thursday confirmed that it will boycott the opening
session of the country's newly-elected parliament, the Assembly of
the Republic, scheduled for January 14.
</P>
<P>
Renamo General-secretary Joao Alexandre told Radio Mozambique
that the 117 deputies from Renamo and its allies in the "Electoral
Union" will not take their seats in the assembly. The "Electoral
Union" consists of Renamo plus 10 minor parties.
</P>
<P>
He said that the coalition is waiting for a dialog with the
ruling Mozambique Liberation Front Party (Frelimo) "in order to
achieve a platform of understanding. "
</P>
<P>
But President Chissano and Frelimo General Secretary Manuel
Tome have made it clear that the country cannot grind to a halt
just because Renamo disagrees with the Supreme Court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
They held that the Frelimo deputies will take their seats and
parliamentary business will start with or without Renamo's
presence.
</P>
<P>
The assembly can function without Renamo since Frelimo holds
133 of the 250 seats, exceeding the quorum of 126 (50 percent plus
one).
</P>
<P>
However, it is not clear whether Renamo will be able to oblige
all its coalition partners to adhere to the boycott.

CAIRO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The Lebanese government is expected to spend about 5.6
billion U.S. dollars in the year 2000 and to generate about 3.6
billion dollars, leaving a spending deficit of 36 percent, the
Daily Star newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 budget proposal, to be approved by the parliament
this month, suggested the privatization of state-run companies.
</P>
<P>
It was based on reducing current expenditures, increasing
revenues and stabilizing the costs of public employment through
privatization and administrative reforms.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Total foreign reserves at Lebanon's Central Bank stood
at 10.2 billion U.S. dollars by the end of last November, the Daily
Star newspaper Thursday quoted a report by the bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
Due to the growing trend of saving in Lebanese pounds, the
bank's international reserves, including gold and net of foreign
liabilities, rose 34.3 million dollars in November, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese pound was stable in November, with the dollar/pound
rate staying at 1,507.5.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's Public Authority for Investment is expected to
declare within days its final approval for the establishment of the
Suez Canal Containers Company with an issued capital of 55 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company will be set up after the National Bank, which is the
agent of the founders, completes the establishment procedures, the
Alalam Alyom daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It will undertake the management, operation and possession of
containers passing the Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi General Authority for Ports opened a website on
the Internet in a bid to attract more ships to Saudi ports by
showing the services available and 183 platforms capable of
receiving the most sophisticated vessels and handling all kinds of
goods.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi ports receive 12,000 ships every year to load and
unload 90 million tons of goods.
</P>
<P>
The website contains general information about the Authority and
the role it has been playing in running and developing the Saudi

<P>
OTTAWA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Nortel Newworks is paying 778
million U.S. dollars in Nortel stock for a California-based
developer of Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technology.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian high-tech giant announced the deal early Thursday
to acquire Promatory Communications Inc. in a bid to gain first-
mover advantage.
</P>
<P>
Promatory's technology could make communication through copper
phone wires 150 times faster than analogue modems for Internet
traffic, according to Nortel.
</P>
<P>
"The addition of Promatory's next-generation DSL platform to
Nortel Networks leading first-mile access solution... will allow
us to make high-speed Internet access a reality for homes and
businesses everywhere," Nortel said in a release.
</P>
<P>
Nortel forecasts seven million DSL lines in service by 2002,
more than seven times the current volume of service. The market is
expected to rise by almost 40 times to 4 billion dollars by 2003,
as compared with last year's total of 103 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hails Progress Over Disputed Prevlaka Peninsula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, issued here Thursday,
Annan said, "Both the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia
have indicated a willingness to resolve their dispute over
Prevlaka through bilateral negotiations pursuant to the Agreement
on Normalization of Relations signed by them at Belgrade on August
26, 1996."
</P>
<P>
In November 1999, the Yugoslav authorities informed the U.N.
Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP) of their intention to
withdraw all the formed units of the Yugoslav Army that had been
stationed in the demilitarized zone in violation of the U.N.
security regime.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal was completed on December 11, 1999 and it had
been confirmed by UNMOP.
</P>
<P>
"Since Croatia does not have military formations in the
demilitarized zone, the whole zone is now free of formed military
units and heavy weapons for the first time since the commencement
of United Nations monitoring in the Prevlaka region on October 20,
1992," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The confirmed withdrawal of Yugoslav military forces from the
United Nations demilitarized zone, seen together with the
continued absence of Croatian troops, is a welcome development,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that this will facilitate the implementation of
further practical steps aimed at strengthening respect for the
security regime, including addressing the remaining violations in
the United Nations-controlled zone and removing all remaining
restrictions on the movement of United Nations military observers,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"The parties should start discussing and implementing such
steps without delay," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Mission currently has 27 observers from 24 countries,
such as Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, Ghana, Nigeria, Russia and
Ukraine.

SHEPHERDSTOWN, W. Va., January 6 (Xinhua) -- President Bill
Clinton planned to return to Shepherdstown, West Virginia, on
Thursday to try to help Syrians and Israelis speed up their work,
the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the two sides did
not hold any working committee meetings on Thursday and Clinton's
return might help bring them to direct discussions.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't seek committee meetings this morning because we
think the best needs this morning are for the substantive work to
go on informally through direct contacts by us with the parties,"
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Two committees on security and peace term started working on
Wednesday while other two on borders and water have not yet
convened.
</P>
<P>
Direct contacts mean that Syrians and Israelis sit face to face.
"Informal contacts" is the U.S. term for separate talks between
the United States and the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Russian Exporters to Convert All Earnings Into Rubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting President Vladimir
Putin on Thursday approved a proposal of the Central Bank that
will require the country's exporters to convert all of their hard
currency earnings into rubles.
</P>
<P>
"This is a step in the right direction," Putin said after a
meeting with Viktor Geraschenko, chairman of the Central Bank, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Putin, who continues to serve as prime minister, said
"any decision ought to be calculated. It must not be made without
stepping up currency and export controls, and must not hurt
exports."
</P>
<P>
The exporters are now required to convert only 75 percent of
their foreign exchange revenues into rubles, which officially
stood at 27.23 to the U.S. dollar Thursday. They are allowed to
retain the remaining 25 percent to make equipment purchases abroad.
</P>
<P>
"The State Duma should also have a hand in the process," Putin
said, adding that imposing a law on the export proceeds sales
would be desirable.
</P>
<P>
Russia first introduced the rules on forced sales of hard
currency earnings after a financial crisis in 1998, when very few
companies were voluntarily buying into the depreciating rubles.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Putin and Geraschenko also discussed the
possibility of lowering the refinancing rate. Putin said if it
happened, the reduction would "be a very good sign for the economy,
the financial market and the real sector."

<HEADLINE> Canadians Urged to Donate Y2K Food to Food Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Canadians are being urged to
donate their stockpiled food to food banks across the country.
</P>
<P>
Food bank directors in Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver and some
other cities are welcoming the donation following the bust of the
predicted Y2K calamity, Local media said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is a time of year when there is always a great demand for
food. What is more, most provinces issued welfare cheques early
last month in case of Y2K glitches, creating an even greater
demand for food, directors say.
</P>
<P>
In Vancouver, food bank officials want residents to drop off
non-perishable food at local grocery stores, while Toronto's food
bank is asking for excess food to be brought to fire halls this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Chris Harris, executive director of the Calgary Inter-faith
Food Bank, said several utility corporations bought cases of
canned food to keep their teams fed for days.
</P>
<P>
"The question is do they still need it, and if they don't we'd
very much like it," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In Halifax, Nova Scotia, food bank officials "undoubtedly"
believe that people have stocked up and are now left with a
surplus.
</P>
<P>
"We would be delighted if those people could share," said Mel
Boutilier, director of Halifax's food bank.
</P>
<P>
People began hoarding Y2K items months before the New Year.
Nearly everything was bought just in case, including generators,
gas masks, lamp oil, toilet paper, bottled water, canned goods and
powdered milk, according to the local media.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Convene Open Meeting on African AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference here
that the open meeting, scheduled for 10:00 a.m. EST on Monday,
will be mainly on "the situation in Africa: the impact of AIDS on
peace and security."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is expected to deliver a
speech at the Security Council meeting, which is to be chaired by
U.S. Vice President Al Gore, whose country is holding the
presidency of the Security Council for the month of January,
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General will welcome the emphasis given to
African problems by the Security Council at the start of the new
millennium, and particularly the fact that its first meeting is
devoted to the problem of AIDS in Africa, which was already the
subject of a high-level meeting in December between African
governments, U.N. agencies, donor governments, private
corporations and NGOs (non-governmental organizations)," he said.
</P>
<P>
In sub-Saharan Africa, still the global epicenter of the AIDS
disease, new evidence shows clearly for the first time that women
infected with HIV, the virus which causes AIDS, outnumber men.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five percent of infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa are
women, which means more than six HIV-positive women for every five
HIV-positive men, UNAIDS, the U.N. agency on AIDS, said late last
year.
</P>
<P>
Studies in several countries have found that African girls aged
15-19 are five to six times more likely to be HIV-positive than
boys the same age.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Opposition Confirms Boycott of New Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican National
Resistance (Renamo) , main opposition party of the country, has
confirmed that it will boycott the opening session of the
country's newly-elected parliament, the Assembly of the Republic,
scheduled for January 14.
</P>
<P>
Renamo General-secretary Joao Alexandre told Radio Mozambique
Thursday that the 117 deputies from Renamo and its allies in the
"Electoral Union" will not take their seats in the assembly.
</P>
<P>
The "Electoral Union" consists of Renamo plus ten minor
parties.
</P>
<P>
He said that the coalition is waiting for a dialogue with the
ruling Mozambique Liberation Front Party (Frelimo) in order to
achieve a platform of understanding.
</P>
<P>
"Our deputies will not attend the opening session, nor will
they take their seats until the votes have been recounted,"
Alexandre said.
</P>
<P>
Renamo called for a recount of the results of the elections
held on December 3-5, 1999. But the Supreme Court ruled against
Renamo and validated the election results announced by the
National Elections Commission.
</P>
<P>
According to the officially announced results, Frelimo and
incumbent President Joaquim Chissano won the second multi-party
elections of the southern African country since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Both President Chissano and Frelimo General Secretary Manuel
Tome have made it clear that the country cannot grind to a halt
just because Renamo disagrees with the Supreme Court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
They held that the Frelimo deputies will take their seats and
parliamentary business will start with or without Renamo's
presence.
</P>
<P>
Since there is no further appeal against the Supreme Court's
ruling, there is nothing further that Renamo can do.
</P>
<P>
The assembly can function without Renamo since Frelimo holds
133 of the 250 seats, exceeding the quorum of 126 (50 percent plus
one).
</P>
<P>
However, it is not clear whether Renamo will be able to oblige
all its coalition partners to adhere to the boycott.

LUANDA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council will realize a special session on Angola this month,
analyzing the political- military situation in the southern
African country, U.S. Ambassador to Angola Joseph Sullivan said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said in a local radio program that the meeting

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Thursday
welcomed the ruling by Mozambique's Supreme Court that the
December 3-5 presidential and general elections were free and
fair.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Foreign Affairs Department of South Africa
called on all the parties participating in the second multi-party
elections of the country to honor the court's ruling and respect
the integrity of the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
The South African government further urged the leadership of
the opposition Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo) in
particular to abide by the court's ruling by cooperating in the
process of governance in order to entrench and consolidate
democracy in a country with one of the fastest growing economies
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Any upheaval would reverse peace, stability and economic
prosperity within the country or even in the entire region, the
South African Foreign Affairs Department said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Renamo, calling for a recount of votes,
rejected the Supreme Court's ruling which validated the election
results.
</P>
<P>
The court, however, dismissed Renamo's claims of election fraud
on the grounds that there was no evidence to substantiate the
charges.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Issues Warning on Possible Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican authorities have
warned of the possibility of flooding in the valley of the
Incomati River, the largest river in southern part of the country,
the Mozambique News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Regional Water Board also issued a warning that
people living near the bank of the river should seek higher
ground.
</P>
<P>
According to the water board, by Tuesday the river was flowing
at 500 cubic meters per second at Ressano Garcia, the point where
it enters Mozambique from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The water level of Incomati was 4.6 meters high, just 40
centimeters short of the maximum alert level of five meters. The
water level dropped slightly late Tuesday and early Wednesday and
the river was flowing at 440 meters per second.
</P>
<P>
However, the level of the Incomati is almost certain to rise
again substantially because the Driekopies dam in South Africa may
be forced to open its floodgates Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican water board noted that the reservoir was 99
percent full on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Because there are no dams on the Mozambican part of Incomati,
any flood wave entering the country at Ressano Garcia will travel
for the full length until it reaches the sea at Marracuene, a
district of Southern Mozambique.

</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed when Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister

HARARE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Allied Forces fighting in the
 Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) said Thursday that the
rebels fighting to topple President Laurent Kabila continue
murdering civilians in the vast war-torn central African country.
</P>
<P>
The Allied Forces headquarters said in a statement that the
rebels murdered seven civilians in the Eshimba area in Kabinda
Saturday, the Zimbabwean News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It said that the civilians were murdered after being accused by
the rebels of being informants of the Allied Forces because they
were related to the Kabinda district administrator.
</P>
<P>
Strongly condemning the "cowardly act" of the rebels, the
Allied Forces headquarters reminded the Congolese rebels and their
supporters of the need to observe the Lusaka Peace Agreement
signed by all the parties directly involved in the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The culprits shall be pursued to the bitter end," the Allied
Forces stressed.
</P>

Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia sent troops to the Congo in 1998
to beef up Kabila's army while Rwanda and Uganda have been

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Opposition Urged to Support Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government
Thursday urged opposition political parties and civic
organizations to support the voters registration exercise for
parliamentary elections scheduled for March this year.
</P>
<P>
The registration process should be transparent, Home Affairs
Minister Dumiso Dabengwa told a meeting to discuss the modalities
and the role of opposition parties and civic organizations in the
exercise.
</P>
<P>
The exercise comes at a time when the country is preparing for
the referendum to adopt the country's draft constitution and the
parliamentary elections, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Dabengwa welcomed cooperation and assistance from the
opposition and civic organizations.
</P>
<P>
The registration exercise is due to kick off on January 15-29
although the Registrar-General's office would remain open to those
who would miss the exercise.
</P>
<P>
Although most participants appreciated the need for the
exercise, they said they were no longer comfortable with
Registrar-General Tobaiwa Mudede conducting the exercise as they
had lost confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
President of the Democratic Party Wurayayi Zembe said
opposition parties had met last year and agreed that the office of
the Registrar-General should be abolished and replaced by an
independent electoral commission before voters' registration could
be discussed.

ADDIS ABABA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's currency, birr,
has been depreciating against the U.S. dollar in the past year.

The birr stood for nearly three decades at a fixed exchange

<HEADLINE> Israel's Second Troop Redeployment Goes On Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 6 (Xinhua)-- The second-phase troop
redeployment by Israel Defense Force (IDF) on the West Bank are
proceeding smoothly and will be completed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The IDF has already evacuated six military bases as part of the
troop withdrawal and two of them, Camp Yosef near the northern West
Bank city of Nablus and Camp Barak near Jenin, are now in the hands
of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The IDF soldiers and the Palestinian security forces started
Thursday conducting joint patrols in the areas just transferred to
the Palestinians in the vicinities of Jenin, Ramallah and Hebron,
the IDF spokesman's office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are working together to demarcate the new border
areas where the map has changed, and the IDF has been assigned to
put up signs warning Israelis that they are entering areas now
under Palestinian control along the new borders of area A, which is
totally under the Palestinian control, the office added.
</P>
<P>
The civil administration in these newly-handed-over areas will
actually be delivered to the Palestinians next Thursday, upon
request by the Palestinian side that Id al Fiter Holiday falls at
the weekend of this week.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians reached an agreement on the 5
percent land transfer from the West Bank on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment includes transfer of 2 percent from Area B,
which Israel controls security and Palestinians exercise civil
administration, to Area A, and 3 percent from Israel's totally
controlled Area C to Area B.
</P>
<P>
The second withdrawal, initially scheduled for last November 15,
was postponed due to Palestinians' refusal to accept the areas
Israel was willing to hand over.
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise agreement reached Tuesday, the second
withdrawal should be carried out as originally planned by Israel,
while Israel will consider Palestinian requests in sketching the
maps for the third withdrawal on January 20.
</P>
<P>
Under the new peace deal signed by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Sharm el Sheikh last
September, Israel will transfer another 11 percent of the West Bank
territories to the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New-Home Sales Fall Sharply in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported Thursday that the November's
drop in single-family sales followed a big 9 percent increase in
October. But Even with the setback, homes were sold at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 865,000 units in November, the
Department said.
</P>
<P>
New-home sales have been above an annual rate of 800,000 for a
record 23 straight months. The previous record was a five-month
string of sales at that level set in late 1977.
</P>
<P>
Many economists had been predicting a slowdown in the red-hot
housing market since June, when the Federal Reserve started
pushing interest rates higher in an effort to dampen such interest-
sensitive sectors of the economy as housing.
</P>
<P>
Last week, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages climbed to 8.06 percent,
compared to 6.83 percent at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Although November's new-home sales had a setback, the biggest
decline since December 1997, housing sales remained above an
annual rate of 800,000 homes for a record 23rd straight month.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said since housing and consumer spending have remained
so strong, they were looking for the Federal Reserve to boost
interest rates further this year, possibly engineering another
three rate increases in an effort to slow economic activity and
keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
Even with the drop in homes sales, the price of a new home
continued to rise to record levels. The average price climbed 4.2
percent to a record 209,700 dollars. The median price also jumped
to a record of 167,400 dollars, up 5.3 percent from October.
</P>
<P>
Sales declines occurred in all parts of the country with the
Northeast suffering the biggest percentage decline, a drop of 31.5
percent which left sales in that region of the country at an
annual rate of 50,000 units, the slowest pace of activity since
January 1996.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- American James Blake defeated
Wayne Ferreira 6-4,6-4 but could not stop South Africa in the
final of the Hopman Cup teams tennis tournament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Blake, ranked 219, looked sharp as he struck winners from all
angles, while Ferreira failed to connect with his returns and paid
the price for a succession of careless errors.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Amanda Coetzer had taken just 59 minutes to dismiss
Alexandra Stevenson 6-3, 6-1, and the United States then claimed
the doubles 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 6-2 to give the Americans a 2-1
victory.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also kept its hopes alive of advancing from
qualifying to Saturday's final when it defeated Slovakia 3-0 as
Paradorn Srichaphan surprised 17th-ranked Karol Kucera 4-6, 7-6 (7-
2), 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Tamarine Tanasugarn outlasted Henrieta Nagyova 2-6, 6-2, 4-1
to give Thailand a winning start against Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
Srichiphan then scored the biggest victory of his career when
he dismissed Kucera, taking advantage of the Slovakian's 17 double-
faults while firing his ninth ace on match point.
</P>
<P>
Because of Nagyova's injury, Slovakia defaulted the mixed
doubles, giving Thailand a 3-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
In another late match Thursday, Sweden beat Belgium 2-1.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Southern Bank to Acquire United Merchant Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Southern Bank
Bhd Thursday entered into an agreement with United Merchant Group
Bhd (UMG) to acquire the latter's equity interest in United
Merchant Finance Bhd (UMF).
</P>
<P>
The Southern Bank, one of the leading banks in Malaysia, said
in a statement that it will acquire UMG's equity in UMF for 319.
415 million ringgit (84.056 million U.S. dollars) in cash,
representing 1.2 times the adjusted net tangible assets of UMF as
on June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The price takes into account UMF's future earnings potential
while the adjustments are based on Bank Negara (State Bank)
Malaysia's guidelines and other parameters as agreed upon by the
Southern Bank and UMG, it said.
</P>
<P>
The purchase consideration shall be subject to adjustments to
account for any changes to the net tangible asset of UMF during
the
financial period commencing on July 1, 1999, up to the month-end
immediately preceding completion of the proposed acquisition, the
Southern Bank said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed acquisition will be funded initially with
borrowings of the Southern Bank group, it said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the deal as a significant milestone for the bank,
the Southern Bank's Chief Executive Director T. H. Tan said in a
statement that the UMF acquisition was earnings positive and that
would provide an entree into the attractive mortgage, hire
purchase and leasing markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 people were
injured in a bomb blast in a train at the Old Delhi railway
station Thursday afternoon, police said.
</P>
<P>
The medium-intensity explosion took place in a compartment of
an express immediately after it reached the platform from the yard,
Deputy Commissioner of Police P.K. Srivastava said.
</P>
<P>
The blast shattered the window panes, ripped apart all the
seats and created a one-meter radius hole in the bogie, he said.
</P>
<P>
The train was for Saharanpur in the north state of Uttar
Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
He said the bomb might have been kept under a seat in one of
the second-class compartments.
</P>
<P>
A team from the Central Forensic Sciences Laboratory had
reached the spot to determine the nature of the explosive used in
the blast while a sniffer dog squad had also been pressed into
service to examine the spot, the Press Trust of India (PTI)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The entire area has been cordoned off by the police and a large
number of personnel have been deployed at the station. And
movement of people at all entry and exit points was being strictly
monitored.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the railway station said some trains had been
rescheduled due to the blast.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the blast at the Old Delhi station, the police
control room here received a call which said a bomb had also been
planted somewhere at the New Delhi railway station, police sources
said.
</P>
<P>
A team from the local police station is making thorough checks
and vans from the police have also been rushed to the spot though
police said the call seemed to be a hoax.

<HEADLINE> India Sets Up Fund for Scientific Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government Thursday
set up a fund for the improvement of the science and technology
infrastructure in universities and other higher education
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the establishment of the fund at his residence,
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said it would improve the
inadequate infrastructure for basic research in higher education
institutions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Saying basic research is the mother of all technologies,
Vajpayee expressed dismay at the decline of bright students
choosing to pursue scientific research in the country.
</P>
<P>
This was probably because they were being attracted by several
other lucrative career options, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The lack of a conducive atmosphere and opportunities for
conducting high-quality research on a sustained basis is also a
reason" for the dwindling of students in scientific research, the
prime minister admitted.
</P>
<P>
The Indian leader asked young scientists to aim higher and work
with "redoubled dedication" to meet the expectations of the people.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee also issued five-year fellowships of 25,000 rupees (
some 580 U.S. dollars) per month to six young scientists.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Stock Market Continues to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Share prices nose-dived on
Singapore Stock Market Thursday after local stocks got one of
their worst-ever drubbings Wednesday following the sudden
resurgence of U.S. interest rate fears that triggered massive
plunges on Wall Street Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Time Index (STI) dropped 31.82 points to
close at 2,359.21, falling off its intra-day high of 2,425.57
points in Thursday's early trading.
</P>
<P>
Total volume decreased to 474.65 million shares worth 896.28
million Singapore dollars (539.77 million U.S. dollars). Losers
outstripped gainers by 278 to 81 with 138 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Benefun topped the volume list as it registered a turnover of
32.97 million units. MediaRing was the second heavily-traded stock
with 29.72 million shares done. Hotung was the next with 24.73
million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
SPH and SPH 100 headed the ascent of the day and both rose 40
cents to close at 34.5 Singapore dollars. Venture edged up 20
cents to finish at 20.2 Singapore dollars. Global Tech and HL Fin
F inched up 12 cents to end at 2.51 and 3.12 Singapore dollars
respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, PacCent remained at the top of the decliners'
list, dropping 260 cents to close at 16.3 Singapore dollars. SIA
DBScw00 was the second biggest loser of the day, incurring a loss
of 120 cents to finish at 12 Singapore dollars. SIA 200 fell 110
cents to end at 18.3 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market opened higher but it failed to sustain
its opening gains as the Hong Kong and Tokyo markets made hefty
losses.
</P>
<P>
Brokers noted that investors were spooked by the regional sell-
down.
</P>
<P>
However, they said the decline was healthy given the market's
sharp ascent in recent trading sessions.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said all regional bourses were soundly thrashed
Wednesday, supposedly because of U.S. interest rate fears that led
to an overnight collapse on Wall Street but more likely because
prices had simply run up too far, too fast.

<HEADLINE> Looted Food Trucks Recovered in S. Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Better organized security
guards from the International Red Cross and coalition militiamen
from the Rahanwein and Marehan clans have successfully recovered
two of three looted food trucks in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
After a heavy gunfire exchange between the rescue mission and
the looters, two looted trucks have been recovered, according to
information reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A large food aid convoy in the Sakow district of Middle Jubba
region was ambushed Tuesday by the gunmen allegedly belonging to
Geledleh clan militiamen of the Rahanwein main community.
</P>
<P>
Clan elders who later on intervened into the situation have
pledged that the remaining truck would also be turned in, but the
fighting should be stopped first.
</P>
<P>
No exact casualty figures are available. However, information
from the area indicates that nearly a dozen people including
non-combatant civilians were either killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
The food convoy consisted of over 30 heavy-duty trucks carrying
more than 300 tons of miscellaneous food items.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen succeeded in seizing three of the trucks during the
height of the fire exchange with the guards of the convoy who
escaped with the rest trucks towards the destined region of Gedo.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest reports, the survivor food convoy
reached the town of Bardera Wednesday on its ways to Garbaharrey
and Bur Dhubo towns where the final destination of the food aid
is.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, another large convoy of badly needed commercial
commodities including various food items reached Bardera town
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It took more than 30 days for the convoy to reach Bardera town
of the border Gedo region after leaving Mogadishu owing to mud and
insecurity along the road between Merca, Jilib and Bardera towns
of southern Somalia.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urged to Give More Aid for Angolan Refugees in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's North Western Province
Thursday called on the United Nations to give more materials and
logistic support to Angolan refugees in the province bordering
Angola.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary of the province Maybin Mubanga also urged
the Zambian government to transfer Angolan soldiers in Mwinilunga
and Solwezi of the province to a refugees camp in Mongu of
neighboring West Province.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers cannot be left along the borders as they are not
civilians, the Zambia News Agency quoted Mubanga as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said it is difficult to monitor over 36,000 refugees
currently in his province and more tents for shelter are needed at
the established transit centers.
</P>
<P>
Mubanga said there is also a critical shortage of fuel, making
it impossible for security personnel to carry out patrols around
the borders.
</P>
<P>
The official called on the Zambian government to ensure that
there is adequate supply of fuel to his province.

<HEADLINE> EU's Economic Sentiment Indicator Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Thursday that the composite economic sentiment indicator for
December 1999 reveals a 0.1 point improvement in the euro zone and
a 0.4 point increase in the European Union as a whole, compared to
November.
</P>
<P>
Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain, with 1.1, 0.6, 0.
4 and 0.4 point increases respectively, were the main contributors
to this improvement. Austria and Spain registered the biggest
declines with 1.1 and 0.4 points respectively.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in its business and consumer surveys that
Germany's manufacturing sector continued its upward trend in
December, which was initiated last August. Industrialist'
confidence in Italy and Britain is on the increase, too.
</P>
<P>
"Although France has reversed the rise observed in November,
confidence in the industrial sector remains steady in Europe," the
EU executive branch said.
</P>
<P>
The construction confidence indicator experienced a fall in
December, four points in both the EU and the euro zone, which
contrasts with the three consecutive rises observed in the
previous months. However, the present level is still well above
the long term average, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
Consumer confidence increased in the EU in December and
remained unchanged in the euro area, the EU executive added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jobless Claims Rise by Largest Amount Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The number of people filing
new claims for jobless benefits in the country jumped by 33,000
last week, the largest increase in a year, the Labor Department
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Department said the number of new applications for
unemployment benefits climbed to 309,000 for the week ending
Saturday,the figure has been above the 300,000-level for the first
time in 13 weeks. In the previous week, the claims had fallen by
7,000.
</P>
<P>
The Department's analysts explained that the claims level is
often volatile during holiday periods and they cautioned against
reading too much into one week's movement in jobless claims.
</P>
<P>
The increase of 33,000 for last week was the largest since a
jump of 60,000 for the week ending December 26, 1998, also a
period around the Christmas holidays.
</P>
<P>
The four-week moving average, which smoothes out weekly
volatility, was up by 3,500 to 283,750, still an extremely low
level indicating that labor markets remain tight.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. unemployment rate was at a 30-year low of 4.1 percent
in November and some analysts believe it may have dipped even
lower to 4 percent in December. That figure will be released by
the government Friday.
</P>
<P>
The dwindling pool of available workers has been cited by the
Federal Reserve as a major reason for raising interest rates three
times in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
Many economists are predicting even more interest-rate
increases in the new year as the central bank works to slow
economic growth as a way of taking pressure off labor markets and
keep rising wage demands from sparking inflationary pressures.

<HEADLINE> EU's Natural Increase of Population At Lowest Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, Jaunary 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Thursday that its first demographic estimates indicate the natural
increase of the EU population was at its lowest level during the
post-war period.
</P>
<P>
The EU's statistical office, Eurostat, said the EU population
was 376.4 million on January 1, 2000. The increase of almost one
million inhabitants in 1999 was mainly due to a net migration of
717,000 persons, increasing substantially compared to 1998, the
Eurostat said.
</P>
<P>
Live births in the 15-nation EU were estimated at 4 million in
1999, which is 0.5 percent fewer than in 1998 and the lowest level
recorded since the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
Concerning births, the data available show a contrasting
picture of the EU member states: Luxemborg recorded the highest
annual growth rate with 4 percent, while Austria saw the sharpest
fall with -5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The natural increase of the population means that live births
minus deaths, according to the Eurostat.

<HEADLINE> Two Key Falun Gong Cult Members Sentenced in Wuhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Two key members of the banned
Falun Gong Cult were sentenced to prison today by the Wuhan
Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Xu Xianglan, the leader of the Falun Gong headquarters in
Wuhan and her husband Wang Hansheng were sentenced to eight and
six years imprisonment respectively. They were charged with
organizing and using the cult to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
The court, which was open to the public today, revealed that
Xu began to practise Falun Gong in 1992 and soon become a Falun
Gong instructor in Wuhan. She had colluded with Falun Gong leader
Li Hongzhi in setting up the Falun Gong Wuhan headquarters and
published a periodical to publicize the teachings and activities
of the Cult.
</P>
<P>
During June 6-8, 1998, Xu organized, on nine occasions, Falun
Gong practitioners to besiege the general office of "Changjiang
Daily Newspaper", seriously disrupting the public order and the
stability of the city.
</P>
<P>
From May 1996 to May 1999, Xu and her husband also illegally
published Falun Gong promotional materials, raking in a total of
10.31 million yuan (1.25 million US dollars) in illegal profit.
</P>
<P>
She also took a leading role in spreading the cult in Hubei,
Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Xu was the principal criminal with her husband as accessory.
They should be punished by law accordingly, the court said.
</P>
<P>
However, since Xu and Wang confessed to their crimes and showed
some repentance by revealing the true nature of the Falun Gong
Cult, the court showed leniency in their sentences.

<HEADLINE> Russia Plans to Host Multilateral Mideast Peace Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said here Thursday that Moscow plans to host a multi-
national Middle East peace conference next month, the first in more
than three years.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, who is accompanying former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin on a three-day visit to the Holy Land to mark the first
Orthodox Christmas of the new millennium, said the conference would
be held at the level of foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that a spokesman in the Israeli Foreign
Ministry confirmed the Russian plan. This may mark a comeback of
Russia to the stage of mideast peace-making - the former Soviet
Union was a co-sponsor of the mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The multilateral peace negotiations will focus on key issues
concerning the entire Middle East region such as water,
environment, arms control, refugees and economic development.
</P>
<P>
The first multilateral negotiations were convened in Moscow in
January 1992 within the framework of a Mideast peace conference
held in the Spanish capital of Madrid in 1991, which kicked off the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
But the talks were frozen, together with the bilateral
negotiations, in early 1996 as the whole peace process came to a
halt following a series of terrorist attacks in Israel carried out
by Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who arrived in Israel Wednesday evening, attended a
ceremony at the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate Thursday to mark the
Orthodox Christmas. He and six Eastern European leaders were
named "Knights of the Holy Sepulcher." The Holy Sepulcher was the
church marking Jesus' burial place.
</P>
<P>
Later, Yeltsin had lunch with Israeli President Ezer Weizman. He
will also hold talks with Palestinian National Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat in the Palestinian self-rule city of Bethlehem, the
birthplace of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin shocked the world last Friday by announcing his
resignation from the presidency he had held since 1991. Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin was appointed acting president.
</P>
<P>
The visit to the Holy Land, which was planned when he was still
in office, was Yeltsin's first travel abroad since his resignation.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Share prices nose-dived on
Singapore Stock Market Thursday after local stocks got one of
their worst-ever drubbings Wednesday following the sudden
resurgence of U.S. interest rate fears that triggered massive
plunges on Wall Street Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Time Index (STI) dropped 31.82 points to
close at 2,359.21, falling off its intra-day high of 2,425.57
points in Thursday's early trading.
</P>
<P>
Total volume decreased to 474.65 million shares worth 896.28
million Singapore dollars (539.77 million U.S. dollars). Losers
outstripped gainers by 278 to 81 with 138 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Benefun topped the volume list as it registered a turnover of
32.97 million units. MediaRing was the second heavily-traded stock
with 29.72 million shares done. Hotung was the next with 24.73
million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
SPH and SPH 100 headed the ascent of the day and both rose 40
cents to close at 34.5 Singapore dollars. Venture edged up 20
cents to finish at 20.2 Singapore dollars. Global Tech and HL Fin
F inched up 12 cents to end at 2.51 and 3.12 Singapore dollars
respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, PacCent remained at the top of the decliners'
list, dropping 260 cents to close at 16.3 Singapore dollars. SIA
DBScw00 was the second biggest loser of the day, incurring a loss
of 120 cents to finish at 12 Singapore dollars. SIA 200 fell 110
cents to end at 18.3 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market opened higher but it failed to sustain
its opening gains as the Hong Kong and Tokyo markets made hefty
losses.
</P>
<P>
Brokers noted that investors were spooked by the regional sell-
down.
</P>
<P>
However, they said the decline was healthy given the market's
sharp ascent in recent trading sessions.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said all regional bourses were soundly thrashed
Wednesday, supposedly because of U.S. interest rate fears that led
to an overnight collapse on Wall Street but more likely because
prices had simply run up too far, too fast.

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Speaker Pushes Benefits for Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine House Speaker Manuel
Villar said Thursday that he wants better wages and benefits for
the country's thousands of public school teachers.
</P>
<P>
Villar said in a radio interview that legislation that will
provide long-term benefits for the country's educators is being
drawn up in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
"This is necessary in uplifting the lives of our teachers and
improving the country's quality of education," he said.
</P>
<P>
Two separate bills seeking to grant added benefits and mid-year
bonus to teachers are also being discussed by the House Committee
on Basic Education, said Villar.
</P>
<P>
"As much as possible, we are looking for ways to source funds
to increase the salary of government workers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Villar also stressed that he supports the planned 10-percent
salary increase this year for government employees as promised by
President Joseph Estrada. "This will be a big help to them," said
Villar.
</P>
<P>
The country's teachers, he said, are vital components in the
proper education of Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
"They will be the ones to mold the minds of the young so we
should make sure that we take good care of them and that we are
able to attract the best educators into the profession," Villar
said.
</P>
<P>
Public school teachers, he said, have long been neglected and
many of their needs, mostly financial, have not been properly
addressed due to the government's lack of resources. "We are doing
what we can to help them," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under Villar's leadership, the House of Representatives has
passed vital measures to address the plights of the "neglected
sectors" which include the disabled, war veterans, the elderly,
women and children.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Treasury Market Gets Record Revenue in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Singapore treasury markets
registered a record revenue of 4.8 billion Singapore dollars (2.86
billion U.S. dollars) in 1998, up 4.6 percent from the previous
year, according to the latest figures released Thursday by the
Singapore Foreign Exchange Market Committee (SFEMC).
</P>
<P>
SFEMC also said in its 1999 annual report that the total
treasury profits climbed by 7.1 percent to 3.3 billion Singapore
dollars (1.96 billion U.S. dollars) in the same period, the
largest total profits posted since the inception of the survey of
treasury activities in 1991.
</P>
<P>
SFEMC said it was of significance that direct costs fell by 5.7
percent under the weak price environment in 1998, the first time
it had fallen.
</P>
<P>
SFEMC has projected that 1999 would continue to be another good
year for treasury activities and affirmed that in the first half
of 1999 alone, banks in Singapore recorded revenues of 2.2 billion
Singapore dollars (1.3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the report, foreign exchange activities continued
to provide the largest revenue for treasury operation in Singapore,
contributing almost half of the total industry revenue, and money
market was the second largest revenue generator, contributing 35
percent to the total revenue.
</P>
<P>
SFEMC attributed the revenue increase in foreign exchange
activities to the increased volatility in financial markets in
1998, resulting in wider price spreads quoted for Asian and G7
currencies, as well as the higher premiums being placed on
liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, SFEMC noted that the number of treasury staff fell 5.
3 percent in 1998, in particular equity and money market dealers.
</P>
<P>
This was a reflection of the spate of consolidation activities
undertaken by banks during the Asian turmoil, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, SFEMC said, in line with the government's efforts to
promote Singapore as a leading debt origination and trading center,
the number of capital market professionals increased significantly
by 50 percent in 1998 compared with the previous year and average
revenue generated per dealer went up by 7.7 percent to 2.24
million Singapore dollars (1.33 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
SFEMC, launched in 1986, is a private-sector body of leading
treasury professionals and its purpose is to foster the growth of
Singapore as a leading international center for transactions in
foreign exchange and financial market instrument.

<HEADLINE> 1,567 Filipinos Injured in Yuletide Revelries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
reported Thursday that there were 1,567 cases of fireworks-related
injuries and 59 cases of stray bullets in the Yuletide revelries
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health (DOH) said the figure was based on a
surveillance conducted by various government agencies between
December 21, 1999, and January 4, 2000, nationwide.
</P>
<P>
According to the DOH, most of the cases came from the national
capital region, which accounted for 56 percent or 882 cases of the
fireworks-related injuries and 59 percent or 35 cases of stray
bullets.
</P>
<P>
Based on the reports of DOH hospitals, which recorded 1,199
fireworks-related cases, there was a 41-percent increase compared
with the figure recorded in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The age of the fireworks victims ranges between 5 months and 80
years old. The majority, or 86 percent, of the victims are male.
No casualty was reported in fireworks-related incidents.
</P>
<P>
The number of stray-bullet victims, on the other hand, is 18
percent higher compared with the figure a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The victims are between 3 and 57 years old and no casualty was
reported.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Alberto Romualdez said the increase in the
number of fireworks and stray bullet victims despite the
government's information campaign may have been due to the ardent
desire of the people to make a grand celebration for the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the department will implement more stringent
regulations on the manufacture, sale and use of fireworks and
pyrotechnic devices.

<HEADLINE> 350,000 Rwandans Die of AIDS-Related Diseases in 1999: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- About 350,000 Rwandans died of
HIV/AIDS- related diseases, the Rwanda News Agency quoted a senior
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some 150,000 adults and over 200,000 children died of such kind
of diseases last year alone, said Ntaganira Innocent, director of
Rwandan National AIDS control program.
</P>
<P>
He added that 60,000 children were orphaned due to HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
However, the AIDS expert noted that better statistics will be
provided in February this year after study results have been fully
compiled.
</P>
<P>
According to the director, 60 percent of patients in Rwandan
hospitals have AIDS-related ailments and over 400,000 people have
been infected by HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Ntaganira expressed satisfaction with the actual
achievements in combating AIDS pandemic in the country for the
past year. He did not elaborate the achievements.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government has for the first time allocated 100
million Rwandan francs (one U.S. dollar equals some 380 Rwandan
francs) as part of this year's recurrent budget to finance its
efforts in fighting AIDS scourge.

<HEADLINE> Spain's Jobless Rate Remains High Despite Sharp Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in Spain
fell to a 20-year low of 9.7 percent in 1999, the first time since
1979 that it has been below 10 percent, data recently published by
the labor ministry showed.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.61 million people were looking for a job in 1999,
172,000 or 9.6 percent less than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a research report said that of the four million new
jobs created from 1994 to 1998 in Spain, Germany, France, Italy
and Britain, Spain represented 1.6 million, or 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts contributed the decline in unemployment to the fast
economic growth in Spain. The country registered a gross domestic
product growth of 3.7 percent in 1999, twice as much as the
average in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Structural reform favoring the development of communication,
service industry and infrastructure construction also helped
create new jobs.
</P>
<P>
In fact, since Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar formed his
government in 1996, 620,000 among the registered jobseekers have
found a new job. In 1999 in particular, more than 110, 000
thousand jobseekers benefited from the government-launched
training plan.
</P>
<P>
With an investment of 1,500 billion peseta (about 10 billion U.
S. dollars), the plan helped jobseekers to train for new job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
However, Spain still faces problems in further reducing the
unemployment rate which despite a sharp decline still remains the
highest in the 15 European Union countries, analysts said.

Assistant spokesman of the French Foreign Ministry Francois

In a speech made to the transitional government on Wednesday,

He said that it was with "the strength of 1,000 gymnasts" that
the government has just paid its employees and that all this was

<HEADLINE> Editorial on Rural Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The "People's Daily" will
carry an editorial tomorrow titled "strategic tasks at the new
stage of agricultural development".
</P>
<P>
The editorial addresses a number of problems in rural areas
and strategies for rural economic development and calls for
strategically readjusting the structure of agriculture and the
rural economy.
</P>
<P>
The just-concluded Central Conference on Rural Work pointed
out that strategic restructuring of agriculture and the rural
economy is needed to develop agriculture as the country enters the
new century.
</P>
<P>
This is an important decision on work in the rural sector made
by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the
State Council after much deliberation and investigation.
</P>
<P>
After 20 years of reform and development, agriculture and
rural economic development have achieved miraculous results.
However, agriculture faces new problems such as growing grain
stockpiles, lowering grain prices and the slow increase in the
incomes of Chinese farmers.
</P>
<P>
To radically solve these problems, strategic restructuring in
agriculture and rural economic structure is paramount, the
editorial notes.
</P>
<P>
The editorial warns that restructuring is fraught with
difficulties and will require both time and hard work.

<HEADLINE> China to Restructure Its Rural Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The two day Central Conference
on Rural Work which closed here today pointed out that
restructuring of agriculture and the rural economy are crucial as
China enters the new century.
</P>
<P>
The meeting stressed that agriculture and the rural economy and
the income of farmers must be improved. "This is the central task
of our country's agricultural and rural economic development."
</P>
<P>
The meeting concluded that in the past year China recorded good
harvests and witnessed an increase in farmers' incomes. Social
stability was also maintained in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring agriculture and the rural economy aims to
improve the quality of agricultural products, optimize the layout
of rural economic regions, realize the sustainable development of
agriculture and the coordinated development of urban and rural
economies. Restructuring is thus critical to China's economic
development.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Manila to Continue With Labor-friendly Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government assured
the labor sector Thursday that it will continue "heightened"
efforts this year to create jobs and provide livelihood
opportunities and better working conditions for workers.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma of the Department of Labor and
Employment (DOLE) said these efforts include helping ensure
industrial peace to encourage more businesses to locate here.
</P>
<P>
"We continue with our job fairs to help people find jobs.
Government workers are also welcome to participate in these
activities to find better job opportunities," Laguesma said in a
radio interview.
</P>
<P>
He said there was greater industrial peace in 1999 compared to
1998, with strikes, lockouts and similar confrontations going down
by some 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
With brighter prospects for the economy in the year 2000, he
added, things would be even better this year for both laborers and
employers.
</P>
<P>
But Laguesma also called on both workers and employers to work
together to sustain industrial peace, saying this plays a crucial
role in attracting foreign investors to do business here, thus
opening up more opportunities for job seekers.
</P>
<P>
In a report submitted earlier to Philippine President Joseph
Estrada, the DOLE reported that in 1999, it mobilized the
commitment and cooperation of the different sectors in generating,
facilitating, enhancing and preserving employment.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the DOLE's performance in 1999 was its job
facilitation program to help displaced workers, creating 644,717
jobs from July 1998 to September 1999.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Road Fatalities on Decline: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is one of the best
among ASEAN countries in the area of road safety based on the
international-level indicator on fatal road accidents, according
to Transport Ministry Parliamentary Secretary Donald Lim Siang
Chai.
</P>
<P>
Based on the indicator, road fatalities in Malaysia have been
on the decline in recent years with the number of deaths for every
10,000 vehicles registered in 1998 declining from 8.4 in that year
to 5.7 in 1999, he said Thursday at a function here.
</P>
<P>
"Based on this rate also, Malaysia is one of the best among
developing countries and is on the same level with several
developed countries such as Belgium and Italy," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, road fatalities in Malaysia in 1996
totaled 6,304 compared with 6,302 in 1997 and 5,744 in 1998 while
between January and November 1999, there were 5,272 road deaths,
fewer than the corresponding period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The decline in road fatalities since 1997 was in line with the
government target of 30 percent reduction in such deaths by the
year 2000, he said, adding that the government had attained a 15-
percent reduction in the rate of road deaths up to December 1998.

<HEADLINE> 2,500 Rwanda Genocide Cases Settled in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- For the year 1999, 2,500 cases
of Rwanda genocide were settled, in which 116 people were
sentenced to death, judicial source has said.
</P>
<P>
The Rwanda News Agency quoted the source as saying that 322
people were sentenced to life imprisonment, 235 acquitted and more
than 425 sentenced to different years of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The number of cases that were settled increased compared to the
past two years in which only 1,200 cases were settled.
</P>
<P>
However, Rwandan Minister of Justice Jean de Dieu Mucyo said
Wednesday that "the performance of the judicial sector is yet to
improve if the Gacaca courts (participatory justice) begin to
function."
</P>
<P>
The Gacaca Court (participatory justice) is a proposed judicial
system intended to speed up trial of genocide suspects since a big
number is so far detained in prisons and many more are not yet
arrested.
</P>
<P>
If these courts start functioning, the truth about the genocide
tragedy will be revealed and the culture of impunity will be
evicted so that unity and reconciliation will be attained.
</P>
<P>
A bill on Gacaca courts is now awaiting the Cabinet decision
after which, it will be submitted to parliament for adoption .
</P>
<P>
The justice minister expected the bill to begin functioning in
April this year.
</P>
<P>
There will be over 10,000 Gacaca courts throughout the country
with a comparatively bigger number of judges to try more than
125,000 suspects already detained and many more who are yet to be
arrested on charges of genocide and other crimes against humanity.

<HEADLINE> China's Spring Season Transport Starts on January 21 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- China's annual railway
transportation peak season which sees tens of millions of people
travel across the country to return home for the traditional
Spring Festival will start on January 21 and end February 29, the
Ministry of Railways said today.
</P>
<P>
The "Spring Season Transport", as it is called, includes
transient laborers and college students returning home during
their winter vacation.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more and more people have traveled during the
Spring Festival period. According to sociologists, the "sea of
humanity" that traverse the country during this period is due to
economic development and improved living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Due to the large amount of human traffic during this period,
China's transport system, chiefly the railway sector, works
especially hard to ensure that "traffic" runs smoothly.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official predicted that during the 40-day peak
season, the railway sector will have to handle 128 million
passengers, averaging 3.22 million per day. The estimated total
volume will be five percent more than last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that transport services run on time, additional
passenger trains will be running. Ticket prices will also vary
depending on demand in an attempt to control the amount of human
traffic during the festive season.

JERUSALEM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Defense Ministry Director-General Amos Yaron is to
return to the United States this weekend, the second time in two
weeks, to continue talks with U.S. defense officials on Israel's
requests for military aid to accompany a peace deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, accompanied by 150
Russian officials, friends, aides and family members, arrived in
Jerusalem Wednesday night at the invitation by the Greek Orthodox
Church and the Palestinian National Authority for the Eastern
Orthodox Christmas celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- More than 100 people were evacuated in the Tel Aviv-Jaffa
area on Wednesday after heavy rain caused extensive flooding. Over
140 millimeters of rainfall was recorded in the Tel Aviv area from
Tuesday morning to Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli President Ezer Weizman told reporters Wednesday that
there are certain difficulties with turning over to the state
attorney the files requested for examination about the accusation
that he had received large sums of cash gifts from a French
millionaire.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to take about two weeks for Weizman's attorney
Ya'acov Weinroth to collect all the material. He attributed the
delay to the disappearance of files from the office of Weizman's
original lawyer, Hanina Brandes, who administered the cash account
in Weizman's name.

<HEADLINE> 2 People Killed in Plane Crash in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A Skypower Express Airways plane
crashlanded in Nigerian capital Abuja Wednesday, killing a
passenger and a farmer on the ground, The Guardian newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the airline confirmed the accident,
saying that a female passenger died in the accident while one
other occupant was seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
The farmer died when the plane crashed into his farm, about 900
meters to the center line of the Abuja airport.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the aircraft was on a charter flight
from commercial hub Lagos to Ilorin, Minna and Abuja with eight
passengers and two crew on board.
</P>
<P>
The pilot of the aircraft reportedly radioed a distress call to
the airport, complaining of fire burning somewhere around the
aircraft cockpit.
</P>
<P>
Skypower management was "surprised and confused" as to the
cause of the accident because the aircraft recently underwent a
maintenance check, according to the airline's public relations
consultant Lateef Lawal.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the accident investigation bureau of the Federal
Ministry of Aviation, and the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority
are already in Abuja to carry out preliminary investigations.
</P>
<P>
With Wednesday's mishap, Skypower has a record of an average of
one crash per year except for last year which was accident-free.

<HEADLINE> Radar-Managed Aviation Zone in South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The aviation fly zone in south
China, which encompasses civil routes for five major international
airports in Guangzhou and Macao and Hong Kong, has been brought
under the management control of a radar system.
</P>
<P>
This has helped shrink the distance between two flying
airliners from a criterion of 75 km to 10-20 km, and saves space
in the busiest aviation airspace in China with the highest daily
number of flights.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the Air Traffic Control department in Guangzhou
report that the new radar system, equipped with advanced data
processing devices, is capable of automatic management and is more
accurate than the old management system.
</P>
<P>
The radar facilities were built at a total cost of 313 million
yuan and are responsible for an averaged daily volume of 900
planes.
</P>
<P>
The China Civil Aviation Corp. will introduce the radar system
into three other artery air routes linking Beijing to Shanghai and
Guangzhou and Shanghai to Guangzhou in the second half of this
year, which accounts for 70 percent of the country's total air
traffic flow.

<HEADLINE> APEC's 2001 Preparatory Meeting Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The first meeting of the
Preparatory Committee for the Conference of Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) in 2001, which will be held in Shanghai,
convened here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, also director of the
preparatory committee, presided over the meeting aimed at making
good preparations for the success of the APEC meeting in October
2001.
</P>
<P>
Tang said in his speech that APEC, as the highest level and
most influential regional economic organization in the Asia-
Pacific region, has played an active role in promoting economic
development in the region and the world since its establishment 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
APEC serves as an important arena for China's diplomacy and
external economic exchange, he noted, adding that the Shanghai
meeting will provide a valuable opportunity for China to play an
even more important role in international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Success of the 2001 meeting will certainly further promote
economic cooperation in the region and enhance the bilateral ties
between China and other countries of the region, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1989, the organization convenes an informal
leadership conference and a ministerial meeting annually with the
purpose of realizing common prosperity through economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China joined the organization in 1991 and has taken an active
part in its activities ever since. Beginning in 1993, President
Jiang Zemin has participated in the annual informal leadership
conferences every year.

<HEADLINE> Saddam: Embargo Has Started to be Corroded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on
Thursday said that the United Nations embargo imposed on Iraq "has
actually started" to be corroded "thanks to the great fortitude and
the endurance of the Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
Saddam made the remarks in a nationally televised address to
mark the 79th anniversary of the founding of the Iraqi National
Army.
</P>
<P>
He said "we have said it with certainty that the embargo will
not be lifted by a (U.N.) Security Council resolution, but will
corrode by itself."
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long argued that it has carried out all its
commitments toward relevant U.N. resolutions, and demanded that the
Security Council lift the sanctions imposed on it since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Saddam stopped short of rejecting directly a
latest U.N. resolution which calls for the return of U.N. arms
inspectors to Iraq in exchange for possible suspension of the U.N.
embargo.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared its rejection to the resolution, saying it
will not lead to the lifting, or even suspension of the sanctions,
rather it imposes new restrictions and conditions on Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Israel Aims to Lower Deficit in Year 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Finance Ministry has
promised to get the 2000 budget deficit down below 2.25 percent of
the gross national product (GNP), despite the cabinet's set target
of 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a report available here Thursday that the
government's deficit in 1999, excluding net credit, totalled 9.2
billion shekels (2.19 billion U.S. dollars), or 2.3 percent of the
GNP.
</P>
<P>
This was 0.3 percent higher than the planned target, but still
lower than the deficit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The figure was largely due to the government's domestic deficit,
which totaled 12.3 billion shekels (2.928 billion dollars). In its
overseas activities, the report said, the government had a surplus
of 3.1 billion shekels (0.73 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
According the report, both income and expenditure for 1999 were
below expectation, but revenues did pick up towards the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Revenues in 1999 totaled 38.3 billion dollars, of which 34.09
billion dollars were from domestic activity and 4.21 billion from
overseas activity.
</P>
<P>
The deficit for 1999 was financed primarily by domestic loans
and the government's sales of bank shares and other privatizations.
</P>
<P>
The 2.5-percent target for 2000 was set half a year ago, when
the economy was still in stagnation and the anticipated economic
growth was only 3 percent, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, the economy has revived and all signs
pointed to a growth of over 3 percent this year while revenues will
grow substantially, it added.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Collects 600,000 Pencils for Iraqi Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A pro-Iraq Jordanian committee has
collected some 600,000 pencils as donations for sanctions-hit Iraqi
children since it launched a "million pencils" campaign in
December, committee sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The National Mobilization Committee For the Defense of Iraq, an
independent committee representing political parties and trade
unions in the kingdom, also decided to extend the pencil-collecting
campaign until January 18 rather than 10 as originally planned.
</P>
<P>
The largest contribution by individuals so far came from British
Member of Parliament George Galloway, who arrived in Amman Tuesday
and donated 10,000 pencils to the committee.
</P>
<P>
Galloway has been lobbying extensively in the region to draw
international attention to the sufferings of the Iraqi people under
the sweeping sanctions imposed on Baghdad by the United Nations
after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in the 1990 Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide pencil-collecting campaign was aimed at
collecting 1 million pencils from all walks of live in the kingdom
as a show of solidarity to the Iraqi people, the committee said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was sympathetic with Iraq during the Gulf crisis, but it
has been trying to mend ties with Gulf Arab states damaged by its
stand since the Gulf war ended in Iraq's defeat by the U.S.-led
coalition forces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the kingdom, which relies mainly on Iraq for free and
cheaper crude supplies, also tried to save and keep its
traditionally friendly ties with it.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. oil-for-food formula for Iraq, Jordan gets 75,000
barrels of crude oil everyday from Iraq, half as free grants and
the rest at a preferential price.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Foreign Investment Drops Sharply in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's approved foreign
investment in 1999, including the joint ventures, decreased to
592 million U.S. dollars from the previous year's 1.58 billion
U.S. dollars, the Business weekly reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Figures provided by the Zimbabwe Investment Center showed that
during 1999, most of the foreign investment was in manufacturing
followed by commercial, mining, tourism and construction.
</P>
<P>
A combination of high inflation and interests rates, negative
publicity and conflicting policy statements had prevented the
country from getting any meaningful investment last year, th
center said.
</P>
<P>
Nick Ncube, Executive Director of the center, admitted that
last year was a difficult year. However, he is optimistic about
this year's prospects which he said would be driven by a number of
new developments initiated last year.
</P>
<P>
The government has increased the rate of subcontracting of
entities to the private sector as part of its efforts to boost
investment this year, he said.

<HEADLINE> Agencies Issue Year 2000 Appeal to Eradicate Polio  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (
WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) have jointly
called on leaders of 30 affected nations to give full cooperation
to the global effort to eradicate polio by the end of the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the verge of an historic public health victory, the
eradication of poliomyelitis, a disease that has caused untold
suffering to millions of children in all parts of the world," said
WHO Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland and UNICEF Executive
Director Carol Bellamy in a New Year's letter published here
Thursday to 30 heads of state in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Launched in 1988, the global initiative to eradicate polio by
the end of the year 2000 is spearheaded by WHO, Rotary
International, UNICEF and the U.N. Foundation.
</P>
<P>
To win the battle against the disease, Brundtland and Bellamy
urged them to provide leadership for extra immunization activities,
to allocate sufficient resources to support National Immunization
Days and routine immunization and surveillance activities, to
mobilize support for these efforts at the national to the
community level and to facilitate truces in areas affected by
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders of the two agencies cited the significant
achievements since the launch of the initiative in 1988:
</P>
<P>
-- The number of polio cases has fallen from an estimated 350,
000 in 1998 to some 5,200 reported cases in 1999;
</P>
<P>
-- The proportion of the world's children living in polio-
infected areas has dropped from 90 percent to less than 50 percent;
</P>
<P>
-- Polio has been eradicated from the Americans, Europe, the
countries of the Western Pacific, and much of the Middle East and
has disappeared from most of northern and southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO, the world will save 1.5 billion U.S. dollars
per year with the eradication of polio and the eventual cessation

<HEADLINE> Japan's Top Police Chief Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Japan's National Police Agency (
NPA) chief Yuko Sekiguchi Thursday announced he will step down as
the country's top police officer.
</P>
<P>
In announcing his resignation, Sekiguchi denied speculation
that he is resigning to take the responsibility for a series of
scandals that hit Kanagawa prefecture police last year.
</P>
<P>
"The scandals were regrettable, but we have set the course for
creating ways to prevent similar incidents. I am not resigning to
take the blame," Sekiguchi told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old senior police officer said he thought it "
appropriate" to quit after holding the post for nearly three years,
having finished working out primary security measures for the
summit of the Group of Eight nations to be held in Okinawa in July
as well as a plan to prevent police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
Sekiguchi had come under fire for a spate of scandals involving
police officers in Kanagawa Prefecture, south of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
The incidents, which came to light in the latter half of last
year, included a cover-up of a police officer's drug use, sexual
harassment, attempted extortion, violence, bullying within the
force, and a hit-and-run case.
</P>
<P>
Setsuo Tanaka, the NPA's deputy director general, has been
tipped to succeed Sekiguchi after Japan's National Public Safety
Commission officially announces his resignation with the approval
of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and cabinet ministers next Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> China to Curb Price Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will take
sterner measures this year to curb price violations in a bid to
create a better environment for economic growth based on increased
urban and rural consumption.
</P>
<P>
Pricing departments across the country will carry out eight
price-related inspections this year, covering such areas as
electricity, public security, tourism, housing and real estate
management, car purchases, education, agriculture, grain, and
tobacco, said Wang Yang, vice-minister of the State Development
Planning Commission (SDPC), at a national price-related conference
begun today in Fuzhou, capital of east China Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The SDPC urged pricing departments at all levels to set up
price complaint organizations and improve networks to deal with
price violation complaints.
</P>
<P>
China's pricing departments conducted 10 price inspections last
year involving sugar, plane tickets, grain, rural electricity,
medicines, charges on overseas-funded enterprises, expanded
university enrollments, telecommunications, and the dumping of
manufactured goods, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
These inspections uncovered 228,400 price-violation cases
involving 2.7 billion yuan, he said, adding that large-scale
inspections of this kind have proven effective for expanding
domestic demand and promoting economic restructuring and
development.

<HEADLINE> Ordination of New Bishops Indicates Development of Chinese Church: Catholic Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The ordination of five new
bishops is a symbol of development for the Chinese Catholic Church,
said Fu Tieshan, chairman of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic
Association, during an interview with Xinhua today here.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Catholic Bishops College this morning ordained five
new bishops here at a two-hour ceremony, during which the new
bishops were handed the mitre and the cross.
</P>
<P>
"It is a joyous occasion for the Chinese Catholic Church and
witness to our development during the past decades," said Fu, who
became bishop of Beijing 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Today's ordination is nothing more than a normal religious
activity of the Chinese Church and the common will of our more
than 4 million followers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Since the average age of the current Chinese bishops is nearly
80, to have more younger bishops is of crucial importance for the
Church's development in the new era," he said, adding that the
average age of the five new bishops is about 45, and the youngest,
assistant bishop of the Tangshan diocese Fang Jianping, is only 37.
</P>
<P>
All five new bishops ordained today were nominated and elected
in a democratic way, and were approved by the Chinese Catholic
Bishops College, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The reason we choose today to hold the ceremony is that today
is the Epiphany, an important feast for Catholics of all colors
and nationalities in the world," the religious leader said.
</P>
<P>
"Other churches in China also held grand masses today to
celebrate the holy day," he added.
</P>
<P>
The bishop said that because normal relations between China and
the Vatican were interrupted several decades ago, China began to
elect and ordain bishops in 1958 in an effort to guarantee the
smooth development of the Chinese Church.
</P>
<P>
"Without that decision, there would be no development of the
Chinese Church today, which is now entering a golden period in its
history."
</P>
<P>
According to Bishop Fu, China now has some 5,000 churches and
more than 4 million Catholics, more than 1,000 of whom are
currently representatives or members of the people's congresses
and the Chinese people's political consultative congresses at all
levels.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Cabinet Approves Draft Law of KR Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian cabinet, after
more than four hours of debate, approved a draft law on Thursday
on setting up Extraordinary Chambers to try former Khmer Rouge
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen presided over the meeting of the Council
of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
The draft law will then be immediately sent to the National
Assembly and the Senate for final passage.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Minister Sok An told reporters that ministers supported
the draft law, adding that since the draft law was completed in
late December, "we have considered the points put forward by the U.
N. Secretary-General and made some revisions."
</P>
<P>
Sok An said the interested countries including the United
States, France and Russia have also expressed their satisfaction
with the draft law. Legal experts from France, Russia and India
took part the drafting of the law.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers said in late December that the
government needed more discussion with the United Nations on how
to conduct the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The draft law contains provisions for the establishment of the
Extraordinary Chambers based on Phnom Penh's existing Trial,
Appeals and Supreme Courts.
</P>
<P>
On the expenses of the Extraordinary Chambers, the revised
draft law sets out that the government shall meet the costs of
Cambodian judges, while countries providing judges would be asked
to meet their own costs.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen insisted that the trial should not be internationalized
or based on the United Nation's finances.
</P>
<P>
Each level of the courts will have a Cambodian majority, but to
reach a verdict will require a "super-majority" of votes, which
means that at least one foreign judge is needed.
</P>
<P>
The term for the judges and co-prosecutors is four years and
the trials' judges would be appointed by the Supreme Council of
the Magistracy while the foreign judges are to be appointed as
requested by the U.N. Secretary General following consultation of
the Royal Government of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The draft law also outlines that if foreign judges or
prosecutors chosen by the U.N. or other countries do not
participate in the Extraordinary Chambers, Cambodian judges or
prosecutors would be chosen to replace them.
</P>
<P>
The charges against the accused include genocide, crimes
against humanity, destruction of cultural property and crimes
against internationally protected persons.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said earlier that the focus of the trial could be
narrowed to only four to five of the former Khmer Rouge leaders,
and Ieng Sary, the former Khmer Rouge foreign minister, would not
be among them. Ieng Sary defected with several thousand guerrillas
to the royal government and was later pardoned by King Norodom
Sihanouk for his 1979 death sentence.
</P>
<P>
Only two former Khmer Rouge leaders -- military commander Ta
Mok and the former Tuol Sleng security chief known as Duch -- are
currently in jail in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
The maximum sentence for those found guilty will range from a
minimum of five years in prison to life imprisonment and seizure
of assets.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian government has rejected an international tribunal
abroad or a joint-U.N. tribunal, insisting that the country's
sovereignty be preserved over the process.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Archeologists have found a group
of articles dating back to the Paleolithic Era in east China's
Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
A total of 23 specimens, including 16 stone articles, were
unearthed recently at Fangniu Mountain near the city of Jurong.
These articles are believed to be more than 300,000 years old, and
archeologists note that the mountain was once the home of ancient
human beings.

In 1993, the skull of a prehistoric man was found at Tangshan
Mountain near Nanjing, less than 100 kilometers from Jurong.
Possible links between the two discoveries are under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists say that these discoveries will play a
significant role in research into the origin of human beings and
the immigration and life of ancient people in China.

SHANGHAI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A 100,000-spindle cotton mill

<HEADLINE> North China Port Handles Record Amount of Coal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINHUANGDAO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The port of Qinhuangdao in
north China's Hebei Province handled nearly 70 million tons of
coal in 1999, a new record that is 12 percent more than 1998.
</P>
<P>
This means that the demand for coal is picking up again in both
domestic and overseas markets. Qinhuangdao is a hub for the
transportation of coal from north to south China, and a major port
for coal export.
</P>
<P>
The amount of coal handled by the port decreased between 1996
and 1998 due to a saturated of market, according to a port
official.
</P>
<P>
Authorities attribute the recovery of coal transport to
improved service and the use of advanced cargo-handling equipment
at the port.
</P>
<P>
The port's total assets stood at 9.4 billion yuan at the end of
1999, up 28 percent from 1996.

<HEADLINE> Imports to Top 1.3 Trillion Dollars Over 6 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- China's total imports will
exceed 1.3 trillion U.S. dollars from 2000 through 2005,
representing an annual growth of over eight percent, said minister
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng here
today.
</P>
<P>
Shi told Xinhua that China will realize its great potential as
the country's modernization drive continues its momentum.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China in 1949, and especially since
China began its reform and opening up program in 1979, the country
's economy has sustained rapid growth, with the living standards
of the Chinese people improved, the domestic investment and
consumption market continuously expanded, and foreign trade
invigorated. Imports grew to 165 billion U.S. dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese government continues to pursue an active fiscal
policy by issuing more treasury bonds this year, investment from
the state coffer will focus on infrastructure construction and
technological upgrading of enterprises in order to accelerate
economic restructuring, stimulate investment by non-government
sectors, and jump-start consumption. The growth rate of the
economy is predicted at around seven percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that in the medium-and long run, China's economy will
be able to sustain a rapid growth rate as it continues to place
emphasis on developing such fields as water conservancy, energy,
transport, telecommunications, raw materials, environmental
protection, and high technology. Those are areas slated by the
central government as priorities.
</P>
<P>
China will encourage imports with appropriate measures,
especially increasing the introduction of new and advanced
technologies and key equipment. This will provide huge trade and
investment opportunities for overseas businesspeople.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth and accession to the World Trade Organization (
WTO) require that China further expand the areas open to the
overseas firms. Step by step, the nation will give overseas
investors access to the sectors of finance, insurance, foreign
trade, retailing, and tourism.
</P>
<P>
China will give green light to overseas investors who want to
set up joint ventures, cooperative projects and wholly-owned
enterprises in these areas, Shi said. This is both an important
move toward participating in the integration of the world economy
and a great impetus to the introduction of foreign funds, advanced
technology and equipment, and managerial expertise.
</P>
<P>
Noted economist Hu Angang said that China has great potential
for trade surplus and import growth. After joining the WTO, the
country is expected to further lower its tariff rates and turn the
present approval system for imports into a registration system.
</P>
<P>
China now ranks tenth in the world in import volume, and Hu
predicted that by 2005, China will become the fifth-largest
importer in the world.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country maintains a sound foreign exchange
reserve, which serves as a strong support for the expansion of
imports. By the end of 1999, the country had a total foreign
exchange reserve of 154.6 billion U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Thursday that he is likely to announce changes in his
cabinet on Saturday, when he delivers his Report to the Nation
from the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released from the Presidential Palace, Estrada
said he would continue to study his options on who among the
members of his cabinet shall be fired, retained or reassigned
</P>
<P>
"I've to study my options well. I'll announce my decision soon.
I will make sure that my decision will benefit the nation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, he added, he is likely to announce his decision on
the fate of some cabinet members, along with their respective
replacements.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also said he felt sad over the resignation of Edgardo
Espiritu as secretary of the Department of Finance, saying
Espiritu did much to help his administration.
</P>
<P>
He lauded Espiritu for bringing down interest rates, restoring
a sense of fiscal discipline and responsibility, adding that he
would be willing to give Espiritu another post in the government.
</P>
<P>
"But his resignation is irrevocable, and he cited family
reasons. He has also neglected his personal business just to join
my team," he said.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu submitted to Estrada his "irrevocable" resignation
during a meeting in the Presidential Palace on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said in his letter that his one-and-a-half year stay
in government was "undoubtedly very gratifying" as he helped
improve the country's economy and the Filipinos' plight.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Ambassador Burgled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Ambassador to the United
States Samson Chemai was burgled Wednesday in the Kenyan capital
Nairobi by six thugs with AK 47 rifles and pistols.
</P>
<P>
The ordeal began at 3:00 a.m. local time and lasted for five
hours, the East African Standard daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The robbers forced Chemai, his two daughters and his
granddaughter into one place and threatened to shoot them if they
did not give all the money they had, the ambassador was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The gang looted 6,000 shillings (about 80 U.S. dollars), a
television set, a fax machine, four speakers, a pair of sports
shoes and other assorted household goods.
</P>
<P>
Because the thugs could not drive, they forced the ambassador
to drive them in his Mercedes Benz around the city. The ambassador
was eventually dumped in the suburb with his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Chemai drove directly to a police station at about 8:00 a.m.
and the police rushed to the scene and recovered four speakers and
a fax machine hidden in a maize plantation.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The AIDS virus is mowing down
school- going children in Kenya and currently more than 20 percent
of the pupils within the age group of 14 - 7 are HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Education Minister Kalonzo Musyoka Wednesday released
the shocking statistics when he launched this year's national
schools Form One selection at the Kenya Science Teachers College
in the capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
"The scourge threatens all gains made in the education sector
and stall any meaningful progress achieved so far," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the killer disease is also a serious threat to teachers
as many of them are dying of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
At national level, he said, approximately 1.9 million Kenyans
are infected with the killer virus, with two thirds of them under
the age of 25.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Health indicate that about 500
Kenyans die of AIDS every day.
</P>
<P>
Last November, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi declared AIDS a
national disaster due to its heavy toll on Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the country has put the syllabuses for AIDS
lessons in place, requiring teachers in various subjects to
address the scourge.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian External Debt Down by 6.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The total external debt of
Tanzania decreased by 6.2 percent by the end of November last year
to 7,296.3 million U.S. dollars from 7,778.6 million U.S. dollars
registered in October.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of the Monthly Economic Review of
the Bank of Tanzania, out of the total amount disbursed, the
outstanding debt of the country stood at 6,158.6 million U.S.
dollars, while committed undisbursed debt was 1,137.7 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Multilateral and bilateral debts contributed the largest share
of the country's total debt, accounting for 56.9 percent and 35.3
percent respectively, the document said.
</P>
<P>
According to the monthly review, agriculture, energy and mining
sectors received 16.5 percent and 14 percent of the debt
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Industries absorbed 7.2 percent of the total debt while social
welfare and education, finance and insurance, and tourism received
five percent, 3. 9 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 12.5 percent was absorbed by other sectors.
</P>
<P>
During the month under review, the country's domestic debt
declined by 8. 7 billion Tanzanian shillings (about 11 million
U.S. dollars) due to government repayment of principal and
interest securities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the document said Tanzania's export earnings from
traditional commodities during last November increased by 152.8
percent from last October to 64.2 million U.S. dollars while
receipts from non-traditional commodities declined by 39.4 percent
to 21.2 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
This is attributed to higher export volumes for such
traditional commodities as coffee, cotton, sisal, tea, tobacco and
cashew nuts, it said.

<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Catholic Bishops
College (CCBC) ordained five new bishops and assistant bishops

<HEADLINE> China Gives Priority to Developing Key Rural Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- China is set to develop around
10,000 key rural towns early this century in order to raise the
social and economic development of rural areas to a new level.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the Ministry of Construction said today
that China had developed more than 55,000 small rural towns by the
end of 1999, which are home to 70,000 specialized and wholesale
markets with accumulative annual trade volume of more than 500
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Small rural towns account for approximately 25 percent of China
's total gross domestic product and are rapidly emerging as
important bases for boosting rural economic development, the
official added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that township enterprises in these towns employ over
150 million farmers and contribute over 70 percent to the country'
s total rural output value.
</P>
<P>
Township employers will be able to hire an average of seven to
eight million rural laborers annually in the coming years, he said,
adding that the rapidly increasing number of small towns will not
only help absorb large numbers of surplus rural laborers, but will
also stimulate efforts to restructure agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 60 percent of the country's 20
million township enterprises are concentrated in small rural towns,
and that a large number of enterprise groups in developed rural
towns have annual output values of over one billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Student Expelled for Assault of Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Dhaka University authorities on
Wednesday expelled a student for his alleged involvement in the
assault of a woman during the New Year Millennium night
celebrations, newspapers here reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Acting Vice Chancellor Professor Shahadat Ali ordered the
expulsion in conformity with the recommendations of a campus facts-
finding committee, which found Alias Russell of the university's
Botany Department guilty of assaulting the young woman along with
others, on the basis of primary evidences.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have requested the law enforcing agencies to
arrest and take legal actions against Russell.
</P>
<P>
A group of youths, reportedly drunk, stripped the girl of her
clothes on December 31 night on the campus as she came with her
brother to join the New Year's celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Ali termed the incident "barbaric" and said the university
authorities would be more careful in future.
</P>
<P>
He said volunteers will be deployed on the campus on the eve of
future festivals as part of the university's own security measures
to resist any "untoward" incident.
</P>
<P>
The incident created strong resentment in society. Denouncing
the incident, the Bangladesh Women's Association staged
demonstrations in the city streets Tuesday. Leaders of the
association demanded exemplary punishment of the youths
responsible for such "heinous acts."
</P>
<P>
Students of Dhaka University Tuesday burnt some of the dailies
for publishing photograph of the girl who was subjected to assault.
"The photo of the culprits instead of the victims should be
published in the mass media," the angry protesters demanded.
</P>
<P>
The government has already directed the law enforcing agencies
to detect the culprits and take legal steps against them.

<HEADLINE> Thai Govt's Shareholding in Thai Airways to Be Cut down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Thai Airways International (THAI)
is trying to reduce the share holdings of the Thai government in
it to less than 70 percent from 93 percent, a senior official of
the national carrier said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dararatana Masakanok, manager of Equity Department, told Xinhua
that THAI will sell about 300 million shares to public or a new
strategic partner in order to raise new capital, but it is not
decided yet.
</P>
<P>
"The decision will be made in the near future", she said.
</P>
<P>
However, any plan would need final approval from the Thai
cabinet before the sale could go ahead.
</P>
<P>
Dararatana denied the reports that the airline will sell 400
million shares this year, saying the reports were "rumors."
</P>
<P>
The airline first announced a plan to issue new shares to raise
fresh capital last June, with the aim of cutting the Finance
Ministry's holding as a first step towards privatization.
</P>
<P>
Privatization of some state enterprises is a key to the Thai
government's economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The ministry holds 1.3 billion shares, or a 93 percent stake,
in THAI.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign airlines, including Singapore Airlines, have shown
interest in bidding for a share in the Thai carrier.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Horticulture Export Earnings Soar in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's horticulture industry,
the country's fastest growing agricultural sector, continued to
experience rapid growth in 1999, earning 100 million U.S. dollars
in exports last year during the marketing season, the Business
weekly reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This was through the export of 26,072 tons of flowers and fresh
produce.
</P>
<P>
The sector had earned 58 million U.S. dollars in same period
the previous year from the export of 25,000 tons of flowers,
vegetables and fruits.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Business on Wednesday, Chief Executive
of the Horticultural Promotion Council Stanley Heri said the
performance of the sector is still restrained by punitive tariffs,
which have held back expansion, especially the acquisition of
hi-tech greenhouses.
</P>
<P>
Small-scale growers have been the hardest hit, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Heri, the lack of appropriate infrastructure,
especially post harvest handling facilities, poor roads and
communication network and the lack of appropriate technical skills
to grow export crops have stifled small players in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Horticulture is the country's third largest agricultural
commodity after tobacco and livestock and the second largest
foreign exchange earner after tobacco.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the world trade in horticulture produce
would continue to increase, Heri said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand continued its giant-
killing spree by beating former title-holders Slovakia in the
Hopman Cup mixed teams tennis tournament in Perth on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Thais have achieved an unbeatable 2-0 lead as both Tamarine
Tanasugarn and Paradorn Srichaphan won their singles clashes over
Slovak, winners of the contest two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Tanasugarn outwitted her opponent Henrieta Nagyova 2-6, 6-2, 6-
1 before 106th-ranked Paradorn Srichaphan caused the biggest upset
by conquering 17th-ranked Karol Kucera 4-6, 7-6 (7/2), 6-2 in the
men's singles.
</P>
<P>
Thailand becomes the first team in Group B to gain two wins,
and will surely make the final if it beats Austria on Friday in
its last clash of the qualifying round robin.
</P>
<P>
American-born Tanasugarn, 22, registered her third successive
singles win although she was ranked a humble 72nd in the world as
Nagyova surrendered at 4-1 in the final set due to thigh strain.
</P>
<P>
She also played a big part in Thailand's 2-1 win over Japan
last Saturday when she beat Ai Sugiyama to pace the Thais for the
main draw of the competition.
</P>
<P>
She performed superbly on Tuesday to beat Australia's 16-year-
old wonder player Jelena Dokic, a crucial part of Thailand's 2-1
victory over the reigning champions.

<HEADLINE> Businesses Wholly Owned By Overseas Investors Rising In E. China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of overseas
investors are preferring to setting up wholly-owned companies in
east China's Jiangsu Province rather than share the businesses
with local associates.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, the number of overseas wholly owned
enterprises in the province reached 628 during the January-
September period of last year, an 11 percent rise on a yearly
basis, as compared with the growth rate of 7.5 percent for Sino-
overseas joint ventures during the nine months.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises totally backed by overseas investors introduced
2.05 billion US dollars of actual overseas money, nearly 200
million US dollars more than the amount used by new Sino-overseas
joint ventures in the same period, according to an local official
source.
</P>
<P>
This transition of investment style by overseas is due to an
improved local investment environment, which has enhanced the
confidence of overseas investors.

<HEADLINE> Expert: World's Longest Canal Can Be Clear Again (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So far, Zhejiang Province alone is in the process of
constructing 20 sewage disposal projects along the river, which
are expected to be completed in three to five years. These
facilities are expected to completely purify local industrial
waste water and that from local residents who discharge into the
waterway, according to Kong.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises situated along the river which were once reluctant
to pay for waste treatment are now willing to do so, as required
for enterprises seeking bank loans.
</P>
<P>
A proposal has been approved to connect the canal with one that
runs from Hangzhou to Ningbo, a coastal city in Zhejiang Province,
thereby making it possible for polluted water from the Beijing-
Hangzhou canal to be diluted, to some extent, by the water of the
Qiantangjiang River.
</P>
<P>
Pollution from the agricultural sector also must be taken into
consideration, said Kong, because 40 percent of the fertilizers
used on nearby farmland goes into the canal. So, Kong has
suggested that farmers use smaller amounts and more pollution-free
fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
All these efforts are expected to return clarity to the
waterway, which long ago was used as a daily water source by the
people living along the canal.
</P>
<P>
The endeavor to control pollution in the canal will certainly
pay off, and add to the attractiveness of many small towns in
Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces through which the waterway flows.
</P>
<P>
These cities situated on the centuries-old canal are among the
nation's most popular tourist destinations for their rich cultural
legacies and delicate traditional features such as gardens,
temples, bridges, and pavilions. These cities include Hangzhou and
Suzhou, two of the country's most famous scenic spots, often
compared to Heaven on Earth.

NANJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province,
which ranks second in the country in terms of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP), has set its growth target at 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Chen Huanyou, secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of
the Communist Party of China, said that this goal is obtainable as
the local economy has maintained a healthy growth momentum over
the past few years, with the 1999 GDP reaching 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this year's goal, Chen said, the province will
further enhance investment to spur domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
About 60 key construction projects will be launched, including
two bridges across the Yangtze River and a subway in Nanjing, the
provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
At least 100 billion yuan will be spent for the technological
upgrading of major industries, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to creating a number of large enterprise
groups, each with annual sales of more than 10 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Private enterprises are encouraged to engage in infrastructure
construction and the upgrading of state-owned enterprises, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Greater efforts also will be made to explore new consumption
areas, such as education, tourism, and housing, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
China's national economy is expected to grow around seven
percent in 2000, according to officials from the State Development
Planning Commission.

</P>
<P>
In the project's second phase, waste water from Minhang, Wujing

million U.S. dollars in World Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The 1.6 billion-yuan first phase of the project was completed

<HEADLINE> Expert: World's Longest Canal Can Be Clear Again (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Environmental protection expert
Kong Shu has great confidence that the sight of a variety of fish
swimming and shrimp wandering along the once-limpid Beijing-
Hangzhou Great Canal that he remembers from his childhood will
once again become a reality in a few years.
</P>
<P>
Kong believes that the 1,789-km-long canal, the longest in the
world, can become clear again in three to five years because he is
encouraged by the growing attention now given to the treatment of
pollution on the waterway which is caused by advanced
industrialization along the river.
</P>
<P>
Kong Shu is vice director of the institute of design and
research for environmental protection in east China's Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
The nearly 1,400-year-old canal winds southward from Beijing
through the city of Tianjin and Shandong Province, down to Anhui
and Jiangsu provinces, and ends in Hangzhou, the capital of
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The canal plays an important role in the country's economic
growth as its transport capacity is four times that of the
parallel Beijing-Shanghai railway line.
</P>
<P>
But the canal's handling capacity has been hampered by
distorted navigation routes, shallow water, and low bridges in
recent years, and only the section south of Shandong Province is
now able to accommodate water traffic.
</P>
<P>
What is worse, the canal, once with clear water from surface to
bottom, is now seriously polluted, causing people walking
alongside it to cover their nose and mouth from the foul and
disgusting stench of polluted water, a result of the mushrooming
and speedy development of township industrial enterprises along
the river, especially in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, since the
1980s.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Launch Master Plan for Industrial  Revolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is to launch a master
plan for the period 2000-2010 with the help of foreign and local
experts to usher in an industrial revolution, the Ministry of
Industrial Development said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The master plan, due to be finalized in July this year, will be
used in compiling the "White Paper on Industrialization," said a
ministry statement.
</P>
<P>
The stage one of the master plan has been completed and six
sectors have been identified for detailed study as "target
industries" by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)
and United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO),
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The interim recommendation of the ministry and the Japanese
experts is to promote industrialization in a selective and
strategic manner through the promotion of target industries.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Gives Priority To Developing Key Rural Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- China is set to develop around
10,000 key rural towns early this century in order to raise the
social and economic development of rural areas to a new level.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the Ministry of Construction said today
that China had developed more than 55,000 small rural towns by the
end of 1999, which are home to 70,000 specialized and wholesale
markets with accumulative annual trade volume of more than 500
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Small rural towns account for approximately 25 percent of China
's total gross domestic product and are rapidly emerging as
important bases for boosting rural economic development, the
official added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that township enterprises in these towns, more than
one million of them each with an annual output value well above
500 million yuan, employ over 150 million farmers and contribute
over 70 percent to the country's total rural output value.
</P>
<P>
Township employers will be able to hire an average of seven to
eight million rural laborers annually in the coming years, he said,
adding that the rapidly increasing number of small towns will not
only help absorb large numbers of surplus rural laborers, but will
also stimulate efforts to restructure agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 60 percent of the country's 20
million township enterprises are concentrated in small rural towns,
and that a large number of enterprise groups in developed rural
towns have annual output values of over one billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Targets an 11 Pct Increase in Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is targeting an 11 percent
increase in exports to 12.8-13 billion U.S. dollars this year by
expanding its sales abroad, English daily Vietnam News (VNS)
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The estimate follows strong export figures for 1999 -- up 23
percent over 1998 to 11.52 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The estimate, said VNS, is based on a number of factors: the
recovery of Asian markets from the regional economic crisis,
Vietnam's continued integration into world and regional economies,
the development of markets in the European Union (EU), the United
States and the opening up of new markets in the Middle East,
Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
An official of Vietnam's Trade Ministry forecast the exports of
the country to the United States will double from 600 million
dollars to 1.2 billion dollars in 2000 if the U.S.- Vietnam Trade
Agreement is signed soon.
</P>
<P>
The export value of commodities including footwear, knitwear,
garments and wooden and ceramic items is expected to increase
after their normal trade relations are established.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's bilateral trade with China is expected to grow by 25
percent this year, with Vietnam's main exports including rubber,
coffee, crude oil, marine products and coal, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The EU has been buying Vietnam's marine produce and garments
for several years and the market has the potential to increase by
an anticipated 15 percent a year from 2001 to 2010, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Japan remains Vietnam's biggest export market. Vietnam's
exports to Japan are expected to grow by 17 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN markets will account for an estimated 13 percent of
Vietnam's total exports in 2000 as against 21-25 percent over the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Trade Ministry is now focusing on new markets in
Africa, the Middle East and West and South Asia and is actively
promoting the signing of trade agreements with South Africa,
Senegal, Nigeria, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Hijackers Reach Kashmir Valley: Freed Prisoner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 6 (Xinhua) -- One of the three prisoners
freed by India to end the eight-day hijacking of an Indian plane,
Wednesday said the five hijackers are all Kashmiris from the India-
occupied valley and they have reached the valley, reported the
daily The News here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Maulana Masood Azhar, making a fiery speech to more than 10,000
people in southern Pakistan, said it was the Indian government's
campaign to malign Pakistan by accusing its involvement in the
hijacking case.
</P>
<P>
"They (the hijackers) are preparing for their next assault," he
said, speaking over a loudspeaker from within a simple white
mosque.
</P>
<P>
"I have come back and will not rest in peace until Kashmir is
liberated," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his 25-minute address the organizers of the meeting had
taken strict security measures and no one was allowed to enter the
meeting venue without body search. The press photographers also
were not allowed to take snaps of Azhar.
</P>
<P>
Azhar was freed on the last day of 1999 from an Indian jail
along with other two Kashmiri activists in exchange for 155
hostages aboard the Indian Airlines Flight 814 hijacked on
December 24 last year by five armed men.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers, who finally released the plane grounded at the
Kandahar airport in south Afghanistan, was given 10 hours by the
Afghan Taliban authorities to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh earlier claimed that they
had entered Pakistan, which was denied by both the Pakistani
government and the Taliban.

The accord, which came into force a few weeks after Lizano's

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Carries Out Medical Examination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Chile's ex-military leader,
Augusto Pinochet, underwent Wednesday a medical examination in a
London hospital, according to reports reaching here from London.
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary Jack Straw will decide, according to
results of the medical examination, if he authorizes the
extradition of Pinochet to Spain or concedes him liberty on
humanitarian grounds, the reports say.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 84 years old, was examined by three British geriatric,
neurology and diabetes specialists at Northwick Park Hospital of
Harrow, in north London. The ex-military leader and current life-
long senator now suffers from about twenty illnesses, including
diabetes and heart problems.
</P>
<P>
Personnel from Chile's embassy in London accompanied Pinochet
to hospital. The appeal hearing regarding Pinochet's delivery to
Spain is planned for March 20 in London's High Court.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was detained on October 16, 1998 in London at request
of a Spanish judge who intends to bring him to trial for crimes
against humanity occurring in Chile during the military regime,
from 1973 to 1990. Last October, a British judge authorized
Pinochet's extradition to Spain. However, the definite decision
will be taken by Straw 15 or 20 days after he receives the medical
report.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Pinochet displayed fear that the military ex-
leader won't resist judgment in Spain and will die. The Chilean
government requested Straw the freeing of Pinochet under
humanitarian grounds owing to his old age and deteriorated state
of health.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan FM Says Normalization of Ties With Honduras Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan Minister of Foreign
Relations Eduardo Montealegre said Wednesday that it would be
possible for Nicaragua and Honduras to sign an accord for the
normalization of their relations.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's relations with its northern neighbor worsened after
Honduras ratified with Colombia the 1986 Maritime Delimitation
Treaty, which according to the Nicaragua government, takes away
from it 130,000 square kilometers of continental platform.
</P>
<P>
"This (the signing of a bilateral accord) is possible, but no
date has been set," said Montealegre
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, these possibilities will depend on the results of
the Washington meeting, programmed for January 12 and 13 at the
Organization of American States (OAS) headquarters, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I consider there may still be lacking three or four further
meetings," indicated the head of Nicaragua's diplomacy.
Montealegre said that the Washington meeting will be made to
define a zone of military exclusion in the Caribbean sea and
establish mechanisms for international verification.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Montealegre and his Honduran counterpart
Roberto Flores Bermudez is the continuation of negotiations that
began December 29 and 30, 1999, in Miami, the United States, in
the presence of OAS special envoy Luigi Einaudi.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the ministers from both Central American
countries agreed the immediate separation of military forces at
the common border and the establishment of a military exclusion
zone in the Caribbean sea.
</P>
<P>
They also committed themselves in Miami to freezing military
posts and personnel on the border area. Under the OAS mediation,
ministers of both countries carried through in Miami an initial
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
According to reports coming from Honduras, Minister Flores also
declared presidents Arnoldo Aleman and Carlos Flores, of Nicaragua
and Honduras respectively, may sign a bilateral accord this month.
He said it is probable that negotiations in Washington allow
sufficient advance so that the presidents of both countries can
sign a document.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military to Make All-out Effort to End Violence in Maluku </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Military (TNI)
Commander Admiral Widodo vowed on Wednesday to make an all-out
effort to end the long standing religious conflicts in Maluku.
</P>
<P>
He said that TNI is ready to send more troops to the region if
it is really necessary, but said that so far the number of troops
deployed in Maluku has been adequate.
</P>
<P>
Widodo revealed that 12 battalions (12,000 troops) have been
deployed in Maluku, with three battalions from local military
headquarters and nine battalions sent from other regions.
</P>
<P>
He said the TNI would do its utmost to settle all the unrest in
the east Indonesian region and not hesitate to disarm the
conflicting parties.
</P>
<P>
"And if need be, we will impose a curfew," he was quoted by
national newspapers Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Ambon Catholic Bishop Petrus Mandagi on
Wednesday, President Abdurrahman Wahid said he ordered the
military to take tougher measures to stop the violence.
</P>
<P>
"The president was very saddened by the ongoing violence in
Maluku, and he promised to take all necessary measures to end the
tragic events," Mandagi was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coordinating Minister for Political Affairs and
Security Gen. Wiranto disclosed that the government may soon
isolate Maluku, including from media coverage, to prevent outside
influences which could foment the violence.
</P>
<P>
"After the situation calms down, we will isolate the region.
This does not mean that the region is closed, but we hope that the
isolation will help to avoid biased reports about Maluku," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Suryadi Soedirdja said the communal
clashes in Maluku had become a "human tragedy" in which the
conflicting sides appeared bent on exterminating each other.
</P>
<P>
He said he fully supported the TNI's willingness to do all
within its power to restore peace and security there.
</P>
<P>
Brutal conflicts in Maluku have been taking place for more than
12 months and have seen almost 2,000 Muslims and Christians
slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
Pattimura Military Commander Brig. Gen. Max Tamaela said in
Ambon, capital of Maluku, that the situation had calmed down on
Wednesday with only sporadic reports of violence.
</P>
<P>
"The forces deployed have succeeded in establishing a barrier
between the two parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tamaela called on all parties to remain calm but conceded that
the level of animosity was high.

<HEADLINE> hke010610 Indonesian Govt to Review Discriminative Laws Against Ethnic Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
pledged to review all discriminative laws, regulations and native
policies against the ethnic Chinese in the country.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs Gen.
Wiranto said at least 13 government regulations and one
presidential decree will be reviewed following a recent pledge
made by President Abdurrahman Wahid to eliminate discrimination
against the ethnic Chinese and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Home Affairs Surjadi Soedirja and Minister of Law
and Legislation Yusril Mahendra have been assigned to study the
technical aspects of the policies, leading newspapers Thursday
quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The laws and regulations which will be revoked include those on
culture, economics, religion and various civil rights, Wiranto
said Wednesday after attending a cabinet meeting chaired by
President Adburrahman Wahid at the Bina Graha presidential office.
</P>
<P>
In the time of former president Soeharto, it was illegal to
teach the Chinese language in schools and Chinese publications
were banned in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Under the discriminative policy, the ethnic Chinese, which make
up about 5 percent of Indonesia's population of 210 million or the
third largest populous nationality in the country, have been a
target for popular resentment and their shops and houses have
regularly been attacked in periods of unrest.
</P>
<P>
The worst incident in recent years occurred in May 1998 before
the downfall of Soeharto during which rioters conducted attacks on
ethnic Chinese, burned down their shops, schools, houses and
churches, claiming about 1,200 lives. The rioters also conducted
wide-spread rape and torture on ethnic Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid has frequently condemned violence
and discriminative actions, pointing out that his new government
will not allow any kind of discriminative actions against any
minorities.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Accuse Each Other in Fourth Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Democratic presidential
front-runner Al Gore and Bill Bradley, his rival for the party's
presidential nomination, mounted their attacks against each other
as the election campaign heated up after the Christmas and new
year holidays.
</P>
<P>
In a one-hour debate at a university in New Hampshire State on
Wednesday night, Bradley, a former senator in New Jersey, accused
vice president Al Gore of deliberately distorting his proposal to
expand health coverage.
</P>
<P>
Bradley said the vice president "offended me" by claiming he
would hurt African-Americans and Latinos and by saying his health
care plan would shortchange many Americans.
</P>
<P>
In response, Gore shot back that his rival's plan would leave
many New Hampshire residents "high and dry."
</P>
<P>
The debate was the fourth between the two rivals and also the
first in the election year.
</P>
<P>
The former senator launched a sharp attack on the Clinton-Gore
administration's handling of relations with Russia, saying the
United States had not pushed hard enough in the last eight years
to reduce the stockpile of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"I think that in spite of the problems there have been some
successes, including a new leader committed to reform, a free
press and free elections," Gore defended.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of attacks came one-third of the way through the
debate, the first in a series of confrontations in which Democrats
and Republicans will take turns debating in the run-up to the
first balloting of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who is even or ahead in the polling in advance of the
nation's first primary set for February 1 in New Hampshire, has
mounted a strong challenge in the state against Vice President
Gore.
</P>
<P>
The two rivals clashed on most issues, but they agreed on some
issues such as a need for stricter gun control laws and appointing
a Joint Chief of Staff who would support policy of permitting gays
to serve openly in the military.

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia Predicts 3-4 Pct Growth for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia has predicted
that the country's economy in the year 2000 will enjoy a growth of
three to four percent.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia attributes the good economic prospects to
improving domestic and international economic development.
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, the improving international economy will provide
a climate conducive to domestic economic growth," Bank Indonesia
Governor Syahril Sabirin was quoted by national newspapers
Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
From the supply point of view, Sabirin said, all sectors were
predicted to improve and register a positive growth, while from
the demand point of view, domestic consumption would continue to
increase due to increasing income, recovery of consumers'
confidence and relatively stable prices.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Bank Indonesia will also continue its policy
of keeping interest rates low to help revive the banking industry
and also the real sector, which will thus stimulate economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is emerging from its worst recession in decades. The
economy shrank by 13.7 percent and inflation topped 80 percent in
1998. The country's output was little changed in 1999, with
inflation slowing to 2.01 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia expects the country's inflation rate in 2000 to
reach between three and five percent. It, however, warned that its
estimate for the inflation rate did not yet include any increases
in fuel and power prices, civil servants' wages or import duties
on rice and sugar.
</P>
<P>
He said that the positive trend had not yet encouraged maximum
development in the real sector, so that the economic recovery
process continued to proceed slowly.
</P>
<P>
"The business sector is still facing various hindrances," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring of foreign debts had not yet been finished, while
working capital was not available because banks were not yet
functioning well, he said.
</P>
<P>
Up to September 1999, Indonesia's foreign debts reached 145.2
billion U.S. dollars, a little lower than 1998's 150.9 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin said the country's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in 1999
was only recorded at 0.1 percent or far below that recorded by
other crisis-hit Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Exports were still low because investment activities were still
hindered, he said, adding that a surplus of 5.2 billion dollars in
the balance of payments in 1999 was caused by a drop in the import
value and better oil and gas exports.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia predicted that current transactions in the
balance of payments will experience a surplus of 3.7 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Budget Impasse Perplexes Philippine Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Congress failed to
pass the government-proposed 2000 national budget before the year-
end of 1999, which is believed to affect the country's economic
recovery process from Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Existing law of the Philippines provides that if the 2000
budget is not enacted at the start of a new fiscal year, the
previous year's budget automatically comes in force and will
remain so until the new budget is enacted.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 budget of the national government stood at 579.5
billion pesos (14.5 billion U.S. dollars), way below the 644
billion pesos (16.1 billion dollars) being eyed for the year 2000
by the government.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives approved last November a budget of
651 billion pesos (16.3 billion dollars) proposed by the
government, but the Senate cut it to 599 billion pesos (15 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
After Philippine President Joseph Estrada exerted pressure,
senators and congressmen agreed to contain the cuts to 7 billion
pesos (175 million dollars), putting the budget for 2000 at 644
billion pesos during the bicameral meetings.
</P>
<P>
However, senator John Osmena, chair of the Senate finance
committee, refused to sign what he called a "bloated" 644-billion-
peso budget. Without Osmena's signature, the proposed budget would
not get approved.
</P>
<P>
As pointed by some analysts, the budget impasse was basically
caused by the fight between those who were arguing for the needs
of specific agencies and sectors on one hand, and those arguing
for fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability on the other.
</P>
<P>
Heads of government agencies and chiefs of local government
units managed to protect the allocations for their respective
turfs, saying the 644-billion-peso budget is important for the
recovery of the economy and the maintenance of the public service.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada said the budget is vital to his
administration's efforts to pump prime the economy which is
estimated to grow by 3.5 percent in 1999 as measured by the gross
national product (GNP) and expected to grow by 4.5 percent to 5.5
percent by year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Budget Secretary Benjami Diokno pointed out that the proposed
budget cut would have a negative impact on the economy because it
means "a negative growth in government consumption expenditures
and a negative growth in public and capital formation."
</P>
<P>
The government also worried that the proposed budget cut would
have serious social impact.
</P>
<P>
Jose Lina, who is the president of the 1.2 million-strong Union
of Local Authorities of the Philippines, has threatened to wage a
nationwide strike if the Congress would cut the 30 billion pesos (
750 million dollars) set for the local governments.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some senators argued that the budget cut is
necessary, saying that the country's projected revenues cannot
justify the size of the national budget proposed by the
administration.
</P>
<P>
Defending his refusal to sign the budget report, Senator John
Osmena said passing an inadequately funded budget would result in
a deficit much bigger than the maximum 62.5 billion pesos (1.56
billion dollars) imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Franklin Drilon said that passing the 64-
billion-peso budget would widen the country's deficit to 92.5
billion pesos (2.3 billion dollars) in 2000.
</P>
<P>
They argued that a large budget deficit will force government
to borrow both domestically and internationally. That will soon
force interest and inflation rates up. It will weaken the currency
and finally hurt the prospects of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the IMF, expressing concern over the government's
failure to contain the deficit in 1999, is waiting for the outcome
of the budget dispute to decide if it will provide concessional
loans to assist the country's growth program.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the decline in tax collection, the budget deficit of
the country ballooned to 110 billion pesos (2.75 billion dollars)
as of last November, much higher than the 86-billion-peso (2.15
billion dollars) limit agreed by the government and the IMF.
</P>
<P>
To save the budget, the government is trying to assure the
Congress that it could find new resources to cover the deficit,
including selling the government shares in companies, imposing new
taxes, as well as seeking grants and aids abroad.
</P>
<P>
By now, the Presidential Palace remains optimistic that the 644-
billion-peso budget will finally be passed when the Congress
convenes for a special session on January 10-15.
</P>
<P>
But some economists pointed out that the country could be
headed for a "fiscal crisis" if the government continues to ignore
the much deeper problems in the way it manages its financial
affairs.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Trade Deficit Drops, Trade Volume Continues to Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Romania's foreign trade
deficit dropped by 51 percent in the first 10 months last year
while its trade volume continued to contract.
</P>
<P>
Latest data released Wednesday by the State Statistics
Committee said that the country's two-way trade from January to
October was 15.07 billion U.S. dollars. Its exports totaled 6.85
billion dollars and imports 8.22 billion dollars, dropping by 1
percent and 15.4 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit in the period under review was 1.37 billion
dollars compared with a year-ago level of 2.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
Dealers here were concerned about the contraction in foreign
trade, saying that export reduction that started early 1990 has
sharply eroded the country's external payment capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The steady decline in imports, particularly those of the state-
of-the-art technology and equipment, will inevitably whittle away
economic development potentials and have a negative impact on the
country's future development.
</P>
<P>
Statistics said that textile materials, textile products,
metallurgical products, machinery and shoes constitute the bulk of
Romanian exports while its main imports include machinery, textile,
mineral products and chemical products.
</P>
<P>
Transactions with its major trading partners, including Italy,
Germany, France, Britain, Russia, the Untied States and Hungary,
accounted for 60 percent of Romania's total trade.
</P>
<P>
Private businesses are playing an increasingly important role
in foreign trade, accounting for 73.5 percent in import and 66.5
percent in export, greatly surpassing the previous year level of
50 percent.

RIO DE JANEIRO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Corinthians beat
African champions Raja Casablanca 2-0 in the World Club Soccer
Championship in Sao Paulo on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Luizao of the Corinthians team opened the scoring in the 50th
minute and his teammate Fabio Luciano fired a shot against the
Raja crossbar following a goalmouth scramble in the 68th minute.
</P>
<P>
The ball bounced down and was cleared by a Moroccan defender
but referee Stefano Braschi ruled that it had crossed the line and
awarded a goal.
</P>
<P>
But television replays showed that the ball did not go over the
line.
</P>
<P>
Raja played plenty of neat football, created several good
chances but were let down by their failure to get in enough shots
on goal.
</P>
<P>
Corinthians were superbly marshalled by Colombian captain
Freddy Rincon but were otherwise unimpressive.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Star Swimming Van Dyken Has Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Amy Van Dyken of the United
States, who won four gold medals at the 1996 Olympics, was resting
Wednesday after doctors remove scar tissue of her injured right
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
"The doctors said it went as expected, and she's going into
rehabilitation tomorrow," Van Dyken's agent Janey Miller said.
</P>
<P>
Van Dyken, 27, was expected to undergo 8-12 weeks of
rehabilitation before going back the water in March. Van Dyken
hopes she can be able to defend 50-meter freestyle title in the
Sydney Olympics in the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
"This is obviously a setback in my preparation for the 2000
Olympics," Van Dyken said, "but I have shown in the past that I
can come back from surgery just as strong as before. I should be
back in the pool in March and plan on swimming in Sydney."
</P>
<P>
Van Dyken had surgery before to her right shoulder, which she
tore in May 1998, five months after she won three gold medals in
the world championships.
</P>
<P>
She recovered in March 1999 and finished No.2 in the world list
for the 50m freestyle last summer. But her shoulder still bothered
her.
</P>
<P>
Van Dyken was a star of the Atlanta Games, becoming the first
American woman to win four Olympic gold medals in one year.

<HEADLINE> Intel Outlines Web Appliance Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Further expanding its
horizons beyond the microprocessor, Intel on Wednesday disclosed
its plans to sell Linux-powered Web appliance products.
</P>
<P>
The chip maker will provide three major components -- appliance
management capabilities, services package building blocks, and a
family of Intel-branded Web appliances designed for accessing the
Internet -- to telecom operators and service providers.
</P>
<P>
The non-PC Web appliances that run Linux instead of Microsoft
Windows can make phone calls, surf the Internet and send and
receive E-mail. Intel said that the first such product will be
available in mid-2000.
</P>
<P>
Intel also said that it will work with other companies that
will provide applications and content for its Web appliance.
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clara, California-based giant said that it is already
working with telecom operators, Internet service providers and E-
commerce retailers worldwide to deploy new services based on its
Web appliances.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts have noted that Intel's strategy might strain
long-standing relationships with its computer customers. Compaq,
IBM and others have plans to bring out similar devices, some of
which will also be based around Intel chips and entirely depend
upon non-Microsoft software.

<P>
JINAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province,
one of the country's economic giants, ratified 1,490 new overseas-
funded enterprises in the first 11 months of 1999, with an overall
utilization of 3.05 billion US dollars of contractual overseas
money.
</P>
<P>
A transformer enterprise backed by Germany's Siemens company
increased its investment to 174 million DM from the originally
planned 41 million DM.
</P>
<P>
Shandong exported 10.26 billion US dollars worth of products
during the January-November period last year, a rise of 10.2
percent over the same period of 1998, and 3.4 percentage points
higher than the national export growth rate. This means that local
exports have begun to rise at a higher pace again, after
experiencing setbacks due to the Asia's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
During the first 11 months of last year, the province
contracted 510 million US dollars of overseas labor services, a 34
percent rise on a yearly basis.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Provinces in western China have
accelerated the construction of highways to meet the needs of the
expected forthcoming economic upsurge in the region.
</P>
<P>
Work on a four-lane highway bridge began recently at the Three
Gorges reservoir area in Chongqing, the largest metropolis in
southwest China. The 956-meter-long bridge will serve as a
corridor leading to Hunan, Hubei, and Shaanxi provinces when it
opens.
</P>
<P>
Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province, has just finished
building an electric railway line between Chengdu and Kunming and
a double-track railway between Baoji and Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
Also, an expressway linking Chengdu with Ya'an will soon open
to traffic. The 140-km-long expressway, a key thoroughfare between
Sichuan and Yunnan provinces and the Tibet Autonomous Region, was
built at a cost of 3.7 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, there were more than 800 km of
expressway in Sichuan, and an expressway network with Chengdu at
the center has now been established, said one local highway
administration official.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China's Qinghai Province increased its highway
mileage to 17,936 km at a cost of 1.37 billion yuan in the first
11 months of last year. The investment was 30 percent more than
that in the corresponding period the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Gansu Province invested 4.18 billion yuan to build 18 key
highway projects last year, doubling the 1998 figure. It also
plans to allocate 38.2 billion yuan over the next six years to
build inter-provincial highways and form an expressway network
centered around Lanzhou, the provincial capital.

<HEADLINE> Fowler Told Another Operation Might not Needed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
club Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler was told on Wednesday that
second operation may not be needed on his troublesome ankle.
</P>
<P>
The England forward underwent a third scan on Tuesday as
Liverpool's medical team attempted to find a reason for the
discomfort in the ankle joint.
</P>
<P>
Fowler has been complaining of pain when running since an
operation in October to remove a spur from the bone.
</P>
<P>
There were fears the striker may have needed more surgery to
correct the problem but Liverpool's French manager Gerard Houllier
confirmed Fowler was simply told to rest the ankle for three weeks
before continuing his comeback.
</P>
<P>
Houllier said on Wednesday: "The doctor is adamant the problem
will not need another operation and we hope the rest will help."

<HEADLINE> Thatcher Charged by FA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Wimbledon defender Ben Thatcher
was charged by the Football Association with misconduct after the
game against Sunderland on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The FA deemed video evidence to be necessary after Thatcher was
seen elbowing Sunderland winger Nicky Summerbee during Monday's
clash at Selhurst Park.
</P>
<P>
FA spokesman Adrian Bevington said: "We requested a video of
the game on Tuesday morning and have charged Ben Thatcher with
misconduct."
</P>
<P>
The incident led to Carl Cort's winner in the game but was
missed by referee Graham Poll.
</P>
<P>
Thatcher was apologetic after the incident but insisted the
challenge was accidental and said: "I was running flat out for a
50/50 ball.
</P>
<P>
"He pulled out of the challenge after I'd already braced myself
for contact. If my elbow caught him I apologize. It was certainly
unintentional."
</P>
<P>
Thatcher now has 14 days to respond to the charge.

<HEADLINE> Wenger Struggles to Keep Kanu on FA Cup Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
club Arsenal mananger Arsene Wenger has refused to abandon hope of
losing Kanu from this weekend's FA Cup fourth round tie.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal are still locked in talks with the player's agents and
Nigerian coach Amodu Shaibu, who has threatened to invoke FIFA
sanctions to get the Gunners kicked out of the FA Cup if Kanu isn'
t released on time.
</P>
<P>
FIFA rules state Kanu should join his Nigeria team-mates on
Sunday to prepare for the African Nations Cup but the Londoners
want him to play in the FA Cup tie with Leicester on the same day.
</P>
<P>
An Arsenal spokesman said: "We are pursuing the possibility of
Kanu playing in Sunday's FA Cup clash with Leicester and are
currently trying to resolve the matter with the relevant parties."
</P>
<P>
Nigerian coach Shaibu hit out at Wenger's delaying tactics but
the parties are still involved in a series of talks about when the
player will leave Highbury.
</P>
<P>
Shaibu has even threatened to invoke FIFA's 14-day rule which
governs clubs releasing players for major tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Shaibu said: "If Arsenal play Kanu in the FA Cup we will invoke
FIFA sanctions against them. If it was a league game they would
lose the points, so if it's a cup tie they must lose the tie."
</P>
<P>
FIFA regulations state that all players should be available 14
days before a major tournament starts.

LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Pele has been voted player of the
20th century ahead of Dutch star Johan Cruyff and inspirational
German Franz Beckenbauer.
</P>
<P>
A poll conducted by the International Federation of Football
History and Statistics awarded Brazilian legend Pele 1,705 points,
while Cruyff polled 1,303 and Beckenbauer 1,228.
</P>
<P>
Cruyff said: "I think the poll has the right winner. Surely it
was decisive that Pele won three World Cup titles."
</P>
<P>
Alfredo di Stefano took fourth place followed by such greats as
Diego Maradona, Ferenc Puskas, Michel Platini, Garrincha, Eusebio
and Bobby Charlton.
</P>
<P>
Lev Yashin, the late Russian giant, was voted top goalkeeper of
the century, followed by Gordon Banks of England and Dino Zoff of
Italy.
</P>
<P>
Jose Luis Chilavert of Paraguay and Peter Schmeichel of Denmark
were the only two players still playing to make it onto either
list.
</P>
<P>
Schmeichel and Chilavert were beaten by Germany's Oliver Kahn
to be proclaimed top world goalkeeper in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Wanderley Luxemburgo of Brazil was named top national team

<HEADLINE> Charlton Hit Back at Man United Director  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Bobby Charlton has hit back at
claims by chairman Martin Edwards that the club would rather be
back in England playing in the FA Cup than competing in the
inaugural World Club Championship in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Manchester United director and former England star
believes United should grab the chance to create a slice of
footballing history.
</P>
<P>
Charlton said: "History will show, once again, that we were
right to accept the new challenge - we have the chance to write a
new page in history by becoming the first winners of the World
Club Championship."
</P>
<P>
He added: "When Sir Matt Busby saw the importance of competing
in Europe in the 1950s it did not go down well with the little
Englanders who thought we should stick to domestic football.
</P>
<P>
"And it is sometimes forgotten that England did not enter the
early World Cups and I cannot believe that there is anyone today
who would defend that decision."
</P>
<P>
But Charlton believes United's task shouldn't be underestimated
as they prepare to face Mexican side Necaxa in the first of their
group games on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Winning in Brazil will not be easy as the hot and humid
conditions will be alien to the English style of play.
</P>
<P>
"But I cannot believe anyone in England would not take some
pride when an English team can truly say it is the best in the
world - in any sport, not just football," he said.

LAGOS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister Alhaji
Sule Lamido said Wednesday that his government maintains its
condemnation of the military take-over in Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Lamido, who is among 10 ministers sent to Abidjanent Henri
Konan Bedie.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if military coups are left unchallenged, "then
democracy would never see the light of day as soldiers could just
wake up one morning and use force to bring down a government
chosen by the people."
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian minister urged the military junta of Cote d'Ivoire
to restore democracy within the shortest time, saying that six
months would be enough for the junta to hand over power to
civilians, as it was done in Mali and recently in Niger.
</P>
<P>
Lamido pointed out that Nigeria, which has just emerged from
15- year military rule, would be willing to assist Cote d'Ivoire
to restore democracy.

<HEADLINE> Pak Border Authorities Said to Be Alerted to Arrest Hijackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan reiterated Wednesday
that it has alerted its border authorities to be vigilant and
arrest the hijackers of an Indian airliner if they attempt to
cross into its territory.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman said, "Pakistan remains firm on its
intent to try the hijackers in accordance with the law. Border
authorities have been alerted to maintain strict vigilance in
order to arrest the hijackers if they attempt to enter Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, since the end of the hijacking on
the last day of the past millennium, the Indian government has not
made any contact with the government of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the episode, the government of Pakistan has
condemned all acts of terrorism including hijacking and provided
all assistance to India which was initially appreciated by India,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
However, he charged that India has failed to provide any
evidence or any relevant information to Pakistan which would
facilitate the arrest of the hijackers or prove that they had any
links in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of any information regarding their identity has so far
frustrated attempts to find them," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also asked New Delhi to make available the transcripts of
the negotiations conducted with the hijackers by Indian
negotiators at Kandahar Airport of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has repeatedly
accused Pakistan of involvement in the hijacking of the Indian
Airlines plane which had been stranded in Afghanistan for seven
days with more than 150 hostages on board.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called such accusations an "Indian propaganda
campaign against Pakistan" and "a crude attempt to externalize her
own problems."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Afghanistan's ruling Taliban, who dealt with the
hijacking drama along with India, had refuted the Indian
allegation that the hijackers were Pakistanis and they had left
for Quetta, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Beats Fernandez at HK Millennium Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- World top-ranked player
Martina Hingis of Switzerland got a flying start in the new year
Wednesday when she outclassed American veteran Mary Joe Fernandez
in straight sets in the Hong Kong Millennium Cup.
</P>
<P>
"It's quite OK. Winning the first match gave me confidence in
the coming Australian Open," said Hingis.
</P>
<P>
The first set turned out to be a breaking game when the two
players broke each other in the first six games before Hingis took
the first set 6-3.
</P>
<P>
The second set saw the world number one attacking with more
powerful returns and sound movement in the court while Fernandez
began making more unforced errors and could not cope with Hingis'
speedy and angled returns.
</P>
<P>
Hingis won the second set 6-1 and the match in just one hour.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Fernandez, who stayed out of the WTA tour for a
long time because of her health and was broken in every serving
game, said Hingis played very well.
</P>
<P>
"She (Hingis) was hard and powerful in the court today," said
world number 38 Fernandez who has been playing on the WTA tour
for 15 years and reached a career high ranking of four in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, 19 years old, vowed to defend her status as world
number one player in the new year.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other match, 27-year-old French veteran Sandrine
Testud met strong resistance from 15-year-old Russian Lyna
Krasnoroutskaya, world junior number one player, who won with a
score of 6-4, 5-7 and 2-6.
</P>
<P>
Hingis will face Testud in the semi-final on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The four-day invitational tournament features four other world
top-ranking star players, including Mary Pierce and Virgnie
Razzano from France and Jennifer Capriati and Chanda Rubin from
the United States.

<P>
The French top seed collapsed 6-0, 6-1 to in-form Bulgarian
Magdalena Maleeva.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Kournikova was rolled in three sets by Croatia'
s top player, seventh-seeded Silvija Talaja, in the packed 1500-
seat stadium at Royal Pines Resort.
</P>
<P>
Kournikova took the first set 6-4 Wednesday, winning the last
five games after being down 4-0.
</P>
<P>
She struggled to hold serve in the second set, which went to
Talaja 6-4 in just over half an hour.
</P>
<P>
The Russian then gave away a 2-1 lead in the final set to let
the 21-year-old Croatian cruise home 6-2 -- an unforced error, a
shot wide of the baseline, delivering the final nail in her coffin
as she served to stay in the match.
</P>
<P>
In the four years since turning professional, the Russian has
been a finalist twice, semi-finalist seven times and, after
Wednesday's capitulation, a quarter-finalist eight times.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia is expected to have
a surplus of 144,000 tons of rice in the 1999-2000 fiscal year,
the largest for several years, the Evening News said Wednesday,
quoting the Agriculture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's paddy production for the wet and dry seasons during
the 1999-2000 fiscal year is estimated at more than 3 million tons
which can produce 1.96 million tons of rice.
</P>
<P>
The unit paddy production averaged 1.65 tons per hectare in
Cambodia. With its 11.4 million people needing a total of 1.8
million tons of rice per year, Cambodia will have a surplus of 144,
000 tons of rice.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia cultivated about 1.89 million hectares of paddies in
1999, 135,000 hectares more than in 1998. Of the total, about 20,
000 hectares of paddies were hit by flood or insects.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's wet season lasts from May to November every year
while the dry season comes between December and April.
</P>
<P>
The good harvest is attributed to adequate rainfall and the
extension of cropping areas as well as the minimal damage from
flooding, drought and insects.

<HEADLINE> Bahraini Emir Visits Qatar for Closer Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Bahraini Emir Sheikh Hamad
Bin Isa Al-Khalifa arrived in the Qatari capital of Doha Thursday
to further the recently improved ties between the two Gulf Arab
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini Emir's brief visit came nine days after Qatar's
Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani's tour of Bahrain on
December 28, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The two emirs agreed in the Bahraini capital of Manama to
exchange ambassadors and to set up a joint committee to try to
settle a border dispute through cordial means.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, the Bahraini Emir described the Manama meeting
as "historic, successful and distinguished."
</P>
<P>
He said the door of cooperation between the two countries is
wide open now at both the government and private levels and in the
political, economic, social and cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Bahrain are locked in a dispute over several small but
potentially oil- and gas-rich Gulf isles, including the Hawar
islands, which are controlled by Bahrain since 1930s but also
claimed by Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The issue has been taken to the International Court of Justice,
which is expected to begin hearings on it next May.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued after the Manama meeting said the two
emirs agreed that the case will be withdrawn if an acceptable
solution is reached before the court's verdict by the joint
committee, which is co-chaired by their crown princes.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the long-running border standoff should not hamper
bilateral cooperation in other fields.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed to resume Qatari Airlines' flights
between Doha and Manama.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here earlier Thursday, the
Bahraini Emir will hold talks with his Qatari counterpart on
bilateral cooperation, and the Gulf, Arab and international issues.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also expected to set a date for the first meeting
of the newly-formed joint committee.

<P>
SHEPHERDSTOWN, W. Va., January 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President
Bill Clinton planned to return to Shepherdstown, West Virginia,
Thursday afternoon to try to help Syrians and Israelis speed up
their work, State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Clinton was returning to the Syrian-Israeli peace
talks at the request of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Albright has recommended that the president return
today to help the parties and help her get the parties rolling up
their sleeves and proceeding to do the substantive work in a
professional and hopefully soon in accelerated way," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the two sides did not hold any working committee
meetings Thursday and Clinton's return might help bring them to
direct discussions.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't seek committee meetings this morning because we
think the best needs this morning are for the substantive work to
go on informally through direct contacts by us with the parties,"
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Two committees on security and peace term started working
Wednesday while other two on borders and water have not yet
convened.
</P>
<P>
Direct contacts mean that Syrians and Israelis sit face to face.
"Informal contacts" is the U.S. term for separate talks between
the United States and the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Albright met with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh for 45
minutes Thursday, according to a Syrian sources.
</P>
<P>
He said Shareh asserted that all core issues should be taken up
simultaneously in line with the agreed mechanism that said all
four committees would meet concurrently.

WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. nonpartisan special
commission announced here Thursday sites and dates for three
presidential debates this fall.
</P>
<P>
The Commission on Presidential Debates announced that the three

Justice Department, including the attorney general," he added.
</P>
<P>
"With respect to the father returning, traveling to Miami to be
reunited with his son, this is a decision Mr. Gonzalez will have
to make. He has not yet applied for a visa to enter the United
States. Should he make a non-immigrant visa application, we are
prepared to expedite it; consideration of it," the spokesman said.
</P>

<P>
Bright colors help the user distinguish various icons,
improving the display's readability in all conditions, whether in
office lighting, low light, or total darkness.
</P>
<P>
"The new Organic Electro-Luminescent (OEL) color display offers
an important benefit to cell phone users, and continues to
position Motorola at the forefront of innovative wireless product
technology," said Ralph Pini, senior vice president and general
manager for Motorola's Personal Communications Sector's Product
Realization Group.
</P>
<P>
"Better readability is especially important as we move to
wireless web browsers that pack a lot of information onto a phone'
s display," he added.
</P>
<P>
The OEL display, developed in partnership with Pioneer Corp.,
of Japan, is one of the first demonstrations of this technology in
a portable product. It is based on light emitting structures that
can be patterned with the same resolution as conventional LCD
displays.
</P>
<P>
The result is a bright graphic display that can be easily read
in any lighting condition. This display utilizes an energy-
efficient architecture with very economical power consumption --
meaning negligible impact on standby or talk time.
</P>
<P>
Motorola plans to debut the OEL display technology in a phone
in the first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
More than 90,000 pre-registered industry members are expected
to attend the 2000 Consumer Electronic Show between January 6 and
9, the largest of its kind in its 32-year history since 1967.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Korean Air Boeing 747 cargo
plane, which crashed last month near an airport north of London,
contained several hundred kilograms of depleted uranium, it was
revealed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Depleted uranium (DU) is a heavy substance, 1.7 times as dense
as lead. It has also been used in aircraft to make counterweights
in the tailplane.
</P>
<P>
"If no precautions were taken at the crash scene, people will
have been exposed to hazards that could prove fatal," Malcolm
Hooper ,professor emeritus of medicinal chemistry at the
University of Sunderland, told BBC News Online.
</P>
<P>
A Boeing spokesman said that the company began using DU in the
early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
"Boeing replaced it with tungsten in the early 1980s on grounds
of cost and availability. The Korean 747 was delivered to the
airline in June 1980. We think it contained about 300 kg of DU,"
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 residents and rescue workers were reported after
the crash to be complaining of a range of problems, including
fatigue, skin complaints, joint and bone pains, kidney ailments
and respiratory problems.

MOSCOW, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian law enforcement agencies
have prevented the distribution of a Y2K-related computer virus
through the Internet, the Itar-Tass news agency reported Thursday.

The virus was designed by a Russian hacker known as Mixter on
the basis of the Tribe Flood Net (TFN) program, Tass reported,
quoting a spokesman of the Russian Interior Ministry's department

</P>
<P>
The virus, named TFNKK, was created under the umbrella of a U.S.

</P>
<P>
The TFNKK, a Trojan virus, can enter private computer systems
unnoticed and steal information from the systems. It was designed
to strike on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Russian law enforcement agencies exposed the virus on December
29 and notified the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. A U.S.

JOHANNESBURG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Namibian is likely to react
before the end of the week to the recent attack on a group of
French tourists near northeastern Namibian border with Angola, a
Namibian official told South African Press Association on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy information minister Gabriel Shihebo said it was
difficult to say when the government would react to the incident .
"Hopefully before the end of this week," he added.
</P>
<P>
Shihebo said some key figures from departments of home affairs,
defense and information held a meeting on Thursday afternoon to
discuss the situation and it was likely that they would later
release a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
He explained the reason for a delay in official reaction was
that some of the information received by the government on the
attack was incorrect.
</P>
<P>
Three French children were killed and their parents seriously
injured on Monday when gunmen in uniform opened fire on the
vehicle they were riding in the Caprivi Strip near the Omega
military base. Two aid workers from the European Union were also
wounded in another attack nearby later.

from strong rallies in the final days of 1999. The index rose to
an unheard-of 85.6 percent gains last year.
</P>
<P>
The warnings about lower profits for two high-tech companies
also helped to drag the Nasdaq index lower. Personal computer
maker Gateway warned late Wednesday its fourth-quarter earnings
would miss expectations due to a slowdown in sales while a Wall
Street analyst said MCI Worldcom's revenue is likely to grow 14.4
percent from 1999 to 2000, below his previous estimate of 15.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
But analysts expected technology stocks to bounce back after
plunging because technology companies still have great potential
for making money. The index fell 404.02 points or 9.7 percent in
the three sessions since Tuesday this year.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE rose 6.47 at 627.54. But the American Stock Exchange
index fell 1.12 at 857.76 and the Russell 2000 index of smaller

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,974 up, 1,158 down and 410
unchanged.

NYSE volume increased to 1.08 billion shares from 1.07 billion
in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Sales of Traditional Lifestyle Products to Remain Strong in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Sales of traditional
lifestyle products will remain strong in the United States this
year, despite an expected decline of sales of audio products,
according to a report released Thursday by the Consumer
Electronics Association (CEA).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade organization expected total sales of consumer
electronics products in the United States to hit a record 85
billion U.S. dollars in 2000. The CEA breaks up consumer
electronics into traditional lifestyle products, and home
information category which includes PCs and peripherals,
telephones, pagers and digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
Among traditional lifestyle products, digital versatile disc (
DVD) players, within the video category, are expected to continue
their phenomenal growth. In 1999, DVD players became the fastest
selling product in the U.S. history of consumer electronics, with
more than 4 million units sold during the year. This figure is up
371 percent over 1998 sales. The CEA projected sales of roughly 1.
5 billion U.S. dollars in 2000 with some 6.5 million units
expected to be sold.
</P>
<P>
Television will continue to stand as the centerpiece of home
consumer electronics with more than 42 million TVs to be sold in
2000.
</P>
<P>
Sales of direct-to-home satellite systems also are expected to
climb in 2000, with system installations to reach 4.1 million from
3.6 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The report said that sales of home and portable audio products
will decline by 3 percent. But with more than 5.6 billion dollars
in projected sales for 2000, audio products remain a popular
choice for consumers. CD players top the list of audio best-
sellers with 47 million players to be sold in 2000.
</P>
<P>
American consumers continue to demand access to information and
entertainment as well as stay in touch with friends and family
while on the go, the report said. Sales of mobile electronics will
reach 9.1 million dollars. Autosound equipment will top 4.9
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sales of gaming hardware and software are expected to rise by
16 percent in 2000, following a five-year period in which sales
have increased about 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the CEA, the average American household spends 1,
000 dollars per year on consumer electronics -- twice as much as
it spends on furniture, toys, sporting good or jewelry.
</P>
<P>
Color televisions are in 98 percent of all U.S. households.
More than 93 million U.S. households own at least one VCR, while
98 million households own a home radio, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> DVD-Video Becomes Fastest-Growing Products In North America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAS VEGAS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Enjoying even greater sales
than expected in the past two years or so, DVD-Video was hailed as
the most successful consumer electronics product launched ever in
North America, according to statistics released at the on-going
2000 Consumer Electronics Show here.
</P>
<P>
Figures released Thursday by the DVD Entertainment Group
estimate that hardware player sales sold through to consumers
since the format launched in late 1997 have reached 5.4 million
players in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Industry executives named DVD-Video the "Medium of the
Millennium" and boast that DVD-Video is the fastest-growing new
packaged media format launched in history.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for next year is equally promising. The DVD
Entertainment Group estimated that hardware shipments will double
to 8 million DVD-Video players in 2000. And, based on the success
of the format exceeding all previous forecasts, that number could
be even higher.
</P>
<P>
The group also estimated that the installed base will more than
exceed 10 percent of U.S. households, a benchmark of success for a
consumer electronics product.
</P>
<P>
The surge in hardware sales is a positive boost for retailers.
In 1999, DVD-Video hardware represented more than 1 billion
dollars in retail sales. This includes stand-alone players only
and does not include DVD-ROM drives or other home theater products.
</P>
<P>
In only its third year in the marketplace, DVD-Video player
prices have declined significantly. Statistics show the average
price sold for a DVD-Video player was 298 dollars last November,
down 30 percent from 428 dollars at the same time last year. Some
players and models are available for less than 200 dollars, making
the format accessible to the mass market.
</P>
<P>
Joe Pagano, vice president in charge of merchandising for Best
Buy, attributed the spectacular results to enthusiastic
acceptance by the consumer, reduction of hardware prices, the
release of popular titles such as "The Matrix," "Saving Private
Ryan" and "The Mummy," and the introduction of "Disney Classics."
</P>
<P>
The DVD Entertainment Group estimated that DVD-Video brought in
revenue of more than 2 billion dollars for Hollywood studios and
music labels in 1999. According to figures compiled by Ernst &AMP;
Young on behalf of the DVD Entertainment Group, nearly 100 million
DVD movies and music videos were shipped in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter alone, almost 50 million DVD movies and
music videos were shipped to retail. This figure represents
virtually the same amount that were shipped in the first nine
months of 1999 and is a 400 percent growth over the same period in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Since the format's launch, software shipments have reached more
than 130 million units, according to the DVD Entertainment Group.
</P>
<P>
The DVD Entertainment Group expected the industry to double its
1999 sales by shipping at least 200 million DVD movies and music
videos in 2000, representing 4 billion dollars in revenue for the
studios and music labels, approximately half of the total revenue
generated from the VHS sell-through.

<HEADLINE> EU Criticizes Italy for Untreated Waste Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
Thursday came a step closer to reporting Italy to the European
Court of Justice for the untreated Milanese sewage water that is
polluting the River Po and the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, the commission sent a "
motivated opinion" to the Italian government on the matter, the
last step before turning to the court in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Milan is the only major European city that is still discharging
untreated sewage waters directly into a key waterway, the Lambro
Olona, which runs into the Po.
</P>
<P>
The EC said this "contributes significantly" to the pollution
of the river and to the thick algae that is choking the oxygen out
of the Adriatic, threatening fish stocks and the tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
The commission said Milan should have taken adequate measures
to comply with a European Union (EU) directive by the end of 1998,
installing purification plants.
</P>
<P>
As things stand, it will not be able to meet EU standards until
the end of 2002 at the earliest, the EC claims.
</P>
<P>
Three water treatment plants are being built around Milan but
they are due to start operating between 2002 and 2005, "well
beyond the deadline," the EC said.
</P>
<P>
"Milan, one of the most important cities in Europe, is setting
a very bad example," said European Environment Commissioner Margot
Wallstrom.
</P>
<P>
"It's really disappointing that Milan should continue to be
without a proper water treatment system, especially in such a
sensitive river basin as the Po's," she added.
</P>
<P>
The EU's 1999 directive requires European cities to meet EU
standards on water treatment by 1998, 2000 or 2005, according to
the size of the city (with the smallest complying last).
</P>
<P>
With a population of 2.7 million, Milan is in the first group,
the major cities that should have brought their treatment systems
up to scratch by 1998.
</P>
<P>
Inadequate treatment of sewage and waste water is one of the
main sources of river pollution across the EU, the commission said.

<HEADLINE> Bucharest Stock Exchange Slightly Up at Beginning of 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bucharest Stock Exchange
in early January 2000 edged up slightly.
</P>
<P>
Stock Exchange brokers were quoted on Thursday by local media
as saying that volumes traded by financial investment companies
were significantly high immediately after the New Year's night.
</P>
<P>
Brokers are optimistic about the trends of the stock exchanges
in this year and consider there are premises for the real growth
of the investment in shares.
</P>
<P>
President of the Romanian Stock Exchange Viorel Marian Pana is
of the opinion that the fiscal reform laid down by the new Cabinet
this week and the start of the negotiations for accession to the
European Union are positive signs that can attract foreign
investors back to the Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The diminution in the tax on profit from 38 percent to 25
percent, initiated by the new Cabinet, and the drop in the
interests to credits are considered by analysts as the
prerequisites for a rise in the stock exchange quotations.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Universities Asked to Give Up Entrance Exams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Minister of National
Education Andrei Marga has recently asked universities all over
the country to give up the entrance exams starting this year, the
official Rompres news agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the students' admission in faculty will be made only
according to the average mark they got during high school years
and at the high school graduation exam.
</P>
<P>
Both students and universities could benefit from giving up the
entrance exam. On the one hand, students will get rid of an extra
exam shortly after the graduation exam, and on the other hand,
universities will cut expenses as organizing such entrance
examinations costs quite a lot.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Ministry of Education announced its intention to
increase the number of seats in the academic education, but the
exact figure will be known only after the budget for this year is
approved. There were 105,000 seats with state universities in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Record Growth in U.S. Consumer Electronics Sales in 2000 Projected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Total sales of consumer
electronics products in the United States will hit a record 85
billion U.S. dollars in 2000, according to projections released
Thursday by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA).
</P>
<P>
This figure represents the eighth consecutive year of growth
for the industry. The CEA, a sector of the U.S. trade organization
Electronic Industries Alliance, also expected total consumer
electronics sales in the U.S. to reach 81 billion dollars in 1999,
up 7 percent over the 1998 figure of 75 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers continue to embrace the exciting array of products
made possible by digital technology," said the CEA in the forecast
report. "We anticipate even further growth as the lines between
traditional information technology and consumer electronics
products blur, enabling manufacturers to offer new products to
enhance consumers' workstyles and lifestyles."
</P>
<P>
Reflecting consumers' continuing desire for workstyle
technologies -- products that enable them to work when, where and
how they wish, the home information category is projected to grow
by 6.5 percent in 2000, with sales of 37 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Within this category, the CEA estimated that a full 54 percent
of all U.S. households own a personal computer. Total PC sales
will hit a record of 16.8 billion dollars in 2000 with 16.8
million units expected to be sold. Sales of computer printers,
modems and fax modems, monitors and other computer peripherals
will add another 10 billion dollars in sales to the computer
hardware category. PC software will surpass 5.2 billion dollars in
sales, marking a full 16 percent rise from 1999.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere within the home information category, sales of corded
and cordless telephones will hit 80 million units or 2.4 billion
dollars. Sales of wireless telephones are expected to reach 18
million units.
</P>
<P>
Sales of traditional lifestyle products also will remain strong
in 2000 in the United States, the report said. These include video
and audio products, television, gaming hardware and software.

<HEADLINE> Japanese, U.S. Companies To Create Set-Top-Box Converter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The announcement was made at the 2000 Consumer Electronics Show
in Las Vegas, which is expected to draw more than 90,000 pre-
registered industry members and more than 100,000 visitors between
January 6 and 9.
</P>
<P>
Funai and Sarnoff said they will work together to develop a
customized set-top-box solution which Funai will manufacture.
Distribution is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Funai is a major provider of TVs and VCRs under the Funai,
Symphonic and Sylvania brand names and an Original Equipment
Manufacturer supplier of sets for sale under other well-known
brands.
</P>
<P>
Sarnoff's role under the agreement includes developing a
customized graphical user interface and a reference design
targeted at the mass market. The proposed set-top box will include
the Motorola MCT 2100 demodulator and MCT 4100 video decoder chips
for reliable reception and superior video quality. The chips were
designed by Motorola in partnership with Sarnoff.
</P>
<P>
"We are excited about the market prospects for affordable DTV
converters, and pleased to be working with a leading developer of
DTV technology," said Mr. S. Otsuka, executive director of Funai.
</P>
<P>
"Our set-top converter box will allow consumers to receive
terrestrial DTV broadcasts on their current analog TVs and home
theaters, with outstanding digital quality pictures and sound, at
a price that will be very attractive in the mass market," he added.
</P>
<P>
The product will offer reception of both ATSC digital and NTSC
analog broadcasts without manual switching by the user.
</P>
<P>
"Funai is a leader in TV and VCR manufacturing, and we're very
happy to be working with them," said James E. Carnes, president
and CEO of Sarnoff. "With their remarkable production capabilities
the consumer can look forward to a high-quality product."
</P>
<P>
According to Funai, this converter is the first in a line of
DTV/HDTV solutions planned for introduction over the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
Set-top converter boxes for DTV effectively turn an analog TV
into a display for digital content, giving consumers access to
digital television programming and such DTV features as CD-quality
surround sound.
</P>
<P>
Funai sees the over 250 million analog TVs in American homes
today as a huge potential market for popularly-priced versions of
set-top boxes, especially as DTV programming availability
increases. More than 100 DTV stations are currently on the air,
reaching over 50 percent of the U.S. population.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM to Initiate Constitutional Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said on Thursday that he stands for an extension of
President Suleyman Demirel's term which will end on May 16,
reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit declared that he will launch a campaign to amend the
Constitution to allow for such a move.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from his weekly meeting with Demirel, the prime
minister said that he is the first person to have voiced the need
for Demirel's term to be extended, adding he raised the issue with
the president for the first time during their meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit stressed that this is his personal idea and that the
president has never expressed such a desire nor has given such a
hint.
</P>
<P>
"As a member of past governments and as prime minister, I have
personally witnessed that the president, with his vast experience,
has served this country with great success, both at home and
abroad," said Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
Reasoning his initiative, Ecevit said that Turkey is going
through a period of stability in which confidence is at an all-time
high at home and that the country is held in high esteem
abroad.  "Stability in our country depends on sensitive
balances, and I believe that if the term of office of President
Demirel is extended for another term, this will further strengthen
the atmosphere of stability," he added.
</P>
<P>
Demirel, who was elected by Parliament on May 16, 1993 for a
seven-year term according to the Constitution, must leave office on
May 17. However, a constitutional amendment will permit him to stay
on in office.
</P>
<P>
Demirel has called for a change in the Constitution to allow
the president to be elected by the people directly. However, in
recent weeks he did not raise any objections to his term in office
being prolonged by Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Hizbullah Behind Kidnapping of Businessmen in Istanbul: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Istanbul police claimed that
Hezbollah, a radical Islamist organization, was involved in the
kidnapping of three leading Turkish businessmen who disappeared
since the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Hizbullah was behind the incident, which rose the number of
businessmen who have been kidnapped in Istanbul in the last four
months to nine, the Turkish Daily News reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The alleged kidnapping of the three men is linked to six others
who have been reported missing earlier, said the police.
</P>
<P>
Searches for the missing have been conducted in Istanbul and its
surrounding areas, especially farm houses.
</P>
<P>
The Hizbullah was accused of kidnapping a Turkish feminist
writer two years ago. The radical group reportedly carried out
assassinations against the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)

<HEADLINE> Sony Unveils First Digital Network Recorder At CES </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAS VEGAS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Sony Electronics, a leading
manufacturer of audio, video, communications and information
technology products, Thursday introduced its first digital network
recorder at the 2000 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) here,
attended by more than 90,000 pre-registered industry members.
</P>
<P>
The next-generation recorder, called Sony SVR-2000, will be
available this spring. The company said it incorporates a 30-
gigabyte hard drive that records up to 30 hours of television
programming or up to nine hours at the highest quality (DVD-Video)
setting.
</P>
<P>
By employing hard disk technology, the new network recorder
enables consumers to play, pause or rewind "live" television
broadcasts as they are being watched. To enhance the home
entertainment experience, it also is designed to work with
standard definition terrestrial broadcasts, as well as digital
satellite systems and cable programming services.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at this product as just the beginning in making
the vision of the digitally networked home a reality," said Mike
Fidler, senior vice president of home audio/video marketing for
Sony Electronics.
</P>
<P>
"Given the flexibility it offers, the SVR-2000 is an important
part of our overall home entertainment strategy," he added.
</P>
<P>
The SVR-2000 also allows users to transfer recordings via one-
touch dubbing to Sony VCRs for archival purposes.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the new digital network recorder enables users to
browse within groups of related programs by including a new "Sony
Showcase" area, which can link viewers to different content from
Sony entertainment companies. Once shows are recorded, the SVR-
2000 offers one-touch access via the "List" button on the supplied
remote commander.
</P>
<P>
The SVR-2000 will be available in April and is expected to sell
for approximately 500 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Report: Emerging Market Economies Providing Better Information to Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Many authorities have made
progress in providing the capital markets with improved data on
their economies, according to a new report released Thursday by
the Institute of International Finance (IIF).
</P>
<P>
The IIF said that its survey of the data release practices of
27 leading emerging market economies shows high levels of
reporting against 25 key IIF benchmarks by a number of economies
including Argentina, the Czech Republic, Poland, Peru, Thailand,
and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"Improved information to lenders and investors is reinforcing
the stability of the international financial system," said John
Bond, the IIF's chairman and chairman of HSBC Holdings Plc.
</P>
<P>
The IIF report, "Data Release Practices of Emerging Market
Economies: 1999 Assessment," indicated that following the 1997
Asian crisis, a number of Asian economies acted to significantly
strengthen their data release approaches.
</P>
<P>
"The crises in certain emerging market economies over the last
few years have once again highlighted the need for the markets to
have greater data transparency from the leading borrowing
countries. Our survey found that constructive responses to market
expectations are being made by a growing number of these countries,
" said Charles Dallara, the IIF's managing director.
</P>
<P>
The IIF, the global association of financial institutions with
315 members, initiated emerging market benchmark standards in 1995
and its most recently published comprehensive assessment was in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The benchmarks have been strengthened following the March 1999
report of a working group involving representatives of leading
financial institutions. Reinforcement of the standard included the
introduction of a requirement for weekly rather than monthly data
on reserves; additional data on disposition of reserves and drains
on them; and more demanding standards for debt, including short-
term debt.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Sell T-bills Worth 750 Million Dollars in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Finance Ministry
said it would recommence in mid-January negotiations with Merrill
Lynch and Nomura investment banks of launching two series of
treasury bills worth 250 million U.S. dollars and 500 million U.S.
dollars respectively, reported the local daily Ziarul Financiar on
Thursday quoting Finance Minister Decebal Traian Remes.
</P>
<P>
According to Valentin Lazea, chief economist of Romania's
central bank, Romania's foreign debt accounted for less than 25
percent of the Gross Domestic Product, leaving the country a gate
to loans from external capital markets.
</P>
<P>
Romania's present Prime Minister Mugur Isarescu in December
last year said in his capacity as a governor of the central bank
that Romania in 2000 would await foreign loans of up to one
billion U.S.dollars.
</P>
<P>
Romania this year must pay its foreign debt service of 2.22
billion U.S. dollars. In 1999, this debt amounted to a total of
about eight billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Romanian Finance Ministry and Credit Suisse
First Boston struck a deal to issue treasury bills with interest
rates of about 12 percent, but the American-Swiss bank failed to
sell the bonds under 17 percent returns. In the same year,
negotiations between the Romanian government and Merrill Lynch for
a new bond issuance came to nought as well.

<HEADLINE> Flu Cases Rise Again in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The number of flu infections has
increased in Britain, according to the latest figures released
Thursday, but experts said there is little risk of an epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The weekly statistics released by the Public Health Laboratory
Service showed a small increase in the number of people suffering
from the virus in England, suggesting the illness is nearing its
seasonal peak.
</P>
<P>
But despite not reaching epidemic levels, intensive care units
across Britain were under enormous pressure. The problem appears
to be exacerbated by a shortage of nurses in the National Health
Service.
</P>
<P>
In England, the number of reported cases rose from 124 per 100,
000 population last week to 144 this week.
</P>
<P>
Anything less than 400 is not classed as an epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday was the busiest day of the winter so far for London
hospitals in terms of demands on beds and the need to transfer
patients between hospitals.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, there were only 11 vacant intensive care beds in
the whole of the UK.
</P>
<P>
All the 275 beds in London's major hospitals were reported to
be occupied.
</P>
<P>
Many hospitals have already been forced to cancel planned
surgery because no intensive care facilities are available for
patients following their operations.
</P>
<P>
In London, some patients have been forced to wait up to 20
hours for treatment as casualty departments are inundated with
patients suffering from respiratory disease.
