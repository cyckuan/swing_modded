	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose sharply Thursday -- marking the  
first gains in four days -- on economic news that lessened fears of 
rising inflation and raised confidence that the Federal Reserve 
Board won't increase interest rates next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 3/32  
point, or $10.94 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, fell to 6.04 percent from 6.12 percent 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gross Domestic Product, which tracks domestic economic  
growth and is a key index for gauging inflation, slowed to 1.6 
percent growth in the second quarter, the slowest growth rate since 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates twice this year  
in an effort to slow the economy and stave off inflation. An 
overheated economy lowers unemployment and pushes up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, bonds rose on news of a radiation leak at a  
Japanese power plant, which caused some investors to pull funds out 
of Japanese securities and place them in U.S.-backed bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were up 1/8 to 3/16 point, while intermediate maturities rose 11/32 
to 5/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Thursday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
rose to 4.84 percent, as the discount rose 0.02 from Wednesday to 
4.71 percent. Six-month yields rose to 4.96 percent as the discount 
rose 0.01 percentage point to 4.77 percent. One-year yields fell to 
5.17 percent as the discount fell 0.04 percentage point to 4.91 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.75 percent from 5.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 1/4 to 112 15/32. The average yield to 
maturity of the index fell to 5.89 percent from 5.91 percent.

<HEADLINE> Jerry Lewis Stalker Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A man who spent more than four years in prison  
for stalking entertainer Jerry Lewis has been released. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Benson, a 56-year-old diagnosed chronic schizophrenic, was  
released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted in 1995 of aggravated stalking and sentenced to  
six years in prison. He received time off with work credits and 
good behavior, state prison spokesman Howard Skolnik said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson, who said he is moving out of state to start a new life,  
on Wednesday told the television show ``Extra'' that he never 
threatened Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think in a sense I was stalking him,'' he said. ``I  
made several calls to his house and I've been to his house to meet 
with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice of the Peace Jennifer Togliatti last week granted Lewis'  
request to extend a 1992 protection order against Benson until 
Sept. 21, 2000. Lewis has said he and his family lived in fear of 
Benson.

	Full Probe Sought on Korea Killings  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Saying ``the U.S. government can no  
longer deny its responsibility,'' South Koreans who say they 
survived a U.S. Army machine-gunning of hundreds of refugees in the 
Korean War demanded a formal investigation today into what happened 
beneath the No Gun Ri railroad bridge in July 1950. The Pentagon 
said any ``compelling new evidence'' would cause it to look again 
at the allegations. The Associated Press reported yesterday that a 
dozen Army veterans, in AP interviews, corroborated the core of the 
Koreans' account of the killings.

	TOKYO (AP) -- A leak at a uranium-processing plant in central  
Japan today sent radiation levels skyrocketing and led to the 
hospitalization of three workers, two in critical condition. Hiromu 
Nonaka, the top government spokesman, called the accident 
``unprecedented,'' and officials said no previous Japanese accident 
had left workers so seriously injured. About 150 people were 
evacuated from the area around the plant in the town of Tokaimura, 
70 miles northeast of Tokyo.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley, his Democratic presidential  
campaign surging, raised more money than Vice President Al Gore 
over the last three months, and has more money in the bank heading 
into the final quarter of the year. Bradley raised an estimated 
$6.7 million from July to September, spokeswoman Anita Dunn said 
today. Gore raised around $6.5 million during the same period, 
according to senior advisers. By spending less than $4.2 million 
during the last three months, Bradley wound up with more than $10 
million in the bank as of today. Gore aides said the vice president 
would have between $9.5 million and $10 million.

the wettest months ever for the region devastated by Hurricane 
Floyd's floodwaters. An inch of rain fell overnight, adding to the 
misery inflicted by 7 inches from Tropical Storm Dennis in early 
September, 20 inches of rain during Floyd two weeks ago, and up to 
8 inches of rain earlier this week. In Virginia, wind gusts up to 
60 mph blew down trees and power lines from remote mountain regions

West Timor, Australia said today that peacekeepers in East Timor 
are authorized to cross the border into the Indonesian territory if 
engaged in a battle with militiamen. Indonesia warned peacekeepers 
against entering West Timor, saying such action could lead to a 
clash between the Australian-led mission and Indonesian soldiers. 
Militiamen went on a rampage following an Aug. 30 independence 
vote, forcing hundreds of thousands of East Timorese to flee to 
West Timor, which remains part of Indonesia.

Disabilities Act. The complaints involved refusal to aid a disabled 
person in boarding a bus and injuries that occurred when disabled 
riders were carried on or off buses.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Romanowski To Appeal Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Denver Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski will  
appeal a $10,000 fine assessed by the NFL for his helmet shot to 
Tampa Bay quarterback Trent Dilfer. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Romanowski declined comment on the matter Thursday, his  
head coach confirmed the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to appeal it,'' Mike Shanahan said. ``There wasn't  
a hit to the head. The question is where was the crown of the 
helmet and the definition (of an illegal hit) more than anything 
else. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really a fine line. It wasn't a hit to the head or  
anything; it was a hit to the shoulder pad. A lot of guys have been 
hitting this way for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski hit Dilfer in the third quarter on Sunday after the  
quarterback released a pass. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL rules prohibit a player from using his ``helmet or face mask  
to violently and unnecessarily butt, spear or ram an opponent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After viewing videotape of the incident, the league announced a  
$10,000 fine on Wednesday. It came one week after Romanowski was 
fined $5,000 for a hit on Kansas City tight end Tony Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski wasn't penalized by game officials on either play.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Romanowski, who has a reputation for aggressive play  
and a history of being fined, was being watched more closely 
because of his reputation, Shanahan said: ``They're watching 
everybody now. They're trying to prevent injuries, especially the 
serious injuries. If there's any question about it, they fine you. 
It's up to you to appeal it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time they have a TV copy like they do and they can isolate  
on Bill, I think there's a lot more shots of Bill than there are of 
a normal person. So any time they get a lot of one-on-one coverage 
and they get it on videotape, you're going to have more of a chance 
to get fined.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Opens Education Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALISADES, N.Y. (AP) -- Saying that Americans are ``hot to do the  
right thing to improve education,'' President Clinton urged the 
Republican-led Congress Thursday to approve his budget to hire new 
teachers, modernize schools and set standards in failing 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to give the schools the tools they need to do the  
job,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke before governors and business executives gathered  
for the National Education Summit, the third in a series of 
high-level meetings going back to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress struggles to enact spending bills, education remains  
a divisive issue between Republicans and Democrats. ``We're having 
a big argument in Washington on the budget,'' Clinton said, adding, 
``I don't want to get into a partisan rerun of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations Committee and the Senate moved toward  
approving similar $320 billion packages financing labor, health and 
education programs. But both faced veto threats because of cuts in 
Clinton's proposal to hire 100,000 new teachers and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Americans still retain ``a passionate sense of  
national urgency about school reform'' 16 years after a landmark 
report called ``A Nation at Risk'' deplored the ``mediocre 
educational performance'' of the nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``The country is as hot to do the right thing to improve the  
education of our children today as it was the day after the 'Nation 
at Risk' report was issued,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton spoke to the same gathering three years ago, 14  
states had standards defining what students should know at various 
grade levels. By the close of this school year, 49 states will have 
such standards in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The president urged governors to accelerate the pace of fixing  
low-performing schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The education summit is a continuation of an idea inaugurated by  
then-President Bush in 1989, when he gathered educators, governors 
and business leaders in Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	An ambitious education plan set at that gathering has fallen far  
short of its goal to make American schoolchildren first in the 
world in math and science. 
</P>
<P>
	Only in fourth-grade science did the United States lead the  
world, according to the Third International Mathematics and Science 
Study. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1989 gathering also set other broad education goals for 2000  
-- from ensuring children are properly immunized and eating the 
right foods so they are ready to learn, to raising the high school 
graduation rate to at least 90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the goals were vague. Governors thought otherwise  
and adopted them. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush launched the education reform package, Clinton, who  
headed the governor's association at the time, has popularized the 
goals with more than $1.7 billion in grants to help states set 
standards and find ways to chart progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton signed the Goals 2000: Educate America Act in 1994,  
writing the original education goals into law and adding new ones 
on teacher quality and parent involvement.

<HEADLINE> Canucks Sign Defenseman Jovanovski </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER (AP) -- The Vancouver Canucks tried to patch up their  
tattered defense Thursday by coming to terms with restricted free 
agent Ed Jovanovski on a four-year, $9.2 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canucks also signed free agent defenseman Greg Hawgood.  
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver also claimed goaltender Manny Legace off waivers and  
sent center Matt Cooke to the Syracuse Crunch of the American 
Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	Jovanovski, 23, picked first overall by Florida in the 1994 NHL  
draft, came to the Canucks last year along with goaltender Kevin 
Weekes in the Pavel Bure trade. The six-foot-two, 210-pound 
Windsor, Ont., native had two goals and nine assists in 31 games 
with the Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawgood, 31, played with the Houston Aeros of the International  
Hockey League. The five-foot-10, 190-pound Edmonton native has 
played nine NHL seasons with six different teams. His one-year deal 
is believed to be worth $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Legace was in the Detroit system last year. He played 17 games  
in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and had a 2.60 goals-against 
average.

<HEADLINE> Bush Raises $56M, Banks $37M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Continuing to financially overwhelm both  
Republicans and Democrats, GOP presidential front-runner George W. 
Bush reported raising more than $56 million through the end of 
September, winding up with a campaign bank balance of $37 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign said Thursday that it had raised $19 million  
between July and September. That was more money than the two 
Democratic contenders, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill 
Bradley, raised between them. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, in fact, outraised Gore for the quarter, $6.7 million  
to $6.5 million. Since the beginning of the year, Gore has 
outraised Bradley, $24 million to $18.4 million. But Gore also has 
spent more money. At the end of September, Bradley had more than 
$10 million in the bank while Gore had between $9.5 million and $10 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush continues to outpace his Republican opponents as well. Sen.  
John McCain, R-Ariz., was a distant second, raising $3 million 
during the last three months and bringing his total to $9.3 
million, which includes $2 million transferred from his Senate 
campaign account. Gary Bauer, Patrick Buchanan, Elizabeth Dole, 
Steve Forbes and Orrin Hatch each raised more than $1 million 
between July and September. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain had $2 million in his campaign bank account as of Sept.  
30; Forbes had $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	With $37 million in the bank, Bush not only has enough money to  
wage energetic campaigns in the early caucus and primary states, 
but to set up full-scale operations elsewhere, such as in 
California, New York and the Midwestern states that will be key 
battlegrounds in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``Candidates develop full organizations in Iowa, New Hampshire  
and a few other states,'' said Anthony Corrado, a professor of 
government at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. ``The rest of the 
campaign is tarmac to tarmac, where they look for free TV time. The 
difference is he's going to be able to set up organizations in any 
of those key states that are essential to the general election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush reported receiving more than 135,000 contributions en route  
to his record-setting haul. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am humbled and honored that so many Americans are helping me  
spread my message of improving schools to leave no child behind, 
strengthening our military to keep the peace, and ushering in an 
era of responsibility in America,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign also released 41 more names of its top  
fund-raisers, known as the Pioneers, each of whom have raised at 
least $100,000. The list included Indianapolis Mayor Stephen 
Goldsmith, a leader of Bush's domestic policy team, and former 
Massachusetts Gov. William Weld. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who is largely financing his own campaign, raised $1.4  
million over the last three months, bringing his total to $4.2 
million through Sept. 30. In addition, Forbes spent around $15 
million from his own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Establishment financial support might be tight-fisted, but  
grassroots support is free flowing, as our lists of endorsements 
and escalating poll numbers reflect,'' Forbes spokeswoman Juleanna 
Glover Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Bush and Forbes are not accepting federal funds to help  
fund their presidential campaigns. But the other candidates are 
eligible for millions of dollars in financial help from the 
government after Jan. 1. Both McCain and Bauer, for example, expect 
to receive more than $3 million in taxpayer funds apiece based on 
what they have raised so far. The federal government matches the 
first $250 of each individual contribution in exchange for 
candidates agreeing to limit their spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are well along in our goal of raising $15-$20 million by  
the end of 1999,'' McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said. ``Our 
success has been fueled by tens of thousands of contributors who 
share John McCain's desire for leadership and independent 
conservative reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer campaign manager Frank Cannon noted the campaign has  
received contributions from more than 100,000 individuals. ``Beyond 
the front-runner, we have the broadest financial base in the 
Republican field,'' Cannon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's fund-raising success has some supporters beginning to  
talk about whether the Texas governor should give up federal 
funding for the general election as well, allowing him to raise and 
spend as much as he wants. After the national party conventions, 
the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees will receive 
around $66 million for the fall campaigns in exchange for not 
raising any private funds, except to cover legal and accounting 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``That discussion is out there,'' said a Republican close to the  
Bush campaign, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``It is 
something that will be looked at down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as Bush will have more money to spend for the primaries  
than he would have if he accepted federal funds, the campaign will 
have to decide whether he can raise more than the $66 million he 
would receive from the federal government if he is the GOP nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's certainly raising money at a pace that makes forgoing the  
public money a definite option,'' Corrado said. ``The question is 
whether the public will see this as a defiance of the rules and 
view it poorly. To date, we have no evidence that the public will 
use its votes to penalize a candidate who chooses not to take 
public money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the campaign has not  
discussed its fund-raising strategy for the general election. 
``Right now, we are focusing on raising money for the primary and 
winning the nomination,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Bombs Found at N. Hampshire Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- An unexploded bomb was found at a  
home-improvement store that is part of a chain that was hit by two 
bombings last week. 
</P>
<P>
	A bomb at a Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse in Asheboro  
slightly injured several employees and customers Sept. 22. Minutes 
later, a customer was seriously injured in the bombing of a Lowe's 
50 miles away in Salisbury. 
</P>
<P>
	A third device was found at a Concord store Tuesday afternoon,  
minutes after the arrival of Bob Tillman, chairman and chief 
executive of the national chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Earl Woodham, spokesman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol  
Tobacco and Firearms, said more lab tests are being conducted on 
the bomb, but it was clearly an explosive designed to harm people. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe's officials and the ATF declined to comment on the  
investigation. But the News &AMP; Record of Greensboro reported today 
that investigators are considering two theories: that the bombings 
were in retaliation for a fatal accident earlier this year at a 
race car track sponsored by Lowe's, or were connected to efforts to 
unionize Lowe's workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper quoted a source as saying that the chain's  
headquarters received a call from a purported relative of one of 
the spectators killed or injured in a May 1 crash at Lowe's Motor 
Speedway in Concord. The caller complained that the chain hadn't 
done enough for the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Three spectators were killed and eight injured when debris from  
a wrecked Indy Racing League car flew into the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe's, based in North Wilkesboro, is the corporate sponsor of  
the track, which is owned by Concord-based Speedway Motorsports 
Inc.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Russia Relationship Said Vital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Russian Prime Minister Viktor  
Chernomyrdin said today concern over alleged Russian corruption and 
money laundering through a U.S. bank must not overshadow the vital 
relationship between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin, speaking to reporters during a visit to the United  
States, acknowledged that Russia has a corruption problem. However, 
he said, ``It would be premature and unfair to think that all 
Russian business is corrupt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin, speaking through an interpreter, said U.S.-Russian  
relations have been thrown into question by the allegations 
concerning the Bank of New York, a development he called ``very 
dangerous both for the peoples of our two countries and for the 
whole world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former prime minister, who jointly headed a commission with  
Vice President Al Gore on bilateral ties, expressed anger at 
suggestions that Gore should be held responsible for the alleged 
misdeeds because of his strong support for U.S. aid to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Corruption ``is our responsibility,'' he said. ``What does it  
have to do with Gore, what does it have to do with the U.S. 
government?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin said he did not meet with Gore during his visit  
this week to Washington and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has come under fire from Republicans for his close  
relationship with Russian leaders and his hands-on role in 
U.S.-Russian diplomacy. Republican leaders have recently criticized 
the administration's support for aid to Russia, as federal 
investigators have widened their inquiry into allegations that 
Russian companies and individuals -- including organized-crime 
figures-- laundered billions of dollars through the Bank of New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin spoke as Russian authorities announced their first  
banking investigation since those allegations surfaced last month. 
The suspected culprit is one of Russia's smallest and most obscure 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are examining Moscow's Flamingo Bank, which  
allegedly had $430,000 and the equivalent of another $120,000 in 
rubles without proper documentation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those sums are minuscule compared to the allegations that  
Russian businesses and organized crime groups may have laundered 
billions of dollars through the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has agreed to cooperate with U.S. investigators, though  
it seemed reluctant to launch its own probe. But now, the 
Prosecutor General's office says it intends to closely scrutinize 
Russian banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``In connection with the scandal we are investigating all  
suspicious deals,'' the chief investigator with the prosecutor's 
office, Vladimir Minayev, was quoted as saying by the Kommersant 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Russian prosecutors have given no indication that  
Flamingo Bank had dealings with the Bank of New York or any other 
American bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Flamingo, with only one branch and no private depositors, has  
never previously attracted public notice of any sort. 
</P>
<P>
	Flamingo has a license that allows it to deal with foreign  
currencies, said a Flamingo bank official who declined to give her 
name. The bank refused to discuss details of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Many legitimate Russian businesses conceal part of their assets  
or try to move them abroad to avoid paying taxes in Russia. The 
practice is widespread, and could account for some of the funds 
that were allegedly funneled through the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of New York scandal has been described as potentially  
one of the largest money-laundering cases ever uncovered in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's inquiry -- focusing on a small bank and a small amount  
of money -- prompted suggestions that the government wants to make a 
scapegoat of Flamingo and give the appearance it is thoroughly 
investigating alleged money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	``Flamingo Bank will answer for the Bank of New York,''  
Kommersant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most crime and corruption scandals in Russia over the past few  
years have fizzled out, with hardly anybody taken to court. As a 
result, Russian law enforcement agencies are widely seen as either 
a feeble or corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian government played down the money laundering scandal  
for weeks after it broke this summer. But officials have 
acknowledged that the scandal is hurting the country's reputation 
and could hurt Russia's chances for receiving new loans from the 
International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF has toughened its conditions for the release of further  
loans following the scandal. The fund is demanding that Russia make 
its finances more transparent, and that the Russian Central Bank 
allow international auditors to examine its management of gold and 
currency reserves, First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko 
told the daily Segodnya.

<HEADLINE> Thais Take Hope From Output Figures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand's strong manufacturing  
performance in August confirms that the economy is on track to 
recovery despite recent softness in the currency, economists said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing production jumped 17.7 percent in August compared  
with the same period last year, said Suchada Kirakul, deputy 
director of the Bank of Thailand's economic research department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thailand's economy in general is showing clear signs of  
recovery,'' she said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists were surprised last week by data from Thailand's  
economic planning agency which showed second-quarter gross domestic 
product growth was a lower-than-expected 3.5 percent. GDP is the 
measure of all goods and services produced in a country. 
</P>
<P>
	The data indicated manufacturing production was flat in the  
April-to-June period compared with the previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Bank of Thailand figures released Thursday told a  
different story. 
</P>
<P>
	Output not only increased over the same period the year before --  
when manufacturing had almost ground to a halt -- but also was up on 
July, Sriyan Pieterz, head of research at SG Asia Credit in 
Bangkok, told Dow Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	Month-on-month growth in output shows manufacturers are meeting  
new demand, and not just restocking inventories which declined 
during Thailand's deep two-year recession, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The output resurgence is mainly to feed export growth,  
economists believe. Thailand's exports grew by 15 percent 
year-on-year in August, compared with a 7.2 percent increase in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank expects the economy, as measured by GDP, to  
grow by 3 percent to 4 percent this year, while many economists say 
a higher figure is likely given the strong manufacturing and export 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	There also seemed to be a recovery in consumer demand, JP Morgan  
regional economist David Fernandez told Dow Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Thailand's composite consumption index for August  
was up 2.4 percent over the previous month to 99.5 points, 
reflecting improvements in sales of motorcycles, liquor and 
value-added tax receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're seeing is a consumption recovery,'' said SG Asia  
Credit's Pieterz. 
</P>
<P>
	But most economists agree exports are the real engine behind  
Thailand's growth, and any downturn in Japanese or U.S. demand 
could stifle economic recovery.

<HEADLINE> Ovitz Seeks Los Angeles NFL Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hollywood dealmaker Michael Ovitz, who  
earlier proposed building a stadium in Carson, Calif., then joined 
forces with Los Angeles Coliseum backers, now is looking into 
bringing an NFL team to Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz and one of his group, billionaire Ron Burkle, have an  
option on 100 acres adjacent to the horse racing track in 
Inglewood, the Los Angeles Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Davis had held the option, but he dropped out of the  
bidding for an NFL team on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The league would have to approve both a stadium plan and a  
potential ownership group for an expansion franchise that would be 
its 32nd team. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL owners are expected to vote on awarding a franchise to  
either Los Angeles or Houston at a meeting in Atlanta on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the league's team owners, who were not identified,  
told the newspaper any proposal by Ovitz would have to overwhelm 
them to gain approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times also reported that the NFL is looking to keep  
alive a plan to build a stadium at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston, which has a stadium and financing plan set to go, is  
still in contention for the new franchise. If there was no group in 
Los Angeles seeking a team, the NFL would lose leverage in any 
negotiations with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz, who has been trying to bring a team to Los Angeles for  
more than four years, said he was confident this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on my conversations with the NFL commissioner and the  
co-chairman of the expansion committee, I believe we are going to 
leave Atlanta Wednesday having a football franchise for Los 
Angeles,'' he told the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz may have to put up a sum of earnest money to show the  
league he is serious about building a stadium and acquiring a team. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Ovitz proposed building a hacienda-style  
stadium, which would have been part of a shopping mall complex, in 
suburban Carson. The NFL, which has declared its intentions to put 
a team in Los Angeles, instead gave the nod to the Los Angeles 
Coliseum. He then joined in what seemed an uneasy alliance with the 
Coliseum backers. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to receive what it considered a suitable plan for the  
Coliseum, the league this summer opened the bidding again to other 
prospective sites and groups in LA. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL had no comment Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Orthodox Recruit Considering Towson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Prep school star Tamir Goodman, who has turned  
down an oral scholarship offer from Maryland, confirmed Thursday 
that his top choice is Towson, adding that he is also considering 
Delaware, Bowling Green and Georgia State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not making any agreements. I'm being extremely patient,''  
said Goodman, a 17-year-old Orthodox Jew who refuses to play on 
Saturday, the Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Karl, said Tamir won't decide on a school until  
after the high school basketball season ends in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman cited friction with the Maryland coaching staff over his  
refusal to play on the Jewish Sabbath as the reason why he turned 
down the offer from the Terrapins. He adheres to a kosher diet and 
wears a yarmulke, even on the court. The Jewish religion deems the 
Sabbath is a day of rest, meaning basketball is strictly forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3, 159-pound Goodman averaged 35.4 points a game last  
year for the Talmudical Academy, a Jewish day school near Baltimore 
that has an enrollment of only 72 students. Goodman transferred to 
Takoma Academy, a Seventh-day Adventist school in Takoma Park, for 
his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Basketball News first reported Goodman's top four choices  
Thursday on its Web site.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Nixes Free Trade-Job Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said  
Thursday there are countless economic arguments in support of free 
trade but job creation is not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, returning to a theme he has sounded several times  
this year, mounted a strong defense for the benefits the U.S. 
economy has enjoyed from reducing trade barriers. But he said he 
regretted that supporters have tried to link trade policies with 
job creation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We too often try to promote free trade on the mistaken ground  
that it will create jobs,'' Greenspan said in a speech prepared for 
a meeting of business executives in Minneapolis. Copies of the 
speech were distributed here. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade can influence the type of jobs that an economy can create,  
but not the overall number, Greenspan said. By opening up a country 
to competition, he said, free trade enhances productivity by 
forcing industry into more productive fields to the benefit of 
workers, who see their salaries increase. 
</P>
<P>
	But the overall number of jobs is influenced my other economic  
factors, Greenspan said, putting forth an argument made by a large 
number of economists. They contend that overall employment is 
influenced much more by factors such as interest rate policies, 
that can boost or depress consumer demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to find credible evidence that trade has  
affected the level of employment in this country over the long 
run,'' Greenspan said. ``Indeed, we are currently experiencing the 
widest trade deficit in history with a level of unemployment close 
to record lows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's remarks represented the latest in a series of  
speeches he has given this year seeking to counter what he views as 
rising protectionist sentiments as America's trade deficit has 
soared over the past two years. A global financial crisis has cut 
sharply into U.S. export markets and increased the flow of low-cost 
imports into this country. 
</P>
<P>
	``The campaign to expand free trade is never won,'' Greenspan  
said. ``Legislation to further lower trade barriers ... is becoming 
increasingly difficult to pass in Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States will serve as hosts this December to a meeting  
in Seattle of the 134-nation World Trade Organization, where a new 
round of global trade liberalization talks will be launched. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the U.S. delegation will attend the session without the  
congressional authorization it needs to complete the negotiations 
because President Clinton has been unable in five years to get the 
measure through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said he also was concerned that as formal trade  
barriers were being reduced, more countries were resorting to other 
forms of protectionism such as raising tariffs through findings 
that goods were being ``dumped'' at unfairly low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``While these forms of protection have often been imposed under  
the label of promoting fair trade, oftentimes they are just simple 
guises for inhibiting competition,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has supported a number of dumping  
cases filed in recent months by the steel industry, which argued 
they were losing millions of dollars in sales because of a flood of 
cheap imports into the country as a result of the Asian financial 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said the U.S. economy has benefited greatly from  
lowering trade barriers, which has increased competition and forced 
American businesses into more innovative fields paying higher wages 
for workers. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the transition from obsolete technologies to newer  
technologies does represent lost jobs for workers through no fault 
of their own. He urged support for the transition through job 
training programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a great tragedy were we to stop the wheels of  
progress because of an incapacity to assist the victims of 
progress,'' Greenspan said.

<HEADLINE> Religious Bias Bill Introduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The devout Christian trucker is forced to  
drive on a Sunday. The Muslim woman is barred from wearing a head 
covering to work. The observant Jew is scheduled for duty on the 
Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
	Such cases were cited by five senators Wednesday as proof that  
Congress should clarify a federal law protecting workers' religious 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are liberties upon which our country was founded,'' said  
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Kerry in sponsoring the bill were Republican Sens. Sam  
Brownback of Kansas and Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas and Democratic 
Sens. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Barbara Mikulski of 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	They said their bill would only clarify a provision in the 1972  
amendments to the 1964 Civil Rights Act that require an employer to 
``reasonably accommodate'' a worker's religious practice or 
observance unless it imposes an ``undue hardship'' on the employer. 
Kerry said courts have interpreted the law so that virtually any 
accommodation can be considered an undue hardship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission would be charged  
with enforcing the new law. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard T. Foltin, a lawyer for the American Jewish Committee,  
said roughly 200 complaints against businesses for failing to 
accommodate religious practices are filed yearly with the EEOC and 
others are filed with state human rights agencies.

<HEADLINE> Reagan Biography on Bookshelves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Reagan biography few have read but  
everyone seems to have an opinion about is finally on bookshelves, 
and the author says he won't lose sleep if reviews are as biting as 
the preliminary naysaying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy and secure with what I've done,'' declared  
Edmund Morris in an interview. And indeed, a few early reviews were 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris' unflinching if often admiring look at Ronald Reagan has  
members of the former president's family coming out on both sides 
of the question of whether the authorized biographer squandered his 
quality time at the Reagan White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Former aides are nervous and at times openly critical of the way  
Reagan is treated. And historians are scratching their heads over 
Morris' unorthodox technique of making himself a fictional 
character in Reagan's early years and inventing a few other people, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Random House long ago sunk a reported $3 million into  
``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan'' as an advance for Morris and 
waited -- and waited -- for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The book got an important early boost from The New York Times  
and USA Today. The Times said in its review today that few 
conventional political biographies ``bring their subjects' pasts so 
richly alive'' as ``Dutch'' does. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to approve the technique in theory; in less  
skilled hands it will doubtless prove a disaster,'' Times critic 
Christopher Lehmann-Haupt writes. ``But it certainly succeeds in 
this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today critic Deirdre Donahue said the book ``offers  
penetrating insights and original observations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Dutch'' sold briskly on the Internet this morning, ranked No.  
5 in sales by the online merchant Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said he welcomes the controversy over the literary  
technique but is ``distressed'' that some people close to Reagan 
have attacked him as being mean to the ex-president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at the gateway of the 21st century now and it's time for  
biography to explore new fields,'' he said in a telephone interview 
from New York, where he begins a tour timed with today's release of 
the biography. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said critics went after him based only on leaked snippets  
or excerpts in this week's Newsweek. ``Most of them have no real 
indication of what the book's like,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan's eldest son, Michael, praised Morris' efforts Wednesday  
even though he has only had time to flip through the book and see 
the author on ``60 Minutes'' on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris' bottom line was that Reagan was a ``great president,''  
Michael Reagan said. ``That's all I worry about. The other stories 
are stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I called him after '60 Minutes' and I said, 'I thought you did  
a very credible job and it was very good.''' 
</P>
<P>
	His sister Maureen said this week she won't read the book  
because it seemed Morris ``wasted an incredible and irreplaceable 
opportunity'' to explain her father. ``I have decided that I have 
read all the fiction about Ronald Reagan I intend to read,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So much for the maturity of her judgment,'' Morris snapped  
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris also said the two other Reagan children were supportive:  
that Patti Davis called and was ``hugely enthusiastic'' after the 
``60 Minutes'' interview and that Ron Reagan told him earlier he 
was eager to read the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Davis and Ron Reagan do not intend to comment on the book,  
their agents said. Nancy Reagan has also stayed silent. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Reagan, a radio talk show host, said from Sherman Oaks,  
Calif., that he was upset Morris dedicated the book to Christine 
Reagan, who died shortly after her premature birth to Jane Wyman, 
Reagan's first wife and Michael's mother. That was ``something that 
has been so private to the family,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris denied Wednesday that he concluded President Reagan was  
``an apparent airhead,'' saying he used that phrase only to convey 
what he thought of the president early on and to characterize ``the 
utter banality of his private conversation, in contrast to the 
magic of his public performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former President George Bush has called the ``airhead''  
observation ``brutal and grossly unfair and untrue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said he voted for Reagan in 1980 and 1984.  
</P>
<P>
	Also in the interview, Morris:  
</P>
<P>
	--Said he has ``copious notes'' supporting his account of a  
conversation with Bush on Christmas Eve 1988. Morris quotes Bush as 
complaining to him that he and his wife were unappreciated by the 
Reagans -- a claim Bush denies. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Bush ... confessed to me several times that his memory  
was very fallible,'' Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he ventured that Reagan loyalists, ``when they get over  
their initial shock,'' may be pleasantly surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	--Defended his assertion that Reagan suffered a ``major  
physiological insult from which he would never entirely recover'' 
when doctors frantically working on him after he was shot in 1981 
gave him blood that was too cold and ``staler'' than his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``The notion that he was permanently damaged because he got  
stale blood is ridiculous,'' said Dr. Richard O'Brien, president of 
the Pennsylvania chapter of the American College of Emergency 
Physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said his Random House editor was almost immediately sold on the  
idea when he raised it in 1992 to use himself as a semifictional 
character. ``It took him one overnight.'' He said his wife, Sylvia 
Jukes Morris, who often spoke for him when he was writing, was 
wrong when she told The Associated Press a year ago that he had 
abandoned the idea. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Execs More Bullish on 4th Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American executives are bullish about the final  
three months of 1999, according to a Dun &AMP; Bradstreet survey that 
reports the first gain in the outlook for exports since the Asian 
financial crisis arose in mid-1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of approximately 3,000 executives, conducted in  
August, had especially strong results in its indexes measuring 
sentiment about exports, sales, profits and employment. 
</P>
<P>
	A boost in hiring plans might further tighten labor markets at a  
time when the unemployment rate is at a 29-year low of 4.2 percent, 
possibly leading to significant wage increases, the 
business-information company said. 
</P>
<P>
	But executives surveyed said they did not expect wage pressures  
to significantly increase inflation. Two-thirds of those responding 
said they expected prices in the fourth quarter either to be the 
same as, or lower than, they were a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey reported 66 percent of the executives expect sales to  
rise in the fourth quarter, 58 percent expect higher profits and 38 
percent plan to hire additional workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The export index surged 19 points from its all-time low of 12 in  
the last quarterly survey in June, rising to 31. That also 
represents a gain of 6 points from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Other optimism indexes also were up substantially from the  
previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our survey indicates that during the last quarter of the  
millennium U.S. businesses expect to turn in very strong results,'' 
said David T. Kresge, chief economist for Dun &AMP; Bradstreet. ``For 
the first time in nearly two years, they see foreign demand for 
U.S. goods picking up significantly, adding to the continued 
strength in domestic spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few executives fear Year 2000 computer problems, Kresge said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Only 10 to 15 percent of respondents expect Y2K to have any  
impact at all on sales, investments, or inventories in the fourth 
quarter. And, among those who think that Y2K will have any effect, 
the great majority expect it to have a positive, rather than a 
negative, influence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, which was conducted by telephone, has a margin of  
error of less than 2 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Douglas May Return to Eagles Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA, Pa. (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles, who could use  
some help, any help, might have defensive end Hugh Douglas when 
they play Sunday against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas suffered a sprained ligament in his left knee in Week 2  
and was expected to miss four to six weeks, but has astounded his 
team by returning to practice. Douglas worked out in full pads on 
Thursday and said his status is now ``day-to-day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say that right now I'm ready to play,'' said Douglas.  
``I've got to be smart about it. I've got the kind of injury that, 
if I try to play on it, I may prolong it and make it worse. I'm 
still day to day. The good thing is I'm a lot further along than 
they thought I'd be on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I proved that I could get out there and practice,'' Douglas  
said. ``It's a step. I'm doing something that I wasn't even 
supposed to do at this point. I felt pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas suffered a partially torn medial collateral ligament in  
after his left knee collided with the helmet of teammate Mike 
Mamula in the second quarter of the Sept. 19 game against Tampa 
Bay. Douglas, the Eagles' best defensive player, had two sacks in 
two games. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed last week's game against Buffalo, a 26-0 defeat. If he  
plays Sunday, it will probably only be in obvious passing 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, his return to the practice field gives the  
Eagles some life. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the heart and soul of this defense,'' said cornerback  
Troy Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas is aching to play.  
</P>
<P>
	``More than anything, it's a matter of building that confidence  
back up and going out and playing,'' he said. ``I'm not in any kind 
of pain. I've been trying to simulate playing football, going out 
there in certain game situations, and it's feeling pretty good. I 
can do all of the lateral movements I have to make. 
</P>
<P>
	``That Sunday when I got hurt, it was more disappointment than  
pain,'' he said. ``When it first happened, I was just upset that it 
happened so soon in the season. If I was going to get hurt, why 
couldn't I get hurt in the 16th week of the season and not so early 
in the season?''

<HEADLINE> Global Ban on Internet Taxes Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration and Congress are  
urging that the World Trade Organization impose a permanent global 
ban on taxes and tariffs aimed specifically at Internet commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Of particular concern is the ``bit tax'' on transmission of  
digital data proposed by a recent United Nations report as a way 
for developing countries to gain revenue. The tax would increase 
based on the size of a computer file being transferred. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation introduced Thursday by Rep. Christopher Cox,  
R-Calif., and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., urges U.S. trade officials to 
work during the WTO's November meeting in Seattle for the permanent 
ban. The measure also says the United States should oppose an 
attempt by any nation to impose a bit tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure we arrest this threat before it's too  
late,'' Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Internet companies, Cox added, have questioned the Clinton  
administration's commitment to the ban, but Wyden said Treasury 
Secretary Lawrence Summers telephoned Thursday to offer full 
support for their non-binding resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need strong U.S. leadership to develop fair rules and a  
level playing field for a healthy global electronic marketplace,'' 
Wyden said. ``Both political parties have a reason to be 
supportive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 130-nation WTO last year adopted a one-year moratorium on  
Internet tariffs and discriminatory taxes, but several European 
countries have expressed interest in attempting to impose their 
value-added taxes on goods sold there. France, for example, has a 
20.6 percent value-added tax on goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan and Egypt, among others, want to ``keep their options  
open,'' Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to get everyone to understand that this would be  
mutually assured destruction,'' Cox said. ``It's appealing to 
people's better judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the domestic Internet tax front, Cox and Wyden agreed that a  
federal commission appointed by Congress should be left free to 
recommend future U.S. tax policy on e-commerce by its April 
deadline. But if the 19-member panel deadlocks or is ``hijacked,'' 
in Wyden's words, by one faction or another, Congress should 
consider giving it more time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, created as part  
of a law banning new U.S. Internet taxes for three years, is 
divided between members who fear loss of government revenue to 
tax-free Internet business and those who argue that sales taxes or 
other taxes would hamper the medium's growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're interested in is, what can they agree on?'' Cox  
said. ``Naturally, everyone is not in harmony. Anything that group 
could agree on would likely be good policy.''

<HEADLINE> Freezer-Bodies Suspect Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A man who eluded authorities for more than a  
week after police found the bodies of his wife and infant son in a 
freezer was arrested early Thursday nearly 500 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	John K. Adams, 24, was arrested near Kansas City, Mo., after a  
police officer found him sleeping in a rented van with a license 
plate stolen in Illinois. A gun was found in the van. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams had not been seen since Sept. 21, the day before a deputy  
found the frozen bodies of Robin Schafer-Adams, 24, and the 
couple's infant son, John R. Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman had been shot to death, and the child, who would have  
been 10 months old, had been strangled, authorities said. The 
bodies may have been in the freezer for up to three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams had not been charged in connection with the deaths, but he  
is wanted in Indianapolis in connection with holdups at two Pizza 
Hut restaurants. Adams is a former Pizza Hut delivery man. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies were found by a deputy coming to serve Adams with a  
robbery arrest warrant.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Eye Primitive Cannibals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a firelit cave in southern France 100,000  
years ago, a group of hunters bent over their meal, expertly 
slicing flesh from carcasses and sucking marrow from the bones. 
</P>
<P>
	But a closer examination uncovers a grisly scene: These were  
Neanderthals, and they butchered six fellow people just like they 
did deer -- the first real proof, say scientists, that Neanderthals 
practiced cannibalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether some Neanderthals ate their own kind has been a  
controversy since the turn of the century, when Neanderthal bones 
bearing suspicious scars were discovered in Croatia. Critics argued 
that maybe those bones had been gnawed by animals, cut for some 
burial ritual or merely damaged by the primitive techniques of 
1890s archaeology. 
</P>
<P>
	But the discovery by a team of French and American scientists,  
who preserved the Moula-Guercy cave on the Rhone River like a crime 
scene and used forensics techniques to examine the bones, should 
settle the issue, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``This one site has all of the evidence right together. It's as  
if somebody put a yellow tape around the cave for 100,000 years and 
kept the scene intact,'' said co-investigator Tim White, a 
University of California, Berkeley, paleontologist. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hominid and deer carcasses were butchered in a similar  
way, with the objective being the removal of soft tissues and 
marrow,'' said lead investigator Alban Defleur of the Universite de 
la Mediterranee at Marseille. This ``is clear evidence,'' he wrote 
in Friday's edition of the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the question is why these primitive people -- an evolutionary  
cousin of modern humans, although most scientists think they are 
not direct ancestors -- practiced cannibalism. 
</P>
<P>
	How to determine cannibalism from ancient bone is tricky. White  
published a book in 1992 about cannibalism among Anasazi Indians of 
the U.S. Southwest that concluded certain markings could 
definitively differentiate bones cut for consumption from those 
that were perhaps damaged by a rockslide or broken in a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Defleur found 100,000-year-old bone fragments from six  
Neanderthal skeletons scattered among piles of animal bones in the 
Moula-Guercy cave, and sought White's help in investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Two marks on a child's skull show how the chewing muscle in  
front of the ear was sliced off the bone by a rough stone tool 
found in the cave. All skulls were cracked open, and limbs 
defleshed and smashed for their marrow. It is very hard to crack a 
fresh femur -- striations from a hammerstone and the stone anvil are 
visible on one. 
</P>
<P>
	The marks, White explains, can be identified just like  
detectives track the gun used in a crime by matching marks on the 
bullet. 
</P>
<P>
	But how does he know bones were not cut for some bizarre burial  
ritual? Identical marks were found on deer bones, and remains of 
the animals and primitive people were discarded together, around 
fireplaces in the cave. 
</P>
<P>
	As White put it: ``Humans are mammals. You eat the same parts  
and leave the same traces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The results are unequivocal,'' Daniel Lieberman, a George  
Washington University anthropologist said after reviewing the 
study. ``I can't imagine any way you could get this kind of damage 
to skeletons through any process other than intentional defleshing 
of bones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some Neanderthals carefully buried their dead, White said  
the French cave and scarred bones at other sites suggest 
cannibalism was more common among Neanderthals than later humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Why? It's unclear. Animal bones suggest game was not a problem.  
They may have eaten enemies. Some cultures practice cannibalism 
after a natural death. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Michigan anthropologist Milford Wolpoff has  
another theory: They needed fat to get through the cold European 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Neanderthals apparently did not store provisions. Meat cannot be  
digested without enough fat, either in the meat or stored in the 
eater's body, so Neanderthals and their game would be incredibly 
lean by late winter, Wolpoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brains are very high in fat, as is bone marrow. Previous  
research suggests that in late winter, Neanderthals broke open 
deers' skulls seeking brains -- and the Neanderthal skulls and 
marrow-full limbs all were cracked, too, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neanderthals were the first humans in cold Europe, ``and you're  
looking at what it took to stick it out,'' Wolpoff contended.

<HEADLINE> World Banks Defends Pipeline Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- World Bank President James Wolfensohn is  
defending as environmentally sound a proposed Exxon-led $3.5 
billion pipeline project in Africa that the bank may help fund. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Thursday an anticipated $1.5 million or more in  
revenue from the project would benefit the people of Chad, one of 
the poorest countries in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists led by the Environmental Defense Fund have urged the  
bank to reject providing $200 million in financing for the 550-mile 
pipeline which would run from Chad, a landlocked country in 
northwest Africa to Cameroon's Atlantic coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups say the pipeline will destroy rain forests in  
Cameroon and harm the livelihoods of people living along its route. 
They also say the governments in both Chad and Cameroon are corrupt 
and claim that any revenue from the project would never reach the 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfensohn said there was ``a lot of hysteria about the  
Chad-Cameroon pipeline. It if had catastrophic effects on the 
environment we wouldn't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said working with the Chadian government the bank would  
try to ensure that pipeline revenues go ``to a transparently 
administered fund for health, education and poverty alleviation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfensohn said this fund could be run by the Chad government,  
members of its supreme court, opposition parties and members of 
civil society. 
</P>
<P>
	He said African representatives at the bank urged him to keep  
looking at the project and not be deterred by demonstrations, 
particularly by people who are not from Chad or Cameroon. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week a protester from the San Francisco-based Rainforest  
Action network scaled the bank's headquarters in Washington and 
hung a large banner with Wolfensohn's picture that read: ``Tax 
dollars and corruption buy murder and destruction. Stop the oil 
pipeline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the campaign against the pipeline, Wolfensohn said, he  
would try to keep it looked at as a serious venture. After a bank 
mission goes to the area for a last inspection trip, the board of 
directors is expected to meet to decide whether to approve the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon, the Anglo-Dutch company Shell and France's Elf Aquitaine  
plan to build the pipeline to deliver 225,000 barrels of oil a day 
from 300 wells in southern Chad. They have said they will pull out 
of the project if the bank decides not to participate in financing.

<HEADLINE> Dry Weather for Floyd's Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- The sky cleared over eastern North Carolina  
today after a last soaking rainfall rang the curtain down on one of 
the wettest months ever for the region devastated by Hurricane 
Floyd's floodwaters. 
</P>
<P>
	An inch of rain fell overnight, adding to the misery inflicted  
by 7 inches from Tropical Storm Dennis in early September, 20 
inches of rain during Floyd two weeks ago, and up to 8 inches of 
rain earlier this week. Residents of the soggy region hoped October 
will be drier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, after we get through this, we'll be sunny and have  
dry conditions right on through Monday,'' Richard Jones, a National 
Weather Service meteorologist in Raleigh, said today. By 
midmorning, the sun was shining on the flooded region. 
</P>
<P>
	Two solid days of rainfall, however, pushed up the Tar and Neuse  
rivers again. The Tar was expected to crest Sunday in Tarboro 7 
feet above its 19-foot flood stage. Forecasters said the Neuse 
would crest in Goldsboro on Friday at 24 feet, 10 feet above flood 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs of normalcy flickered in the worst-flooded areas, but not  
at Tarboro High School, serving as a shelter for 300 displaced 
flood victims beset by boredom and frustration. More than 1,500 
made homeless by the storm remain in 18 shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want a home,'' said Annie McDowell of Tarboro while snapping  
a plastic spoon in her hand after another lunch Wednesday at the 
high school shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest rain system spawned tornadoes that downed trees and  
damaged homes Wednesday night in central North Carolina, to the 
west of the worst of Floyd's damage. One person was injured by a 
fallen tree. 
</P>
<P>
	In Virginia, wind gusts up to 60 mph blew down trees and power  
lines from remote mountain regions to the Washington suburbs. A 
tornado also demolished mobile homes several miles from Darlington, 
S.C., but did not seriously injure anyone, emergency officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Southeast of Goldsboro in the small town of Seven Springs,  
residents braced for more flooding as authorities said the Neuse 
would crest Friday. Many of the town's side streets were covered 
Wednesday and an overnight curfew remains enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jesse Jackson toured Princeville, a town of 1,900  
founded by ex-slaves that is still closed to residents. Jackson 
said eastern North Carolina needs not just flood relief but a 
top-to-bottom reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	``This area had people who were hurting even before this  
flood,'' he said. ``Not only must we pump water out, but pump 
resources in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Princeville residents today were allowed to enter their town for  
the first time since they fled Floyd's floodwaters two weeks ago. 
However, residents may not be able to move back into their homes 
immediately. On Wednesday, Mayor Delia Perkins said the water 
system will need replacement this winter, suggesting it may be next 
year before residents can return for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd is expected to eclipse the $6 billion in state losses  
caused by Hurricane Fran in 1996. It has claimed at least 47 lives 
in North Carolina, destroyed 1,461 homes and damaged thousands of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	In Greenville, East Carolina University opened Wednesday for the  
first time in two weeks. School officials said up to 2,500 of the 
university's 18,000 students may need new housing. 
</P>
<P>
	In Edgecombe County, the epicenter of the storm damage, schools  
plan to reopen on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of their curriculum materials, all of their supplies were  
lost,'' said county spokeswoman Diane LeFiles. ``They're really 
starting from scratch. They've got to order the pencils, paper and 
paper clips.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State officials announced plans to spend up to $60 million to  
buy 4,000 mobile homes for displaced flood victims to live in for 
up to 18 months. Sixty-five families already are living in camping 
trailers in Rocky Mount. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 42,500 people have registered for state and federal  
assistance, and about $4.8 million in aid already has been 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers got more bad news Wednesday when state Agriculture  
Secretary Jim Graham urged them to destroy flood-damaged tobacco 
leaves rather than risk contaminating other harvested tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize this request is severe and costly,'' Graham said.  
</P>
<P>
	Early estimates peg flood losses for the state's tobacco crop at  
nearly $99 million, and all agriculture losses at $1 billion or 
more. North Carolina is the No. 1 tobacco state.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders Korea War Deaths Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered a  
top-level investigation Thursday of accounts of mass killings of 
Korean civilians by U.S. soldiers at No Gun Ri in 1950, saying a 
thorough and quick inquiry was needed to maintain ``the confidence 
of the American people'' in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Accounts by American veterans and South Korean villagers who  
said they witnessed killings at the No Gun Ri railroad bridge early 
in the Korean War -- including six ex-GIs who said they shot 
civilians -- were reported by The Associated Press on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen told Army Secretary Louis Caldera to conduct the review,  
which he said also was important to veterans and to U.S.-South 
Korean relations. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton gave assurances that the Pentagon ``wants to  
get to the bottom of it,'' and South Korea promised its own 
investigation. Both countries for years have rejected appeals from 
survivors and relatives, telling them the stories could not be 
verified. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP report prompted South Korean villagers to renew their  
calls for investigation of the incident in which they said 300 men, 
women and children were shot to death under the bridge, which still 
bears marks where bullets ricocheted off its cement walls. An 
additional 100 were killed in a preceding U.S. air attack, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These reports are, of course, very disturbing,'' Caldera said  
at a news conference. He said soldiers from the war would be 
interviewed -- acknowledging that no interviews had been conducted 
in previous Pentagon inquiries into the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This review will go beyond the documentary records,'' he said.  
``It will be an all-encompassing review'' that will take at least a 
year. He said it was too early to speculate on compensation to the 
Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Chul-kyun said  
officials would ``try to verify the truth of all related things 
concerning this case.'' He said any further action would be decided 
after that inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera said previous Pentagon reviews, which concluded there  
was no evidence of mass killing, also would be examined to evaluate 
military handling of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the AP report ``clearly has raised new information that  
demanded that it be looked into.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera said the early weeks of the conflict were chaotic and  
many U.S. soldiers at that time were ill-trained and ill-equipped. 
He said that was ``not an excuse'' for the reported acts. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, in a letter to Caldera, said, ``This review is important  
to the active and retired members of our armed forces, the 
confidence of the American people in the finest armed forces in the 
world, and our relationship with the people of the Republic of 
Korea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He asked Caldera to devote ``whatever resources are appropriate  
to accomplish this review as thoroughly and as quickly as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he was briefed on the AP report Thursday. Asked  
about it at a White House question-and-answer session, he responded 
by endorsing the inquiry ordered by Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to look into this,'' Clinton said. ``He wants to get  
to the bottom of it. He wants to examine all the available 
information and evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, a Republican president hopeful and former  
Vietnam prisoner of war, urged a ``full and complete 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The overall record of the American military has been  
exemplary, far better than any other country,'' McCain said after a 
campaign speech in San Diego. ``That doesn't change the fact that 
if there's an allegation, it has to be completely investigated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There could be a military tribunal such as in My Lai,'' he  
said, referring to the 1968 Vietnam War incident in which more than 
500 Vietnamese may have died. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Joan B. Campbell, general secretary of the U.S.  
National Council of Churches, which had appealed to the Pentagon 
for further investigation, said the ``truth should be disclosed to 
the public and the families of the victims should be compensated 
adequately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her statement also praised the courage of the American veterans  
who talked publicly about the events. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Korean War veterans group was critical of the report,  
calling it ``propaganda more than anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if it did happen, I don't think we need to hear this  
really,'' said Harley Coon, president of the Korean War Veterans 
Association. ``I can't see where it's going to do anyone any good. 
It's certainly not going to shed any good light on our military.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a Korean War historian, the University of Chicago's Bruce  
Cumings, said the new information is essential to setting the 
historical record straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything that can be done to bring out the truth of the Korean  
War as Koreans experienced it will serve reconciliation. It will 
serve to bring Koreans together,'' Cumings said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Criticizes GOP-Led Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- In a rare dispute with Congress,  
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush on Thursday 
criticized a GOP plan to squeeze money from a program for the 
working poor to meet budget targets. 
</P>
<P>
	He also signaled his displeasure with trends that suggest  
Congress may exceed spending limits in place since the 1997 
balanced-budget deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they ought to balance their budget on the backs  
of the poor,'' said the two-term Texas governor and Republican 
presidential front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP-led Congress is mulling several bookkeeping gimmicks to  
keep a promise to avoid spending portions of the budget surplus 
reserved for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	One proposal accepted by Republican House leaders would produce  
$8 billion in savings by spreading the earned income tax credit 
over 12 monthly payments rather than the lump sum now paid with tax 
refunds. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say the tactic would be unfair, because it would  
siphon money from working families who earn less than $30,000 a 
year. Bush agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned about the earned income tax credit. I'm  
concerned for someone who is moving from near-poverty to middle 
class,'' said Bush, whose is trying to build an election coalition 
by blending traditional conservative values with moderate rhetoric. 
Afterward, his spokeswoman Karen Hughes confirmed that Bush was 
criticizing the proposal to change the earned income tax credit 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Bush's remarks, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,  
R-Texas, who sponsored the proposal, said: ``This is not balancing 
on the backs of the poor. They don't lose a dime.'' DeLay later 
said Bush would realize that poor people will not lose any money. 
``It's obvious Mr. Bush needs a little education on how Congress 
works. I don't think he knew what he was talking about,'' DeLay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the self-professed ``compassionate conservative,''  
signaled in August that his long-awaited tax proposal would revise 
the earned income tax program. Bush has delayed revealing his tax 
plan, in part to ensure that tax cuts to wealthy Americans are 
offset by relief for voters in the middle class and near-poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks at a news conference during a swing through Silicon  
Valley marked the first time he has spoke against the spending 
plan. Bush has close ties to Congress and the GOP establishment, a 
point that his Democratic and Republican opponents could use 
against him if Republican lawmakers mishandle the politics of the 
budget debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office says current Republican  
spending proposals would exceed two-year-old spending caps set for 
fiscal 2000 and eat into the Social Security surplus. Asked about 
the report, Bush said, ``The administration and Congress should 
hold to the spending caps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not elaborate.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate office of Arizona's John McCain, who is also running  
for the Republican presidential nomination, chafed at Bush's 
criticism of congressional Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's press secretary Nancy Ives replied by saying, ``If we  
were to eliminate the pork that's in the spending bills right now, 
we wouldn't have to rely on budget gimmicks; we would have the 
money to spend on low-income Americans and hard-working families 
instead of spending that money on special interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Accused the Clinton administration of refusing to help the  
high-technology industry deal with a laundry list of issues before 
Congress until he began courting the industry on the campaign 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
	--Promised to debate his rivals, but only ``when the people start  
paying attention.'' Fellow GOP presidential candidates, trailing 
him badly in polls and money-raising, want to test his handle on 
issues.

<HEADLINE>  McHale, Thompson To Be Enshrined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Kevin McHale pushed himself beyond  
pain and whatever else stood in his way. John Thompson pushed 
himself and everyone around him until they sometimes felt like 
shoving back. 
</P>
<P>
	The high standards of the Boston Celtics star and the Georgetown  
coach propelled them into the Basketball Hall of Fame. They will be 
inducted Friday night, along with Cleveland Cavaliers executive 
Wayne Embry, women's college coach Billie Moore, and the late NBA 
pioneer and owner Fred Zollner. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale, who formed a powerful frontcourt with Larry Bird and  
Robert Parish, made it into the Hall of Fame on his first try. 
Other triumphs did not come so easily, like the 1987 final against 
the Los Angeles Lakers that McHale played with a battered right 
foot. He reportedly used a patio chair as a walker when he was off 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all that pain, we don't want you to play,'' his coach,  
K.C. Jones, said, adding. ``He said, `I'm doing this!' '' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a testament ... to his fiber,'' Parish said Thursday.  
``Most players with a broken foot wouldn't think of playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics lost in six games, and McHale underwent surgery. He  
was hobbled by foot and ankle injuries until retiring in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	But during 13 seasons with Boston, McHale played on championship  
teams in 1981, 1984 and 1986. He made seven NBA All-Star teams. 
</P>
<P>
	A Minnesotan with a taste for the outdoors and an easygoing  
exterior, McHale at first wanted to play hockey. But he grew to a 
gangly, long-limbed 6-foot-10 and came to Boston in 1980 as the 
sixth man. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale eventually learned to shoot a jump hook and a fadeaway  
jumper. He transformed himself into one of the league's most feared 
offensive threats, averaging 55 percent from the floor during his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson captured his share of glory, too. During 27 seasons at  
Georgetown, he stalked the sidelines with a towel habitually draped 
over his shoulder. Georgetown made 24 straight postseason 
appearances, three NCAA Final Fours, and won the 1984 national 
championship -- the first ever won by a black coach. 
</P>
<P>
	But it took the outspoken, even combative Thompson three tries  
to reach the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're standing for your views, you're going to have  
enemies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a `yes' man, maybe you can get into the Hall of Fame  
-- but that's not his nature,'' said Tom Heinsohn, another Hall of 
Famer from the Celtics. He played with Thompson when the future 
college coach was a backup center for Bill Russell. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinsohn said he would have picked Thompson for the Hall of Fame  
even more for being a ``social worker'' with his many players from 
poor backgrounds than for being a winning coach. Colleagues say 
Thompson always demanded that his players be their best on court 
and in class. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Shapland, an athletic department staffer who worked for  
Thompson for 15 years, said the coach taught him Yoda's lesson in 
``Star Wars'': ``There is no try; do or do not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He challenged you. There were some days I left the court as a  
player not thinking good thoughts about him,'' said Georgetown 
coach Craig Esherick, who played for Thompson and later was his 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson also demanded more and better chances for minorities.  
Thompson endured racial taunts when he first fielded a 
predominantly black team at Georgetown. He boycotted two games in 
1989 to protest NCAA Proposition 42, saying its financial limits 
hurt minority athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when finally elected to the Hall of Fame, Thompson grumbled  
that maybe his politics had delayed his entry.

<HEADLINE> Mixup May Have Doomed Mars Orbiter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The $125 million spacecraft that was  
destroyed on a mission to Mars was probably doomed by the 
embarrassing failure to convert English units of measurement to 
metric ones, NASA said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Climate Orbiter flew too close to Mars and is believed  
to have broken apart or burned up in the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA said the English-vs.-metric mixup apparently caused the  
navigation error. The company that built the spacecraft 
acknowledged it made the error. 
</P>
<P>
	The mistake was particularly embarrassing because the spacecraft  
had successfully flown 416 million miles over 9 1/2 months before its 
disappearance Sept. 23 just as it was about to go into orbit around 
the Red Planet. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials said the mistake somehow escaped what is  
supposed to be a rigorous error-checking process. A report is 
expected in mid-November, which would be soon enough to fix any 
possible similar problems with a spacecraft already en route to 
Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not make us feel good that this happened,'' said Tom  
Gavin of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``This mixup has caused 
us to look at our entire end-to-end process. We will get to the 
bottom of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	JPL said that its preliminary findings showed that Lockheed  
Martin Astronautics in Colorado submitted acceleration data in 
English units of pounds of force instead of the metric unit called 
newtons. At JPL, the numbers were entered into a computer that 
assumed metric measurements. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our previous Mars missions, we have always used metric,''  
Gavin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers were used in figuring the force of thruster firings  
used by the spacecraft to adjust its position. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad numbers had been used ever since the spacecraft's launch  
last December, but the effect was so small that it went unnoticed. 
The difference added up over the months as the spacecraft journeyed 
toward Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	Gavin said he does not expect the error to affect NASA's  
relationship with Lockheed Martin Astronautics, which has built 
several probes for the space agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin Astronautics acknowledged the mistake.  
</P>
<P>
	``We should have had them in metric units,'' said Noel Hinners,  
vice president of flight systems for Lockheed Martin Astronautics 
in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Climate Orbiter was on a mission to study the Red  
Planet's weather and look for signs of water -- information key to 
understanding whether life ever existed or can exist there. It 
carried cameras along with equipment for measuring temperature, 
dust, water vapor and clouds. 
</P>
<P>
	The orbiter's sibling spacecraft, Mars Polar Lander, is set to  
arrive Dec. 3. Gavin said investigators are trying to determine 
whether NASA made the same mistake with that spacecraft. The 
problem could be fixed if it did occur. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Polar Lander will study Mars' climate history and  
weather with the goal of finding what happened to water on the 
planet. It is equipped with a robotic arm that will collect samples 
for testing inside the spacecraft.

<HEADLINE> Robert Brooks To Keep Signing Bonus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Robert Brooks, who retired from the Green  
Bay Packers during training camp, will keep all of his signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Brandt, the team's director of player finance/football  
operations, said that after researching the matter, the Packers 
decided not to file a grievance to recover some of the $3.5 million 
signing bonus Brooks received in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks, who had been with the team since 1992, retired because  
of a knee injury and the resulting problems caused by 
overcompensating for it. 
</P>
<P>
	He had received the signing bonus as part of a five-year deal he  
signed in February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Green Bay Press-Gazette said in reporting the move that, if  
a player retires voluntarily, National Football League contracts 
call for a prorated portion of the signing bonus to be returned to 
the club while, if team doctors tell a player he should retire 
because of an injury, the player keeps the signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks had passed the Packers' physical but said he was in too  
much pain to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Press-Gazette said the Packers sent Brooks a letter saying  
they wanted to negotiate a settlement rather than pursue the matter 
through a grievance. It said Brooks countered by saying he would 
come back and play, which would have forced the Packers to cut him. 
</P>
<P>
	If he was cut, he would keep the bonus money anyway, so the  
Packers dropped the matter, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Govt Lawyer in Microsoft Case Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the lead lawyers for the government in  
the antitrust trial against the Microsoft Corp. has quit the case 
and resigned from the New York attorney general's office just weeks 
before the judge's initial verdict is expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Houck, who resigned Wednesday, led the courtroom fight  
for the 19 states suing Microsoft along with the Justice 
Department. He also delivered part of the government's closing 
arguments to the judge last week. 
</P>
<P>
	His decision was not expected to affect the trial's outcome  
because New York and the other states still are pursuing their 
claims. Iowa's attorney general, Tom Miller, is coordinating the 
states' role in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to see how this is going to affect the case,'' said  
Robert Litan, a former senior Justice official. ``Turnover is 
normal. I don't think you can really read too much into this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houck did not return messages left at his office Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Houck questioned only one of the 26 trial witnesses, IBM  
executive John Soyring, who also was from New York. Much of the 
attention during 77 days of testimony, has been on Justice 
Department lawyer David Boies, who questioned Microsoft trial 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	When Houck sought an expanded role early in the trial -- asking a  
question during testimony from the first witness -- the judge 
snapped at him harshly and reminded him that only one government 
lawyer was allowed to question each witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Houck was perhaps best known for his strong views that Microsoft  
should face the severest penalties for its alleged antitrust 
violations. On the final day of testimony, he told reporters the 
company was a ``malignant despot'' and that its behavior ``will 
justify a very significant remedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houck also was the only lawyer, besides Boies, to question  
Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, during a sworn videotaped 
deposition over three days last year. Shown at trial, excerpts from 
the tape of Gates professing to forget key events and appearing to 
evade questions proved embarrassing for the software giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Houck mentioned the Gates tape again during closing arguments  
last week when he said the judge ``plainly has seen enough of Mr. 
Gates' videotaped deposition to make your own findings'' about his 
truthfulness. 
</P>
<P>
	A Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, declined to comment on  
Houck's resignation. ``He has not applied for a job in (Microsoft) 
law and corporate affairs,'' Cullinan quipped in response to a 
question. 
</P>
<P>
	Houck was the head of the antitrust office for New York's  
attorney general until last year's election, when Democrat Eliot 
Spitzer defeated the incumbent and replaced Houck with Harry First.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Radio Station Steals Stories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- The Blade claims a radio station and its  
morning host have used the daily newspaper's stories on the air 
without crediting the newspaper or obtaining permission. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, the newspaper accused WSPD-AM of  
``pirating'' its stories and using deceptive trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The radio station's manager denied the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	``We would not intentionally pirate any other journalist's  
work,'' Andy Stuart, vice president and market manager for Clear 
Channel Communications Inc.'s five Toledo stations, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper cited four examples of articles it said were  
published in The Blade during September and then used by morning 
show host Mark Standriff on the air without proper credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law and the most fundamental rules of journalism require  
that when they use The Blade, they must give proper attribution 
each and every time,'' said the newspaper's lawyer, Fritz Byers. 
</P>
<P>
	Standriff would discuss issues based on what was reported in the  
newspaper and read direct quotes from The Blade as if he had 
gathered the information himself, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart said Standriff's show is based on opinions and that the  
standards are different. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark is not a journalist,'' Stuart said. ``Mark is a radio  
talk show host and has a much broader license.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit also claims that Standriff has encouraged listeners  
not to read the newspaper by using the motto ``I Read The Blade So 
You Don't Have To.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Standriff joked about the lawsuit during his show Wednesday.  
``I'm a wanted man,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks unspecified damages and an order that WSPD stop  
broadcasting news or other reports taken from The Blade. The 
lawsuit also asks that the court order WSPD to pay The Blade all 
advertising profits generated during the broadcasts at issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers often complain about broadcast stations pirating  
stories, said Aly Colon, a member of the ethics faculty at the 
Poynter Institute, a journalism training center in St. Petersburg, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a general perception that news is a public  
commodity,'' he said. ``Once the news comes out, it's often 
considered in the public domain.''

<HEADLINE> Restoring the Satire of Animal Farm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUGGALA, Ireland (AP) -- The actor-comedian W. C. Fields famously  
advised against working with children or animals, so he clearly 
would have balked at a film set without actors. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet that was the situation one rainswept day last fall on  
the set of ``Animal Farm,'' the $22 million TNT Original movie 
airing Sunday at 8 p.m. EDT on TNT. 
</P>
<P>
	Performers had, of course, previously been present on the rural  
Irish location, from Englishman Pete Postlethwaite (``Among 
Giants,'' ``In the Name of the Father'') to Dublin theater mainstay 
Alan Stanford (``Waiting for Godot''). 
</P>
<P>
	But halfway through the autumn shoot, the animals took over. As  
in the book, so it was on set where the day's stars included the 
donkey portraying Benjamin and the gray mare playing Mollie, not to 
mention a potentially scene-stealing border collie named Spice in 
the pivotal dog's role of Jessie. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no Winnebagos, no makeup and hair, no costumes, no  
perks, nothing,'' said Robert Halmi Sr., the film's executive 
producer, explaining the differences between this shoot and just 
about any other in the veteran producer's long career. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, Halmi had to build the entire location, creating  
a little town -- complete with electricity and phone lines -- on a 
fraction of the 2,000-acre Guinness Estate in a grassy dip amid the 
Wicklow Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the film itself, a Hallmark Entertainment  
adaptation intent on honoring its source, as befits a producer who 
says bluntly of the venture, ``This is it. I'll be happy if I don't 
do anything else in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is George Orwell, with satiric sting intact.  
</P>
<P>
	``In America, this is probably over the heads of most people,''  
conceded Halmi, who was 21 and living under Communist rule in his 
native Hungary in 1945 when Orwell's portrait of an animal uprising 
as a parable for Stalinism was first published. 
</P>
<P>
	While a student in Budapest, Halmi was part of the  
anti-communist resistance movement and got hold of a smuggled 
version of the book, which had been banned in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50 years later, he is using his clout as an  
Emmy-winning producer to bring it to the screen. ``For me, the most 
important thing -- almost religiously -- has been to do this book,'' 
Halmi said. 
</P>
<P>
	What he didn't want, he added, ``was a Disney-esque adaptation  
or a cartoon. That would be Hollywood, and I'm antiestablishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Animal Farm'' did inspire a British cartoon feature in 1954  
that radically softened Orwell's ending, and Halmi admits that even 
his live-action version leaves open an un-Orwellian door to hope. 
(``There are always survivors'' reads a key line at the end of the 
film.) 
</P>
<P>
	Other versions of the same fable include an acclaimed,  
much-traveled stage version, directed by Sir Peter Hall, that began 
at London's National Theater in 1984. A separate youth theater 
production for 24 actors ages 11 to 14 will run in Leicester in the 
English Midlands in late October. 
</P>
<P>
	Wherever it is seen, this is still the story of Napoleon, the  
nostril-flaring pig who participates in an insurrection on Manor 
Farm -- soon renamed the Animal Farm of the title -- only to end up 
grandly sipping whiskey with the same abusive landowners whom the 
animals displaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Napoleon's excesses mirror those of man at his most beastly, as  
Orwell paints a ruthless picture of totalitarianism then and for 
all time. 
</P>
<P>
	The film marries live-action with animatronics -- the latter  
courtesy of Jim Henson's Creature Shop in London -- alongside 
computer-generated effects, all intended to bring the barnyard 
inhabitants to nearly human life. (Think ``Babe'' but more 
bruising, as well as technically advanced.) 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's walking, it's an actual animal; if it's static and  
talking, it's animatronic,'' visual effects supervisor Angus 
Bickerton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Postlethwaite plays the bibulous owner of Manor Farm, with  
Patrick Stewart, Ian Holm and Julia Ormond supplying the voices for 
the opportunistic Napoleon, his sidekick Squealer and the wise 
escapee Jessie, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	But on a muddy day last October, actors voicing the animals had  
yet to be chosen, while those playing humans had done their jobs 
and left. (Kelsey Grammer and Julia Louis-Dreyfus were among those 
ultimately selected to voice the animals.) 
</P>
<P>
	So the rural location south of Dublin found director John  
Stephenson, a veteran of the Creature Shop, clambering through hay 
in a leaking barn, preparing for a close-up on an animatronic 
red-haired pig in what is Stephenson's first major directing 
assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is to get believable lips in,'' he explained,  
in between overseeing the four puppeteers who control the animals 
alongside a back-up team numbering almost 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do try and treat them as actors,'' he said of the animal  
operators. ``The end results are better that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Have any non-human stars been born? All eyes were on Spice, the  
3 1/2 year-old pooch playing Jessie, who is that rare holdout amid the 
autocratic misrule chronicled in ``Animal Farm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's in love with that dog,'' Bickerton said. ``She's  
gorgeous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Owens, Spice's Irish owner and trainer, said the dog would  
take it in stride: ``I think Spice thinks she's ready for Hollywood 
anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`SHASTA McNASTY': Your wait is over. Perhaps the season's  
least-awaited sitcoms will preview tonight at 9:30 p.m. EDT on UPN. 
Three rowdy roommates living in Venice Beach, Calif., make up the 
music group Shasta McNasty in a show that dares to be one of the 
most outrageous sitcoms on network television (this, according to 
the network). Dale Godboldo, Jake Busey and Carmine Giovinazzo 
star. If you want more, ``Shasta'' officially premieres next 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Family Farms Must Cut Costs / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIFTON, Ga. (AP) -- New technology, better fertilizer and more  
chemicals will not save family farms, according to a horticulturist 
in south Georgia who is trying to persuade farmers to rely on more 
natural processes to improve their land. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharard Phatak has encountered many skeptics as he preached his  
message around the state. 
</P>
<P>
	But more and more farmers are switching to the techniques  
advocated by Phatak and others who believe sustainable agriculture 
is an inexpensive and environmentally friendly way to farm. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of fertilizer, practitioners of sustainable agriculture  
rely on cover crops such as crimson clover, rye and winter wheat to 
supply nitrogen for the soil. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of plowing and harrowing their fields before planting,  
they practice no-till farming. They plant new crops amid the 
stubble of cover crops or previous crops. That saves them fuel, 
labor, equipment costs and reduces soil erosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of relying exclusively on insecticides, they rely on  
beneficial insects and microorganisms in the soil to give total or 
partial pest control. That saves money, benefits wildlife and helps 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Phatak was troubled in the 1980s as thousands of family farms  
failed. During that period he visited his father's farm in India. 
His father had switched from natural farming to modern practices -- 
heavy reliance on pesticides, chemical fertilizers and harsh 
treatment of the soil. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could see the quality of the soil was depleted,'' Phatak  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to the University of Georgia's Coastal Plain  
Experiment Station and began looking for cheaper and more gentle 
ways to grow crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have little control over seed, chemicals, fuel and  
equipment costs, he said. Because commodity prices are driven by 
market conditions, farmers also have little control over the amount 
they are paid for their crops, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So how could farmers increase profits and improve their chances  
of survival? Phatak wondered. He decided cost cutting was the only 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Reed, Coffee County's extension director, said he was  
skeptical, but felt he had an obligation to assist farmers who were 
interested in sustainable agriculture. Now, the county leads the 
state with 40,000 acres of crops grown using such techniques. 
Brooks County is second with 35,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed predicts 30 percent to 50 percent of Georgia's crops will  
be grown that way within 10 years. Already, groups are being formed 
to assist farmers and campaign for more research. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't say we have an answer for everything,'' Phatak said.  
``Research is a continuous process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Growers in Coffee County, located in south-central Georgia, are  
growing peanuts, cotton, soybeans, corn and vegetables the 
sustainable way. 
</P>
<P>
	Max Carter, 64, who farms near Douglas, began the switch about  
24 years ago when he read that soil erosion was the farmer's top 
enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	Now all of his crops -- peanuts, cotton, soybeans, wheat and rye  
-- are grown that way. He plants two crops a year on the same land. 
In August, September and November, after the summer crops are 
harvested, he plants his winter cover crops in the residue. He 
harvests the cover crops in early June and plants the summer crops 
in the rye and wheat stubble. 
</P>
<P>
	``Double cropping with no-till has made it easier for me to stay  
in business,'' he said. ``Or you could say it like this, I'm going 
out of business slower.''

<HEADLINE> Venezuela To Sell Unleaded Gasoline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela will start selling unleaded  
gasoline on Friday, years after most countries switched to the more 
environmentally compatible fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Environment Minister Jesus Arnaldo Perez told reporters that it  
was unclear why the country with the world's largest oil reserves 
outside the Middle East has taken so long to introduce unleaded 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Venezuela, which competes with Saudi Arabia and Mexico  
as the top foreign supplier of oil to the United States, has been 
exporting unleaded gasoline for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Only cars manufactured from this year on in Venezuela will be  
equipped to use unleaded gasoline. Perez estimated that by 2008 
about 30 percent of the nation's vehicles will be using unleaded 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the nation's decades-long use of leaded gasoline,  
environmental officials insisted Thursday that lead levels in the 
air are within environmentally safe levels even in the worst areas 
such as the El Silencio neighborhood in downtown Caracas. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Venezuela has reduced the amount of lead in its  
gasoline by two-thirds since 1988.

<HEADLINE> 'Gray Market' Cigarette Sellers Sue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Discount cigarette distributors filed a  
federal lawsuit challenging last year's $206 billion settlement 
between big tobacco companies and attorneys general in 47 states, 
an attorney said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is the latest shot fired in a long-running battle  
between the tobacco companies and so-called ``gray market'' 
distributors who buy cigarettes manufactured in the U.S. for 
overseas markets at cheap rates, then re-import them and sell them 
to U.S. smokers at huge discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco companies have sued dozens of discount distributors and  
have lobbied state governments and the International Trade 
Commission to ban the sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The new lawsuit, filed Aug. 13 in U.S. District Court, was made  
public in a statement issued by Matthew Fairshter, a Pasadena 
attorney representing the discount marketers. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants include cigarette makers R.J. Reynolds, Brown &AMP;  
Williamson, Lorrilard and Liggett Group, as well as the attorneys 
general of states that participated in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks to overturn the settlement, arguing that it  
unfairly allowed cigarette makers to increase prices far beyond 
what was needed to meet their settlement obligations. Further, it 
contends that as part of the deal, attorneys general agreed to 
lobby states to restrict discount sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also asks that proceeds from any settlement or verdict  
be used to establish a national trust to pay health care costs of 
people with tobacco-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we're going to defend our interests and the sanctity  
of the settlement,'' said Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for 
California Attorney General Bill Lockyer. ``We don't believe this 
litigation presents a meaningful threat to the settlement 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calls made after business hours to R.J. Reynolds, Brown &AMP;  
Williamson, Lorrilard parent Loews Corp. and Liggett parent Brooke 
Group Ltd. were not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Bush Challengers: We've Got Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thanks in part to the federal funds being  
rejected by Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush, 
his GOP challengers maintain they will have enough money to compete 
financially with the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	As Bush reported yet another new fund-raising record Thursday,  
raking in $56 million through the end of September, his rivals 
touted their own fund raising during the period from July 1 to 
Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for Bush and millionaire Steve Forbes, who is paying most  
of his campaign expenses, the remaining six Republican and two 
Democratic candidates are accepting federal help for their 
campaigns. Under the Watergate-era law, taxpayers match the first 
$250 of each individual contribution, while candidates agree to 
limit spending. 
</P>
<P>
	In a year when Bush has captured most of the available  
contributions, the federal aid looms larger as his opponents 
struggle to raise enough to be effective. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush reported having $37 million in the bank, the others  
noted they had millions of dollars not yet reported because the 
federal funds won't be released until January. 
</P>
<P>
	A case in point: Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a poor second in the  
money race. 
</P>
<P>
	Though McCain reported $2 million in the bank as of Thursday,  
aides noted that he already was eligible to receive another $3 
million in federal matching funds, bringing his real total to $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``John McCain will lead America on a new patriotic challenge and  
the McCain campaign will have sufficient resources to spread that 
message across the nation,'' said McCain's national finance 
chairman, Herb Allison. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer had just $300,000 in the bank at September's end, but  
has $3.6 million in federal matching funds coming next year, 
campaign manager Frank Cannon said. ``Beyond the front-runner, we 
have the broadest financial base in the Republican field,'' Cannon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign said Thursday that it had raised $19 million  
between July and September. That was more money than the two 
Democratic contenders, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill 
Bradley, raised between them. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, in fact, surpassed Gore for the quarter, $6.7 million  
to $6.5 million. Since the beginning of the year, Gore has raised 
more money than Bradley, $24 million compared to $18.4 million. But 
Gore also has spent more money. As of Thursday, Bradley had more 
than $10 million in the bank while Gore had between $9.5 million 
and $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush reported receiving more than 135,000 contributions en route  
to his record-setting haul. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am humbled and honored that so many Americans are helping me  
spread my message of improving schools to leave no child behind, 
strengthening our military to keep the peace, and ushering in an 
era of responsibility in America,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign also released 41 more names of its top  
fund-raisers, known as the Pioneers, each of whom have raised at 
least $100,000. The list included Indianapolis Mayor Stephen 
Goldsmith, a leader of Bush's domestic policy team, and former 
Massachusetts Gov. William Weld. 
</P>
<P>
	With his sizable bank balance, Bush not only has enough money to  
wage energetic campaigns in the early caucus and primary states, 
but to set up full-scale operations elsewhere, such as in 
California, New York and the Midwestern states that will be key 
battlegrounds in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is now going to have the money needed to run not just  
robust campaigns in Iowa and New Hampshire, but he will be able to 
run well-organized campaigns in most of the states, which means he 
will be able to use his primary campaign to set a strong foundation 
for a general election organization,'' said Anthony Corrado, a 
professor of government at Colby College in Waterville, Maine.

<HEADLINE> NBC Sitcom Is First Cancellation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC's ``Mike O'Malley Show'' earned a grim  
distinction Thursday by becoming the first of the season's three 
dozen new series to be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	A terse announcement from NBC declared an immediate production  
halt for the sitcom, with no more episodes scheduled for broadcast. 
``O'Malley'' had aired twice, with this week's episode losing 
one-third of the audience that watched its lead-in show, ``Will &AMP; 
Grace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Repeats of other NBC comedies will air in the former  
``O'Malley'' slot (9:30 to 10 p.m. EDT Tuesday) following the 
conclusion of baseball playoff coverage, NBC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starring actor-comedian O'Malley as a 30-ish bachelor trying to  
behave like an adult, the series had been troubled from the outset. 
The pilot was rewritten and reshot this summer, but still got 
dismal reviews. Its Sept. 21 debut shared an inauspicious 54th 
place in the Nielsen ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Thursday, O'Malley thanked his crew and said he  
was heartbroken by NBC's decision. ``Then again,'' he said, ``I 
always wanted to be No. 1, and now I can say I am No. 1 to be 
canceled.''

<HEADLINE> McNown Pleads No Contest To Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cade McNown admits he made a mistake nearly  
three years ago, and now he's going to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Through his attorneys, the rookie Chicago Bears quarterback  
pleaded no contest Thursday to a misdemeanor charge of illegally 
possessing a handicapped parking placard. 
</P>
<P>
	Current UCLA safety Eric Whitfield and former Bruins fullback  
Craig Walendy also entered no-contest pleas in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court, joining 13 other current and former UCLA football 
players who previously agreed to a plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	All 16 have been ordered to pay $1,485 in fines and perform 200  
hours of community service, and also must spend a day meeting with 
the disabled and their advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	The final three charged in the matter were scheduled for  
arraignment Thursday before Municipal Judge Sam Ohta, but were 
granted continuances until Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown's lawyers, Ronald Safer and Stanley Greenberg, entered  
the no-contest plea. McNown issued a statement nearly three hours 
later from the Bears' practice site in Lake Forest, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	It read: ``During offseason workouts at UCLA, I applied for a  
handicapped parking sticker. Although I was injured, the process by 
which I acquired the permit was wrong, and for that I am sorry. I 
had trouble getting around, but applying for the sticker minimized 
the needs of permanently disabled persons. I deeply regret the 
incident occurred, and hope people don't judge me on this 
particular mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown refused to comment further, citing the advice of his  
lawyers. He could not be found earlier when the Bears' locker room 
was open following practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Safer emphasized outside court that McNown never used a  
handicapped parking space, and said the state had no such evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``He feels terrible that his conduct and the conduct of others  
denigrates the seriousness of the obstacles faced by permanently 
handicapped people,'' Safer said. ``He made this mistake in 
judgment when he was 19 years old. Let the first person who made no 
mistakes of judgment when they were teen-agers throw the first 
stone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now 22, McNown was a first-round draft choice of the Bears last  
April. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crime is obtaining and possessing this handicap sticker,''  
Safer said. ``He did not obtain the placard through correct 
channels, and he acknowledges that. He should have followed 
procedures and seen a doctor himself instead of somebody else 
obtaining a doctor's signature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Safer said McNown, who led the Bruins to the Pac-10 championship  
last season, believed at the time that the doctor's signature was 
valid. The lawyer wouldn't elaborate further. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy city attorney Brian Williams said he expected the three  
remaining men charged -- Washington Redskins running back Skip 
Hicks, Kansas City Chiefs safety Larry Atkins and former UCLA 
linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo -- to enter no-contest pleas Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The city attorney's office brought charges July 8 against 14  
current or former players alleged to be part of the disabled 
parking scam, and five more were charged Sept. 13. Nine entered 
pleas on July 28, four more on Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten, including Whitfield, are members of the current team and  
were suspended for the season's first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	California law allows people with temporary or permanent  
disabilities to obtain permits to park in special handicap spaces, 
to use metered spaces for free and to park in limited-time zones 
indefinitely. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Agents Probe N. Carolina Bombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Federal investigators are said to be  
looking into a possible link between three bombs found at Lowe's 
stores and a fatal accident at an auto track named for the home 
improvement chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The News &AMP; Record quoted an unidentified source Thursday as  
saying someone had called Lowe's to complain not enough was done 
for victims of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Three spectators were killed and eight injured May 1 at Lowe's  
Motor Speedway in Concord when debris from a wrecked car flew into 
the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	The person who called the chain's headquarters in North  
Wilkesboro claimed to be ``an aggrieved relative,'' said the 
source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also are looking into the possibility that the  
bombings are connected to recent efforts to unionize Lowe's 
workers, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	A bomb that was found at a store in Concord on Tuesday before it  
went off was the third planted at a Lowe's in less than a week. Two 
bombs exploded minutes apart Sept. 22 at stores in Asheboro and 
Salisbury. Three people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Earl Woodham, spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco  
and Firearms, said lab analysis showed that all three bombs 
appeared to be the work of the same person or persons. He wouldn't 
confirm the newspaper report. 
</P>
<P>
	Concord store employees found the bomb soon after Bob Tillman,  
the chairman and chief executive of Lowe's, entered the store. 
Tillman regularly visits stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe's spokesman Brian Peace would not comment on the  
investigation.

<HEADLINE>  U.S.-Russia Relationship Said Vital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Concern over alleged Russian corruption and  
money laundering through a U.S. bank must not overshadow the vital 
relationship between the two nations, former Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin, speaking to reporters during a visit to the United  
States, acknowledged there is corruption in Russia. However, he 
said, ``It would be premature and unfair to think that all Russian 
business is corrupt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin noted that U.S.-Russian relations have been thrown  
into question by the allegations about money laundering at the Bank 
of New York, a development he called ``very dangerous both for the 
peoples of our two countries and for the whole world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former prime minister, who jointly headed a commission with  
Vice President Al Gore on bilateral ties, bristled at suggestions 
that Gore should be held responsible for the alleged misdeeds 
because of his strong support for U.S. aid to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Corruption ``is our responsibility,'' he said, speaking through  
an interpreter. ``What does it have to do with Gore, what does it 
have to do with the U.S. government?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin, who had a longer tenure than most Russian prime  
ministers, from 1992 to 1998, said he did not meet with Gore during 
his visit this week to Washington and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has come under fire from Republicans for his close  
relationship with Russian leaders and his hands-on role in 
U.S.-Russian diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders recently have criticized the administration's  
support for aid to Russia, as federal investigators have widened 
their inquiry into allegations that Russian companies and 
individuals -- including organized-crime figures-- laundered billions 
of dollars through the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin spoke as Russian authorities announced their first  
banking investigation since those allegations surfaced last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are examining Moscow's Flamingo Bank, which  
allegedly had $430,000 and the equivalent of another $120,000 in 
rubles without proper documentation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those sums are tiny when compared with those allegedly involving  
the Bank of New York, the 15th-largest U.S. bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian prosecutors have given no indication that Flamingo Bank  
had dealings with the Bank of New York or any other American bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Flamingo, with only one branch and no private depositors, has  
not attracted public notice in the past. The bank has a license 
that allows it to deal in foreign currencies, said a Flamingo 
official who declined to give her name. The bank declined to 
discuss details of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's inquiry -- focusing on a small bank and a small amount  
of money -- prompted suggestions that the government wants to make a 
scapegoat of Flamingo and give the appearance it is thoroughly 
investigating alleged money laundering.

<HEADLINE> Alitel To Cut 350 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Communications company Alltel Corp.  
plans to cut 350 jobs during the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The cutbacks are to come from Alltel's wire-line operations in  
13 states, mostly in the Southeast and Midwest markets, the company 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts will begin next month and continue through next  
summer, Alltel spokesman George Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some jobs are to be eliminated through attrition and others  
through early retirement. Some employees may be offered other jobs 
in the company, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Alltel has been installing digital and  
fiber-optic equipment that has eliminated the need for some 
engineering, warehousing and switching office jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that dramatic changes in technology can  
result in the elimination of job positions,'' said Scott Ford, 
Alltel's president and chief operating officer. ``This announcement 
is a clear indication that our business needs are changing and our 
company must be proactive in meeting daily challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts amount to 1.5 percent of Alltel's nearly  
24,000-person work force. 
</P>
<P>
	Alltel, based in Little Rock, Ark., will take a yet-unspecified  
third-quarter charge to cover severance expenses, which will be 
offered based on years of service and company benefit plans.

<HEADLINE> Help Wanted Ads Up in in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The volume of help-wanted advertising in major  
U.S. newspapers edged up in August from the three-year low reached 
in the previous two months, a private research firm reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board said its index of help-wanted ads rose  
slightly to 86 in August, up from 85 in both June and July. 
</P>
<P>
	The index is used as a gauge of changes in job supply. It is  
watched by economists as an indicator of labor market conditions to 
help form estimates of unemployment rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the slow rate of increase in the index in August, the  
Conference Board's chief economist said he remained convinced that 
an expected spurt of economic growth in the second half of this 
year could force the unemployment rate to its lowest level in 
nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are very few signs that hiring will slow as companies  
scramble to rebuild inventory,'' Ken Goldstein said in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein predicted that with economic growth of at least 3.5  
percent in the third and fourth quarters driving increased creation 
of jobs, the unemployment rate could fall below 4 percent for the 
first time since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's unemployment rate rose from a 29-year low of 4.2  
percent in May to 4.3 percent in July, which was still the lowest 
level in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Commerce Department reported Thursday that U.S.  
economic growth dipped to a relatively slow annual rate of 1.6 
percent in the spring, but many analysts expect the slowdown to be 
temporary. Some economists are even more bullish than Goldstein, 
expecting growth of at least 4 percent in the July-September 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The seasonally adjusted help-wanted index, which stood at 100 in  
the base year of 1987, is derived from measuring the volume of 
unemployment ads in 51 major newspapers across the country each 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	From June through August, help-wanted advertising fell in seven  
regions and rose in two. The steepest declines took place in the 
West North Central region, which includes Kansas City, Mo., 
Minneapolis, Omaha, Neb., and St. Louis, down 10.1 percent; the 
West South Central region, including Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, 
New Orleans, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa, Okla., down 7 percent; and 
the South Atlantic region region -- Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte, 
N.C., Miami and Jacksonville in Fla. , Richmond, Va., and 
Washington, down 4.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Increases took place in the Mountain region, which includes  
Denver, Colo., Phoenix and Salt Lake City, up 4.9 percent; and the 
East South Central region, including Birmingham, Ala.; Knoxville, 
Memphis and Nashville in Tennessee; and Louisville, Ky., up 2.4 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Deal Hatcher to Rangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins trimmed payroll and  
added some badly needed size Thursday by trading defenseman Kevin 
Hatcher, their second highest-paid player, to the New York Rangers 
for defenseman Peter Popovic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins were eager to trim their payroll after signing  
defenseman Darius Kasparaitis to a $3 million, two-year contract on 
Wednesday. Hatcher is in the final year of a contract worth $3.1 
million this season and was the second-highest paid player to 
Jaromir Jagr's $10.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovic will make $1.4 million this season.  
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Hatcher was the Penguins' most productive  
offensive defenseman, with 45 goals and 95 assists in 140 career 
games. A 15-year veteran and the bother of the Stars' Derian 
Hatcher, he is one of only five NHL defensemen to score 30 goals in 
a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovic, 31, isn't much of a scorer, but brings size -- he is  
6-foot-6 and 245 pounds -- to a team desperately in need of it. The 
6-3, 230-pound Hatcher was the Penguins' biggest defenseman, but he 
is not exceptionally physical and is more of a scorer than an 
agitator. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovic had one goal and 40 penalty minutes in 68 games with the  
Rangers last season and seven goals and 48 assists in five seasons 
with the Montreal Canadiens from 1993-98. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher was originally acquired by the Penguins from the Stars  
on June 22, 1996, for forward Sergei Zubov. Popovic was the 
Canadiens' fourth-round pick in the 1988 entry draft.

<HEADLINE>  German Wins Nobel in Literature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Novelist Guenter Grass, whose  
explorations of Germany's troubled century made him one of the 
best-known German writers of the post-World War II generation, won 
the 1999 Nobel Prize in literature today. 
</P>
<P>
	A phone call from the Swedish Academy informing him of the  
choice brought a smile from the 71-year-old author. ``I'm happy,'' 
he told journalists after emerging with his wife and dog from his 
house in Behlendorf in northern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was constantly a candidate for 20 years. That kept me  
young,'' he said in a later German radio interview. ``Now, old age 
is irrevocably starting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedish Academy cited Grass' first novel, ``The Tin Drum,''  
published in 1959, for ushering in a new era for German literature 
``after decades of linguistic and moral destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Here he comes to grips with the enormous task of reviewing  
contemporary history by recalling the disavowed and the forgotten: 
the victims, losers and lies that people wanted to forget because 
they had once believed in them,'' the academy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not too audacious to assume that `The Tin Drum' will  
become one of the enduring literary works of the 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Combining naturalistic detail with fantastical images and  
events, Grass established his reputation with ``The Tin Drum,'' 
``Cat and Mouse'' and ``Dog Years,'' published between 1959 and 
1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Collectively known as The Danzig Trilogy, the novels captured  
the German reaction to the rise of Nazism, the horrors of war and 
the guilt that lingered in the aftermath of Adolf Hitler's regime. 
</P>
<P>
	German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder praised Grass today as a  
``competent critic of society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All Germans are celebrating with him,'' said Schroeder, who  
learned of the honor while on an official visit to the Czech 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Nadine Gordimer, the South African who won the 1991 literature  
prize, praised this year's selection. ``It's about time,'' she 
said, calling Grass one of the great writers of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	``His writing had a great political significance, especially in  
the renaissance of Germany after the World War. He never failed to 
confront Germans with what they did, but always with a great sense 
of the vitality that was in the people and still is there,'' she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerging from a group of postwar writers seeking a new beginning  
from German literature after the Third Reich, Grass has chronicled 
the Nazi era, the difficult years of postwar reconstruction, the 
social upheavals of the 1960s and German unification in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass and other German writers of his generation are criticized  
in a recent book, ``The Language of Silence,'' by Ernestine 
Schlant, a professor of German and comparative literature at New 
Jersey's Montclair State University. Schlant, the German-born wife 
of Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley, says the 
writers' books virtually ignore the Holocaust and experiences of 
Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	Famous since ``The Tin Drum,'' Grass consistently used his  
position to speak out on political issues with a leftist bent. 
</P>
<P>
	When communist East Germany merged with the West in 1990, Grass  
looked on warily. ``Capitalism has never been more barbaric, 
beastlike than after the victory over the communist system,'' he 
once said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass gave his view on German unification in ``A Broad Field,''  
giving the Stasi -- the dreaded East German secret police -- a 
prominent role in the book. But many critics said Grass had let 
down the nation by failing to produce the great, sweeping 
``unification novel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Grass called the then conservative German government's  
policies on refugees and asylum-seekers ``democratically covered 
barbarism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Academy secretary Horace Engdahl, who announced the prize, said  
the academy ignored Grass' controversial nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fact, Guenter Grass has been surrounded by storms fairly  
often,'' he said. ``This (reunification) was perhaps the worst 
storm, but we don't take those things into consideration. We sit 
down and read the book, and the book is darn good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he remains politically outspoken, Grass seems to have  
mellowed in recent years. To some, his sweeping look back in his 
book ``My Century,'' published this year, suggests an author coming 
to peace with the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass is the fifth consecutive European to win the prize and  
Germany's seventh Nobel literature laureate. The last was Heinrich 
Boell in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	The literature prize has been given to writers with worldviews  
stretching from the bleak futility of Samuel Beckett's works to the 
vivid epics of Iceland's Halldor Laxness. The prize even has gone 
occasionally to writers who did not work in fiction or poetry, 
notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand Russell. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Saramago of Portugal, a nonconformist with a soft spot for  
the common man, was last year's laureate. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the Nobel Prize in medicine is to be announced  
Monday, the physics and chemistry winners on Tuesday, the economics 
laureate on Wednesday and the peace prize on Oct. 15. All the prize 
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize, which 
is given in Oslo, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf will present the prizes, this year  
worth $960,000, on Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement was a slight break from tradition. The  
academy usually names the literature winner on a Thursday in 
October. The early announcement indicated the academy was solidly 
behind Grass. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was an easy choice,'' Engdahl said. ``He has a lot to say  
and his writing carries great weight. He won the love of the 
academy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The academy, founded in 1786, has 18 members, although one spot  
is vacant and three members don't participate. Academy members, 
former recipients and a select group of literature and language 
professors and specialists in the field may suggest candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nobel Prizes are funded by a trust set up in the will of  
Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. Nobel 
said the literature prize should recognize an author whose work 
moves in an ``ideal direction'' without specifying exactly what he 
meant.

looked on warily. ``Capitalism has never been more barbaric, 
beastlike than after the victory over the communist system,'' he 
once said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass gave his view on German unification in ``A Broad Field,''  
giving the Stasi -- the dreaded East German secret police -- a 
prominent role in the book. But many critics said Grass had let 
down the nation by failing to produce the great, sweeping 
``unification novel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Grass called the then conservative German government's  
policies on refugees and asylum-seekers ``democratically covered 
barbarism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Academy secretary Horace Engdahl, who announced the prize, said  
the academy ignored Grass' controversial nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fact, Guenter Grass has been surrounded by storms fairly  
often,'' he said. ``This (reunification) was perhaps the worst 
storm, but we don't take those things into consideration. We sit 
down and read the book, and the book is darn good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he remains politically outspoken, Grass seems to have  
mellowed in recent years. To some, his sweeping look back in his 
book ``My Century,'' published this year, suggests an author coming 
to peace with the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass is the fifth consecutive European to win the prize and  
Germany's seventh Nobel literature laureate. The last was Heinrich 
Boell in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	The literature prize has been given to writers with worldviews  
stretching from the bleak futility of Samuel Beckett's works to the 
vivid epics of Iceland's Halldor Laxness. The prize even has gone 
occasionally to writers who did not work in fiction or poetry, 
notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand Russell. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Saramago of Portugal, a nonconformist with a soft spot for  
the common man, was last year's laureate. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the Nobel Prize in medicine is to be announced  
Monday, the physics and chemistry winners on Tuesday, the economics 
laureate on Wednesday and the peace prize on Oct. 15. All the prize 
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize, which 
is given in Oslo, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf will present the prizes, this year  
worth $960,000, on Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement was a slight break from tradition. The  
academy usually names the literature winner on a Thursday in 
October. The early announcement indicated the academy was solidly 
behind Grass. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was an easy choice,'' Engdahl said. ``He has a lot to say  
and his writing carries great weight. He won the love of the 
academy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The academy, founded in 1786, has 18 members, although one spot  
is vacant and three members don't participate. Academy members, 
former recipients and a select group of literature and language 
professors and specialists in the field may suggest candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nobel Prizes are funded by a trust set up in the will of  
Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. Nobel 
said the literature prize should recognize an author whose work 
moves in an ``ideal direction'' without specifying exactly what he 
meant.

<HEADLINE> MLS' Revolution Fires Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Coach Walter Zenga was fired Thursday by  
the New England Revolution with two games left in the regular 
season. He was replaced by Steve Nicol, who coached the Boston 
Bulldogs of the A League in Framingham. 
</P>
<P>
	Zenga, who took over as player-coach with six games left last  
season, led the Revolution to a 10-20-4 record this year. With two 
games left, New England trails Miami by one point for the last 
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Zenga has a 5-13 record as 
a goalkeeper and will not continue as a player with the Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Brian O'Donovan said Zenga didn't want to wait  
until the end of the season to discuss a contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``He also indicated to us that he had other options in Italy and  
needed to explore them immediately,'' O'Donovan said in a team 
statement. ``We received (Wednesday) a written ultimatum insisting 
that the team reach a decision. We would have preferred to evaluate 
fully the situation during the offseason and make our decision 
then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zenga, 39, named the world's best goalkeeper after the 1990  
World Cup, played that position for the Revolution in 1997. He then 
retired from the team and returned to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 23, 1998, he was named to replace Thomas Rongen, who was  
fired by the Revolution. Zenga led the Revolution to a 3-3 record 
last year and its first playoff berth ever.

<HEADLINE> Mazda Settles Clean Air Act Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mazda Motor of America Inc. agreed Thursday to  
pay a $900,000 penalty and to modify its reporting of emission 
control defects in order to settle allegations it violated the 
Clean Air Act, the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department and the Environmental Protection Agency filed the  
settlement in U.S. District Court here to resolve civil claims that 
Mazda, based in Irvine, Calif., failed to promptly report defective 
emission control devices in its MPV minivans. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement covers 226,000 MPV minivans in model years 1989  
through 1994. Their emission control devices have a part that can 
crack or break, emitting gasoline vapor into the atmosphere at a 
level substantially above EPA's standard, the government said. 
Passengers may detect a gasoline odor inside the car when the part 
fails. 
</P>
<P>
	The toxic emissions contain hydrocarbons, a component of ozone,  
which can aggravate respiratory problems such as asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prompt disclosure of emissions-related defects by automakers  
is critical to assuring the public that it is driving clean cars,'' 
said Lois J. Schiffer, assistant attorney general for environment 
and natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA regulations require automakers to file emissions defect  
reports with the agency within 15 days after learning of them in 25 
or more vehicles of the same model year. The government alleged 
Mazda knew of this defect years before it filed a report with the 
EPA in November 1996, preventing the agency from taking prompt 
action to fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to paying a penalty and changing its investigation  
and reporting of defects, Mazda also will extend the warranty on 
the defective part on all 1989 through 1994 MPV minivans to a total 
of 11 years, without any mileage limitation. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker will notify owners that they do not have to wait  
for the part to fail before having it replaced. Earlier, Mazda had 
notified them of a similar warranty extension as part of an 
agreement with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda also agreed to reimburse minivan owners who repaired a  
defective vapor separator at their own expense.

<HEADLINE> Final Candlestick Game Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- When the San Francisco Giants move downtown  
next season, leaving wind-swept Candlestick Park to the NFL's 
49ers, they'll take four decades of memories to the new stadium, 
and little else. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't miss the place,'' Giants senior vice president Pat  
Gallagher said. ``We had a lot of meetings to think about what we 
wanted to take from Candlestick to the new park, and we couldn't 
think of a thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few pitchers will miss a park in which popups blew over the  
outfield wall for homers. Neither will fans, who came to August 
games in ski jackets and gloves. 
</P>
<P>
	The lousy weather, which became a part of Candlestick lore  
almost from the day it opened in 1960, forced players to come up 
with survival strategies. They tried a variety of tricks to stay 
warm at Candlestick, where a perfectly nice day could suddenly 
become arctic as a cold fog descended on the park. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Murcer heated his bat in the Giants' clubhouse sauna  
before plate appearances. The Atlanta Braves hugged hot-water 
bottles in the dugout. Right fielders sometimes skipped into the 
clubhouse between innings for coffee, or whatever else they could 
find to ward off the cold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never got cold out here. I would make sure I had a lot of  
oil on me, like a swimmer. They could smell me on the bench,'' said 
Willie Mays, who wore heating balm on his back. 
</P>
<P>
	Mays had other ways of adapting to the weird weather. In fact,  
he used a simple formula for coping with the swirling winds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take two steps in and five steps back, and get the ball,'' he  
explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Candlestick, which had its final major league game today as the  
Giants faced the Los Angeles Dodgers, opened on April 12, 1960 -- 
two seasons after the Giants moved west from New York. Vice 
President Richard Nixon and Hall of Famer Ty Cobb presided over the 
opening ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Candlestick, now the fifth-oldest park in the majors, was home  
to Willie McCovey, Juan Marichal and Mays, who hit 203 homers there 
and undoubtedly would have hit many more if not for the gusts 
blowing in from left field. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the few opposing players who enjoyed Candlestick was San  
Diego's Tony Gwynn, whose 134 hits tie him for fifth among visitors 
to the park. Pete Rose tops the list with 201 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to miss it because Willie Mays is not going to play  
in the other park. This place has a lot of history,'' Gwynn said. 
``That's just a little disappointing, seeing a place where Willie 
Mays, Willie McCovey and Jim Ray Hart played not being used 
anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Candlestick was the site of the Beatles' final concert, on Aug.  
29, 1966. When the group took the stage behind second base, John 
Lennon's first words to the crowd were not surprising. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bit chilly,'' he complained.  
</P>
<P>
	The stadium survived the Oct. 17, 1989, earthquake that  
interrupted the World Series for 10 days. But one fan in Section 
51, atop the center-field stands, probably needed years of 
psychotherapy -- the 7.1 quake opened an expansion joint next to his 
seat, leaving him staring down 12 stories to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	About the only person in the ballpark who didn't immediately  
realize it was an earthquake was elevator operator Bob Goodman, who 
has been working at Candlestick since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``The elevator had been shaking all homestand. I was going up  
and it was shaking again that night, and I didn't think twice about 
it,'' he said. ``When I opened the door, it was the weirdest site I 
ever saw. The whole world was going back and forth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marichal was scheduled to throw out the ceremonial first pitch  
today. Mays was to throw the final pitch, after the Dodgers-Giants 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium was renamed 3Com Park in 1996, but almost no one  
called it that. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the 'Stick. It'll always be the 'Stick,'' Gallagher said.  
``That was the only good thing about the ballpark, the name.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- City officials have fired another round in their  
escalating fight with the Brooklyn Museum of Art, accusing the 
museum of displaying controversial work just to drive up its value. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusations made Wednesday by Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota and  
the city's top lawyer, Michael Hess, came a day after the museum 
sued to stop Mayor Rudolph Giuliani from freezing its funding over 
the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has threatened to cut city funding to the museum  
because of its decision to display an exhibit that includes a black 
Madonna decorated with elephant dung and pornographic cutouts. The 
funding amounts to $7 million, or about one-third of the museum's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The pieces are from advertising executive Charles Saatchi's  
collection. Lhota and Hess say the museum's board planned the 
``Sensation'' exhibition so the works would fetch high prices at 
auction once the show closes. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum's board members are ``shilling for a British subject  
who is a multimillionaire and trying to enhance his art 
collection,'' Lhota said. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited a New York Observer article which said that after the  
show closed in London, Saatchi auctioned 128 pieces from his 
collection, many of them by artists in the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, on a fund-raising trip in California, said he has been  
in touch with Lhota and Hess about their accusations. He said the 
project raises the question whether a publicly funded museum should 
engage in ``shock commercialization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andree Corroon, a spokeswoman for Christie's, which is helping  
sponsor the show, said the auction house had no plans for an 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bewildering accusation has absolutely no substance, is  
absolutely not true,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the museum called the accusations ``preposterous  
and misleading.'' The show opens Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a federal judge has been asked to decide whether to  
restore the museum's funding. The museum sued the city on Tuesday, 
saying Giuliani's act violates the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the Senate agreed unanimously Wednesday to a  
non-binding measure calling for the withholding of federal funds 
from the museum unless it cancels the exhibit. Independent Sen. Bob 
Smith of New Hampshire said the museum has received $500,000 from 
the National Endowment for the Arts in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, singer David Bowie -- who recorded an audio tour  
for museum visitors -- joined leaders of major New York City museums 
in support of the Brooklyn Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sensation represents some of the best, worst but definitely  
most extreme of the high-profile work to have come out of Britain 
in the last 10 years or so,'' Bowie said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders of two dozen cultural institutions -- including the  
Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Modern Art -- signed a letter 
protesting the mayor's funding cut.

<HEADLINE> Former Michigan St. Player Acquitted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Former Michigan State basketball star  
Antonio Smith was acquitted Thursday of charges he broke a cooler 
door lock and stole a 40-ounce bottle of beer from a convenience 
store. 
</P>
<P>
	An East Lansing District Court jury deliberated for less than  
two hours before finding Smith, 23, innocent of larceny and 
malicious destruction of property less than $200. 
</P>
<P>
	A conviction could have resulted in a jail sentence of up to 90  
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said during the three-day trial that Smith and his  
former teammate, Mateen Cleaves, stole the bottle from a 7-Eleven 
cooler about 2 a.m. April 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Police pulled the two players over that morning after Smith's  
Ford Expedition matched the description of one reportedly involved 
in the theft. Jason Klein, another Michigan State player, and two 
women also were in the vehicle. Arrest warrants were issued June 2 
against Smith and Cleaves. 
</P>
<P>
	During closing arguments, Smith's attorney, Frank Reynolds,  
argued the prosecution never proved there was a robbery. Two 
7-Eleven employees testified they had no inventory recorded to 
determine if the bottle was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the 911 tape, in which an anonymous caller tipped police to  
a robbery, indicated a crime may have been committed, Reynolds 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Assistant Prosecutor Joe Finnerty told the jury his case was  
strong, with testimony from a witness who saw Smith break the lock 
at the convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
	Finnerty had no comment following the verdict. Ingham County  
Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings did not return phone calls seeking 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquittal was a relief for Smith, who said he was on edge  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to work out and couldn't concentrate,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the Spartans third-leading career rebounder, completed  
his college eligibility in March. He said Thursday he is headed to 
New York for a tryout with the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunnings III dropped a larceny charge against Cleaves, 22, last  
week because a key witness was out of the country. Charges against 
Cleaves could be refiled if the witness returns.

<HEADLINE> Teen Gets Life in Torture Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- A 16-year-old boy was sentenced to life in  
prison Thursday for masterminding a plot that led to the brutal 
beating, torture and death of a 15-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirill Varnovatyy was bludgeoned and stabbed 27 times before  
Aaron Goldfarb slashed his throat with a switchblade knife taken 
from the victim, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The torture and terror that Mr. Varnovatyy experienced is  
unimaginable,'' Maryland Circuit Court Judge Nelson W. Rupp Jr. 
said 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 7, 1998, Varnovatyy thought he was going to Quince  
Orchard Valley Park in Gaithersburg, Md., to smoke cigarettes and 
drink beer, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records indicate he pleaded for his life during a series  
of attacks on several isolated acres of parkland. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went out with people that he thought were his friends and  
they killed him,'' prosecutor Katherine Winfree said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Goldfarb blamed Varnovatyy for arranging a deal for  
phony drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Philip Morrongiello, 20, and Zachary Smith Marshall, 16,  
both pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the case. They are 
to be sentenced in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Morrongiello and Marshall admitted beating Varnovatyy,  
prosecutors say it was Goldfarb who wielded the knife that severed 
his victim's carotid artery and jugular vein, and perforated his 
trachea. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldfarb pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in June. Because  
he was 15 at the time of the crime, he was ineligible for the death 
penalty. Prosecutors said Goldfarb could be eligible for parole in 
25 years with the governor's consent. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is not a monster, he is the boy next door,'' Cheryl  
Etchison said in a tearful plea for leniency for her son. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldfarb allegedly was the victim of sexual abuse that began  
when he was 5. A psychiatrist testified that Goldfarb also suffers 
from drug and alcohol abuse and depression.

<HEADLINE> Govt Lawyer in Microsoft Case Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the two government lawyers who  
questioned Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates in videotaped testimony 
that proved embarrassing during the company's antitrust trial has 
quit his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Houck resigned unexpectedly earlier this week from the  
New York attorney general's office. He had led the courtroom fight 
against Microsoft for the 19 states suing the software giant along 
with the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Houck, whose decision comes just weeks before the judge's  
initial verdict is expected, also delivered part of the 
government's closing arguments to the judge last week. 
</P>
<P>
	His decision was not expected to affect the trial's outcome  
because New York and the other states still are pursuing their 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Houck did not return messages left at his office.  
</P>
<P>
	Houck never achieved the prominence during the 77-day trial that  
was afforded the Justice Department's high-profile litigator, David 
Boies. Houck questioned only one of the 26 trial witnesses, IBM 
executive John Soyring, who also was from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	When Houck sought an expanded role early in the case -- asking a  
question during testimony from the first witness -- the judge 
snapped at him harshly, reminding him that only one lawyer from the 
government was allowed to question each witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Houck was perhaps best known for his strong views that Microsoft  
should face the severest penalties for its alleged antitrust 
violations. On the final day of testimony, he told reporters the 
company was a ``malignant despot'' and that its behavior ``will 
justify a very significant remedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houck was the only lawyer, besides Boies, to question Gates  
during a sworn videotaped deposition over three days last year. 
Shown at trial, excerpts from the tape of Gates professing to 
forget key events and appearing to evade questions proved highly 
embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
	Houck mentioned the Gates tape again during closing arguments  
last week when he said the judge ``plainly has seen enough of Mr. 
Gates' videotaped deposition to make your own findings'' about his 
truthfulness. 
</P>
<P>
	A Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, declined to comment on  
Houck's resignation. ``He has not applied for a job in (Microsoft) 
law and corporate affairs,'' Cullinan quipped in response to a 
question. 
</P>
<P>
	Houck was the head of the antitrust office for New York's  
attorney general until last year's election, when Democrat Eliot 
Spitzer defeated the incumbent and replaced Houck with Harry First.

<HEADLINE> Hispanic College Attendance Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of young Hispanics are qualified for  
college but never attend, often becoming stuck in dead-end, 
low-paying jobs, according to a study released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by the Educational Testing Service -- the firm which  
produces the SAT test -- said 22 percent of Hispanics ages 18 to 24 
attend college, compared with 32 percent of the general population 
of that age group. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing that gap would produce 430,000 more Hispanic college  
students and more than 100,000 more Hispanic college graduates, the 
study said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have the makings of a huge problem, a tragedy,'' said  
Antonio Flores, president of the Hispanic Association of Colleges 
and Universities, a partner with ETS in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Those with college experience and degrees could then get  
higher-paying jobs, said the study's author, ETS researcher Anthony 
Carnevale. Hispanic workers currently are concentrated in 
lower-paying jobs that require less education, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hispanic workers are competing against others, but they aren't  
as well-armed in the competition for jobs,'' Carnevale said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that Hispanics from an early age have lower  
expectations of attending college. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 55 percent of Hispanic eighth-graders expect to go to  
college, compared with 64 percent of blacks, 72 percent of Asians 
and 68 percent of non-Hispanic whites, Carnevale said. 
</P>
<P>
	National tests show Hispanic students lag two years behind  
whites in math, he said. Thirty-four percent of Hispanic 
15-year-olds in 1996 had not reached 10th grade, compared with 28 
percent of whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those Hispanic students who do go to college, 64 percent  
attend community colleges or less competitive universities, the 
study said. Half of non-Hispanic white students, 42 percent of 
Asian students and 65 percent of black students attend those types 
of colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents can help by telling their children they expect them to  
go to college, the study said. More than three-quarters of students 
with risk factors such as low incomes or poor grades went to 
college if their parents expected them to go, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics themselves need to become more involved in pushing for  
better schools and more college opportunities, said Rep. Ruben 
Hinojosa, D-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to stop being passive in the world of education,''  
Hinojosa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinojosa and other Democrats who joined Carnevale at a Capitol  
news conference said the study showed that the government needs to 
do more to ensure that Hispanics are successful in school and able 
to go on to college. Many Hispanics attend sub-par elementary and 
high schools, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the lower-income neighborhoods, in the barrios, if you  
will, is where the worst teachers are,'' said Rep. Matthew 
Martinez, D-Calif., a member of the House Committee on Education 
and the Workforce. 
</P>
<P>
	The study recommends a number of ways to boost Hispanic college  
enrollment, including increasing financial aid programs, expanding 
college affirmative action programs and enhancing bilingual 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	Those programs are part of the problem, not part of the  
solution, said Jorge Amselle, the vice president for education of 
the Center for Equal Opportunity, a Washington group that opposes 
bilingual education and affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Talk about having to be completely proficient in the English  
language, I can't think of a tougher test than the verbal portion 
of the SAT,'' said Amselle. ``For them (ETS) to say that more 
bilingual education is going to get you there is completely absurd. 
If anything, Hispanics are going to do worse on the SAT if there is 
more bilingual education.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Higher; Dow Up 82.00 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mostly higher today as a  
government report of slower economic growth in the second quarter 
raised hopes that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest 
rates next week. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was up 82.00 at 10,295.48. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 4.25 at 1,272.62, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
down 4.73 at 2,725.54. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks rose after the Commerce Department reported that the U.S.  
economy, weighted down by record trade deficits, saw growth slow to 
an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the spring, the slowest rate of 
expansion in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The report provided a bit of relief for investors who have  
driven stocks lower in the sessions ahead of the Fed's Oct. 5 
meeting on interest rates. In a bid to cool the economy's sizzling 
growth, the Fed has raised rates twice this year and suggested it 
would do so again if signs of inflation crept into the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report today, the Labor Department said the number  
of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week rose by 
25,000 to 299,000, reflecting the impact of Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Claims below 300,000 are considered a sign of an extremely tight  
labor market. Many economists believe the Fed will consider the 
labor shortage in its debate on interest rates, as companies spend 
heavily to attract and retain skilled workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq's relative weakness came from some of its major  
technology names. Amazon.com slipped 1 3/8 to 79 3/8 after rising sharply 
on Wednesday. Intel fell 1 3/8 to 73 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-4 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 115.98 million 
shares, well ahead of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index rose 1.63 to 423.15.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.9 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.2 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> French Locate Seizure Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	French scientists have identified a gene associated with the  
kind of brain seizure that killed Olympic sprinter Florence 
Griffith Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulty copies of the gene, known as CCM1, are responsible for  
the development of tangled blood vessels in the brain known as 
cavernous angiomas, according to a study by three laboratories in 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The abnormality is found in one in every 40 Americans, and the  
condition is inherited in half of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In most cases, these tangles remain quite small for many years,  
making them hard to find even with sophisticated imaging equipment 
and risky to remove. Eventually, the tangles swell and engulf more 
of the brain. Without surgery, they trigger seizures, paralysis and 
potentially fatal strokes, often with little warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said understanding CCM1 may lead to early testing  
and treatments for cavernous angiomas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Often, the first clinical sign of the disease is a stroke or  
death,'' said geneticist Doug Marchuk of Duke University, a member 
of an American research team that has also linked CCM1 with the 
brain lesions and will release its study next month. ``A DNA test 
should be readily available. If you know who is at risk, you can 
aggressively treat them early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy showed that Ms. Griffith Joyner died in her sleep a  
year ago at 38 from a seizure triggered as a result of cavernous 
angioma. The Olympic gold medalist had a history of seizures in the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is unknown whether she had, in fact, a bad copy of the  
CCM1 gene and suffered from the inherited form of the brain lesions 
</P>
<P>
	On June 13, Houston Astros manager Larry Dierker suffered a  
violent seizure during a baseball game. Surgeons removed a 
cavernous angioma, and he returned to the dugout a month later. 
</P>
<P>
	In the French study, researcher Elisabeth Tournier-Lasserve and  
others examined unrelated patients from 20 families with histories 
of cavernous angiomas, including a high frequency of multiple 
lesions. CCM1 mutations were found in 12 of the patients. The 
results appear in the October issue of the journal Nature Genetics. 
</P>
<P>
	In the U.S. study, 16 of 21 Mexican-American families were found  
to share the mutation. Their report will be published in the 
November issue of Human Molecular Genetics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until now, little has been known about the molecular  
mechanisms leading to these lesions,'' said geneticist Mikka 
Vikkula of Catholic University in Belgium. ``Identifying the 
causative gene and the kinds of mutations it contains allows us to 
start thinking of completely new ways of treating the disorder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither study answered several lingering questions about CCM1,  
including whether the gene is implicated in non-inherited forms of 
the disease.

<HEADLINE>  McGwire, Sosa To Go Head-to-Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Just like in the movies, the sequel to the  
great home run derby will try to top the original. It may not quite 
surpass it, but it will come close. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire vs. Sosa, man to man, face to face.  
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs wind up the season with  
a three-game series starting Friday night that would be totally 
meaningless except for the home run title at stake. The Cardinals 
are 11 games below .500, and the Cubs had only three more victories 
than Sammy Sosa has homers entering Thursday night's game in 
Philadelphia, yet there's no denying a certain electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those miracle coincidences that both these guys  
are playing the last three games of the season against each 
other,'' Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. ``What a treat for 
our fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs manager Jim Riggleman isn't nearly as intrigued. After the  
Cubs lost their 94th game of the season, 2-1 to the Phillies on 
Thursday night, Riggleman lost his patience with the home-run hype. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the game of the week,'' said Riggleman, whose job is  
widely speculated to be in jeopardy. ``Yet the Mets, Cincinnati and 
Houston are fighting for a playoff spot. Why are we the game of the 
week? I'm embarrassed by it. To me, an adjustment needs to be made, 
and I think Sammy and Mark would agree. If they go 0-for-3, they're 
still getting bombarded after the game, and that makes no sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire took the lead for the first time since Aug. 18 when  
he hit Nos. 62 and 63 in a doubleheader sweep of the San Diego 
Padres Wednesday night. He has homered in each of the last four 
games, although he insists his charge has absolutely nothing to do 
with wanting to top Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever wins this home run title, we're both over 60 home  
runs,'' McGwire said. ``So nobody loses, right? 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no `I want to beat him, he wants to beat me.' That's  
not going on, but I know the press is trying to get it going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, who was ahead 55-51 entering September, had a 30 at-bat  
homer drought this month and was one behind heading into Thursday 
night's game in Philadelphia. He was the first player to hit 60 in 
consecutive seasons and the first to beat Roger Maris' 1961 record 
of 61 in consecutive seasons, but just like last year he's trailing 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not Superman. I'm human, just like everybody else,'' Sosa  
said. ``I'm allowed to struggle sometimes. I'm allowed to go longer 
without hitting a home run sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Busch Stadium figures to have at least a semblance of the  
atmosphere during McGwire's record 70-homer season from 1998, with 
the series sold out for months. The scene may more closely resemble 
the lower-key setting for McGwire's 500th career homer last month, 
however, when 50 or 60 outside media requests were filled, instead 
of the 700 or so during the Maris chase at the height of 
McGwire-mania. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what you get with a sequel.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was totally different; last year was a record,''  
McGwire said. ``Here, everybody is talking about a home run title, 
which up until this last year nobody ever talked about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who had 65 homers with three games to go last year,  
believes fans are disappointed there won't be another challenge to 
the record. 
</P>
<P>
	``People, I think, are spoiled from what we've done last year,''  
McGwire said. ``They constantly want more, more, more. It's hard to 
comprehend that what we've done this year is harder than what we 
did last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa echoed those sentiments.  
</P>
<P>
	``The people expect us to go out there and hit a home run every  
at-bat,'' Sosa said. ``They have to understand that we don't play 
by ourselves, there's a guy out there trying to get me out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa has said several times that McGwire's encore is perhaps  
more impressive than his record-setting season, because it would be 
natural for most players to relax after such an achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, with me, no,'' McGwire said. ``I'm just speaking for  
myself, but I would never allow that to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said he's been more mentally weary this year than  
last year, mostly because the Cardinals are winding up another 
disappointing season, and can't wait for it all to end. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also been stung by criticism that 50 home runs isn't such a  
notable accomplishment, noting that only he and Sosa have done it 
the last two years. Ken Griffey Jr., who had 48 and could do it 
three straight years, was the only other player in striking 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I can't understand is people can't accept what's  
happening, they always have to find a reason why it's happening,'' 
McGwire said. ``There's no reason; it's just happening. So accept 
it. Enjoy the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has a combined three homers in 26 at-bats against the  
Cubs' three scheduled starters, Jon Lieber, Andrew Lorraine and 
Steve Trachsel. Trachsel has surrendered two homers in 15 at-bats, 
including McGwire's 62nd last year, Lieber has allowed one homer in 
10 at-bats and Lorraine has walked and struck out McGwire in his 
only two appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa has only one home run in 25 at-bats against the Cardinals'  
scheduled starters. He's 3-for-15 with one homer against Mark 
Thompson, the Cardinals' starter on Friday, 1-for-5 with no homers 
against Garrett Stephenson and 1-for-5 with no homers against Larry 
Luebbers, who gets the call on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Declares War on a Painting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has gotten high marks for  
clean parks, low crime and clearing X-rated stores out of Times 
Square. But now he's declared war on a painting, and not everyone 
is cheering. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has said he will cut all city funding to the Brooklyn  
Museum of Art over its decision to display a black Madonna 
decorated with elephant dung and pornographic cutouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Catholic Church is on his side, but the arts community and  
prominent people including his likely opponent in the 2000 Senate 
race, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and First Amendment lawyer Floyd 
Abrams -- who is representing the Brooklyn institution -- think the 
mayor should keep his hands off the city's museums. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders of two dozen city museums and cultural institutions  
-- including the Metropolitan Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, the 
Whitney Museum and the Guggenheim -- have signed a letter protesting 
the mayor's funding cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the museum gets the money -- $7 million, or about  
one-third of its budget -- restored is now up to a federal judge. On 
Tuesday, the museum sued, saying Giuliani's act violates the First 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the Supreme Court ruled that government may exercise a  
``decency standard'' for funding the arts. But Abrams said the 
decision also ``made quite clear that a city cannot manipulate the 
funding process in an effort to coerce people into shutting up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved a non-binding measure Wednesday saying the  
museum should not get federal funds unless it cancels the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	``People can do what they want to do and they can draw what they  
want to draw,'' said New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, an independent 
who sponsored the measure. But he added: ``The government doesn't 
have to fund this garbage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his Sunday sermon, Cardinal John O'Connor, who heads the New  
York Archdiocese, deemed the work an ``attack on religion.'' The 
next day, Mrs. Clinton said it was wrong to ``penalize and punish 
an institution such as the Brooklyn Museum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The British show featuring ``The Holy Virgin Mary'' -- called  
``Sensation'' -- opens Saturday. The ticket agent for the show would 
not comment on sales and the museum did not return calls Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia University art history professor James Beck said the  
controversy over the elephant dung painting ``could be the 
beginning of a public debate about the role of government in art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, the National Endowment for the Arts was  
nearly shut down by conservatives in Congress outraged that it had 
given grants for works like Robert Mapplethorpe's homoerotic art 
and Andres Serrano's photograph of a crucifix immersed in urine. 
The stir over the NEA led to the Supreme Court ruling on decency. 
</P>
<P>
	Average New Yorkers are divided, and some out-of-towners are  
intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a lot of people say, `Why aren't we going to  
Brooklyn?''' said Lisa Hahn, president of Art Horizons, which plans 
cultural tours of New York City for museum staffs from all over the 
world. ``I hadn't put it on everybody's schedule. But I've had 
people call me and say, `Do we have enough free time to get out 
there?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Fitzgerald sided with Giuliani. ``It's a disgrace,'' he  
said, referring to the Virgin Mary painting. ``I'm a Catholic and I 
think this is an offense against Catholics and all religions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damien Hirst, whose display of bisected animals pickled in  
formaldehyde is also part of the show, said Wednesday that the 
mayor ``may as well say `I only like Picasso and if you don't show 
it then I'm going to cut your funding.' It's just pure 
censorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Ofili, a Catholic who created the Virgin Mary painting,  
was more oblique, telling The New York Times: ``The people who are 
attacking this painting are attacking their own interpretation, not 
mine.''

<HEADLINE> Former CEO Pleads in Price-Fix Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former executive of the world's largest  
producer of graphite electrodes agreed Wednesday to plead guilty 
and serve 17 months in jail for fixing prices of a key steel-making 
component. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Krass, former president, chairman and chief executive  
officer of UCAR International Inc., also agreed to pay a $1.25 
million fine, the Justice Department said. He filed his plea in the 
U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Krass is the second executive of UCAR, based in Nashville,  
Tenn., to agree to a fine and time in jail to settle charges of 
conspiring to fix prices in the graphite electrodes market. Last 
week, UCAR's former senior vice president and chief operating 
officer, Robert Hart, pleaded guilty for his part in the conspiracy 
and agreed to pay a $1 million fine and serve a nine-month jail 
term. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Romanowski Fined $10,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Denver Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski has been  
fined 
</P>
<P>
	$10,000 for a late hit to Tampa Bay quarterback Trent Dilfer.  
</P>
<P>
	The third-quarter hit came Sunday after Dilfer released a pass.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised,'' Broncos defensive coordinator Greg Robinson  
said Wednesday when he learned of the fine, the second for 
Romanowski in as many weeks. ``I guess the cameras are on Bill at 
all times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski received a $5,000 fine for a hit on Kansas City tight  
end Tony Gonzalez on Sept. 19, an NFL source told the Denver Post. 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't penalized for either offense during the game. However,  
upon studying the videotapes, the NFL ruled the Broncos linebacker 
struck Dilfer with his helmet and that he used unnecessary 
roughness against Gonzalez, hitting the Chiefs' tight end in the 
neck and head. 
</P>
<P>
	The league is known to treat multiple infractions with increased  
fines, which could help explain the $5,000 hike between fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski has appealed the first fine and is expected to the do  
same with Wednesday's $10,000 fine. He could not be reached for 
comment, but is expected to comment today on whether he thinks they 
were warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	Fines are nothing new to Romanowski.  
</P>
<P>
	During the 1997 season, he compiled $27,500 worth of fines --  
$20,000 for a helmet-to-helmet hit that broke the jaw of former 
Carolina quarterback Kerry Collins, and a $7,500 fine for spitting 
on San Francisco wide receiver J.J. Stokes. NFL officials also did 
not penalize Romanowski for either of those plays.

<HEADLINE> Pet Safety in Cars Becomes Focus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) -- People are treating their pets more like  
family members these days, taking them on the road for quick jaunts 
to the market or out for joyrides. 
</P>
<P>
	Some automakers and pet supply companies are taking notice --  
offering seat belts and other restraints so animals can go along 
for the ride safely. 
</P>
<P>
	A Wisconsin company sells harnesses for dogs to be strapped to a  
seat belt, while two automakers, Saab Car USA and Ford Motor Co., 
are introducing cars that offer ways to safeguard pets in case of 
an accident and keep drivers focused on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are seeing a lot more of these kinds of devices out in the  
marketplace,'' said Kathy Bausch, director of projects for the 
Humane Society of the United States, the nation's largest animal 
protection organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbey White, 39, of Oakland, Calif., routinely takes Poppy, her  
3 1/2-year-old yellow lab, on errands to the gas station, the post 
office or to a park for exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, Poppy sits or lies down in the passenger seat of  
White's station wagon, hooked to a seat belt by a harness. 
</P>
<P>
	White said she decided to buy the harness after she heard that  
the accident that injured best-selling author Stephen King was 
caused by a dog running loose in a minivan. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people have seat belts, why shouldn't animals?'' said  
White, who owns Abbie's Animal Care, a pet-sitting business. ``I 
really feel it is important to have pets tethered in the car and 
this is a great way to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile  
Manufacturers, a coalition of 11 car and light-truck manufacturers, 
said the industry's safety focus remains on humans because only 70 
percent of people routinely use seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	As for pets, ``It had to happen. We have all heard stories of  
dogs distracting drivers in vehicles,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential market is enormous. There are an estimated 40  
million to 70 million pet owners in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Saab recently did a survey of its customers and found that more  
than 60 percent of owners had dogs and traveled with them 
frequently, spokesman Steve Janisse said. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the Norcross, Ga.-based automaker began offering a  
line of supplies designed to make traveling with pets safer. 
</P>
<P>
	A new Saab wagon includes a standard cargo track also designed  
so a dog's leash can be hooked to it, allowing the dog some 
mobility but also restraining the pet, Janisse said. Since April, 
Saab has sold about 1,200 of the new wagons and 60 buyers bought 
the $49.95 VersaLeash for the cargo track, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also sells a $19.95 belt for strapping a dog to a  
seat belt, some 500 of which have been sold, Janisse said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later this year, Ford is making a ``pet package'' available for  
buyers of its new Focus subcompact. The feature includes a pet 
safety belt, insulated tip-resistant water bowl and other products 
designed to make travel for pets more convenient and comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realized a lot of our customers are pet owners and we  
wanted to address their needs,'' said Julie Roehm, Focus Brand 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The pet package is expected to sell for less than $200, she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterinarians have been preaching pet safety belts for years,  
said Martin Smith, a veterinarian and co-owner of Doctors Foster &AMP; 
Smith, a northern Wisconsin mail-order company that publishes a 
160-page catalog with thousands of products for pet owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster &AMP; Smith, headquartered in Rhinelander, sells a $9.99  
harness that allows a dog to be strapped to a seat belt in any 
vehicle. The company sells 14,500 of the harnesses annually, 
promoting them as a way to protect pets in case of an accident and 
as a way to make sure drivers stay focused on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he has treated hundreds of dogs who where injured  
when they jumped out of open car windows or were hurled about 
inside the cab in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	He has also has seen first hand the trouble an untethered pet  
can cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Several years ago, at his veterinary clinic in Minocqua, a car  
crashed through a wall and into the waiting room because a golden 
retriever puppy climbed behind the brake pedal as the car arrived 
at the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	The harnesses aren't just for dogs.  
</P>
<P>
	Barb Wargo, 51, of Southbury, Conn., has a seat-belt harness so  
her black cat Sooty can ride safely in the passenger seat of her 
BMW convertible and not jump out when she takes him for joy rides. 
</P>
<P>
	The charter trip didn't go too well.  
</P>
<P>
	``He meowed a lot. He was unhappy,'' Wargo said. ``He doesn't  
like the harness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Wargo was undeterred. ``I don't think it is silly,'' she  
said. ``I love my cat.''

<HEADLINE> German Wins Nobel in Literature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Novelist Guenter Grass, Germany's  
best-known writer of the post-World War II generation, won the 1999 
Nobel Prize in literature today. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement brought a smile from the 71-year-old author.  
``I'm happy,'' he told journalists after emerging with his wife and 
dog from his house in Behlendorf in northern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedish Academy cited Grass' first novel, ``The Tin Drum,''  
published in 1959, for ushering in a new era for German literature 
``after decades of linguistic and moral destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Here he comes to grips with the enormous task of reviewing  
contemporary history by recalling the disavowed and the forgotten: 
the victims, losers and lies that people wanted to forget because 
they had once believed in them. ...,'' the academy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not too audacious to assume that `The Tin Drum' will  
become one of the enduring literary works of the 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Combining naturalistic detail with fantastical images and  
events, Grass established his reputation with ``The Tin Drum,'' 
``Cat and Mouse'' and ``Dog Years,'' published between 1959 and 
1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Collectively known as The Danzig Trilogy, the novels captured  
the German reaction to the rise of Nazism, the horrors of war and 
the guilt that lingered in the aftermath of Adolf Hitler's regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass is the fifth consecutive European to win the prize and  
Germany's seventh Nobel literature laureate. 
</P>
<P>
	He is a heralded social critic, admired by his literary  
contemporaries but also controversial because of his political 
views. He argued against the speedy reunification of East and West 
Germany in 1990. In 1997, he called the then conservative German 
government's refugee and asylum policies ``democratically covered 
barbarism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedish Academy noted the award is for Grass' body of work,  
including his most recent novel, ``My Century,'' which came out 
this year. Academy secretary Horace Engdahl, who made the 
announcement, said the academy didn't take into account Grass' 
controversial views. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Saramago of Portugal won last year's Nobel Prize in  
literature. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobel Prize winners receive their prizes, this year worth  
$960,000, on Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement of the 1999 literature prize was a break  
from tradition. The Swedish Academy usually names the winner on a 
Thursday in October. It did not say why the winner was announced 
sooner this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy, founded in 1786, has 18 members, although one spot  
is vacant and three members don't participate. Academy members, 
former recipients and a select group of literature and language 
professors and specialists in the field may suggest candidates.

<HEADLINE> Infant, Maternal Death Rates Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Touting what they called one of the century's  
most significant advances in public health, federal officials said 
Thursday that infant and maternal mortality rates have dropped by 
more than 90 percent since 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at the number of babies that have been saved  
during the 20th century, it's enormous,'' said Dr. Solomon Iyasu of 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of 
Reproductive Health. ``At the beginning of the century, 10 percent 
of all babies were dying. Now it's less than 1 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rate of infants who die before age 1 went from 100 per 1,000  
live births in 1915 to less than 7.2 per 1,000 in 1997, marking a 
decline the CDC said was unparalleled by other mortality reductions 
this century. 
</P>
<P>
	At the turn of the 20th century, six to nine out of every 1,000  
women died of pregnancy-related complications. The rate was less 
than .1 per 1,000 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Early efforts to combat infant mortality focused on improving  
living conditions in urban areas, such as establishing safe 
drinking water and sewage and trash disposal. Rising standards of 
living, educational levels and access to health care also 
contributed to the decline. In addition, women started having fewer 
children and spacing them further apart. 
</P>
<P>
	But there wasn't much decline in maternal mortality rates during  
the first three decades of the century, until health care providers 
shifted their focus from infant health problems to a more holistic 
approach that included the mother, Iyasu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Delivery practices were the main factor in the high deaths among  
pregnant women -- most births were in the home and obstetrics was a 
specialty was shunned by many physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	The death rate began decreasing during the 1930s and 1940s with  
the introduction of penicillin and other antibiotics along with the 
availability of safer blood supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The declines slowed during the 1950s and early 1960s, primarily  
because of inadequate programs to reduce deaths among children who 
were born premature or with a low birthweight. The CDC said 
Medicaid and other federal programs implemented during the late 
1960s helped reverse that. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1990s, the downward trend continued as cases of  
sudden infant death syndrome dropped 50 percent after parents were 
urged to place sleeping infants on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is that the infant mortality rate and the  
maternal mortality rate has declined for all groups during the 
century but there is still a gap that we need to concentrate on,'' 
Iyasu said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example: Black infants are more than twice as likely to die  
than whites and black women are more than three times as likely to 
die as a result of pregnancy-related complications than whites.

<HEADLINE> Senior PGA Player Kiefer Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Jack Kiefer, a two-time winner on  
the Senior PGA Tour who was diagnosed last year with cancer in his 
spinal cord, has died. He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service for Kiefer will be at Tanglewood Park, site  
of the Senior Tour's Vantage Championship in Clemmons, N.C., after 
the first round on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiefer, who died Sept. 24 at his home in Stuart, Fla., won the  
1994 Ralphs Senior Classic and the 1997 du Maurier Champions, when 
he finished 16th on the money list. He played 12 events in 1998 
before he was diagnosed with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the senior tour in 1990 after finishing second in  
Q-school, and had the reputation as an ironman for playing at least 
30 tournaments a year every season except 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiefer, born Jan. 1, 1940 in Columbia, Pa., was a pitcher for  
Millersville State College in 1961, and his knuckleball earned him 
a contract with the Detroit Tigers. But after three days in camp, 
he left baseball and took up golf. 
</P>
<P>
	He turned professional in 1967. He was inducted two years ago  
into the New Jersey PGA Hall of Fame. Kiefer won the New Jersey 
State Open three times. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiefer is survived by his wife, Jan, and a daughter, Jennifer.

<HEADLINE> New Steel Group To Be Named Corus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The group formed by the recent merger of British  
Steel PLC and Dutch metals producer Koninklijke Hoogovens NV is to 
be named Corus, the companies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly merged group was initially called BSKH. Corus has no  
specific meaning but is meant to be a name with international 
appeal, British Steel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corus would have its headquarters in London and 66,000 employees  
worldwide. Its shares are to start trading next Wednesday on stock 
exchanges in London, Amsterdam and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	European Union regulators approved the planned $6.24 billion  
merger in July. The merger, which would create Europe's largest 
steelmaker, has been approved by shareholders and financial 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The last body still to give its nod to the deal, Britain's High  
Court of Justice, is expected to do so on Monday, British Steel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The British company, which has sales nearly double those of its  
Dutch partner, would have a 62 percent share in the new group. 
Hoogovens would control the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company would rank as the world's third-biggest  
steel manufacturer with annual sales worth $14.8 billion.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Nations Still Face Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Southeast Asian countries, while recovering  
from the recent financial crisis, still face huge economic and 
political challenges, Singapore's prime minister said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong warned that foreign investment in  
most Southeast Asian countries has remained weak, and that banks 
have remained wary about extending new loans to businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite improvements, I would caution against any hasty  
conclusion that things would only get better,'' Goh told economic 
ministers and officials from the ten-member Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	He was speaking at the opening of the 31st meeting of ASEAN  
economic ministers. The ministers will be discussing the region's 
economic and industrial cooperation through Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Goh also said the region's political stability will be a crucial  
factor in achieving the full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indonesia, the largest ASEAN member, with two-fifths of  
ASEAN's total population is in political transition,'' Goh said, 
adding that ``investors will be watching developments in Indonesia 
closely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia, the world's fourth most-populous nation, is facing  
numerous political upheavals: The territory of East Timor recently 
voted for independence and an electoral college is due to pick 
Indonesia's next head of state in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Goh urged ASEAN countries to continue to reform and liberalize  
their economies and implement various collective measures as an 
ASEAN group. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, ASEAN officials took a major step toward making  
the region a free trade area by reducing tariffs to a maximum of 5 
percent for various agricultural and manufacturing products by Jan. 
1 next year in six nations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Malaysia later urged ASEAN to postpone reducing tariffs on  
imported cars, although cars are among the products on the Jan. 1 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	ASEAN's ultimate goal is to make the region a ``zero tariff''  
trade area by 2015 for the six founding members, while remaining 
members Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia should join them by 
2018, officials said in a joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Goh urged the ministers to make a ``bold, collective effort to  
market ASEAN to the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What is clear is that ASEAN should act decisively now to seize  
the initiative to progress further,'' Goh said. ``This will place 
ASEAN in an advantageous position as we enter the next 
millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The members of ASEAN are Brunei, Burma, Indonesia, Laos,  
Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Reloaded Rangers: Ready To Roll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The New York Rangers, after going on a big free-agent shopping  
spree this year, will get to see if their investment will pay off 
as they open the NHL season tonight in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our expectations have to be higher,'' Adam Graves said ``We  
made some key additions. We put ourselves into position (to be more 
competitive).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers might not yet be the Dallas Stars, the defending  
Stanley Cup champions who open the season at home against 
Pittsburgh in the only other NHL game tonight. But they have spared 
no expense to put together a team that will at least compete for a 
playoff berth, spending a reported $67 million in contracts to six 
free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers have missed the playoffs for two straight seasons  
despite one of the highest payrolls in hockey, including the $5.5 
million paid to Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	With Gretzky retired and four of New York's defensemen gone from  
last year's team, the Rangers will have a dramatic new look for 
1999-00. Included among the new people are Theo Fleury, a 40-goal 
scorer who was the jewel of the free-agent crop. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers also landed forwards Valeri Kamensky and Tim Taylor,  
defensemen Stephane Quintal and Sylvain Lefebvre and goalie Kirk 
McLean in the free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers also re-signed All-Star defenseman Brian Leetch,  
keeping him from going into the free-agent market himself. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, New York shored up its defense further by acquiring  
veteran Kevin Hatcher from Pittsburgh for defenseman Peter 
Popovich. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played some good games (in the exhibition season) and I  
think we got a good feel how we have to play as a team in order to 
be successful,'' Fleury said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers had a 6-3-0 record in September.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're all a little unsure, but excited to get the season  
started and find out what's going to happen,'' Leetch said. ``When 
we get this many players coming from outside the organization. ... 
it's a lot of uncertainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers-Oilers game will include a special tribute to  
Gretzky, who played for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're fortunate to be there for a great night for a great  
man,'' Graves said, ``but we have to be ready to play. We have to 
make sure we're focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Oilers will stage a tribute to Gretzky, the Stars will  
be raising their Stanley Cup banner in Dallas. Last season, the 
Stars won their second straight President's Trophy for the top 
record in the NHL in addition to their first Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be hard to be as good as last year  
during the regular season,'' Guy Carbonneau said. ``The same goal 
is in our mind this year, but we know it'll be much harder because 
everybody wants to try to beat the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's games, it will be Carolina at Boston, Toronto at  
Montreal, Ottawa at Philadelphia, New Jersey at Atlanta, New York 
Islanders at Tampa Bay, Washington at Florida, Buffalo at Detroit, 
Phoenix at St. Louis, Los Angeles at Nashville, Anaheim at Dallas, 
the Rangers at Vancouver and Calgary at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey-Atlanta matchup will be the first game for the  
expansion Thrashers, played in their new Philips Arena. The 
Thrashers are the second expansion team in two years in the NHL, 
following the Nashville Predators last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look how Nashville played last year, they were in every  
game, and we want to be there, also,'' Thrashers captain Kelly 
Buchberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams were still trying to fine-tune their rosters on the eve of  
opening night. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver signed free agent defenseman Ed Jovanovski; Calgary  
traded defenseman Todd Simpson to Florida for left wing Bill 
Lindsay; Edmonton re-signed defenseman Roman Hamrlik; St. Louis 
claimed defenseman Todd Reirden off waivers from Edmonton, and 
Dallas claimed forward Chris Murray off waivers from Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Bengals' Season Hits Turbulence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Coach Bruce Coslet won't talk about the move  
that's got the Cincinnati Bengals' dressing room buzzing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ki-Jana Carter? He's miffed that no one talked to him.  
</P>
<P>
	The winless Bengals hit a little more turbulence Thursday, a day  
after a series of moves involving the running backs left players 
upset and the head coach uncharacteristically silent. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of negative stuff going on around here right  
now,'' Carter said. ``It's not good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest tempest started Wednesday, when the Bengals decided  
to put Carter on injured reserve with a dislocated kneecap and 
waived fullback Brian Milne, who started 31 of the last 35 games. 
</P>
<P>
	They added a couple of running backs -- Michael Basnight off the  
practice squad and Sedrick Shaw off waivers from Cleveland. But 
with rookie Nick Williams sidelined by a sprained ankle, the 
Bengals were left with one healthy fullback, Clif Groce. 
</P>
<P>
	Coslet walked off the practice field Thursday avoiding the  
subject. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have anything to say yesterday, I don't have anything  
to say today and I won't have anything to say tomorrow,'' Coslet 
said, without slowing his pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, the star-crossed running back who has missed all or most  
of three seasons since he was the No. 1 overall pick in 1995, 
showed up for treatment on his knee Thursday unhappy that he didn't 
get a chance to plead his case. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter tore tissue when his right kneecap came out of place  
during a 27-3 loss Sunday in Carolina. The Bengals decided to put 
him on injured reserve -- ending his season -- because doctors 
anticipated an eight-week recovery time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very disappointed that they did it without giving me a  
chance (to talk them out of it),'' Carter said. ``If it was a 
season-ending injury, I could understand it. They say I'll be out 
eight weeks; I say six. Then we have seven or eight games left. I 
mean, that's half a season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter also was unhappy about how he learned of the move.  
</P>
<P>
	``I came home and was watching TV and saw my name at the bottom  
of the screen saying I'm out for the year,'' Carter said. ``That's 
the big thing that really disappointed me, that I had to find out 
from TV. Everyone in this whole world knew I was out besides me. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd think they would have the common courtesy just to call  
me and let me know. They've got all my phone numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Mike Brown said Carter should have been told.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been a mistake on our part, and we apologize for  
it,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some players were still disturbed by the decision to waive  
Milne, who was the lead blocker during Corey Dillon's consecutive 
1,000-yard seasons. Dillon wouldn't talk about the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it's still a shock to us,'' Groce said.  
</P>
<P>
	Groce was waived on Aug. 30 and brought back three days later,  
when the Bengals waived fullback Nicky Sualua. Now, he's the No. 1 
fullback. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a country-western song,'' Groce said. ``It's just  
ups and downs -- some tears, shake your head and hopefully when this 
is over, some laughter.''

<HEADLINE> Slaying Victim ID'd After 15 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- He was found shot to death in an abandoned house  
an hour's drive south of Atlanta, badly decomposed and without 
identification. Local officials buried him in a cheap casket under 
the name John Doe. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen years later, he has a name and a history. He is Carl  
Rowland, an 18-year-old who disappeared in 1984 while trying to 
hitchhike from Atlanta to Florida for the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowland's mother and sister visited his grave for the first time  
Wednesday, a day after authorities matched X-rays of Rowland's 
teeth with those of the unidentified victim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought whenever I retired this would still be an unsolved  
mystery,'' said Rene Chamblee, chief investigator for the Lamar 
County sheriff's department. ``I've asked the question 100 times: 
`Whose son are you? Who do you belong to?' ... And now I have the 
answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Chamblee hoped she would be able to close the case two  
years ago, when a former sheriff's dispatcher confessed to being 
the killer. But he insisted he didn't know the victim's name. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a bit of luck to find out who John Doe really was.  
</P>
<P>
	Rowland's mother, who asked authorities not to release her name,  
was discussing her son with a co-worker several weeks ago. She 
agreed to hire the woman's boyfriend -- private investigator Ed 
Hood, a former policeman in Barnesville, the Lamar County seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Remembering the John Doe case, Hood contacted Mrs. Chamblee to  
see if there was any possible connection. There was. 
</P>
<P>
	John Doe and Rowland were the same height -- 6 feet. They had the  
same shoe size. A composite drawing made from the killer's 
description had a resemblance to Rowland. 
</P>
<P>
	Dental X-rays revealed Rowland, like John Doe, had four impacted  
wisdom teeth. They also each had two fillings in the same teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did not take an expert or a rocket scientist to say, `Oh  
this is Carl Rowland,''' Mrs. Chamblee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowland's mother plans to move his body from Lamar County to  
Atlanta, authorities said. Investigators have told her everything 
they know about the case, showing her crime scene photos and 
photographs of her son's confessed killer, who died earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a blessing in that she is getting some closure to  
knowing the fate of Carl,'' said Abe Sharony, the woman's lawyer. 
``The other side is she has received all this information and 
images that have almost created a video in her mind of what 
happened. It's so real it's almost hard for her to cope with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Cloud, who confessed two years ago to shooting Rowland,  
said he shot the teen-ager in self-defense after Rowland tried to 
rob him with a knife. He was charged with murder and concealing a 
death, but died before he could be tried. 
</P>
<P>
	Police never found a knife. With both the killer and victim  
dead, Mrs. Chamblee said, what really happened in that abandoned 
house will likely remain a mystery.

<HEADLINE> French Locate Seizure Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	French scientists have identified a gene associated with the  
kind of brain seizure that killed Olympic sprinter Florence 
Griffith Joyner, a step that may lead to early testing and better 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulty copies of the gene, known as CCM1, are responsible for  
the development of tangled blood vessels in the brain known as 
cavernous angiomas, according to a study by three laboratories in 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The results appear in the October issue of the journal Nature  
Genetics. 
</P>
<P>
	The abnormality is found in one in every 40 Americans, and the  
condition is inherited in half of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In most cases, these tangles remain quite small for many years,  
making them hard to find even with sophisticated imaging equipment 
and risky to remove. Eventually, the tangles swell and engulf more 
of the brain. Without surgery, they trigger seizures, paralysis and 
potentially fatal strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Often, the first clinical sign of the disease is a stroke or  
death,'' said geneticist Doug Marchuk of Duke University, a member 
of an American research team that has also linked CCM1 with the 
brain lesions and will release its study next month. ``A DNA test 
should be readily available. If you know who is at risk, you can 
aggressively treat them early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy showed that Ms. Griffith Joyner died in her sleep a  
year ago from a seizure triggered as a result of cavernous angioma. 
She was 38. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic gold medalist had a history of seizures in the  
1990s. But it is unknown whether she had a bad copy of the CCM1 
gene and suffered from the inherited form of the brain lesions 
</P>
<P>
	On June 13, Houston Astros manager Larry Dierker suffered a  
violent seizure during a baseball game. Surgeons removed a 
cavernous angioma, and he returned to the dugout a month later. 
</P>
<P>
	In the French study, researcher Elisabeth Tournier-Lasserve and  
others examined unrelated patients from 20 families with histories 
of cavernous angiomas, including a high frequency of multiple 
lesions. CCM1 mutations were found in 12 of the patients. 
</P>
<P>
	In the U.S. study, 16 of 21 Mexican-American families were found  
to share the mutation. Their report will be published in the 
November issue of Human Molecular Genetics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until now, little has been known about the molecular  
mechanisms leading to these lesions,'' said geneticist Mikka 
Vikkula of Catholic University in Belgium. ``Identifying the 
causative gene and the kinds of mutations it contains allows us to 
start thinking of completely new ways of treating the disorder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither study answered several lingering questions about CCM1,  
including whether the gene is implicated in non-inherited forms of 
the disease.

<HEADLINE> Tough Week To Be an Artist in NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The message on the wall of the Brooklyn Museum  
of Art looked like a traffic sign: ``Danger. ART.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Danger, indeed.  
</P>
<P>
	New York's art world has rarely been more hazardous than it was  
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	A dispute over an exhibit containing a dung-plastered portrait  
of the Virgin Mary threatens to cost the Brooklyn Museum of Art 
millions in city funds. An art dealer was busted for distributing 
live ammunition from an artist's ``bullet bowl'' at her gallery. 
And an artist was arrested after flinging horse manure at the 
Brooklyn museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Artists are discovering the two toughest critics in New York may  
be Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest flap in the centuries-old battle over what  
constitutes art started with Giuliani taking on the Brooklyn museum 
over an exhibit that previously played in London and includes the 
picture of the Virgin Mary and dissected pigs floating in 
formaldehyde. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani ripped the exhibit as ``sick stuff'' and promised to  
withhold $7 million in annual city funding, touching off a court 
battle that remains unsettled. The exhibit is still scheduled to 
open on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on Wednesday night, Mary Boone was arrested at her Fifth  
Avenue gallery after visitors to the one-man show by artist Tom 
Sachs were invited to take home a souvenir: a 9 mm bullet. A vase 
filled with 100 live bullets was found by police on the reception 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
	The ammunition was in keeping with Sachs' work -- his signature  
artwork is homemade guns. Police, after determining the guns were 
functional, seized them along with the bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	Boone was charged with illegal distribution of ammunition and  
other misdemeanors. Her lawyer, Jed Poretz, did not return a call. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday afternoon, self-proclaimed artist Scott LoBaido was  
grabbed by police for throwing the horse manure at the Brooklyn 
museum. He said the excrement embodied his First Amendment right to 
protest the upcoming exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	Police disagreed, taking him away after less than five minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm expressing myself creatively!'' shouted LoBaido, who  
charged that the upcoming exhibit was anti-Catholic, as police led 
him off. ``You can't stop me.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds fell by $3.64 billion in the latest week to $895.20 
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category fell  
by $2.01 billion to $746.60 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets fell by $1.63 billion to $148.60 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds fell by $5.20 billion

taxable money market fund assets fell by $4.92 billion to $554.36 
billion; assets of tax-exempt funds fell by $273.4 million to 
$46.27 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.496 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.505 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.71 percent from 4.69 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield rose to 4.69 percent from 4.66 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.82 percent from 4.80  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to 
4.80 percent from 4.77 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
57 days, unchanged from a week earlier, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts was 2.08 percent as of 
Wednesday unchanged from a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts held steady at 0.84 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.37 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.35 percent the 
previous week. Yields were 4.74 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.73 
percent; 5.02 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 5.01 percent; and 
5.25 percent on 5-year CDs, unchanged from a week earlier.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Fall to 2-Month Low / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages fell to 7.70 percent this week, the lowest 
level in two months and the fourth straight weekly decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was down from 7.76 percent last week, according to a  
weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgages rates have been on an upward climb for much of this  
year. The average rates on a 30-year mortgage hit a low for the 
year of 6.74 percent at the end of January and a high of 8.15 
percent in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 7.35 percent this week, also down from the average of 7.40 
percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 6.12 percent this week, down from 6.19 
percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amid continuing signs of robust health in the housing  
industry, mortgage rates dropped a little more this week,'' said 
Robert Van Order, Freddie Mac's chief economist. From now until the 
end of the year, rates are expected to fluctuate between 7.75 
percent and 8 percent, he said. 
</P>

	Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said

percent compared to the same week last year.

<HEADLINE> Academics, Retailers Honor Bar Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Academics from some of the nation's top Ivy  
League schools joined executives from Wal-Mart and other retailers 
Thursday to praise the bar code -- that ubiquitous and unfathomable 
collection of lines and numbers that made its debut 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At a daylong conference at the Smithsonian Institution, the  
executives and researchers recalled the earliest days of the humble 
technology, including sometimes epic arguments among supporters, 
and forecast the next generation of bar codes. 
</P>
<P>
	Though consumers pay them little heed, the retail and grocery  
industries describe universal price codes -- scanned an estimated 5 
billion times each day -- as among the most significant advances 
since, well, sliced bread. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all my years, I've seen nothing that has changed the  
industry like the universal product code,'' said Bob Martin, former 
president and chairman of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s international 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	During some of the earliest days' most heated debates over the  
technology's development, ``we had to sit in alphabetical order 
because we fought a lot,'' Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since their debut in 1974, the familiar black-and-white symbols  
have found themselves affixed to items from surgical instruments to 
Alaskan sled dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Museum of American History organized the conference to  
coincide with its exhibit about the technology, ``25 Years Behind 
Bars,'' which runs through March. David Allison, who coordinated 
the exhibit, said the museum sought to ``take something that is 
today, everywhere, and help people understand the story behind the 
story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People do want to know what drives their lives,'' Allison  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Haberman, who was on the 1970s committee that chose the  
design of today's bar codes, said consumers appreciated the 
benefits that grocery scanners offered even when they didn't 
understand how they worked. 
</P>
<P>
	The first bar-code scanner was used June 26, 1974, to buy a  
10-pack of Wrigley's gum in a Marsh Supermarket in Troy, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``From day one, they knew we were going faster,'' Haberman said.  
``They were getting through the lines faster. The customer 
appreciates the fact that the checker has an easier job. They could 
talk to her, watch to see what she was doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These bar-code experts also described the technology's future:  
Starting in 2005, the codes will be redesigned to use 13 and 14 
digits, up from today's 10 numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	They also announced a new multimillion dollar research center at  
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop the next 
generation of bar codes -- tiny radio transmitters on products that 
can track how they were shipped and when they were sold and can 
even distinguish individual cans of Coke or bottles of milk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely time to pick up the gauntlet, time for the  
Internet generation to pick up this thing and move it ahead,'' said 
Kevin Ashton, director of the new MIT research center. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of public attention to the bar code doesn't distress  
Haberman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't that what you hope happens with most standards?'' he  
said. ``The proof that this is successful is that everybody takes 
it for granted.''

<HEADLINE> Ovitz Seeks Los Angeles NFL Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hollywood dealmaker Michael Ovitz, who  
earlier proposed building a stadium in Carson, Calif., then joined 
forces with Los Angeles Coliseum backers, now is looking into 
bringing an NFL team to Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz and one of his group, billionaire Ron Burkle, have an  
option on 100 acres adjacent to the horse racing track in 
Inglewood, the Los Angeles Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Davis had held the option, but he dropped out of the  
bidding for an NFL team on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The league would have to approve both a stadium plan and a  
potential ownership group for an expansion franchise that would be 
its 32nd team. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL owners are expected to vote on awarding a franchise to  
either Los Angeles or Houston at a meeting in Atlanta on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the league's team owners, who were not identified,  
told the newspaper any proposal by Ovitz would have to overwhelm 
them to gain approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times also reported that the NFL is looking to keep  
alive a plan to build a stadium at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston, which has a stadium and financing plan set to go, is  
still in contention for the new franchise. If there was no group in 
Los Angeles seeking a team, the NFL would lose leverage in any 
negotiations with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz, who has been trying to bring a team to Los Angeles for  
more than four years, said he was confident this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on my conversations with the NFL commissioner and the  
co-chairman of the expansion committee, I believe we are going to 
leave Atlanta Wednesday having a football franchise for Los 
Angeles,'' he told the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz may have to put up a sum of earnest money to show the  
league he is serious about building a stadium and acquiring a team. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Ovitz proposed building a hacienda-style  
stadium, which would have been part of a shopping mall complex, in 
suburban Carson. The NFL, which has declared its intentions to put 
a team in Los Angeles, instead gave the nod to the Los Angeles 
Coliseum. He then joined in what seemed an uneasy alliance with the 
Coliseum backers. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to receive what it considered a suitable plan for the  
Coliseum, the league this summer opened the bidding again to other 
prospective sites and groups in LA. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL had no comment Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> AutoNation To Spin Off Rental Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- AutoNation Inc., the country's  
largest automobile retailer, said Thursday it will spin off its 
troubled rental-car division by issuing stock in the new company to 
current AutoNation shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation, which is controlled by billionaire H. Wayne  
Huizenga, spent about $1.8 billion over the past two years to 
acquire five rental car companies, including National Car Rental 
and Alamo Rent-A-Car. 
</P>
<P>
	But the businesses have suffered from too many cars, problems  
with the reservation system, and undercutting its own published 
rates, according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The retail business is doing extremely well, both in sales  
revenue and earnings, but the rental business has had a difficult 
business of late,'' said Jim Donahue, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 2, the company announced it would separate the rental  
car business. That news was soon followed by the resignation of 
William Lobeck, president of AutoNation's rental car group. His 
successor has not been named. 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga tried to sell the rental business to at least one  
competitor, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, but couldn't strike a deal. With 
no takers, he decided to spin off the business to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation shareholders will receive one share in the new  
company for each 6 to 8 shares in AutoNation they hold. The 
distribution will take place in late January to anyone holding 
AutoNation shares in late December. The exact share ratio and 
distribution dates have not been set. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of the Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.-based retailer rose 56 1/4 cents  
to $12.50 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, well below the 
one-year high of $18.37 set in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, AutoNation tapped the president and chief executive  
of luxury car maker Mercedes-Benz USA Inc. to be its chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael J. Jackson was named to replace Steven Berrard, who left  
earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Astros Gird for Pivotal Finale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- After maintaining a share of first place with  
Cincinnati after a two-game split, the Houston Astros know they 
can't let up this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got three games left and we've got to play the same  
way,'' center fielder Carl Everett said after the Astros won 4-1 
Wednesday to rejoin the Reds atop the National League Central. ``We 
can't worry about what the other teams are doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati and Houston, both 95-64, were off Thursday. The  
Astros finish the regular season with a three-game series against 
Los Angeles -- the final games scheduled for the Astrodome. The Reds 
travel to Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Mets, who began Thursday 1 1/2 games back in the  
wild-card race, lost more ground with a 4-3 loss to the Atlanta 
Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still not clicking offensively,'' said Astros manager  
Larry Dierker, noting that a throwing error by shortstop Barry 
Larkin gave Houston three unearned runs Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Astros ranked Wednesday's win as the biggest so far.  
Normally stoic Mike Hampton pumped his left fist after fanning 
Dmitri Yong in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't usually show a lot of emotion out there, but it was  
late in the game, and I needed to shut the door and not let any 
cheap runs in,'' Hampton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hampton said he thinks the Astros, who have lost eight of 12,  
are ready for a return to form against Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a scrappy bunch of guys,'' he said. ``With all the  
injuries we've had this year, we've been through a lot. But it's 
brought us closer together, and I think we've gotten better because 
of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While many Astros and Reds recited the familiar mantra that they  
``can't worry about what the other teams do'' and ``we've got to 
take care of our own business,'' Cincinnati manager Jack McKeon was 
forthright. 
</P>
<P>
	``With three games left, I think everybody is watching the  
scoreboard,'' he said. ``What else are you going to do? You don't 
have a book to read between innings. You have to look around at the 
scoreboard.''

<HEADLINE> Russia, Iraq Fail To Bridge Oil Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq and Russia have agreed to further  
expand trade under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program but 
failed to find a common ground on how to activate an oil 
development deal they signed in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Visiting Russian Energy Minister Viktor Kaluzhny and his Iraqi  
counterpart Amer Mohammed Rashid held a third round of negotiations 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials said Rashid warned his Russian guest that the  
state-owned Lukoil company may lose its contract to develop about 
10 billion barrels of reserves in the southern West Qurna oil field 
if it does not start work promptly. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
Kaluzhny, while stressing Russia's continued interest in West 
Qurna, made it clear to Rashid that Moscow is in no position to 
flout U.N. trade sanctions which ban foreign investments in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	West Qurna is one of the largest undeveloped oil fields in the  
world with total proven reserves of more than 20 billion barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the contract, Russia holds a nearly 25-year stake in half  
of West Qurna's reserves. Iraq had also pledged to offer Russia the 
remaining 10 billion barrels if it started work despite the U.N. 
trade sanctions imposed for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract calls for Lukoil, which is Russia's largest oil  
company, and partners Zarubezhneft and Mashinoimport to spend $200 
million to develop the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials said Kaluzhny told Rashid that the Russian  
firms did not have ready cash to start work and that Western 
creditors would not give them loans as long as U.N. sanctions 
remained in place. 
</P>
<P>
	But he assured Rashid that Russia will do what it can to  
persuade the U.N. Security Council to allow foreign investment in 
Iraq, particularly in the oil sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-scale development of West Qurna by Russian firms is  
expected to cost more than $2.5 billion.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Claim Underdog Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Will the real underdog please stand up?  
</P>
<P>
	Not only are Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley slugging it  
out for the Democratic presidential nomination, they're also now 
fighting for the title of ``underdog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with fresh evidence that his campaign is surging, Bradley  
insisted Thursday his was an uphill battle against Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like an underdog. I always feel like an underdog, and  
here there are some numbers to confirm it,'' he said, referring to 
polls that show him trailing Gore in California. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments in Oakland came one day after Gore, no longer  
assured of an easy victory, challenged the former New Jersey 
senator to debates and announced he was moving his campaign 
headquarters to his family's home state of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like the underdog. I'm going to campaign like the  
underdog, and I think that's the way to get elected,'' Gore said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Bradley denied he had ``momentum,'' allowing ``traction''  
at most. But some of his supporters were swelling with confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill WAS the underdog,'' said Ted Schlein, a partner in a  
Silicon Valley investment firm who attended a Bradley fund-raiser 
in San Jose on Thursday night. ``I think someone might have 
whispered in Gore's ear and said, 'Maybe it's better to be the 
underdog than the front-runner.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Is the label ``underdog'' hip?  
</P>
<P>
	``We never thought so,'' Schlein said. ``We just were that,  
until now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Sullivan, the Democratic Party chairwoman in New  
Hampshire, where Gore narrowly trails Bradley in polls, said with a 
chuckle that the underdog title fight was under way in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess we have to wait and see who's the real underdog on  
Election Day,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, challenging a sitting vice president, has always  
painted himself as an underdog. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday he said he faced an uphill fight against ``entrenched  
power'' and the ``symbolism'' Gore wields by arriving at campaign 
stops aboard Air Force Two. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Bradley was upbeat on the stump, signing  
autographs, telling jokes to more than 200 supporters at an Oakland 
rally, then bringing them to rapt attention with a story about a 
fourth-grader who told her teacher it was her sibling's turn, not 
hers, to eat breakfast one recent morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was still upbeat at the San Jose fund-raiser, calling  
his campaign ``a joyous journey that we're on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley raised an estimated $6.7 million between July and  
September, spokeswoman Anita Dunn said. Gore raised around $6.5 
million during the same period, according to advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	But by spending far less than the vice president, Bradley wound  
up with more than $10 million in the bank as of Thursday. Gore 
aides said the vice president would have between $9.5 million and 
$10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's three-day California swing brought in $1.2 million,  
said Rick Wright, Bradley's national finance chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made a concerted effort to reach out to new people who  
have never been a part of the process, let them know I'm serious 
about such things as campaign finance reform,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	He insisted the financial numbers had not given him or his staff  
any emotional boost. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't get an adrenaline boost in the second quarter,'' he  
said. ``You get an adrenaline boost when you're in the final 
minutes of the game.''

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Fall on Supply News / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices fell in trading  
on the Chicago Board of Trade Thursday on higher-than-expected 
supply numbers released by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures fell in reaction to U.S. grain stock estimates of  
1.796 billion bushels, about 100 million bushels higher than 
anticipated, market participants said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was bigger than the trade was looking for, surprisingly  
so,'' said Don Roose, president of Iowa-based U.S. Commodities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	There was other bearish news in corn: harvest conditions  
improved this week; and there are forecasts for rain in the Midwest 
this weekend and early next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures plummeted on estimates that quarterly stocks were  
much larger than expected. Roose said the corn and wheat stocks 
indicate a serious decline in feed use. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock reports were released today by the U.S. Department of  
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures fell in sympathy with corn and wheat, but losses  
were limited by stock estimates that were down slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Thursday, wheat for December delivery fell 8 1/2 cents  
to $2.75 3/4 a bushel; December corn fell 5 1/2 cents to $2.08 1/4 a bushel; 
December oats fell 2 cents to $1.13 1/4 a bushel; and November 
soybeans fell 1/2 cent to $4.91 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, cattle futures prices were higher in trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while pork futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle futures were up .97 cent to 68.27 cents a  
pound; October feeder cattle rose 1.17 cent to 81.07 cents a pound; 
October lean hogs fell .43 cent to 48.97 cents a pound; and 
February pork bellies fell .42 cent to 63.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Gov't. Launches Y2K Travel Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government started warning airline  
travelers about foreign airport and airline Y2K readiness Thursday, 
but one senator questioned why the information was so sketchy. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory was made public through a new Transportation  
Department Web site, www.fly2k.dot.gov, which will serve as the 
federal government's clearinghouse for Year 2000 traveler 
information during the next three months. 
</P>
<P>
	For those interested in Australia's readiness, for example, the  
site says: ``Reports indicate steps are under way in the civil 
aviation Y2K programs of this country. However, there is 
insufficient information available to estimate the overall status 
of Y2K preparations at this time. It is difficult to estimate the 
likelihood, length or severity of any disruptions in the civil 
aviation system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same description is included for numerous other countries,  
followed by a recommendation that travelers ``be prepared to cope 
with disruptions and delays in services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such a lack of detail prompted Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,  
to complain during a hearing called to assess the transportation 
industry and its Year 2000 readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd threatened to file legislation grounding any U.S. aviation  
certificate holder who does not respond to a government 
questionnaire about their readiness by mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Mead, inspector general of the Transportation  
Department, told the hearing that 1,900 certificate holders have 
yet to respond. The Federal Aviation Administration said none of 
them are major airlines and many are manufacturing companies or one 
plane crop-dusters. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd also complained groups such as the International Air  
Transport Association, which represents 265 international airlines, 
were not making public all the information they had culled from 
their members. An IATA official said airlines agreed to provide the 
information only if it was not made public, which could lead to 
lawsuits against them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shouldn't I have a right to that information?'' Dodd said.  
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Windmuller, who testified on behalf of the transport  
association, said passengers should trust the airlines to use the 
information wisely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine any of our member airlines would ever  
compromise safety,'' Windmuller said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 problem can plague older computers, since some  
were designed to recognize years in a two-digit format, such as 
``99'' for 1999. There are questions about whether systems will 
malfunction when the new century starts, since some computers could 
confuse ``00'' for 1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	That is of particular concern in aviation, where computers  
control everything from radars to runway lights. In June, the FAA 
announced that it had repaired and tested all of its computers, and 
U.S. and Canadian airlines recently offered the same assurance. 
</P>
<P>
	There are two lingering questions: the readiness of airports  
both domestically and abroad, and the readiness of international 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	In launching the new site, Transportation Secretary Rodney  
Slater said that the top three travel destination from the United 
States -- Canada, Britain and Japan -- report they will be fully Y2K 
ready by the end of the year. All told, the Web site covers almost 
90 countries with direct service to and from the United States.

<HEADLINE> Highlights of Reagan Biography </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' biographer Edmund  
Morris writes: 
</P>
<P>
	--George Bush felt unappreciated as Reagan's vice president, a  
claim Bush denies. 
</P>
<P>
	--Reagan came closer to dying after the 1981 assassination  
attempt than was let on at the time. Some former aides say Morris 
overdramatized the aftermath of Reagan's surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	--Reagan tried to forgive his attempted assassin, John Hinckley.  
In his diary, Reagan wrote, ``I realized I couldn't ask for God's 
help while at the same time I felt hatred for the mixed up young 
man who had shot me. Isn't that the meaning of the lost sheep?'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Reagan said of aide Alexander Haig: ``It's amazing how sound he  
can be on international matters, but how utterly paranoid with 
regard to the people he must work with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--French President Francois Mitterrand told Canadian Prime  
Minister Pierre Trudeau that Reagan ``is a man without ideas and 
without culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Reagan on President Carter: ``And after he left here, he was  
the only president to become a nobody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Reagan was ``greatly depressed,'' according to his diary, about  
the ABC television movie ``The Day After,'' about a nuclear war. 
</P>

	--Reagan's role was unclear in the diversion of money to the  
Nicaraguan Contras from illicit missile sales to Iran. ``My 
suspicion, for what it's worth, is that Dutch (Reagan) did 
authorize the transfer, not having the smallest comprehension of 
the laws he was subverting.'' Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Reagan sent a love letter to wife, Nancy, saying her love was  
``like fruit of the month with a lifetime subscription -- a 
perpetual motion happiness machine. It starts off fresh and brand 
new every day shining up my whole world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Reagan began conserving his mental resources after second-term  
cancer surgery, focusing on ``rescue of the hostages in Lebanon, 
Contra aid, strategic defense, abolition of nuclear weapons, moral 
warfare against communism and continued restoration of the national 
spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Reagan was at his best dealing with Soviet leader Mikhail  
Gorbachev and said of him: ``You could almost get to like the guy. 
I keep telling myself I mustn't do it, because he could turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Reagan was aloof and ``never seemed to need anybody'' except  
his wife.

<HEADLINE> Conectiv Selling Nuclear Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Conectiv will sell its share in three  
nuclear power plants for $20 million as part of a restructuring 
plan, the company announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility, based in Wilmington, Del., is selling its minority  
ownership to other utility companies which already operate the 
plants and own the majority of the shares. 
</P>
<P>
	PECO Energy Co. of Philadelphia, and PSEG Power, a subsidiary of  
New Jersey's Public Service Electric &AMP; Gas Co., are splitting 
Conectiv's 15 percent interest in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power 
Station in York County, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	PSEG Power will also buy Conectiv's 14.8 percent interest in the  
Salem Nuclear Generating Station and its 5 percent interest in the 
Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station. Both of those plants are 
located in Salem County, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Although sales of the nuclear power plants must be approved by  
government regulators, officials with Conectiv said they believe 
the deals will close by the middle of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The selloff is part of Conectiv's efforts to raise $1 billion in  
cash to help make the company more flexible for deregulation of the 
consumer energy market. 
</P>
<P>
	Conectiv, created last year by the merger of Delmarva Power &AMP;  
Light Co. and Atlantic Energy Co., provides electricity, natural 
gas and telecommunications services to about 1 million homes and 
businesses in New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Academics, Retailers Honor Bar Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers might ignore them but to the grocery  
industry, bar code technology -- which made its debut 25 years ago -- 
is among the most significant advances since sliced bread. 
</P>
<P>
	Academics from some of the nation's top Ivy League schools  
joined executives from Wal-Mart and other retailers Thursday to 
praise the bar code -- that ubiquitous and unfathomable collection 
of lines and numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	At a daylong conference at the Smithsonian Institution,  
executives and researchers recalled the earliest days of the humble 
technology, including sometimes epic arguments among supporters, 
and forecast the next generation of bar codes, which are scanned an 
estimated 5 billion times each day. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all my years, I've seen nothing that has changed the  
industry like the universal product code,'' said Bob Martin, former 
president and chairman of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s international 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	During some of the earliest days' most heated debates in  
conference rooms about the technology's development, ``we had to 
sit in alphabetical order because we fought a lot,'' Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since their debut in 1974, the familiar black-and-white symbols  
have found themselves affixed to items from surgical instruments to 
Alaskan sled dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Museum of American History organized the conference to  
coincide with its exhibit about the technology, ``25 Years Behind 
Bars,'' which runs through March. David Allison, who coordinated 
the exhibit, said the museum sought to ``take something that is 
today, everywhere, and help people understand the story behind the 
story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People do want to know what drives their lives,'' Allison  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Haberman, who was on the 1970s committee that chose the  
design of today's bar codes, said consumers appreciated the 
benefits that grocery scanners offered even when they didn't 
understand how they worked. 
</P>
<P>
	The first bar-code scanner was used June 26, 1974, to buy a  
10-pack of Wrigley's gum in a Marsh Supermarket in Troy, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``From day one, they knew we were going faster,'' Haberman said.  
``They were getting through the lines faster. The customer 
appreciates the fact that the checker has an easier job. They could 
talk to her, watch to see what she was doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These bar-code experts also described the technology's future:  
Starting in 2005, the codes will be redesigned to use 13 and 14 
digits, up from today's 10 numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	They also announced a new multimillion dollar research center at  
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop the next 
generation of bar codes -- tiny radio transmitters on products that 
can track how they were shipped and when they were sold and can 
even distinguish individual cans of soda or bottles of milk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely time to pick up the gauntlet, time for the  
Internet generation to pick up this thing and move it ahead,'' said 
Kevin Ashton, director of the new MIT research center. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of public attention to the bar code doesn't distress  
Haberman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't that what you hope happens with most standards?'' he  
said. ``The proof that this is successful is that everybody takes 
it for granted.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- City officials have fired another round in their  
escalating fight with the Brooklyn Museum of Art, accusing the 
museum of displaying controversial work just to drive up its value. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusations made Wednesday by Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota and  
the city's top lawyer, Michael Hess, came a day after the museum 
sued to stop Mayor Rudolph Giuliani from freezing its funding over 
the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has threatened to cut city funding to the museum  
because of its decision to display an exhibit that includes a black 
Madonna decorated with elephant dung and pornographic cutouts. The 
funding amounts to $7 million, or about one-third of the museum's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The pieces are from advertising executive Charles Saatchi's  
collection. Lhota and Hess say the museum's board planned the 
``Sensation'' exhibition so the works would fetch high prices at 
auction once the show closes. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum's board members are ``shilling for a British subject  
who is a multimillionaire and trying to enhance his art 
collection,'' Lhota said. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited a New York Observer article which said that after the  
show closed in London, Saatchi auctioned 128 pieces from his 
collection, many of them by artists in the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, on a fund-raising trip in California, said he has been  
in touch with Lhota and Hess about their accusations. He said the 
project raises the question whether a publicly funded museum should 
engage in ``shock commercialization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andree Corroon, a spokeswoman for Christie's, which is helping  
sponsor the show, said the auction house had no plans for an 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bewildering accusation has absolutely no substance, is  
absolutely not true,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the museum called the accusations ``preposterous  
and misleading.'' The show opens Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a federal judge has been asked to decide whether to  
restore the museum's funding. The museum sued the city on Tuesday, 
saying Giuliani's act violates the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the Senate agreed unanimously Wednesday to a  
non-binding measure calling for the withholding of federal funds 
from the museum unless it cancels the exhibit. Independent Sen. Bob 
Smith of New Hampshire said the museum has received $500,000 from 
the National Endowment for the Arts in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, singer David Bowie -- who recorded an audio tour  
for museum visitors -- joined leaders of major New York City museums 
in support of the Brooklyn Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sensation represents some of the best, worst but definitely  
most extreme of the high-profile work to have come out of Britain 
in the last 10 years or so,'' Bowie said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders of two dozen cultural institutions -- including the  
Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Modern Art -- signed a letter 
protesting the mayor's funding cut.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Memo Cites Academic Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHANHASSEN, Minn. (AP) -- Former Minnesota men's basketball coach  
Clem Haskins allegedly asked an academic counselor in 1986 to write 
a paper for a player to keep him eligible to play. 
</P>
<P>
	That disclosure came from a memo from counselor Rick Marsden  
that was obtained by investigators examining academic fraud at the 
University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of several documents shown to Elayne Donahue, former  
director of the academic counseling unit, during a deposition 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are preparing a report, to be made public in  
November, on academic fraud in the basketball program and other 
alleged misconduct in the men's athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsden wrote in the memo about ``a disturbing interaction'' he  
had with Haskins. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote that a player's eligibility was in jeopardy and that  
Haskins told him ``we'' must ``do whatever it takes to get (the 
student) eligible. ... Clem said that if someone doing a paper for 
an athlete would allow him the opportunity be eligible to compete, 
and therefore succeed, we need to do the paper for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marsden wrote that he was ``shocked'' by Haskins' statement and  
that he wouldn't write the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsden also said in the memo that he heard Haskins ask Susan  
Latendresse, a secretary in the basketball office in 1986, to 
process a scholarship tender to an athlete who had hired an agent 
and therefore lost his amateur status. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsden is now a counselor in another department at the  
university. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins, who resigned under pressure and accepted a $1.5 million  
buyout of his contract in June, has said he had no knowledge of any 
academic cheating in the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached by telephone today, Haskins' wife, Yevette Haskins, said  
he would not comment on the memo. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also met with Joanne Carpenter on Wednesday, a  
sister of Jan Gangelhoff, whose admission that she wrote papers for 
at least 20 players sparked the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter said she wrote one paper for a player. Previously,  
another sister of Gangelhoff, Jeanne Payer, said she wrote papers 
for players.

<HEADLINE> Court: Gunmaker Can Be Sued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The firearms industry may have been dealt a  
serious blow in California, where an appellate court has become the 
first in the nation to allow a gunmaker to be sued for a criminal 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1st District Court of Appeal on Wednesday reinstated a civil  
suit against Navegar Inc., the maker of two TEC-DC9 semiautomatic 
pistols that were used by a deranged gunman to kill eight people in 
a San Francisco office building in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges acknowledged that no other appeals court has ever  
ruled that manufacturers of legal, non-defective guns can be sued 
and held liable for the criminal misuse of the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	But they said the San Francisco case was unusual. The gun's  
firepower, the lack of any apparent legitimate civilian use, and 
the company's marketing practices could lead a jury to conclude 
that the manufacturer should have foreseen that it would be used in 
a massacre, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling stopped well short of authorizing suits by any gun  
victim against a manufacturer -- claims dismissed by every other 
state and federal appellate court to have considered them. 
</P>
<P>
	But a gun-control group that represented families of the victims  
was quick to cast its victory in broad terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has ``far-reaching implications'' for lawsuits by local  
governments accusing gunmakers of negligently designing, 
manufacturing and distributing their products, said the Center to 
Prevent Handgun Violence, a Washington, D.C., organization. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 25 such suits have been filed across the country, the  
latest on Wednesday by the city of Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling ``provides legal precedent for finding that (the) gun  
industry can be held accountable for irresponsible conduct leading 
to death and injury,'' the center said. 
</P>
<P>
	Navegar will probably appeal to the state Supreme Court.  
</P>
<P>
	``The court appears to have gone where no other appellate court  
has seen fit to go,'' said the company's lawyer, Ernest Getto. 
</P>
<P>
	Gian Luigi Ferri, a mentally disturbed man with a grudge against  
lawyers, entered a downtown skyscraper in July 1993 and opened fire 
in a law office. He killed eight people and wounded six before 
killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said federal statistics showed the TEC-DC9 was the  
``weapon of choice'' for certain types of criminals. Navegar's 
former marketing director was quoted as saying in 1992 that sales 
went up when the gun was used in a notorious crime. 
</P>
<P>
	One company ad touted the gun's surface as resistant to  
fingerprints. A brochure to distributors said the gun was ``as 
tough as your toughest customer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Navegar ``had substantial reason to foresee that many of those  
to whom it made the TEC-DC9 available would criminally misuse it to 
kill and injure others,'' said the appeals court opinion by Justice 
J. Anthony Kline. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissenting Justice Paul Haerle accused the majority of  
``judicial legislation'' and said Ferri bore sole responsibility 
for the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	A TEC-DC9 also was used in the April shootings at Columbine High  
School in Littleton, Colo.

	Pentagon To Look at Korea Killings  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Army Secretary Louis Caldera today promised a  
``complete and thorough review'' of accounts of mass killings of 
South Korean civilians by U.S. soldiers early in the Korean war. 
Caldera said The Associated Press account ``clearly has raised new 
information that demanded that it be looked into.'' President 
Clinton said the Pentagon ``wants to get to the bottom of it.'' 
Accounts of South Korean villagers and of a dozen ex-GIs who either 
witnessed or were involved in the killings were reported by The AP 
yesterday.

<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A strong earthquake rocked southern Mexico  
today, toppling church towers and knocking over old homes in Oaxaca 
and shaking buildings in the capital. At least five people were 
killed and an unknown number injured. The quake had a preliminary 
magnitude of 7.5 and was centered 275 miles southeast of Mexico 
City, the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. said. Moderate 
damage was reported in Oaxaca City, the state capital, where church 
steeples and many homes collapsed. Federal officials said water and 
sewage treatment plants were damaged in 95 percent of Oaxaca state.

	TOKYO (AP) -- A major leak at a uranium-processing plant in  
northeastern Japan today sent radiation levels skyrocketing. At 
least three workers were hospitalized -- two in critical condition -- 
and at least 34 others may have been contaminated. The nuclear 
reaction is continuing and workers have begun removing water from 
the cooling equipment around the tank to stop it. Five residents 
were also exposed to radiation, a local official said on customary 
condition of anonymity. More than 310,000 people were ordered not 
to leave their homes and officials shut down schools and train 
service in the region.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley, his Democratic presidential  
campaign surging, raised more money than Vice President Al Gore 
over the last three months, and has more money in the bank heading 
into the final quarter of the year. On the Republican side, Texas 
Gov. George W. Bush continued to shatter fund-raising records, 
reporting raising more than $56 million through the end of 
September. He has about $37 million cash on hand. Bradley raised an 
estimated $6.7 million between July and September, a spokeswoman 
said today. Gore raised around $6.5 million during the same period, 
according to senior advisers.

another government shutdown.'' He accused the Republican Congress 
of resorting to ``gimmicks and gamesmanship'' instead of meeting 
the Oct. 1 deadline for passage of the appropriations bills that 
finance the government. The resolution extends funding until Oct. 
21.

	Mixup May Have Doomed Mars Orbiter

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A mixup over metric and English measurements  
likely caused the loss of the $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter as 
it started to circle the planet last week, officials said today. 
The error caused the probe to fly too close to the red planet, 
causing the spacecraft to break up or burn up in the Martian 
atmosphere that it had been designed to study, mission controllers 
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said.

<HEADLINE> Armani Fashion Dazzles Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- It's no easy feat to get a bevy of stars to  
share the same limelight, but Giorgio Armani made it look simple. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoots of approval and hundreds of camera flashes greeted  
actresses Sophia Loren, Glenn Close and Ornella Muti, singers Ricky 
Martin, Tina Turner and Phil Collins, and Ronaldo, the world's most 
famous soccer player, as one by one they arrived Wednesday to 
attend the Armani fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the lights dimmed in his new digs -- a renovated Milan  
chocolate factory -- the stars were happy to sit elbow to elbow in 
the front row and enjoy the parade of beauty down the runway. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything in the Spring-Summer 2000 collection is delicate and  
neatly put together. 
</P>
<P>
	The color scheme is strictly pastel -- a theme reproduced in the  
lighting of the new showrooms -- and the fabric is as light as a 
feather. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspiration comes from India with sarong skirts worn over  
cropped pants, delicate slipper footwear and embroidered purses. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Armani suit has a very small jacket and pants cut above  
the ankle. Tiny clasps and snaps replace buttons, which are totally 
absent from the collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Evening is diaphanous, with pastel rainbow-colored gowns,  
adorned by twinkling sequins, or a pastel floral printed skirt with 
crisscross velvet brocade top. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a beautiful collection,'' said Close, adding that she has  
been wearing Armani since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Martin had to rush back to Los Angeles and couldn't stay  
for the after-show party, but the young rock-star idol appeared to 
enjoy the show. 
</P>
<P>
	It was star time again at Dolce and Gabbana on Thursday, when  
singer Whitney Houston showed up for the designing duo's colorful 
show in a re-created Sicilian marketplace, set up in the garden of 
their downtown Milan home. 
</P>
<P>
	The new collection is a glam star's dream. The basic silhouette  
starts from a rigorously man-tailored suit with pristine white 
blouse, to unfold into a carnival of sequined pants, super short 
six-inch skirts and tiny bikini bra tops. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall look is outrageous but definitely creative. This is  
a breath of fresh air in a season where often there has been more 
flesh than flash, with designers uncovering the body, rather than 
offering exciting things to wear. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Karl Lagerfeld, for Fendi, had some fun ideas for  
the summer of 2000. There were plenty of new ``baguette'' bags in 
the collection from brocade, from woven to knitted. 
</P>
<P>
	The small, usually flat and rectangular bag with a belted handle  
has been the rage in accessories over the past several seasons. Its 
success is one reason why Gucci and Prada, also big accessory 
labels, are vying for a possible purchase of the company. Fendi is 
owned by the five Fendi sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	In the shoe department, Lagerfeld introduces a brand new heel,  
with an empty wedge, making the foot seem suspended in air. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagerfeld, too, opted for a light and colorful summer view.  
Chiffon and multicolored polka dots were everywhere, from the 
cropped pants to the flimsy ruffled blouses, to the flowing evening 
gowns.

<HEADLINE> Ex-GIs Tell AP of Korea Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	From freshly dug foxholes, the GIs looked out over their  
gunsights. Hundreds of civilians, many of them women and children, 
were moving toward their lines, trying to cross to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The young American soldiers, new at the warfront, were wary.  
Orders had come down: No one crosses the line. ``It was assumed 
there were enemy in these people,'' veteran Herman Patterson 
remembers. 
</P>
<P>
	A terrible episode was about to unfold in a ``forgotten war,'' a  
chapter of the 1950-53 Korean conflict that would remain unwritten 
until a dozen ex-soldiers, in interviews with The Associated Press, 
corroborated the allegations of South Koreans who say they survived 
a mass killing at the U.S. Army's hands. 
</P>
<P>
	In late July 1950, the American veterans said, their Army  
battalion killed a large number of South Korean refugees beneath a 
railroad bridge at a place called No Gun Ri. 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-GIs speak of 100, 200 or simply hundreds dead. The Koreans,  
whose claim for compensation was rejected last year, say 300 were 
shot to death at the bridge and 100 died in a preceding U.S. air 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The veterans described other refugee killings as well in the  
war's first weeks, when U.S. commanders ordered their troops to 
shoot civilians, citizens of an allied nation, as a defense against 
disguised enemy soldiers, according to once-classified documents 
found by the AP in U.S. military archives. 
</P>
<P>
	Six veterans of the 1st Cavalry Division said they fired on the  
civilians at No Gun Ri, and six others said they witnessed the mass 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just annihilated them,'' said ex-machine gunner Norman  
Tinkler of Glasco, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	After five decades, none gave a complete, detailed account. But  
the ex-GIs agreed on such elements as time and place, and on the 
preponderance of women, children and old men among the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Some said they were fired on from among the refugees beneath the  
bridge. But others said they don't remember hostile fire. One said 
they later found a few disguised North Korean soldiers among the 
dead. But others disputed this. 
</P>
<P>
	Some soldiers refused to shoot what one described as ``civilians  
just trying to hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 30 Korean claimants -- survivors and victims' relatives --  
said what happened July 26-29, 1950, was an unprovoked, three-day 
carnage. ``The American soldiers played with our lives like boys 
playing with flies,'' said Chun Choon-ja, a 12-year-old girl at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed with new evidence that U.S. GIs had confirmed much of  
their account, the Korean claimants called for a U.S. investigation 
into the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the U.S. government will meet our demands and console  
the wandering souls of those who died an unfair death,'' the 
claimants said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen said today that the claims could  
be examined if there were new evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not aware of any evidence that would support or  
substantiate those claims. But to the degree that any substantive 
information is forthcoming, we certainly would look at it,'' he 
told a press conference in Jakarta, Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. military has said repeatedly it found no basis for the  
allegations. On Wednesday, after the AP report was released, 
Pentagon spokesman P.J. Crowley said, ``We just have no information 
in historical files to lend any clarity to what might have happened 
in July 1950.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AP's research also found no official Army account of the  
events. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Korean government said it will investigate whether the  
survivors' claims are true or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``With keen attention, we'll try to verify the truth of all  
related things concerning the case,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Chang Chul-kyun said. ``Any further action will be decided after 
those efforts are finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reported death toll would make No Gun Ri one of only two  
known cases of large-scale killings of noncombatants by U.S. ground 
troops in this century's major wars, military law experts note. The 
other was Vietnam's My Lai massacre, in 1968, in which more than 
500 Vietnamese may have died. 
</P>
<P>
	From the start of the 1950-53 conflict, North Korean atrocities  
were widely reported -- the killing of civilians and summary 
executions of prisoners. But the story of No Gun Ri has remained 
undisclosed for a half-century. 
</P>
<P>
	Some elements of the No Gun Ri episode are unclear: What chain  
of officers gave open-fire orders? Did GIs see gunfire from the 
refugees or their own ricochets? How many soldiers refused to fire? 
How high in the ranks did knowledge of the events extend? 
</P>
<P>
	The troops dug in at No Gun Ri, 100 miles southeast of Seoul,  
South Korea's capital, were members of the 7th Cavalry, a regiment 
of the 1st Cavalry Division. The refugees who encountered them had 
been rousted by U.S. soldiers from nearby villages as the invading 
army of communist North Korea approached, the Korean claimants 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth week of the Korean War. Word was circulating  
among U.S. troops that northern soldiers disguised in white peasant 
garb might try to penetrate American lines via refugee groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was assumed there were enemy in these people,'' ex-rifleman  
Herman W. Patterson of Greer, S.C., said of the civilian throng. 
</P>
<P>
	As they neared No Gun Ri, leading ox carts, with children on  
their backs, the hundreds of refugees were ordered off the dirt 
road by American soldiers and onto parallel railroad tracks, the 
Koreans said. 
</P>
<P>
	What then happened under the concrete bridge cannot be  
reconstructed in full detail. Although some ex-GIs poured out 
chilling memories, others offered only fragments, or abruptly ended 
their interviews. Over the three days, soldiers were dug in over 
hundreds of yards of hilly terrain, and no one -- Korean or American 
-- saw everything. 
</P>
<P>
	But the veterans corroborated the core of the Koreans' account:  
that American troops kept the large group of refugees pinned under 
the No Gun Ri railroad bridge and killed almost all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just wholesale slaughter,'' said Patterson.  
</P>
<P>
	Both the Koreans and several ex-GIs said the killing began when  
American planes suddenly swooped in and strafed an area where the 
white-clad refugees were resting. Bodies fell everywhere, and 
terrified parents dragged their children into a narrow culvert 
beneath the tracks, the Koreans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some ex-GIs believe the strafing was a mistake, that the pilots  
were supposed to strike enemy artillery miles up the road. But 
declassified U.S. Air Force reports from mid-1950, found by the AP, 
show that pilots also sometimes deliberately attacked ``people in 
white,'' apparently suspecting disguised North Korean soldiers were 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-GI Delos Flint said he and other soldiers were caught in the  
U.S. air attack and piled into the culvert with the refugees. Then 
``somebody -- maybe our guys -- was shooting in at us,'' he recalled. 
The soldiers managed to slip out. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Col. Robert M. Carroll, then a first lieutenant,  
remembers 7th Cavalry riflemen opening fire on the refugees from 
nearby positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is right after we get orders that nobody comes through,  
civilian, military, nobody,'' said Carroll, of Lansdowne, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days earlier, 1st Cavalry Division headquarters had issued  
an order: ``No refugees to cross the front line. Fire everyone 
trying to cross lines. Use discretion in case of women and 
children.'' A neighboring U.S. Army division, in its order, said 
civilians ``are to be considered enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts in the law of war told the AP that such orders, to shoot  
civilians, are plainly illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll said he got the rifle companies to cease fire. ``I  
wasn't convinced this was enemy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He then shepherded a boy to safety under a double-arched  
concrete railroad bridge nearby, where shaken and wounded Koreans 
were gathering. He saw no threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``There weren't any North Koreans in there the first day. ... It  
was mainly women and kids and old men,'' recalled Carroll, who said 
he then left the area and knows nothing about what followed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans directed the refugees into the 80-foot-long bridge  
underpasses and after dark opened fire on them from nearby 
machine-gun positions, the Koreans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans said the heavy-weapons company commander, Capt.  
Melbourne C. Chandler, after speaking with superior officers by 
radio, had ordered machine-gunners to set up near the tunnel mouths 
and open fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chandler said, `The hell with all those people. Let's get rid  
of all of them,''' said Eugene Hesselman of Fort Mitchell, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know if they were North or South Koreans. ... We  
were there only a couple of days and we didn't know them from a 
load of coal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler and other key officers are dead. The colonel who  
commanded the battalion, Herbert B. Heyer, 88, of Sandy Springs, 
Ga., told the AP he knew nothing about the shootings and ``I know I 
didn't give such an order.'' Veterans said the colonel apparently 
was leaving operations to subordinates at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korean claimants said those near the tunnel entrances died  
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``People pulled dead bodies around them for protection,'' said  
survivor Chung Koo-ho, 61. ``Mothers wrapped their children with 
blankets and hugged them with their backs toward the entrances. ... 
My mother died on the second day of shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some ex-soldiers said gunfire was coming out of the underpasses,  
but others don't remember any. None of the ex-GIs interviewed 
supported one veteran's statement that he and others afterward 
discovered ``at least seven'' dead North Korean soldiers in the 
underpasses, in uniform under peasant white. 
</P>
<P>
	Some GIs didn't fire, veterans said. ``It was civilians just  
trying to hide,'' said Flint, of Clio, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	All 24 South Korean survivors interviewed individually by the AP  
said they remembered no North Koreans or gunfire directed at the 
Americans. One suggested the Americans were seeing their own 
comrades' gunfire ricocheting through from the tunnels' opposite 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Relevant U.S. Army documents say nothing about North Korean  
soldiers killed under a bridge or anything else about No Gun Ri. 
</P>
<P>
	The precise death toll will never be known. The survivors  
believe 300 were killed at the bridge and 100 in the air attack. 
Ex-GIs close to the bridge generally put the dead there at about 
200. ``A lot'' also were killed in the strafing, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	One battalion lieutenant located by the AP said he was in the  
area but knew nothing about the killing of civilians. ``I have 
honestly never, ever heard of this from either my soldiers or 
superiors or my friends,'' said John C. Lippincott of Stone 
Mountain, Ga. He said he could have missed it because ``we were 
extremely spread out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In authoritarian, U.S.-allied South Korea, the survivors were  
long discouraged from speaking out. In 1997, in a liberalized 
political atmosphere, they filed a claim with South Korea's 
Government Compensation Committee. But the committee rejected it in 
April 1998, saying a five-year statute of limitations had expired 
long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP reconstructed U.S. troop movements from map coordinates  
in declassified U.S. war records, narrowed the possibilities among 
Army units, then spent months tracing veterans -- some 130 
interviews by telephone and in person -- to pinpoint the companies 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government's civil liability may be limited. It is  
largely protected by U.S. law against foreign lawsuits related to 
``combatant activities,'' although the claimants say the killings 
were not directly combat-related. 
</P>
<P>
	War crimes prosecution appears even less likely. The U.S.  
military code condemns indiscriminate killing of civilians, even if 
a few enemy soldiers are among a large number of noncombatants 
killed, legal experts note. But prosecution so many years later is 
a practical impossibility, they say.

<HEADLINE> Jimenez: U.S. Didn't Deserve Win  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- Miguel Angel Jimenez still is seething  
about the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniard shot a 6-under 66 to share the lead in the  
rain-shortened first round of the German Masters Thursday, but even 
that didn't cool him down. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American players are not the winners,'' Jimenez said. ``I  
don't feel like we lost the match. I feel they didn't deserve it 
after what happened the last day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all the world is pointing at them because of what  
happened on the golf course. It was not professional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Justin Leonard holed a 45-foot putt at the 17th hole, the  
American players and wives poured onto the green in a spontaneous 
celebration. That held up Jose Maria Olazabal's putt, which the 
Spaniard missed to clinch the victory for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	That kicked off a feud, with the Europeans calling the behavior  
of Americans fans and players boorish, and European captain Mark 
James saying his wife was spit at. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans have apologized, but that has not satisfied  
Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Ryder Cup has to be like this in the future, then I  
don't want to play any more Ryder Cups,'' Jimenez said. ``The 
tradition of the Ryder Cup is very important and it was nice to be 
there and to be involved, but what happened in Brookline (Mass.) is 
not what it is about. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed about what happened with the players. I  
can't understand them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish teen-ager Sergio Garcia was positive about his first cup  
experience. Then again, the popular teen had the impression the 
crowds were cheering for him to beat the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Ryder Cup is a great tournament,'' the 19-year-old  
said. ``What happened last week was bad for the Ryder Cup, but 
nobody wants it to go away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia's biggest problem was the way his American caddy, Jerry  
Higginbotham, was attacked at a hotel bar Sunday by a zealous fan. 
The man apparently took exception to the fact he carried the bags 
for a European Ryder Cup player, sending the caddy to the hospital 
with a head wound, two black eyes and a swollen cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed about that,'' Garcia said. ``But Jerry's  
taking it pretty well.''

<HEADLINE> Islanders Sign Top Pick Connolly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York Islanders rewarded center  
Tim Connolly and defenseman Mathieu Biron for making the parent 
club by signing them to three-year deals Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Connolly was the first of the Islanders' four first-round picks  
in this year's Entry Draft and the fifth overall. The Kings made 
Biron the 21st choice in the first round. The choice was acquired 
from Los Angeles as part of the trade for Zigmund Palffy on June 
20. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players signed for the rookie maximum three years, and  
general manager Mike Milbury said their bonus packages were along 
the lines of others drafted in their respective positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They now become two of America's youngest millionaires,''  
Milbury said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign System's Y2K Status Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Air travelers heading for distant parts of the  
world this New Year's holiday could be flying into a void of 
information -- and maybe trouble -- about Y2K preparations, the 
Transportation Department's inspector general says. 
</P>
<P>
	There is major uncertainty about Y2K readiness in some foreign  
countries where Y2K preparedness has been ``sketchy or known to be 
inadequate,'' Kenneth Mead, the transportation official, said in 
testimony prepared for a hearing today of the Senate's special Y2K 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Mead said the International Civil Aviation Organization, a  
U.N.-based group that sets international flight standards, has not 
received responses from 34 of its 185 members about readiness for 
the potential computer glitch at the end of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The concerns are focused primarily on African and Asian  
countries where there is a low amount of air travel. Still, 
officials said, about 1 million passengers last year traveled 
between the United States and the 34 countries yet to respond on 
Y2K. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Smart of the International Federation of Air Line Pilot  
Associations told the Senate panel that pilots were confident of 
flight safety in North America and in the eastern Pacific and 
northern Atlantic regions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are somewhat less confident'' about Eastern Europe and  
other areas of the world, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smart said there was a possibility of airspace and airports  
along main Asia-Europe routes being closed because of air-ground 
communications failures. His association is recommending that 
pilots carry an extra 30 minutes of fuel and that the ICAO make 
military airports available to cope with possible Y2K-induced 
delays and diversions. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA plans to impose flight restrictions if there is a known,  
verifiable safety problem. But Mead said ``we are not persuaded 
this approach will be sufficient because FAA is not likely to have 
verified evidence of problems until after Dec. 31, 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Smallen, spokesman of the Transportation Department's Y2K  
office, said a lack of Y2K readiness does not necessarily means a 
safety problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are telling people that they should be very prudent and  
very careful when making their travel plans, because they could 
face service disruptions and diversions, but at this point we are 
not going beyond that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smallen said the department today is launching a website,  
www.fly2k.dot.gov, that will provide information on what foreign 
countries, airports and airlines have reported their Y2K 
preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestically, Mead said air carriers handling 95 percent of  
passenger and cargo services say they will be Y2K-ready at the end 
of September. The Federal Aviation Administration has given 
assurances that vital aviation systems are prepared to handle the 
year 2000 date rollover and people can be confident that air travel 
in this country will be safe. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mead also noted that 1,900 smaller carriers of the 3,300 air  
carriers surveyed by the FAA about Y2K readiness did not respond, 
and only 107 of 579 non-hub and general aviation airports had 
completed Y2K work as of March 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Y2K-related failures or disruptions are likely to be isolated  
local events in the United States, Mead said, but ``we are 
disappointed at the lack of information concerning the readiness of 
many smaller providers.'' He said the 4,624 public airports not 
associated with the major airport associations had not been 
surveyed by the FAA or the trade associations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem involves older computers that read only the last  
two digits of a year and could mistake the year 2000, or ``00,'' as 
1900, causing systems to malfunction or break down.

<HEADLINE> House Agrees To Cut Crop Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers would pay less for crop insurance  
under a House-passed bill that would double the cost to taxpayers 
for the federally subsidized program. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance now covers about 65 percent of the eligible  
acreage nationally. It primarily covers losses from storms and 
severe drought, but some policies can protect against sharp drops 
in commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no consensus on the issue in the Senate, although bills  
similar to the House-passed legislation have been introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	Many farmers say the insurance is too expensive for the coverage  
they get. 
</P>
<P>
	The government now pays 13 percent to 57 percent of the premium,  
with farmers picking up the rest. Under the House bill, which was 
approved on a voice vote Wednesday, the government would pay from 
31 percent to 67 percent, depending on the level of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	That would push the cost of the program to about $3 billion a  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers need the insurance, but if they can't afford it if  
they're not going to use it,'' said Rep. Leonard Boswell, D-Iowa. 
``This will be a big step, an incentive to get this going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., chairman of the Agriculture  
Committee, prefers cash incentives so farmers can reduce their 
financial risk, whether by buying insurance, paying down debt, 
increasing their savings or selling crops under contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Lugar's committee is expected to have a hearing on the issue  
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	With the agricultural economy in a recession, Congress has been  
searching for ways to provide farmers with a safety net while 
preserving the market-oriented features of the 1996 farm law that 
did away with a Depression-era system of price supports. Lawmakers 
are working on a package of farm aid approaching $9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The House-passed bill also would boost coverage for farmers who  
suffered one or two major crop losses in recent years; authorize 
experimental insurance programs for livestock producers; and allow 
some growers to plant a second crop on land for which they have 
received payment on an insurance claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism of the legislation has been muted, given the poor  
economic times that farmers have faced this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is some concern that cutting insurance premiums will  
increase production of commodities that are already in surplus and 
encourage farmers to plant crops in areas that don't get enough 
rainfall or where the growing season is too short. 
</P>
<P>
	``As farmers today are faced with low prices, largely as a  
result of oversupply and the Asian economic crisis, it is important 
that legislation does not inadvertently subsidize increased 
overproduction,'' Lugar said.

<HEADLINE> Bruins' Dafoe Fuming at Sinden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- After storming out of a meeting with Boston Bruins  
management, holdout goalie Byron Dafoe asked the team to trade him 
if it isn't interested in meeting his price. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can only push a person so far,'' Dafoe said. General  
manager Harry Sinden ``indicated I might have to sit. Well, if 
that's the best for the Boston Bruins, I'll be glad to go somewhere 
else. How can that benefit a hockey team?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dafoe and his agent, Ron Salcer, met with Sinden and assistant  
GM Mike O'Connell on Wednesday in an attempt to end the impasse. 
Dafoe was asking for $4 million a year but has since lowered his 
demands; the Bruins have offered a three-year, $9 million contract 
and have not budged. 
</P>
<P>
	``They made a different proposal, but it's still nowhere near  
where we think it should be,'' O'Connell told the Boston Herald. 
``We've stated our intentions from the get-go, that the deal we 
offered was where we are going to be. We haven't changed that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dafoe told The Boston Globe that Sinden claimed the team  
couldn't afford his request. 
</P>
<P>
	``To quote Harry, he said, `If I were to pay you what you were  
asking for, the Boston Bruins go bankrupt. ... I'm not going to be 
like these other teams and run my team into the ground,''' Dafoe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end, I got up and left. I couldn't take it anymore. For  
him (Sinden) to be crying poverty and to say I'm going to bankrupt 
the team with what I'm asking for, I think that's ridiculous. I 
came home, called the real estate agent, and the sign is going up 
(today).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sinden said he would consider trading Dafoe only if it helped  
the team. But he still wants his goalie back. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as we're concerned, there's no bridges burned. You'd  
have to ask him how he feels,'' he said. ``We haven't taken our 
offer off the table. It's there for him to accept it if he wants 
it. The ideal thing for us would still be that he take our deal and 
sign.''

<HEADLINE> Swissair Won't Carry the Deported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Swissair will no longer carry  
passengers who are being deported forcibly from Switzerland, the 
company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss national carrier's decision came into force Sept. 10,  
spokesman Urs Peter Naef said. 
</P>
<P>
	Incidents involving people resisting deportation have caused  
increasing problems with passengers and flight crews, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one such case in May, a Congolese man escaped deportation  
after fellow passengers on a Swissair flight to Kinshasa attacked 
his three police guards during a stopover in Cameroon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss officers returned to Switzerland because local  
authorities wouldn't let the plane continue unless the detainee was 
taken back.

<HEADLINE> CIA Sets Up Venture Capital Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The Central Intelligence Agency is  
becoming more overt with its covert operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is setting up a venture capital company in Silicon  
Valley that will help it keep up with the latest technological 
inventions and ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rapid and unprecedented pace of technological change and  
the evolution of our national security environment dictates a 
change in the way the intelligence community does business,'' said 
CIA Director George Tenet. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, which normally operates under a cloak of secrecy,  
received $28.5 million in seed money from Congress to charter 
``In-Q-It.'' The company will invest in high-tech firms, share 
information with universities and form joint ventures to solve such 
questions as security in the new Internet culture and use of the 
Web for gathering information. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll work with outside companies. We'll be as nimble as we  
possibly can. We're trying not to be a laboratory,'' Gilman Louie, 
an outsider hired as In-Q-It's chief operating officer, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Louie, 39, founded his own electronic game company -- MicroProse  
Inc. -- that was later bought by Hasboro. At Hasboro, he has been an 
executive with the toy company's online business group. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the goals will be to bring CIA operatives up to speed on  
browser security and faster search engines, Louie said. 
</P>
<P>
	In-Q-It also will try to support technologies that will help the  
CIA better organize and use its information. 
</P>
<P>
	Louie cited the accidental May 7 bombing of the Chinese embassy  
in Yugoslavia -- a target picked by the CIA -- as ``the manifestation 
of the worst result that could happen if you don't have all your 
information lined up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company has a board of directors that includes well-known  
high-tech figures and former Defense Secretary William Perry. Louie 
said the company will remain small, with no more than 25 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Louie and the CIA stressed that the company would deal with  
unclassified projects, at least initially. 
</P>
<P>
	The project ``grew out of the recognition here of a need to find  
new ways to harness the capabilities of the private sector to deal 
with some of the more difficult problems of information 
technology,'' said CIA spokesman Bill Harlow. 
</P>
<P>
	Louie said the CIA now is the upstart company's only customer,  
but other private-sector clients might be sought. He said he 
expected the company to become self-sustaining from its 
investments, with an eventual annual budget of about $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's board of directors includes Perry; John Seely  
Brown, director of the Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research 
Center; Norm Augustine, chairman of Lockheed Martin; and former 
AT&AMP;T President Alex Mandl. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the name, ``In'' stands for intelligence, ``It'' stands  
for information technology, and the Q in the middle is in honor of 
British gadgets expert ``Q'' in the James Bond movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have a sense of humor,'' said Harlow.

<HEADLINE>  Strong Quake Shakes Southern Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A strong earthquake rocked southern Mexico on  
Thursday, toppling church towers and old homes in Oaxaca and 
shaking buildings in the capital. At least eight people were killed 
and an unknown number injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 7.5 and it was centered  
275 miles southeast of Mexico City, the U.S. Geological Survey in 
Golden, Colo. said. It hit at about 11:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. EDT). 
</P>
<P>
	Moderate damage was reported in Oaxaca City, the state capital,  
where church steeples and many homes collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world is coming to an end!'' a secretary screamed as she  
and dozens of others ran out of the state legislature building 
after the 11:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. EDT) quake. The temblor lasted for 
several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jose Murat Casab said at least eight people died in his  
state. Two deaths occurred when a doorway collapsed in a store in 
Oaxaca City, crushing a man and a woman who had taken refuge 
underneath. Another man was crushed by debris while fleeing from 
his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more women died in the small village of Santo Domingo  
Teojomulco and one in San Jose del Progreso. In Miahuatlan, a woman 
was killed by falling debris, and a 12-year-old girl in Tuxtepec 
died of a heart attack that was attributed to the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 houses were badly damaged in the state, Murat Casab  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only minor damage was reported in Huatulco, a popular tourist  
resort near the epicenter. Mayor Jorge Sanchez Cruz said there was 
``normal panic'' there. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the nearby resort of Puerto Escondido, 15 buildings were  
damaged and electricity was cut. City Hall spokeswoman Norma 
Alquitra said nobody was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal environmental officials said water and sewage treatment  
plants were damaged in 95 percent of Oaxaca state, Notimex 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico City, thousands of people rushed out of offices and  
gathered along Reforma Avenue and other major thoroughfares in the 
capital, staring at skyscrapers that were visibly moving. Shattered 
glass was seen falling from some buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was frightened. It lasted a long time,'' said Thalia  
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually they feel like gelatin,'' said Abel Cueller, an  
engineer who was on the 10th floor of an office building during the 
quake. ``This one was more of a shaker'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quake was felt as far south as Chiapas state, 500 miles  
southeast of Mexico City. It bounced some cars onto sidewalks along 
Mexico City roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico City, one of the world's largest cities with nearly 20  
million residents in the metro area, last suffered a major quake on 
Sept. 19, 1985 when an 8.1-magnitude quake struck and killed at 
least 9,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	A 7.6-magnitude earthquake in Taiwan on Sept. 21 left more than  
2,000 dead and a 7.4-magnitude temblor left more than 15,000 dead 
in Turkey on Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	A magnitude-6.7 quake June 15 in a sparsely populated mountain  
area 165 miles southwest of Mexico City killed at least 17 people 
and injured nearly 200. More than 7,700 homes were damaged or 
destroyed, mostly in Oaxaca and Puebla states.

<HEADLINE> Mental Disorder Gene Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scientists have identified a faulty gene behind  
one of the most common causes of mental retardation in females, a 
step that should help doctors better diagnose the confusing and 
incurable disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	The research involving Rett syndrome was reported in the October  
issue of the journal Nature Genetics. It could help doctors find 
out what goes wrong in the brain, which might lead to a treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rett syndrome almost invariably strikes girls. They develop  
normally until age 6 months to 18 months, then gradually lose the 
ability to speak, walk and control their hands. They withdraw from 
contact with other people and develop repetitive hand-wringing and 
seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	The syndrome probably affects 8,000 to 10,000 girls and women in  
the United States, said Dr. Alan Percy, chairman of the 
professional advisory board of the International Rett Syndrome 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for the gene has been hampered because Rett only  
rarely runs in families. The vast majority of the time, it strikes 
just once, apparently because of a one-time genetic mutation in an 
egg or sperm. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of the gene that becomes mutated was reported by  
Dr. Huda Zoghbi of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and 
the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Dr. Uta Francke of Stanford 
University and the institute, and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists do not know yet whether it is the only gene that  
causes the disorder. But it probably is at least the main gene, 
said Eric Hoffman of Children's National Medical Center in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Duane Alexander, director of the National Institute of Child  
Health and Human Development, which helped pay for the work, called 
the discovery ``a definite turning point, which we hope will soon 
lead to better diagnosis and, ultimately, treatment for this 
disorder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gene, called MECP2, lies on the X chromosome. Males have  
only one copy of that chromosome per cell, and if it carries a 
defective MECP2 gene, they die before birth or shortly after. Girls 
have two X chromosomes, one inherited from each parent. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoghbi's study found mutations in MECP2 in five of 21 Rett  
patients, as well as in two affected half-sisters. The remaining 
patients may have mutations in parts of the gene that have not been 
examined yet, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoghbi said she sees no reason to screen all newborn girls for  
the genetic defect until an effective treatment is developed.

<HEADLINE> Not Even Daly Knows What Lies Ahead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. (AP) -- The eve of the Buick Challenge was a  
typical night for John Daly ever since he decided once again that 
happiness on the golf course depends largely on whether he can get 
a drink. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had four Miller Lites and a big chimichanga,'' Daly said.  
</P>
<P>
	In his lifelong battle against alcoholism, this night was a  
draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to quit drinking,'' he said. ``I just don't want  
to get drunk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly was all smiles Thursday at Callaway Gardens. Grossly  
overweight in olive-colored pants that bagged around his ankles, he 
went through at least one cigarette per hole, signed autographs 
during his round of even-par 72 and then headed out to the driving 
range. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he is free again, no longer bound by his contract with  
his main sponsor, Callaway Golf, that required him to stay off the 
bottle and out of casinos. He says he wants to play like the 
slugger who won the PGA Championship and British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	What Daly cannot say is whether another night awaits like the  
one in Jacksonville Beach, Fla., two years ago, when he poured down 
shots and ripped up his hotel room in a drunken rage. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know with me,'' Daly said bluntly.  
</P>
<P>
	In life, much like with his golf, there are no guarantees with  
Daly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what to think,'' said Jay Haas, one of several  
PGA Tour peers confused by Daly's return to drinking. ``I suppose 
past history shows he shouldn't be doing what he's doing. Whether 
he can handle it this time remains to be seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly's latest attempt to stay sober ended after a 26-month run  
that cost him his Callaway contract when he refused to go back to a 
rehab center for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
	From a business standpoint, Daly said he regrets parting ways  
with 80-year-old founder Ely Callaway, who is a distant relative to 
the Callaway clan that developed the plush resort where the Buick 
Challenge is being played this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly turned his back on about $3 million, but he said maybe  
that's for the best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Mr. C. made it too easy for me,'' he said. ``The money  
was too good and I didn't practice hard enough. It's going to make 
me hungry, that money not coming in like it was. We've got great 
purses. There's a ton of money out there, and it's time for me to 
earn my money again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Daly said he finally reached the conclusion that  
drinking is part of his life. ``It's in my blood,'' is the chilling 
phrase he told Golf World magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said he came to a crossroads and took a long, hard look in  
both directions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was either golf and drinking, or no golf and no drinking,''  
he said. ``I made a decision to keep playing golf. This is what I 
do. This is my talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the drinking, Daly told himself, is part of the package.  
</P>
<P>
	``I could give up the game and probably stay sober and do  
speeches and stuff,'' he said. ``It would be a hell of a lot easier 
because I'd be out of the spotlight and out of the game. But I 
can't do both. There ain't no way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is not much to suggest Daly, who started drinking when he  
was 8, can control his drinking this time around. 
</P>
<P>
	He won the British Open sober in 1995, started ``social  
drinking'' a year later and then lost control that night in 
Jacksonville Beach during The Players Championship, a binge that 
led to divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think sometimes, you can control alcohol,'' Daly said. ``And  
for everybody who has ever been there and gotten really drunk, 
there are certain times in their lives that they don't think 
alcohol does take over. It's not a good feeling when you can barely 
walk, or laying by a commode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly admits that pressure to stay sober helped drive him to  
drink again. He said he was trying to live up to everyone else's 
expectations, and ``you can't make somebody do something they don't 
want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 33 years old,'' he said. ``It's a decision I have to  
make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he envisions the day when he no longer has a craving for  
a drink. A statement two weeks ago on his Web site -- 
gripitandripit.com -- said his commitment to live a sober life 
remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
	When will that day come? Daly could only shrug.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's still one day at a time,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Final Candlestick Game Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- When the San Francisco Giants move downtown  
next season, leaving wind-swept Candlestick Park to the NFL's 
49ers, they'll take four decades of memories to the new stadium, 
and little else. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't miss the place,'' Giants senior vice president Pat  
Gallagher said. ``We had a lot of meetings to think about what we 
wanted to take from Candlestick to the new park, and we couldn't 
think of a thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few pitchers will miss a park in which popups blew over the  
outfield wall for homers. Neither will fans, who came to August 
games in ski jackets and gloves. 
</P>
<P>
	The lousy weather, which became a part of Candlestick lore  
almost from the day it opened in 1960, forced players to come up 
with survival strategies. They tried a variety of tricks to stay 
warm at Candlestick, where a perfectly nice day could suddenly 
become arctic as a cold fog descended on the park. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Murcer heated his bat in the Giants' clubhouse sauna  
before plate appearances. The Atlanta Braves hugged hot-water 
bottles in the dugout. Right fielders sometimes skipped into the 
clubhouse between innings for coffee, or whatever else they could 
find to ward off the cold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never got cold out here. I would make sure I had a lot of  
oil on me, like a swimmer. They could smell me on the bench,'' said 
Willie Mays, who wore heating balm on his back. 
</P>
<P>
	Mays had other ways of adapting to the weird weather. In fact,  
he used a simple formula for coping with the swirling winds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take two steps in and five steps back, and get the ball,'' he  
explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Candlestick, which had its final major league game today as the  
Giants faced the Los Angeles Dodgers, opened on April 12, 1960 -- 
two seasons after the Giants moved west from New York. Vice 
President Richard Nixon and Hall of Famer Ty Cobb presided over the 
opening ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Candlestick, now the fifth-oldest park in the majors, was home  
to Willie McCovey, Juan Marichal and Mays, who hit 203 homers there 
and undoubtedly would have hit many more if not for the gusts 
blowing in from left field. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the few opposing players who enjoyed Candlestick was San  
Diego's Tony Gwynn, whose 134 hits tie him for fifth among visitors 
to the park. Pete Rose tops the list with 201 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to miss it because Willie Mays is not going to play  
in the other park. This place has a lot of history,'' Gwynn said. 
``That's just a little disappointing, seeing a place where Willie 
Mays, Willie McCovey and Jim Ray Hart played not being used 
anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Candlestick was the site of the Beatles' final concert, on Aug.  
29, 1966. When the group took the stage behind second base, John 
Lennon's first words to the crowd were not surprising. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bit chilly,'' he complained.  
</P>
<P>
	The stadium survived the Oct. 17, 1989, earthquake that  
interrupted the World Series for 10 days. But one fan in Section 
51, atop the center-field stands, probably needed years of 
psychotherapy -- the 7.1 quake opened an expansion joint next to his 
seat, leaving him staring down 12 stories to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	About the only person in the ballpark who didn't immediately  
realize it was an earthquake was elevator operator Bob Goodman, who 
has been working at Candlestick since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``The elevator had been shaking all homestand. I was going up  
and it was shaking again that night, and I didn't think twice about 
it,'' he said. ``When I opened the door, it was the weirdest site I 
ever saw. The whole world was going back and forth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marichal was scheduled to throw out the ceremonial first pitch  
today. Mays was to throw the final pitch, after the Dodgers-Giants 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium was renamed 3Com Park in 1996, but almost no one  
called it that. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the 'Stick. It'll always be the 'Stick,'' Gallagher said.  
``That was the only good thing about the ballpark, the name.''

<HEADLINE> Disneyland Paris Plans Second Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Euro Disney has announced plans to open a second  
theme park outside Paris, hoping Europeans will embrace its new 
exhibit on show business the way they have warmed to Mickey Mouse 
and Space Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Disney Studios,'' a behind-the-screen look at the movies,  
is set to open in the spring of 2002 next to the existing Magic 
Kingdom theme park in Marne-La-Vallee, east of Paris, at a cost of 
about $670 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The park, which takes its inspiration from French, European and  
Hollywood cinema, cartoons and television, is similar in theme to 
Disney-MGM Studios at Walt Disney World in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney chief Gilles Pelisson said visitors to the park will  
watch cartoonists at work, attend special effects shows and watch 
shoots of TV programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is that visitors pass through the movie screen and  
see what's behind it,'' Pelisson said. ``It's about interaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Euro Disney officials also intend for the park, planned since  
1987, to become home to movie shoots and other artistic endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Disney Co. has said it will put up 39 percent of the  
capital, in keeping with its current commitment to Euro Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the park is fully operational in 2003, the company expects  
an estimated 4.2 million visitors annually. The company has not yet 
determined a ticket price for park, which will have a separate 
entrance from the Magic Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	Euro Disney executives have promised the park will create 1,500  
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-of-center government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin  
has made jobs its first priority. Euro Disney already employs 
10,000 people and has said it will favor young people in its staff 
for the second theme park. 
</P>
<P>
	Disneyland Paris opened in April 1992 to widespread concern --  
and some heavy criticism -- that American-style family entertainment 
would not catch on in the Old World. 
</P>
<P>
	Some financial analysts worried that Europeans would balk at the  
prices. But Disneyland Paris proved itself in 1995 by posting 
profits a year ahead of schedule.

<HEADLINE> Stars Set To Defend Stanley Cup / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Brett Hull limped through the Dallas Stars locker  
room Thursday favoring the leg with the still-healing knee ligament 
and sporting a nasty green bruise across the back of the other 
thigh. 
</P>
<P>
	``The knee is fine,'' he said. ``It's everything else that's  
killing me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's no time for rest now. The nine-month-long physical and  
mental grind that is the NHL season begins Friday night with the 
Stars opening their Stanley Cup defense at home against the 
Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	One-hundred-three days will have passed since Hull's  
foot-in-crease goal clinched the title in a triple-overtime 
thriller in Buffalo. While the time off is several years worth of 
vacations in the real world, it's extremely short for guys with pro 
sports teams, especially the brutal NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players want more money, owners want money, the fans have to  
pay more money. As a result, we're getting less time off,'' Stars 
veteran Brian Skrudland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant Marshall, who tore a groin muscle, is the only Dallas  
player who won't play because of a lingering injury. But others are 
still feeling the effects of a 1998-99 season that came within 22 
hours of covering all four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Hull's torn medial collateral ligament, disguised as a groin  
injury during the finals, isn't totally healed. Neither is Shawn 
Chambers' arthroscopically repaired knee. And even though Mike 
Modano's fractured wrist has healed, he still feels stiffness in 
the wrist and fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	The pain will disappear shortly before 7 p.m. Friday when the  
various trophies the Stars won last season are brought onto the 
ice. After a light and laser show that will include a video montage 
of last season's great moments, the first championship banner in 
franchise history will go up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's going to be a lot of emotion,'' Dallas coach  
Ken Hitchcock said. ``I know for me it's going to be a proud moment 
when that banner goes up because I recognize all the hard work 
players past and present put into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One person in attendance who'll understand the feeling is Mario  
Lemieux, a two-time Cup winner for the Penguins and their new 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	From his new perspective, Lemieux hopes his former  
teammates-turned-employees soak in the ceremony and envision being 
the guests of honor of a similar presentation this time next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be exciting for everyone in the organization to  
be there and see all of the festivities and hopefully one day come 
back here and regain the Cup,'' Lemieux said. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other NHL game Friday night will be in Edmonton, where  
the Oilers and New York Rangers will hold a pregame ceremony in 
honor of Wayne Gretzky. The Great One's No. 99 jersey will be 
raised in advance of the league-wide retirement of his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas-Pittsburgh game pits one of the NHL's best defenses  
against an offense led by reigning scoring champion Jaromir Jagr, 
last season's league MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars have turned over their roster a bit to become younger,  
faster and more talented. Hitchcock has responded by emphasizing 
offense more, which means Dallas will be less likely to try sitting 
on 1-0 leads. 
</P>
<P>
	The new offense and Jagr's presence combined with opening-night  
jitters could result in a wide-open game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't imagine either team is going to be very  
conservative,'' Hitchcock said. ``There's going to be a lot of 
energy in the building for both teams. It should be a pretty wild 
ride.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Co. Agrees To Remove Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- An Internet company agreed to pull a  
magazine advertisement that showed Muslims praying after an Islamic 
group complained that the ad was offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad for Internet search engine GoTo.com, which appeared in  
computer and trade magazines, included the image of kneeling Muslim 
men and the words: ``With our search on your site, you can build a 
more loyal following. ... OK, so they won't worship you, but 
they'll come back to your site more often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company agreed Wednesday to pull the ad after receiving a  
complaint from the Southern California office of the Council on 
American-Islamic Relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no intention to offend anyone and we're very sorry if  
in fact that's what's taken away from that advertisement,'' said 
Jeffrey Brewer, chief executive officer of the Pasadena-based 
company. The ad ``slipped through'' the company's review process, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the council's Southern  
California branch, said he applauded the company's quick response. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that this unfortunate incident will help sensitize  
other companies to Muslim concerns and prevent a similar occurrence 
in the future,'' Ayloush said.

<HEADLINE> Body Found in Steel Drum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) -- Detectives have identified the remains of a  
pregnant woman found stuffed in a steel drum, painting the picture 
of a worker killed three decades ago by her boss after their affair 
spiraled out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyna Angelica Marroquin, a Salvadoran immigrant, is thought to  
have been about 28 when several blows to the head killed her in 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative identification was made public Wednesday. The body  
was found Sept. 3 under the former Jericho home of Howard Elkin, 
Ms. Marroquin's former employer. 
</P>
<P>
	Elkin and his wife moved from Long Island to Florida in 1972. A  
little more than two weeks ago, on Sept. 10 and the day after 
Nassau County detectives interviewed him in Boca Raton, Fla., Elkin 
shot himself to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Ms. Marroquin was a factory worker at a flower  
business owned by Elkin. An address book found with the body 
contained his name, along with the address and phone number of a 
confidant of Ms. Marroquin's. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities tracked down the confidant, a former volunteer at a  
Manhattan home for women operated by nuns. It was where Ms. 
Marroquin lived shortly after coming to the United States in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman told police she had received a frantic phone call from  
Ms. Marroquin in early 1969, saying she had made a ``big mistake'' 
by calling Elkin's wife to tell her she was pregnant with his 
child, Nassau County Police Detective Sgt. Robert Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She told her confidant either that she was afraid he was now  
going to kill her, or that he had actually threatened to kill 
her,'' Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Marroquin had asked the confidant, whose name was not  
released, to come to a New Jersey residence where Elkin had put her 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	When the woman arrived, the front door was wide open and a warm  
meal was still on the table, but Ms. Marroquin was not there. She 
went to police, but left after she was told that only family 
members could file missing persons reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty years later, Ms. Marroquin's mummified body was found in  
a drum by the present owners of Elkin's former home, prompting 
authorities to track him down in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives are awaiting DNA tests results on Ms. Marroquin's  
nine-month old fetus to determine if Elkin was the father. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said their initial key to Ms. Marroquin's identity  
came when her Social Security number was found in the barely 
legible and decaying address book. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pages were like pulp, stuck together and saturated,'' said  
Edwards. ``Detectives in our documents unit brought the book back 
to life.''

<HEADLINE> Jump-Starting Babies' Vision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Newborns have incredibly poor eyesight that  
depends on brain stimulation to sharpen. Now a study suggests 
infants' brains are so flexible that just an hour of visual 
stimulation can jump-start that process. 
</P>
<P>
	A healthy adult's vision is about 40 times better than a  
newborn's. That's one reason baby mobiles are sold in sharply 
contrasting patterns -- those are easiest for infants to spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the first six months of life, infants' vision improves  
fivefold as their brains are stimulated to establish the neural 
network necessary to see. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is how much visual stimulation a baby needs.  
</P>
<P>
	Daphne Maurer, a vision researcher at Canada's McMaster  
University, studied 28 babies born with severe cataracts. They 
could distinguish between light and dark but nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
	The cataracts were removed between 1 week and 9 months of age.  
Then, the hour they were fitted with artificial lenses to finally 
process light, Maurer began testing their vision. She used cards 
with black and white stripes of varying sizes. Babies look away 
from the cards when the stripe is too small for them to see, 
allowing visual measurement. 
</P>
<P>
	Right after surgery, the babies had the poor vision of newborns.  
</P>
<P>
	But after as little as one hour of visual stimulation, these  
sight-deprived infants could see one stripe better. It doesn't 
sound like a huge improvement, but actually normal newborns, used 
to gradual visual stimulation, take a month to improve that much, 
Maurer reports Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows us that the nervous system is wired in such a way  
that it can respond quickly to visual input,'' Maurer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next month, the cataract babies' vision still lagged  
behind normal babies, but their brains adjusted so fast that they 
cut the gap in half. 
</P>
<P>
	Babies who had very early surgery recovered best, because the  
brain is most flexible in early infancy, Maurer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study ``demonstrates the amazing plasticity of the young  
human brain, and underscores the importance of complete, balanced 
early sensory input,'' wrote Ruxandra Sireteanu of Germany's Max 
Planck Institute for Brain Research in analyzing the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Congenital cataracts are very rare, occurring in one in 10,000  
births. But the findings are applicable to other vision problems, 
suggesting babies with signs of trouble need prompt examination, 
Maurer said. 
</P>
<P>
	But if eye trouble is discovered late, ``don't give up,'' she  
added. ``The effectiveness of any therapeutic intervention is going 
to be harder, but there's some neural plasticity even in us old 
folks.''

<HEADLINE> AMC Plans Job Cuts, Office Closings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The movie theater company AMC  
Entertainment expects to cut $20 million in costs by closing three 
regional offices and eliminating 100 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The offices set to close are in Los Angeles, Philadelphia and  
Clearwater, Fla., AMC chairman Peter Brown said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the remaining 300 jobs in those offices will be  
transferred to Kansas City, Brown said, estimating that the changes 
will reduce AMC's general and administrative costs by 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	No theaters are to be closed as part of AMC's cost-cutting  
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	When Brown took the helm of AMC in July, after the death of  
founder Stan Durwood, he said he would look for ways to trim fat 
and strengthen AMC's core business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing of these moves is a reflection of the new  
management's philosophy of centralization,'' said AMC spokeswoman 
Brenda Nolte. ``As to why this specific time, we're between two 
major peak times in our business -- summer and holiday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Daniel O'Neill of Credit Suisse First Boston said he was  
pleasantly surprised by AMC's savings estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time I talked to them about this, the number was more  
like $10 million,'' O'Neill said.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Still Feels Like Underdog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill  
Bradley said Thursday, ``I feel like the underdog,'' but the signs 
contradicted him: he signed autographs and joked with youngsters, 
clearly upbeat as new campaign finance reports showed that he had 
more money in the bank than Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by the shakeup in Gore's campaign and the fresh spending  
figures but as cautious as ever, Bradley said at a news conference, 
``I don't think we have momentum, I think we have a little 
traction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley raised an estimated $6.7 million between July and  
September, spokeswoman Anita Dunn said. Gore raised around $6.5 
million during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	By spending less than $4.2 million during the last three months,  
Bradley wound up with more than $10 million in the bank. Gore aides 
said the vice president would have between $9.5 million and $10 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a snapshot at a particular moment,'' Bradley said.  
``Life's volatile, campaigns are volatile, and I think ultimately 
we have to get known by more people.'' Bradley said he believed at 
least 40 percent of Americans have no idea who he is. 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator has repeatedly painted himself as  
an underdog to Gore, and said Thursday that he faced an uphill 
fight against ``entrenched power'' and the ``symbolism'' Gore 
wields by arriving at campaign stops in Air Force Two. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like an underdog. I always feel like an underdog, and  
here there are some numbers to confirm it,'' he said, referring to 
polls that show him trailing Gore in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidentally, the vice president used that same term to  
describe the state of his campaign. ``I now am, in effect, the 
underdog,'' he said Thursday, a day after announcing he would move 
his headquarters to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said he thought that Bradley has  
``clearly grown'' as a campaigner since his days running for the 
Senate. ``He's more engaging, more focused. His campaign is better 
managed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli, who said he was staying neutral in the Democratic  
presidential race, said Bradley ``was notorious for quickly the 
spending the money he raised'' as a Senate campaigner But, he said, 
``he's now running a very tight organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was upbeat as he campaigned Thursday, signing  
autographs, telling jokes to more than 200 supporters at a rally, 
then bringing them to rapt silence with a story about a 
fourth-grader who told her teacher it was her sibling's turn, not 
hers, to eat breakfast one recent morning. 
</P>
<P>
	He drew repeated applause with pledges to ``bring not just some,  
but all of us to higher ground'' amid the booming economy, and to 
improve race relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Several supporters said it was Bradley's emphasis on racial  
harmony that appealed to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a candidate, he's one of the few that's thought carefully  
about issues of race in this country and has actually come up with 
ideas on how to address it,'' said Dr. Lisa Benton, a trauma 
physician at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	At the hospital, Bradley spent his third consecutive day in  
California pitching his health care proposal, designed to enroll 95 
percent of Americans in health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley led a round-table discussion on health care at the  
hospital, where he faced questions about the plan's specifics, but 
widespread support for its goal of near-universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``No American, or no human being inside America's borders,  
should be without health care,'' said Rebecca Denison, who said she 
had been infected with the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference afterward, Bradley faced far more questions  
about his surging candidacy than about his health-care proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made a concerted effort to reach out to new people who  
have never been a part of the process, let them know I'm serious 
about such things as campaign finance reform,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	He insisted the financial numbers had not given him or his staff  
any emotional boost. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't get an adrenaline boost in the second quarter,'' he  
said. ``You get an adrenaline boost when you're in the final 
minutes of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Gore likened the Democratic presidential contest  
to a choice between Coke and Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
	Told of that comment Thursday, the famously dry Bradley said:  
``Really? I always thought I was 'diet wild cherry.'''

<HEADLINE> D-Backs' Durazo Rockets to Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Of all the great baseball stories that have  
evolved in Arizona this summer, Erubial Durazo's might be the best. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old first baseman tore through the Diamondbacks'  
minor league system in three torrid months before being called up 
to the big club, where he took over as starter from slumping Travis 
Lee and never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do my job everywhere I go,'' said the shy young man with  
braces who has become a national sensation in his native Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Since coming to the Diamondbacks on July 25, Durazo has hit .327  
in 150 at-bats with 11 home runs and 29 RBIs. A left-handed batter, 
he has homered to all three fields. Two of his home runs were among 
the team's biggest hits this season -- off John Smoltz Sept. 4 at 
Atlanta -- as the Diamondbacks rallied for a 5-4 victory to end a 
three-game skid that had seen their lead in the NL West dip to five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the best complement you could give him is when you  
look at him now, you don't even think this guy came from Double-A 
ball three months ago,'' Arizona reliever Dan Plesac said. ``He's 
played so well and his defense has improved so dramatically that 
now it seems like he's a five-year player. He's got as many big 
hits for us as anybody else on the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is not Durazo's first stint in the state of Arizona. He  
grew up on a ranch near Hermasillo, Mexico, and moved to Tucson for 
his senior year in high school in hopes that he would have a better 
shot at being noticed by major league scouts. He stuck around after 
graduation and attended Pima Community College. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a skinny kid then, just 175 pounds, and was mostly a  
pitcher. The scouts apparently weren't impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Durazo went back to Mexico, went to work on the ranch and played  
semipro baseball. Derek Bryant, a well-known manager in Mexico who 
now manages Arizona's Class A team at High Desert, Calif., had 
watched Durazo since the youngster was 15, and he persuaded him to 
sign with Monterrey. 
</P>
<P>
	Durazo worked his way up through the Mexican minor league system  
and made it to Monterrey as a right fielder in 1997 and was rookie 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked out constantly to build up to 225 pounds on his  
6-foot-3 frame. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden the strength and everything caught up with  
him,'' said Arizona manager Buck Showalter, who admits he's a bit 
mystified at Durazo's surge to the big-time. ``He's 25 years old, 
and I don't have a whole lot of answers where he's concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, he hit .350 with Monterrey and, at Bryant's urging, the  
Diamondbacks purchased Durazo's contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Durazo started the season at Double-A El Paso, where he hit .403  
with 14 homers and 55 RBIs in 64 games. On June 19, he was promoted 
to Triple-A Tucson, where he hit .417 in 28 games with 10 homers 
and 28 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like `Wow, let's see if he can do it at the next  
level.' `Wow, he did it at this level, let's see if he can do it at 
the next level,''' Showalter said. ``He'd be the first to tell you 
the jury's still out, but he's handled everything thrown at him so 
far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Durazo quietly insists he has not been overwhelmed by his sudden  
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't read the paper or watch TV. I don't want to get  
distracted,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he is far from satisfied.  
</P>
<P>
	``You never know in baseball. It's a tough career,'' Durazo  
said. ``Sometimes guys make it two or three months. I'm not happy. 
I want to stay here a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Joe Garagiola Jr. is confident about Durazo's  
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see anything in his approach that suggests that he's  
going to be one of these one-year or half-of-one-year wonders, that 
he has some real hole in his game that people will be able to 
figure out and exploit,'' Garagiola said. 
</P>
<P>
	Durazo's emergence has created speculation about the future of  
Lee, signed to a then-record $10 million bonus in 1996 as the 
supposed cornerstone of the new franchise. Lee went out with an 
ankle injury shortly after Durazo's arrival and has played two 
games in right field since returning. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee might be lucrative trade material in the offseason.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's a question for another time,'' Garagiola said. ``A lot  
of times these things have a way of working themselves out.''

<HEADLINE> Beatty Gives 'Majorette' Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Actor-director Warren Beatty says  
he won't let ``monied, honeyed voices of ridicule and reaction'' 
stop him from considering a presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to Hollywood's liberal elite Wednesday night, Beatty  
drew several rounds of applause, but didn't deliver what the crowd 
came to hear: A yes or no about his presidential intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	That will come later in the campaign season.  
</P>
<P>
	He did promise to champion the causes of American liberalism  
whether he runs or not. He criticized the Democratic Party for 
looking Republican, and questioned whether Democratic presidential 
candidates Al Gore and Bill Bradley are true to the party's 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there no protest anymore?'' Beatty told a celebrity-studded  
audience of several hundred people during a speech to the Southern 
California Americans for Democratic Action ``Are we coming to the 
point where the Democratic Party has to have a Republican president 
to find its voice again?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ever the actor, Beatty framed his presidential intentions by  
giving advice to an imaginary character -- a drum majorette. 
</P>
<P>
	``If an unexpected person showed that he or she had that spirit  
and the ability to lead and said to me, `Look, there's no liberal 
running for president' ... and if serious people of good judgment 
are actually talking to that person about running ... it would make 
no difference to me whether that person became well known as a 
basketball player or a businessman or wrestler or a grocery store 
clerk or a drum majorette. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say, `Look, drum majorette. There's no harm in thinking  
about this -- however unlikely it might be. But whatever you do, go 
ahead and speak up. Speak up for the people nobody speaks up for,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you speak up well, maybe you'll influence some people.  
Maybe you'll influence the candidates that are running,'' Beatty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One more thing, drum majorette,'' he said. ``When you start  
hearing those monied, honied voices of ridicule and reaction, let 
them call you coy. Let them call you flirtatious. But keep 
talking.''

<HEADLINE> Donor Gives $60M to Air&AMP;Space Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Hungarian American businessman has bestowed  
the Smithsonian's National Air &AMP; Space Museum with $60 million, the 
largest gift in the Smithsonian's 153 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven F. Udvar-Hazy, 53, made the donation for the new Air &AMP;  
Space Museum's annex at Dulles International Airport in Virginia, 
about 35 miles from the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``This wonderful gift is a great beginning for the campaign to  
build the new Dulles Center. It is yet another indication of the 
support of the American people for the Smithsonian Institution,'' 
I. Michael Heyman, the outgoing secretary of the Smithsonian, told 
The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Udvar-Hazy, a jet pilot, is head of the world's largest aircraft  
leasing company, International Lease Financial Corp., based in 
Beverly Hills, Calif. Forbes magazine named him the 120th richest 
person in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	His donation will go toward a $130 million capital campaign to  
build the annex, which will be four times the size of the museum on 
the National Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	To be completed in 2003, the annex will hold the newest and  
largest crafts in the museum's collection.

<HEADLINE> Religion in the News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In December 1995, American Catholic scholar  
George Weigel found himself in Rome listening to a lecture when a 
seminarian slipped into the hall and tapped him on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope's secretary is on the phone for you, he whispered.  
</P>
<P>
	Monsignor Stanislaw Dziwisz, Pope John Paul II's longtime aide,  
was calling to ask, ``Can you come over for dinner tonight? Off I 
went.'' The pope had met Weigel several times before, but this was 
far from a routine occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul wanted Weigel to write his biography.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week Weigel was in Rome to give the pope his first look at  
the resulting 992-page doorstopper: ``Witness to Hope: The 
Biography of Pope John Paul II'' (Cliff Street Books, $35). By 
coincidence, this respectful account of John Paul reaches stores 
alongside ``Hitler's Pope,'' John Cornwell's biographical assault 
on the World War II-era pope, Pius XII, and his record of not 
confronting the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	A onetime seminarian and daily communicant at St. Jane Frances  
de Chantal parish in Bethesda, Md., Weigel, 48, was president of a 
conservative think tank, the Ethics and Public Policy Center in 
Washington, D.C., when the pope made his request. He will return 
there as a researcher after a world tour to promote his book's 
English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, Polish and Slovenian 
editions. (Other translations are under negotiation.) 
</P>
<P>
	More than other biographies of John Paul II, Weigel's work was  
shaped by Catholic insiders -- most notably the pope himself, who 
gave Weigel 10 interviews spanning 20 hours, invariably over a 
meal. John Paul granted Weigel not just unusual access to himself 
but remarkable freedom to write whatever he wanted without Vatican 
clearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Rome had reason to worry -- John Paul II made a shrewder  
choice than Ronald Reagan, subject of an authorized biography in 
which the author has stirred controversy by appearing as a 
semi-fictional character. Weigel is a straightforward researcher 
and he's a fan of this pope and his traditionalist policies. In an 
interview, Weigel proudly called himself ``very much a John Paul II 
Catholic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he does give a bit of attention to such papal critics as the  
``We Are the Church'' movement, which roused 1.5 million Germans to 
sign a petition demanding women's ordination and protesting other 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The biographer set to work in 1996, equipped with an endorsement  
letter from John Paul, ample access to documents, and assurances 
that the pope and Dziwisz would urge cooperation upon anyone who 
checked with them. Weigel wangled interviews with 43 Vatican 
officials (only two refused) and a vast array of Catholics 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Most important were the 54 Poles, since Weigel thinks John  
Paul's work as an archbishop and cardinal in Cracow was ``a preview 
of his pontificate. He, the supposed outsider, didn't need a lot of 
instruction from the people who run popes. He came in with a 
formulated idea of how to be a pope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weigel wrote a 1992 book depicting John Paul's influence as a  
key reason European Communism collapsed when it did and with little 
bloodshed. Hostility to the Kremlin was fermenting prior to John 
Paul, but ``it was not connected with popular piety and a mass 
movement,'' Weigel explains. 
</P>
<P>
	The biographer says that 20th century people think the affairs  
of the world are mostly matters of politics and economics. But John 
Paul believes ``culture is what counts over the long haul,'' 
religion included, and also that ``culture is a powerful 
non-violent weapon against tyranny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was a natural viewpoint for a son of Poland, which vanished  
as a nation-state from 1795 till 1918 but survived as a culture, 
thanks largely to the Catholic church. The pope has been proven 
right, Weigel thinks. 
</P>
<P>
	The momentous 1978 choice of a Polish pope, Weigel believes,  
resulted from shock over the sudden death of the newly elected 
Italian, John Paul I. Once the 118 cardinals ``began to think the 
unthinkable,'' namely that non-Italians should be considered, ``the 
question became, who is the most effective public leader in the 
church today?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Karol Wojtyla was not known to most of us, but to the 118 men  
who counted he was one of the best known figures in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weigel thinks ``nationality will mean very little in choosing  
the next pope.'' Future candidates will, like John Paul II, have 
successful pastoral records running local dioceses and be well 
prepared to be public personalities and world travelers, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	He believes that John Paul, unrestrained by tradition, has  
permanently changed the nature of his ancient office. 
</P>
<P>
	Weigel says that two decades into the Wojtyla papacy, ``I was  
surprised the degree to which some parts of the Roman establishment 
are still not accustomed to a non-Italian pontificate.'' To John 
Paul, the pope is no longer the leader of a bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pope of the 21st century is not the C.E.O. of Roman  
Catholic Church Inc. It will be the pope as evangelist, pastor, the 
first witness to the faith, and the world's leading defender of 
basic human rights. There's no reversing this. The church expects 
it. Just as intriguingly, the world expects it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What has been the key to all of John Paul's accomplishments?  
Smarts? Stubbornness? Stamina? ``The sheer intensity of his prayer 
life. He walks down the hall to a meeting and he's praying. He 
prays all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weigel's biography bogs down somewhat when it moves from Poland  
into John Paul's pontificate, due to an unfortunate decision to 
follow rigid chronology rather than organizing the information into 
themes. And the prose, while clear, is not especially engaging. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, this ranks as the definitive biography of the first  
pope from beyond the Danube, due to its rich detail and confident 
grasp of the religious dynamics.

<HEADLINE>  Giants, Fans Bid Adieu to the Stick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Hall of Famer Juan Marichal took the mound  
in a business suit, signaling the beginning of the end, and fellow 
Hall of Famer Willie Mays followed hours later for a last goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	And finally, after the last baseball game at Candlestick Park  
was in the books and Giants greats past and present took the field 
for a salute, workers dug out home plate and took the old park's 
heart away, flying it by helicopter to be transplanted at the 
team's new stadium near downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess all you can say is, `Tell it goodbye,' '' longtime  
Giants broadcaster Lon Simmons said during postgame ceremonies that 
ended with the blowing out of a candle. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of good memories, a lot of bad memories here,''  
Mays said. ``I'm happy. I don't understand why when you leave a 
good thing and you go to another thing that's going to be good for 
the fans that you've got to be sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last day for baseball was unlike any other at Candlestick in  
so many ways. 
</P>
<P>
	The park's famous winds were quiet, the familiar shroud of cold  
and fog nowhere to be seen or felt. 
</P>
<P>
	Defying 40 years of history, the park that was home to Mays,  
Marichal, and Willie McCovey, brought down the curtain on a 
brilliant day for baseball even though the Giants lost to the rival 
Los Angeles Dodgers 9-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very special,'' Dodgers manager Dave Johnson said.  
``Fans were really into it today, but they weren't too bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Managing general partner Peter Magowan thanked the crowd for  
braving the elements and supporting the team during the last 40 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``No fans were prepared to endure as much as you have,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Magowan added, ``This is not a sad day for the Giants. Yes, we  
are leaving our home, but we are going to new one and I promise you 
it will be the best ballpark in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day was special from the start. Marichal, 61, displayed his  
leg kick once again in throwing out the first pitch. Mays, 67, 
returned to throw out the last pitch and his godson, Giants star 
Barry Bonds, caught it. It will be the first ball thrown out next 
season at Pacific Bell Park, about a 25-minute walk from Union 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 61,389, the most ever to see a regular season  
baseball game at Candlestick, was on hand. Many wore old jerseys 
and hats and some made their feelings known in signs dotting the 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adios Candlestick,'' one sign read. ``We'll miss the thrills  
and chills,'' read another. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, watched some of the  
greatest players in the game on a day-to-day basis in this 
ballpark,'' Giants executive vice president Larry Baer said. ``This 
is closure for them, but it's also a happy sendoff because we're 
going to a new ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maligned for its bitter weather and isolation, it was also  
remembered for some of baseball's great moments and its strength in 
withstanding the October 1989 earthquake that ravaged the Bay area 
and interrupted the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star game was played at the 'Stick in 1961, when the  
winds blew pitcher Stu Miller off the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Dedicated the year before by Vice President Richard Nixon as  
``the finest ballpark in America,'' Candlestick also was the scene 
of the 16-inning scoreless duel between Marichal and the Braves' 
Warren Spahn (Mays won it with a homer); McCovey's 500-foot 
upper-deck homer in a 1966 loss to the Mets and lefty Dave 
Dravecky's August 1989 miracle comeback from cancer, in which he 
beat the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Juan Marichal's no-hitter, the World Series games ...,'' Hall  
of Famer Orlando Cepeda said. ``And that 16-inning game that Juan 
pitched and Willie won, I'll never forget that. This was a tough 
playing field but I spent so many days here and there are so many 
great memories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 1964 game was delayed after a visiting Dodgers outfielder lost  
a fly ball in the fog, though the final game was played under a 
broiling sun. The temperature at game time was 82 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable,'' said Richard Scimeca, 43, of San Jose,  
who took the day off from work to be at the final game. ``Maybe 
it's because it's the last game and the baseball gods decided after 
all these years we're going to give you some good weather. It seems 
like every other time I was here, it was windy and freezing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Ivie was among some 60 former Giants players on hand to  
take a final bow. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wind and the cold made it miserable. Night games were  
terrible,'' Ivie recalled. ``It took a little bit to put on the 
insulated underwear and go play nine innings, but just being here 
and seeing all the old coaches players and made it enjoyable for 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And with the sun out and the stands and dugout warmed by  
nostalgia, even the bad, cold days didn't seem so windy or so cold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never really minded it,'' said San Francisco manager Dusty  
Baker, a native of Sacramento who got his first hit here in 1968 as 
a rookie with the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever I'm here, I've had all my friends and family here, so  
it was always like a homecoming for me. I had to have my best games 
here in front of my home boys.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Expands Hate Crime Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis signed a bill Thursday  
that increases the penalty for murders motivated by the victim's 
gender, sexual orientation or disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Under California's current hate crime law, a murder committed  
because of the victim's race, color, religion, ancestry or national 
origin can bring the death penalty or life in prison without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum penalty for a murder based on gender, sexual  
orientation or disability is 25 years to life in prison. The bill 
signed Thursday, which takes effect Jan. 1, increases the maximum 
in those categories to life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	It does not by itself allow for the death penalty.  
</P>
<P>
	The bill's author, Assemblyman Wally Knox, said he tried to pass  
the measure last year but was unsuccessful. He said the bill gained 
support after the slayings of Mathew Shepard in Wyoming last year 
and a gay couple in Northern California in July.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Outraises Gore in Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley, his Democratic presidential  
campaign surging, raised more money than Vice President Al Gore 
over the last three months, and has more money in the bank heading 
into the final quarter of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley raised an estimated $6.7 million between July and  
September, spokeswoman Anita Dunn said today. Gore raised around 
$6.5 million during the same period, according to senior advisers 
who spoke Wednesday on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	By spending less than $4.2 million during the last three months,  
Bradley wound up with more than $10 million in the bank as of 
today. Gore aides said the vice president would have between $9.5 
million and $10 million. Gore spent about $6 million between July 
and September, almost as much as he raised. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's fund-raising figures show that he will have enough  
money to financially compete with Gore throughout the primary 
season. It also means that the eventual nominee, whether it be Gore 
or Bradley, may run up against the federal spending limits months 
before the party's convention, and have little to spend to defend 
against Republican attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Gore, seeking to rejuvenate his campaign, announced  
Wednesday that he was moving his headquarters from Washington to 
Nashville, Tenn., and challenging Bradley to a series of debates. 
He called the move ``an opportunity for transformation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged, ``This is a hard, tough fight.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has been gaining on Gore in key early primary states.  
</P>
<P>
	Since entering the race, Bradley has raised around $18.4  
million, including more than $650,000 over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows that the campaign continues to enjoy steady growth  
and support,'' Dunn said. ``In particular, we're excited about the 
number of small donors, both through our Internet site and through 
the mail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigns are required to report to the Federal Election  
Commission by Oct. 15 how much money they have raised and spent 
since July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican front-runner George W. Bush has raised more than $53  
million, including more than $16 million between July and 
September. The figure excludes money raised through direct mail 
solicitations and from people who contribute on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other Republicans, Gary Bauer reported raising around $2  
million between July and September, increasing his fund-raising 
total to about $5.4 million. Elizabeth Dole's campaign expects to 
report that her total for the year also had topped $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., reported today that  
it had raised $3 million during the last three months, bringing its 
total to $7 million, plus $2 million transferred from his Senate 
campaign committee. And Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, reported raising 
$1.2 million through today. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, the Gore campaign has raised $24 million and spent $14  
million. Because he is accepting federal funds for the campaign, 
Gore is limited as to how much he can spend during the primary 
season to about $40 million, plus legal and accounting costs. 
</P>
<P>
	His early spending has raised concerns that, if he secures the  
Democratic nomination, he will press up against the limits and be 
unable to respond to Bush, who is not accepting federal funds and 
can spend as much as he can raise. In 1996, Republican presidential 
nominee Bob Dole hit the spending cap months before the national 
conventions and could not answer millions of dollars in advertising 
by the Clinton-Gore campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore advisers said the campaign has been spending heavily on  
fund raising, including direct mail, and has hired dozens of 
staffers in Iowa, New Hampshire, New York and California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking down the road, unless he makes changes, he could be in  
the position Dole was in 1996, essentially being unable to spend 
money with months left before the conventions, facing an opponent 
with plenty of money left to spend,'' said Anthony Corrado, a 
professor of government at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. 
``They have to get leaner in their spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gore advisers acknowledged that the campaign was cutting  
spending and reducing the number of aides and amount of equipment 
at events. In addition, as the campaign winds down its fund raising 
later this year, it will be able to move employees to the 
Democratic National Committee payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to Nashville also is expected to result in a trimming  
of campaign staff. It also was designed to shake up a campaign that 
found the road to the White House not as smooth as it once 
appeared, especially in the wake of Bradley's strength in both fund 
raising and polling. 
</P>
<P>
	``You run the risk of looking desperate but these folks are  
desperate,'' former Dole campaign chairman Scott Reed said. 
``They've managed to spend almost 50 percent of their resources and 
they find themselves in a competitive race four months before the 
first vote is cast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a riff on a motto from the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign, Reed  
had this advice for Gore: ``It's the spending, stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore advisers said they would have enough money to wage a  
full-scale campaign through next summer's nominating convention, 
helped by a DNC-financed advertising effort. The DNC recently 
brought in Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell, a top fund-raiser, to 
be general chairman.

<HEADLINE> Gateway Targeting Sales to Latinos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gateway Inc. will target the fast-growing  
Hispanic population with a major marketing campaign that will 
include running advertisements in Spanish, adding bilingual sales 
and technical staff and offering computers equipped with Spanish 
software and keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign will launch Friday with Spanish television and  
radio ads in Miami and Phoenix, as well as a nationwide toll-free 
telephone number Spanish speakers can use to order computers and 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway, a leading made-to-order computer retailer based in San  
Diego, hopes to tap into the growing interest in computers and the 
Internet among Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, the Hispanic community and the Hispanic market, it  
fits really well into what Gateway is all about,'' said R. Todd 
Bradley, a senior vice president at Gateway. ``It's huge, it grows 
very, very aggressively. More important, it's underserved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the food, beverage and auto industries have run  
marketing campaigns focused on the nation's 8 million Hispanic 
households. Computer and Internet companies have been slower to 
catch on to Hispanic's strong interest in both technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	A Forrester Research survey 100,000 U.S. households found that  
on a percentage basis, Hispanics ranked No. 2 behind Asian 
Americans as the most likely to be wired to the Internet. 
Non-Hispanic whites trailed in third place. 
</P>
<P>
	A whopping 64 percent of Asian American homes had Internet  
access, compared to 36 percent of Hispanic homes and 34 percent of 
non-Hispanic whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Hispanics were open to embracing new technologies, said  
Forrester analyst Ekaterina Walsh. Internet access among Latinos is 
expected to increase 43 percent by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hispanics are very open to new technology. They are more  
optimistic about technology than whites, for example,'' she said. 
``The demand for computers will definitely grow among 
Hispanic-American households.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next few months, the advertising campaign will expand  
to include other big cities with large Hispanic populations. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway also is adding Spanish speakers to its sales and  
technical support staffs in its online and telephone sales 
operations, as well as its brick-and-mortar Gateway Country stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has 180 stores, including 44 in what the company  
considers the top Hispanic markets. At the stores, customers can 
order computers tailored to personal preferences, which are 
delivered to the customer's home. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the company will spend $2.5 million on television  
advertising through December, but the amount will grow ``as the 
market grows,'' said Bradley. He declined to say how much Gateway 
will spend on the entire marketing effort.

<HEADLINE>  Beatty Gives 'Majorette' Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Actor-director Warren Beatty says  
he won't let ``monied, honeyed voices of ridicule and reaction'' 
stop him from considering a presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to Hollywood's liberal elite Wednesday night, Beatty  
drew several rounds of applause, but didn't deliver what the crowd 
came to hear: A yes or no about his presidential intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	That will come later in the campaign season.  
</P>
<P>
	He did promise to champion the causes of American liberalism  
whether he runs or not. He criticized the Democratic Party for 
looking Republican, and questioned whether Democratic presidential 
candidates Al Gore and Bill Bradley are true to the party's 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there no protest anymore?'' Beatty told a celebrity-studded  
audience of several hundred people during a speech to the Southern 
California Americans for Democratic Action ``Are we coming to the 
point where the Democratic Party has to have a Republican president 
to find its voice again?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ever the actor, Beatty framed his presidential intentions by  
giving advice to an imaginary character -- a drum majorette. 
</P>
<P>
	``If an unexpected person showed that he or she had that spirit  
and the ability to lead and said to me, `Look, there's no liberal 
running for president' ... and if serious people of good judgment 
are actually talking to that person about running ... it would make 
no difference to me whether that person became well known as a 
basketball player or a businessman or wrestler or a grocery store 
clerk or a drum majorette. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say, `Look, drum majorette. There's no harm in thinking  
about this -- however unlikely it might be. But whatever you do, go 
ahead and speak up. Speak up for the people nobody speaks up for,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you speak up well, maybe you'll influence some people.  
Maybe you'll influence the candidates that are running,'' Beatty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One more thing, drum majorette,'' he said. ``When you start  
hearing those monied, honied voices of ridicule and reaction, let 
them call you coy. Let them call you flirtatious. But keep 
talking.''

<HEADLINE> Compaq Names Human Resources Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. has named a former Burger  
King Corp. executive as its new senior vice president for human 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Yvonne Jackson is the first senior executive hired by Michael  
Capellas, who was named Compaq's chief executive in July. She will 
begin her new job on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	As Burger King's senior vice president of worldwide human  
resources, Ms. Jackson supervised a work force of about 25,000 
people, less than half the size of Compaq's. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Burger King in 1993, she spent 13 years in human  
resources management at Avon Products. She began her career at 
Sears, Roebuck and Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yvonne's experience with customer-focused companies like  
Burger King, Avon and Sears will be a tremendous asset as we work 
to make customer advocacy an important part of Compaq's culture,'' 
Capellas said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's top priority will be completing integration of Digital  
Equipment Corp., which Houston-based Compaq bought last year, and 
Tandem Computers, which it acquired in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Mandatory Anthrax Shots Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Military commanders told Congress on Thursday  
the mandatory program to inoculate soldiers with the anthrax 
vaccine is essential because hostile nations have developed weapons 
using the biological warfare agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre and Gen. Anthony Zinni, in  
charge of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region, said troops must 
be vaccinated or they would die if exposed to the biological 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be almost impossible for us to conduct our war plans  
... if this were to be used on the battlefield,'' Zinni testified 
before the House Armed Services Committee's personnel panel. ``The 
level of casualties would be significant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamre said 10 countries have taken steps to put anthrax in bombs  
or missiles, but he named only Iraq, saying the military received 
evidence in 1997 that Iraq had weapons containing anthrax: ``We 
have got absolute, incontrovertible evidence we have this threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to conclude that anyone in General Zinni's field of  
operations could face an anthrax threat,'' Hamre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen last year ordered all 2.4  
million active duty and reserve troops to get shots of the anthrax 
vaccine as protection against biological warfare. Some 340,000 
service members have been immunized so far. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 to 300 troops have refused to take the shots because  
of questions about the vaccine's safety and efficacy, Pentagon 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense officials have said repeatedly the vaccine is safe and  
effective. But it has come under increasing scrutiny from 
congressional lawmakers as soldiers, including pilots in the 
National Guard and reserves, have expressed concerns with taking 
the six-shot regimen and some have said they would resign. 
Complaints include fevers, muscle pain, soreness and dizziness. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gen. Ronald Blanck, the Army's surgeon general, said there  
have been 72 reports of adverse effects from the shots serious 
enough for soldiers to be hospitalized or take a sick day. 
Fifty-five were verified as related to the anthrax vaccine, he 
said, which compares favorably with reaction rates from other 
vaccines. There have been no deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthrax has never been used in combat, but the Pentagon fears  
Iraq, North Korea and other countries, which they say are 
classified -- or terrorist groups -- might try. Anthrax is a 
naturally occurring bacteria found in domesticated animals; it can 
be produced as dry spores that, when inhaled, cause death within a 
few days. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are attacked with this agent and we have a force that's  
vaccinated, our soldiers, sailors and marines will survive,'' 
Blanck said. Without it, he said, soldiers ``will inevitably die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni also said the inoculations must be mandatory because there  
would be a devastating impact on morale if some soldiers with 
important missions duties were caught unprepared. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthrax is easily and cheaply converted into a weapon and a tiny  
amount could ``jeopardize our forces in a place like Kuwait,'' 
Zinni said. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, one Iraqi airplane with a single spray tank full  
of anthrax spores ``could endanger the entire population of 
Kuwait,'' he said. ``They have the ability within minutes to affect 
Kuwait and northern Saudi Arabia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several lawmakers criticized military leaders for failing keep  
close track of the number of refusals to take the vaccinations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hamre said he was reluctant to count refusals through a  
central tracking system because it would undermine command 
authority.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders Korea War Deaths Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and South Korean governments are  
investigating an Associated Press report that U.S. soldiers killed 
up to 400 civilians at a railroad bridge in the early days of the 
Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Secretary Louis Caldera, called by Defense Secretary  
William Cohen to head the U.S. inquiry, promised a thorough review 
of the No Gun Ri incident. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Thursday that the review, which could take a year or  
more, would include the military's first interviews with veterans 
who were at the bridge in July 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP reported Wednesday accounts by American veterans and  
South Korean villagers who said they witnessed the killings, 
including six ex-GIs who said they shot South Korean civilians at 
the bridge. The AP also found once-classified documents showing 
that U.S. commanders ordered their troops to shoot civilians as a 
defense against disguised enemy soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said he had assurances that the Pentagon  
``wants to get to the bottom of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, in ordering the inquiry, said, ``This review is important  
to the active and retired members of our armed forces, the 
confidence of the American people in the finest armed forces in the 
world, and our relationship with the people of the Republic of 
Korea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean survivors or relatives of victims have been asking  
for investigation, compensation and apology, and renewed that call 
after the new evidence was reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know where the road will lead,'' Pentagon spokesman  
Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said, expressing confidence that the Army 
would be ``candid in its findings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera said he would recommend further action if necessary, but  
cautioned against ``speculating at this point what the consequences 
would be'' if details of the report are confirmed by his inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP report prompted South Korean villagers on Thursday to  
renew their calls for investigation of the incident. The ex-GIs 
recalled the killing of men, women and children. Villagers said 300 
people were shot to death under the bridge and 100 by U.S. air 
attacks that preceded the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera said a search of records earlier this year by the Army  
Center for Military History ``found nothing to substantiate the 
claims.'' That was in response to the latest appeal from survivors 
and victims, which had been quietly rejected as unsubstantiated by 
the Korean and U.S. governments. 
</P>
<P>
	``This review, of course, is going to go beyond a search of the  
documentary records,'' Caldera said at a Pentagon news conference. 
``It will be an all-encompassing review. I am committed to finding 
out the truth of these matters as best we can after these many 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A similar pledge came in Seoul from South Korean Foreign  
Ministry spokesman Chang Chul-kyun, who said officials would ``try 
to verify the truth of all related things concerning this case.'' 
He said any further action would be decided after that inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera noted that the early weeks of the Korean conflict were  
chaotic. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. soldiers, although they fought with great courage under  
very harsh conditions, were ill-trained and ill-equipped to fight 
because of the large reduction in resources available to the 
military for training and equipment following World War II,'' he 
said, noting that more than 30,000 Americans died in 1950-53 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``We owe these dead and the vast, vast majority of our veterans  
of the Korean War, our nation's gratitude for their sacrifices on 
behalf of our country,'' Caldera said. ``Regardless, we owe the 
American people, our veterans, and the people, our friends and 
allies of the Republic of Korea, a full accounting of these 
matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his review would also examine previous Pentagon  
investigations of the matter to see if there was any ``misreading 
of the record'' or other mistakes.

	China Anniversary Celebration Begins  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- With huge lantern balloons swaying overhead,  
China began celebrations on Friday feting 50 years of communist 
rule. Columns of tanks moved through Beijing before dawn, followed 
in the day's first light by floats for each of China's provinces. 
The Communist Party's celebration Friday, costing the equivalent of 
$36 million, will showcase the nation's growing military might and 
its rapid economic progress since Mao Tse-tung declared the 
founding of the People's Republic on Oct. 1, 1949.

	Nuclear Reaction Contained in Japan  
</P>
<P>
	TOKAIMURA, Japan (AP) -- An uncontrolled nuclear reaction was  
contained at a uranium processing plant in Japan Friday, 
authorities said, a day after leaking radioactive gas seriously 
injured three workers and possibly contaminated 34 others. The 
company that operates the plant acknowledged fault. The accident 
was the result of a ``clear violation'' of in-house safety rules, a 
spokesman for the company JCO, said Friday. The radiation levels 
outside the plant had returned to normal Friday morning and experts 
said that they did not believe there was a serious threat to local 
residents. Thirty-nine people had been exposed to radioactivity, 
said Tatsuo Shimizu, a spokesman for the Tokaimura village office. 
That number included the three hospitalized workers.

	Russia Takes Over Chechnya Territory  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian ground troops entered Chechnya  
Thursday, taking positions on strategic heights near the border and 
reportedly advancing as far as six miles into the breakaway 
republic. The moves followed a week of airstrikes on the Chechen 
capital, Grozny, that sent nearly 80,000 Chechens fleeing in fear. 
It raised concern that Russia is on the verge of another full-scale 
war in Chechnya just three years after a humiliating and costly 
defeat there.

	Bush Criticizes GOP-Led Congress

<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- In a rare dispute with Congress,  
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush on Thursday 
criticized a GOP plan to squeeze money from a program for the 
working poor to meet budget targets. ``I don't think they ought to 
balance their budget on the backs of the poor,'' said the two-term 
Texas governor and Republican presidential front-runner. The 
GOP-led Congress is mulling several bookkeeping gimmicks to keep a 
promise to avoid spending portions of the federal surplus reserved 
for Social Security.

	Some Clinton Friends Declined Help  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Thursday that some of  
his friends declined to help him buy his $1.7 million home in 
suburban New York because they didn't want to get ``dragged 
around'' and subjected to unwarranted allegations. The president 
and his wife Hillary are to close on their five-bedroom home in 
Chappaqua, N.Y., in early November. Originally, the Clintons said 
they would accept a loan guarantee from Terry McAuliffe, a friend 
and major fund raiser for the president. But the Clintons dropped 
that idea amid criticism of the deal and began pursuing a 
conventional mortgage, sources said.

and resigned from the New York attorney general's office just weeks 
before the judge's initial verdict is expected. Stephen Houck, who 
resigned Wednesday, led the courtroom fight for the 19 states suing 
Microsoft along with the Justice Department. He also delivered part 
of the government's closing arguments last week. His decision was 
not expected to affect the trial's outcome because other states 
still are pursuing their claims.

	BALTIMORE (AP) -- It took a lot longer than last year, and the  
final margin won't be nearly as impressive, yet the New York 
Yankees are once again the AL East champions. Scott Brosius hit two 
homers and Bernie Williams reached 200 hits for the first time in 
his career as the Yankees won their second straight division title 
by defeating the Baltimore Orioles 12-5 Thursday for a split of 
their day-night doubleheader. The victory eliminated the Boston Red 
Sox, who will enter the playoffs as the wild-card team.

<HEADLINE> Labor Dept. Sues Over Fund-Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two unions officials are being accused by the  
Labor Department of investing employees' pension funds in 
``imprudent'' deals with companies owned by a top fund-raiser for 
President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Terence McAuliffe, the fund-raiser who recently offered to help  
the Clintons buy a home in New York, is not a defendant in the 
lawsuit. The Labor Department regulates those who manage workers' 
pensions, not those who do business with such funds. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit filed by the Labor Department says that in one  
instance, McAuliffe made $2.45 million on a deal in which the fund 
bought him out of a real estate partnership. He had invested $100, 
the pension fund $39 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit names as defendants Jack Moore, former executive  
secretary of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, 
and John Grau, executive vice president of the National Electrical 
Contractors Association. The two managed the unions' National 
Electrical Benefit Fund, at the time worth $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The department alleges the pension fund lost money as a result  
of a loan and a partnership deal that involved more than $47 
million in investments with McAuliffe's companies. Tax records show 
the fund did not receive all the principal and interest due under 
the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both trustees, Moore and Grau, authorized each of the  
imprudent investments,'' the suit said. ``If the fund had not made 
these investments, it would have had the money ... to invest in 
prudent investments that would have earned a greater return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore and Grau deny the government's allegations. A lawyer for  
McAuliffe says the pension fund made some money on the investments, 
just not as much as hoped. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pension fund could have done better, but it also could  
have done a lot worse,'' attorney Richard Ben-Veniste said. ``The 
pension fund is not out any money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Kefauver, a lawyer for Moore and Grau, agreed. ``It's  
their position that the fund made money, although not as much as 
they would have liked,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pension fund made a return of 6.5 percent on the investments  
with McAuliffe, according to Jim Spellane, spokesman for IBEW. 
Other large pension funds made a median return of 10.9 percent on 
their investments during the first half of the 1990s, according to 
a study by consulting firm Watson Wyatt. 
</P>
<P>
	Spellane declined to discuss the transactions further, citing  
the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	A former investment banker who made a fortune in home building,  
telecommunications and title insurance, McAuliffe has been a key 
figure in the Clintons' inner circle. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the president's chief fund-raiser in the 1996 election  
and now is raising money for Mrs. Clinton's possible Senate bid in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	This month he put up $1.35 million as collateral to guarantee  
the Clintons' mortgage on a $1.7 million house in Chappaqua, N.Y. 
Public interest groups and some Republicans complained the 
arrangement was improper because of McAuliffe's political ties, and 
the Clintons have decided not to accept his help. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which was filed in May in U.S. District Court in  
Maryland, details business dealings between the pension fund and 
McAuliffe dating to November 1990. That is when the fund formed a 
partnership with McAuliffe's company, American Capital Management 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Records show the company was set up by McAuliffe's  
father-in-law, Richard Swann, a former Democratic Party fund-raiser 
who owned a failed savings and loan that had been taken over by the 
government six months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund paid $39 million for the partnership to buy a shopping  
center and apartment complexes from the Resolution Trust Corp., the 
federal S&AMP;L bailout agency that had taken over the properties from 
Swann's institution. 
</P>
<P>
	McAuliffe, who owned half the partnership, put up just $100, the  
suit alleges. By 1993, the fund had paid McAuliffe $2.45 million to 
buy out most of his share, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund also lent another McAuliffe company $6 million to buy  
property in Orlando, Fla., to build and sell homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The new investment was supposed to yield an 18.6 percent return,  
the suit said. But lot sales and revenues didn't meet projections, 
and the loan quickly went into default. By 1996, the unpaid balance 
was $8.6 million, tax records show. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund finally got out of the deals in 1997. Moore and Grau  
agreed to let McAuliffe purchase the fund's share of the 
partnership and buy off his loan for $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund's 1997 tax records said ``the loan price was less than  
the loan amount plus accrued interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit doesn't say whether the fund received any revenue from  
the deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Swann said the fund received $4 million from lot sales on the  
Orlando property and other income from the leases on the apartments 
and shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the partnership took out mortgages on the shopping  
center and apartments and used those funds to pay $23 million back 
to the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had our accountants go through the deals and we calculated  
their return at 10.5 percent,'' Swann said.

<HEADLINE> McGwire, Sosa To Go Head-to-Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Just like in the movies, the sequel to the  
great home run derby will try to top the original. It may not quite 
surpass it, but it will come close. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire vs. Sosa, man to man, face to face.  
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs wind up the season with  
a three-game series starting Friday night that would be totally 
meaningless except for the home run title at stake. The Cardinals 
are 11 games below .500, and the Cubs had only three more victories 
than Sammy Sosa has homers entering Thursday night's game in 
Philadelphia, yet there's no denying a certain electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those miracle coincidences that both these guys  
are playing the last three games of the season against each 
other,'' Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. ``What a treat for 
our fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire took the lead for the first time since Aug. 18 when  
he hit Nos. 62 and 63 in a doubleheader sweep of the San Diego 
Padres Wednesday night. He has homered in each of the last four 
games, although he insists his charge has absolutely nothing to do 
with wanting to top Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever wins this home run title, we're both over 60 home  
runs,'' McGwire said. ``So nobody loses, right? 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no `I want to beat him, he wants to beat me.' That's  
not going on, but I know the press is trying to get it going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, who was ahead 55-51 entering September, had a 30 at-bat  
homer drought this month and was one behind heading into Thursday 
night's game in Philadelphia. He was the first player to hit 60 in 
consecutive seasons and the first to beat Roger Maris' 1961 record 
of 61 in consecutive seasons, but just like last year he's trailing 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not Superman. I'm human, just like everybody else,'' Sosa  
said. ``I'm allowed to struggle sometimes. I'm allowed to go longer 
without hitting a home run sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Busch Stadium figures to have at least a semblance of the  
atmosphere during McGwire's record 70-homer season from 1998, with 
the series sold out for months. The scene may more closely resemble 
the lower-key setting for McGwire's 500th career homer last month, 
however, when 50 or 60 outside media requests were filled, instead 
of the 700 or so during the Maris chase at the height of 
McGwire-mania. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what you get with a sequel.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was totally different; last year was a record,''  
McGwire said. ``Here, everybody is talking about a home run title, 
which up until this last year nobody ever talked about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who had 65 homers with three games to go last year,  
believes fans are disappointed there won't be another challenge to 
the record. 
</P>
<P>
	``People, I think, are spoiled from what we've done last year,''  
McGwire said. ``They constantly want more, more, more. It's hard to 
comprehend that what we've done this year is harder than what we 
did last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa echoed those sentiments.  
</P>
<P>
	``The people expect us to go out there and hit a home run every  
at-bat,'' Sosa said. ``They have to understand that we don't play 
by ourselves, there's a guy out there trying to get me out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa has said several times that McGwire's encore is perhaps  
more impressive than his record-setting season, because it would be 
natural for most players to relax after such an achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, with me, no,'' McGwire said. ``I'm just speaking for  
myself, but I would never allow that to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said he's been more mentally weary this year than  
last year, mostly because the Cardinals are winding up another 
disappointing season, and can't wait for it all to end. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also been stung by criticism that 50 home runs isn't such a  
notable accomplishment, noting that only he and Sosa have done it 
the last two years. Ken Griffey Jr., who had 48 and could do it 
three straight years, was the only other player in striking 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I can't understand is people can't accept what's  
happening, they always have to find a reason why it's happening,'' 
McGwire said. ``There's no reason; it's just happening. So accept 
it. Enjoy the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has a combined three homers in 26 at-bats against the  
Cubs' three scheduled starters, Jon Lieber, Andrew Lorraine and 
Steve Trachsel. Trachsel has surrendered two homers in 15 at-bats, 
including McGwire's 62nd last year, Lieber has allowed one homer in 
10 at-bats and Lorraine has walked and struck out McGwire in his 
only two appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa has only one home run in 25 at-bats against the Cardinals'  
scheduled starters. He's 3-for-15 with one homer against Mark 
Thompson, the Cardinals' starter on Friday, 1-for-5 with no homers 
against Garrett Stephenson and 1-for-5 with no homers against Larry 
Luebbers, who gets the call on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Giants, Fans Bid Adieu to the Stick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Hall of Famer Juan Marichal took the mound  
in a business suit, signaling the beginning of the end, and fellow 
Hall of Famer Willie Mays followed hours later for a last goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	And finally, after the last baseball game at Candlestick Park  
was in the books and Giants greats past and present took the field 
for a salute, workers dug out home plate and took the old park's 
heart away, flying it by helicopter to be transplanted at the 
team's new stadium near downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess all you can say is, `Tell it goodbye,' '' longtime  
Giants broadcaster Lon Simmons said during postgame ceremonies that 
ended with the blowing out of a candle. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of good memories, a lot of bad memories here,''  
Mays said. ``I'm happy. I don't understand why when you leave a 
good thing and you go to another thing that's going to be good for 
the fans that you've got to be sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last day for baseball was unlike any other at Candlestick in  
so many ways. 
</P>
<P>
	The park's famous winds were quiet, the familiar shroud of cold  
and fog nowhere to be seen or felt. 
</P>
<P>
	Defying 40 years of history, the park that was home to Mays,  
Marichal, and Willie McCovey, brought down the curtain on a 
brilliant day for baseball even though the Giants lost to the rival 
Los Angeles Dodgers 9-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very special,'' Dodgers manager Dave Johnson said.  
``Fans were really into it today, but they weren't too bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Managing general partner Peter Magowan thanked the crowd for  
braving the elements and supporting the team during the last 40 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``No fans were prepared to endure as much as you have,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Magowan added, ``This is not a sad day for the Giants. Yes, we  
are leaving our home, but we are going to new one and I promise you 
it will be the best ballpark in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day was special from the start. Marichal, 61, displayed his  
leg kick once again in throwing out the first pitch. Mays, 67, 
returned to throw out the last pitch and his godson, Giants star 
Barry Bonds, caught it. It will be the first ball thrown out next 
season at Pacific Bell Park, about a 25-minute walk from Union 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 61,389, the most ever to see a regular season  
baseball game at Candlestick, was on hand. Many wore old jerseys 
and hats and some made their feelings known in signs dotting the 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adios Candlestick,'' one sign read. ``We'll miss the thrills  
and chills,'' read another. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, watched some of the  
greatest players in the game on a day-to-day basis in this 
ballpark,'' Giants executive vice president Larry Baer said. ``This 
is closure for them, but it's also a happy sendoff because we're 
going to a new ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maligned for its bitter weather and isolation, it was also  
remembered for some of baseball's great moments and its strength in 
withstanding the October 1989 earthquake that ravaged the Bay area 
and interrupted the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star game was played at the 'Stick in 1961, when the  
winds blew pitcher Stu Miller off the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Dedicated the year before by Vice President Richard Nixon as  
``the finest ballpark in America,'' Candlestick also was the scene 
of the 16-inning scoreless duel between Marichal and the Braves' 
Warren Spahn (Mays won it with a homer); McCovey's 500-foot 
upper-deck homer in a 1966 loss to the Mets and lefty Dave 
Dravecky's August 1989 miracle comeback from cancer, in which he 
beat the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Juan Marichal's no-hitter, the World Series games ...,'' Hall  
of Famer Orlando Cepeda said. ``And that 16-inning game that Juan 
pitched and Willie won, I'll never forget that. This was a tough 
playing field but I spent so many days here and there are so many 
great memories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 1964 game was delayed after a visiting Dodgers outfielder lost  
a fly ball in the fog, though the final game was played under a 
broiling sun. The temperature at game time was 82 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable,'' said Richard Scimeca, 43, of San Jose,  
who took the day off from work to be at the final game. ``Maybe 
it's because it's the last game and the baseball gods decided after 
all these years we're going to give you some good weather. It seems 
like every other time I was here, it was windy and freezing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Ivie was among some 60 former Giants players on hand to  
take a final bow. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wind and the cold made it miserable. Night games were  
terrible,'' Ivie recalled. ``It took a little bit to put on the 
insulated underwear and go play nine innings, but just being here 
and seeing all the old coaches players and made it enjoyable for 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And with the sun out and the stands and dugout warmed by  
nostalgia, even the bad, cold days didn't seem so windy or so cold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never really minded it,'' said San Francisco manager Dusty  
Baker, a native of Sacramento who got his first hit here in 1968 as 
a rookie with the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever I'm here, I've had all my friends and family here, so  
it was always like a homecoming for me. I had to have my best games 
here in front of my home boys.''

<HEADLINE> Next Year Last for Tech's Williams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Texas Tech running back Ricky Williams,  
out for the season with a knee injury, said Thursday he probably 
won't ask the NCAA for another year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know, but in my mind I really don't want to,''  
Williams, a junior, said during a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really would like next year to be my last year here playing  
football at Texas Tech. I love Texas Tech a lot and it has done a 
lot for me, but I think next year I'll be able to graduate with the 
classmates I came here with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA allows players to apply for a medical redshirt, which  
gives a player an extra year of eligibility if he misses a season 
because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who ran for 1,582 yards and 13 touchdowns last year,  
hurt his knee in the opener against Arizona State and sat out the 
next two games before aggravating the injury during practice this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fully expect to get back to 100 percent,'' Williams said.  
``Everyone will see that happen. The Heisman was one of my main 
goals so it's very disappointing. Now I just have to work to get 
back.''

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Nixes Free Trade-Job Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said  
Thursday there are countless economic arguments in support of free 
trade but job creation is not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, returning to a theme he has sounded several times  
this year, mounted a strong defense for the benefits the U.S. 
economy has enjoyed from reducing trade barriers. But he said he 
regretted that supporters have tried to link trade policies with 
job creation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We too often try to promote free trade on the mistaken ground  
that it will create jobs,'' Greenspan said in a speech prepared for 
a meeting of business executives in Minneapolis. Copies of the 
speech were distributed here. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade can influence the type of jobs that an economy can create,  
but not the overall number, Greenspan said. By opening up a country 
to competition, he said, free trade enhances productivity by 
forcing industry into more productive fields to the benefit of 
workers, who see their salaries increase. 
</P>
<P>
	But the overall number of jobs is influenced my other economic  
factors, Greenspan said, putting forth an argument made by a large 
number of economists. They contend that overall employment is 
influenced much more by factors such as interest rate policies, 
that can boost or depress consumer demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to find credible evidence that trade has  
affected the level of employment in this country over the long 
run,'' Greenspan said. ``Indeed, we are currently experiencing the 
widest trade deficit in history with a level of unemployment close 
to record lows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's remarks represented the latest in a series of  
speeches he has given this year seeking to counter what he views as 
rising protectionist sentiments as America's trade deficit has 
soared over the past two years. A global financial crisis has cut 
sharply into U.S. export markets and increased the flow of low-cost 
imports into this country. 
</P>
<P>
	``The campaign to expand free trade is never won,'' Greenspan  
said. ``Legislation to further lower trade barriers ... is becoming 
increasingly difficult to pass in Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States will serve as hosts this December to a meeting  
in Seattle of the 134-nation World Trade Organization, where a new 
round of global trade liberalization talks will be launched. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the U.S. delegation will attend the session without the  
congressional authorization it needs to complete the negotiations 
because President Clinton has been unable in five years to get the 
measure through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said he also was concerned that as formal trade  
barriers were being reduced, more countries were resorting to other 
forms of protectionism such as raising tariffs through findings 
that goods were being ``dumped'' at unfairly low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``While these forms of protection have often been imposed under  
the label of promoting fair trade, oftentimes they are just simple 
guises for inhibiting competition,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has supported a number of dumping  
cases filed in recent months by the steel industry, which argued 
they were losing millions of dollars in sales because of a flood of 
cheap imports into the country as a result of the Asian financial 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said the U.S. economy has benefited greatly from  
lowering trade barriers, which has increased competition and forced 
American businesses into more innovative fields paying higher wages 
for workers. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the transition from obsolete technologies to newer  
technologies does represent lost jobs for workers through no fault 
of their own. He urged support for the transition through job 
training programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a great tragedy were we to stop the wheels of  
progress because of an incapacity to assist the victims of 
progress,'' Greenspan said.

</P>
<P>
	LOGAN, Utah (AP) -- Eva Israelsen, who lived long enough to have  
271 great-grandchildren, died Thursday, five days before her 105th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Israelsen appeared in Life magazine in October 1993 in an  
article noting the birth of her 200th and 201st 
great-grandchildren. Since then, her progeny has grown to 271 
great-grandchildren and 40 great-great-grandchildren. She had 11 
original children, and they had 67 kids. 
</P>
<P>
	She was born Eva May Butler on Oct. 5, 1894, at the mouth of Big  
Cottonwood Canyon in Salt Lake County. She met Victor E. Israelsen 
while attending Utah Agricultural College, now Utah State 
University, in the 1920s and later married him. 
</P>
<P>
	They spent their lives on a dairy farm. Mrs. Israelsen remained  
active well past her 100th birthday, walking at least a mile a day.

	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- James M. Kelso, a popular state  
representative and restaurateur, died Wednesday from cancer. He was 
55. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelso was a political novice in 1996 when he ran for the state  
House as a Democrat. He became a deputy majority leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelso was also a partner in the Coast Guard House restaurant in

	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Jack Kiefer, a two-time winner on  
the Senior PGA Tour who was diagnosed last year with cancer in his 
spinal cord, died Sept. 24. He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiefer won the 1994 Ralphs Senior Classic and the du Maurier  
Champions in 1997, when he finished 16th on the money list. He 
played 12 events in 1998 before he was diagnosed with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiefer was a pitcher for Millersville State College in 1961, and  
his knuckleball earned him a contract with the Detroit Tigers. But 
after three days in camp, he left baseball and took up golf. 
</P>
<P>
	He turned professional in 1967 and joined the senior tour in  
1990. He had a reputation as an iron man for playing at least 30 
tournaments a year every season except 1992.

	WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) -- The Rev. Cotesworth Pinckney Lewis, who  
once told President Lyndon Johnson that Americans needed a 
``straightforward explanation'' about the Vietnam war, died 
Wednesday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' 1967 sermon to the visiting Johnson at Bruton Parish  
Episcopal Church prompted the church's vestry and the governor of 
Virginia to apologize to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis was rector of the church from 1956 to 1985. The  
congregation more than doubled during his tenure.

<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Dmitry Likhachyov, a literary historian who was  
one of Russia's most respected cultural figures, died Thursday. He 
was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Likhachyov, sometimes described as ``the conscience of Russia,''  
spent four years, from 1928-32, in one of the Soviet Union's most 
dreaded prison camps, Solovki, located in a former monastery on a 
northern Russian island. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, he became prominent as an impassioned defender of the  
country's cultural heritage. He fought to protect the purity of 
texts written by Russia's most famous poet, Alexander Pushkin, to 
whom counterfeiters have long attributed fake diaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our pragmatic century, he embodied the best qualities of  
Russian intelligentsia -- selfless service to the fatherland, 
nobility, sense of duty,'' President Boris Yeltsin said in a letter 
addressed to Likhachyov's widow and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Yeltsin awarded Likhachyov one of the country's  
highest honors, the Order of St. Andrew, for contributions to the 
development of national culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Likhachyov, an expert in Russian literature of the 11th-17th  
centuries, held honorary doctorates from Oxford and several other 
foreign universities.

<HEADLINE> Bengals in Turmoil Day After Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Bruce Coslet still wouldn't talk about the  
Cincinnati Bengals' latest shocking move. Ki-Jana Carter was miffed 
that no one talked to him. 
</P>
<P>
	The winless Bengals lurched through another tough day Thursday  
as players tried to figure out the front office and the head coach 
declined to give his opinion of what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of negative stuff going on around here right  
now,'' Carter said. ``It's not good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest tempest formed Wednesday, when the Bengals decided to  
put Carter on injured reserve with a dislocated kneecap and waived 
fullback Brian Milne, who started 31 of the last 35 games. 
</P>
<P>
	They added a couple of running backs -- Michael Basnight off the  
practice squad and Sedrick Shaw off waivers from Cleveland. But 
with rookie Nick Williams sidelined by a sprained ankle, the 
Bengals were left with one healthy fullback, Clif Groce. 
</P>
<P>
	Coslet, at odds with the front office over releasing veterans,  
walked off the practice field Thursday with nothing to say about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have anything to say yesterday, I don't have anything  
to say today and I won't have anything to say tomorrow,'' Coslet 
said, without slowing his pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, the star-crossed running back who has missed all or most  
of three seasons since he was the No. 1 overall pick in 1995, 
showed up for treatment on his knee Thursday unhappy that he didn't 
get a chance to plead his case. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter tore tissue when his right kneecap came out of place  
during a 27-3 loss Sunday in Carolina. The Bengals decided to put 
him on injured reserve -- ending his season -- because doctors 
anticipated an eight-week recovery time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very disappointed that they did it without giving me a  
chance (to talk them out of it),'' Carter said. ``If it was a 
season-ending injury, I could understand it. They say I'll be out 
eight weeks; I say six. Then we have seven or eight games left. I 
mean, that's half a season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter was unhappy about how he learned of the move.  
</P>
<P>
	``I came home and was watching TV and saw my name at the bottom  
of the screen saying I'm out for the year,'' Carter said. ``That's 
the big thing that really disappointed me, that I had to find out 
from TV. Everyone in this whole world knew I was out besides me. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd think they would have the common courtesy just to call  
me and let me know. They've got all my phone numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Mike Brown said Carter should have been told.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been a mistake on our part here and we apologize  
for it,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some players were still disturbed by the decision to waive  
Milne, who was the lead blocker during Corey Dillon's consecutive 
1,000-yard seasons. Dillon wouldn't talk about the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it's still a shock to us,'' Groce said.  
</P>
<P>
	Groce was waived on Aug. 30 and brought back three days later,  
when the Bengals waived fullback Nicky Sualua. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a country-western song,'' Groce said. ``It's just  
ups and downs -- some tears, shake your head and hopefully when this 
is over, some laughter.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Nuclear Reaction Contained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKAIMURA, Japan (AP) -- An uncontrolled nuclear reaction was  
contained at a uranium processing plant in Japan Friday, 
authorities said, a day after leaking radioactive gas seriously 
injured three workers and possibly contaminated 34 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Masaru Hashimoto, governor of Ibaraki Prefecture, said he had  
received confirmation that the reaction had been brought under 
control at 6:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The company that runs the plant acknowledged fault. The accident  
was the result of a ``clear violation'' of in-house safety rules, 
Makoto Morita, a spokesman for the company JCO, told The Associated 
Press Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The radiation levels outside the plant had returned to normal  
Friday morning and experts said that they did not believe there was 
a serious threat to local residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, officials described the accident as the most serious ever  
at a nuclear facility in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	An order for more than 310,000 residents within a six-mile  
radius to stay inside remained in effect, cloaking this normally 
busy town and the neighboring city of Mito in an eerie silence. 
</P>
<P>
	The facility, which refines uranium so it can be used to fuel  
nuclear reactors, is located in Tokaimura, a town of 33,000 people, 
70 miles northeast of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Morita, the JCO spokesman, said workers had been mixing uranium  
with nitric acid to make nuclear fuel, but had used too much 
uranium and set off the accidental uncontrolled reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	He said one of the workers is believed to have put 35 pounds of  
uranium into the tank -- well over the 4.8-pound limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no words to express our apologies,'' he said. ``We  
cannot escape our responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police were investigating whether negligence was involved,  
according to Japanese news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials said the accident spewed a gas containing  
alpha, beta and gamma radiation into the atmosphere, forcing the 
evacuation of 150 neighbors of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant was not designed to block the escape of radiation,  
company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton expressed deep concern, offered  
assistance. ``This is going to be a very hard day for the people of 
Japan,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the three injured workers were in critical condition from  
the radiation, estimated at about 4,000 times the level considered 
safe for a person to receive in a year, said hospital official 
Yukio Kamakura. 
</P>
<P>
	A team removed water from the cooling equipment around the tank  
early Friday in hopes that it would suppress further nuclear 
fission, Science and Technology Agency official Eiichiro Watanabe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nuclear fission happens when neutrons hit uranium, causing atoms  
to split, releasing huge amounts of energy. It is the principle 
behind the atomic bomb. Water stimulates the neutrons, spurring 
along the reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 34 workers other than the injured were being examined  
for possible contamination, said Junichi Takahashi, an official 
with JCO, which is owned by Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., one of 
Japan's largest business groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Five residents were exposed to radiation, a local official said  
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that Japan has never experienced,''  
government spokesman Hiromu Nonaka said late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Radioactivity levels -- at one point 10,000 times above normal at  
the plant -- remained high several hours after the accident. Ibaraki 
state officials said Thursday that radiation levels were about 10 
times above normal 1 1/4 miles from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Major highways into town were closed, smaller roads had  
electronic billboards asking motorists to pass through the area as 
quickly as possible. Train services were stopped in the area, Kyodo 
News service reported. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Tokyo Electric Power Co. delivered 880 pounds of  
sodium borate, but authorities were trying to figure out how to get 
close enough to dump the neutron-absorbing powder onto the 
radioactive tank to snuff the fission, company official Kohgo Usami 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said in a telephone  
interview from Russia that the United States and Russia were 
prepared to send a joint team of nuclear experts to Japan along 
with high-tech robots that can work in areas too dangerous for 
human beings. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States was awaiting a formal request for help  
from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Nuclear fuel for U.S. reactors is processed using a different  
method than the one used in Japan, said Dr. Donald Olander, a 
professor of nuclear engineering at the University of California at 
Berkely. 
</P>
<P>
	Accidents have plagued the nuclear power industry in Japan -- a  
land so poor in natural resources that it relies on atomic energy 
for about a third of its electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident is sure to damage the already shaky faith of many  
in the nation's nuclear policy. The government set up a task force 
to investigate -- the first time it has taken such a measure in a 
nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an accident that's so basic it should never have  
happened,'' said anti-nuclear activist Chihiro Kamisawa. ``So much 
has been made of Japan's sophisticated technology that supposedly 
makes nuclear energy safe. The accident proves that's absolutely 
not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi acknowledged late Thursday that the  
government was slow in reacting to the accident, Kyodo News agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The three injured workers were exposed to about the same amount  
of radiation as was received in 1986 by workers at the Chernobyl 
plant in the Ukraine during the world's worst nuclear accident, a 
radiation biologist said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are real high doses,'' said Tom Koval, a radiation  
biologist at the National Council on Radiation Protection and 
Measurements, a private, nonprofit agency in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Hisashi Ouchi, 35, and 39-year-old Masato Shinohara were in a  
state of shock and had diarrhea, fever, a high white-blood-cell 
count and reddened skin -- all symptoms of radiation sickness. The 
third injured worker, Yutaka Yokokawa, 54, was alert and able to 
walk.

<HEADLINE> New Owners for Twins Worked on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The owners of Minnesota's NBA and NHL  
teams are were working on a deal to buy the Minnesota Twins, 
contingent upon the construction of a new stadium in St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would have the Twins, the NBA's Timberwolves and the  
NHL's Wild start their own regional sports cable television network 
that would broadcast games of all three teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The principal participants in the talks were Wild lead owner  
Robert Naegele Jr., Timberwolves lead owner Glen Taylor and Twins 
owner Carl Pohlad, reports said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star Tribune of Minneapolis said a group led by Naegele and  
Wild President Jac Sperling submitted a $100 million bid for the 
Twins earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Any deal would depend on the city and the state agreeing to  
build a stadium for the Twins in St. Paul. City voters decide Nov. 
2 whether to approve a 0.5 percentage point increase in the city 
sales tax to pay for one-third the cost of $325 million ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the stadium plan, Pohlad agreed with Mayor Norm  
Coleman last summer to find a buyer by Oct. 1. Coleman aide Mike 
Zipko said Thursday the Friday deadline could be extended a day or 
more if an agreement were imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined ownership of more than one team, frequently including a  
broadcasting component, is growing trend. Jointly owned teams can 
save money if they combine ticket sales, marketing, corporate 
sponsorships and radio and television production. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Coleman nor the owners of the Minnesota franchises would  
comment on the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Pohlad has had at least two offers in recent years, most  
recently one from Minneapolis lawyer Clark Griffith, who said he 
offered between $110 million and $120 million. Griffith is the son 
of Calvin Griffith, who sold the team to Pohlad in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Pohlad's plan to sell the team to North Carolina businessman Don  
Beaver for about $140 million fell through last year after voters 
there rejected a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Vance Opperman, a Wild owner reported to be involved in the  
negotiations, said in July he thought the Twins were worth $100 
million, but only if a new stadium were built.

<HEADLINE> Mob Hit Man Admits to Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A hit man who admitted to federal prosecutors he  
killed 20 people pleaded guilty Thursday to 10 murders in a plea 
bargain that calls for a sentence of as little as 12 1/2 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	John Martorano, 58, agreed to the deal that would have him  
testify against his cohorts in a trial of major New England mob 
figures. He has already served five years in prison while awaiting 
trial, so he could be free in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	As U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf read the 78 charges against  
him, including racketeering, loan sharking and extortion, and asked 
if he understood them, Martorano repeatedly replied, ``Yes, your 
honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some relatives of Martorano's victims sat in the courtroom as  
the powerfully built mobster impassively admitted to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard to look him up in the eye,'' said Denise Castucci,  
whose father, Richard Castucci, was murdered in 1976 by Martorano. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been ripped off of a father and my children of their  
grandfather,'' she said. ``He's sitting there, waiting for a lesser 
sentence. How dare he?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plea bargain must be approved by Wolf, who said he is  
uncertain about accepting the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent ruling, Wolf noted that Martorano turned informant  
only after learning that co-defendants in a racketeering case, 
Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi and fugitive James ``Whitey'' 
Bulger, were themselves FBI informants for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge was concerned that the information used to indict  
Flemmi and Bulger was gathered while they were helping the 
government put mobsters behind bars under promises of immunity. 
Wolf was further worried that the information was used to gain 
Martorano's cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf also said he was not sure a 12 1/2-year sentence was  
appropriate, considering Martorano's record.

<HEADLINE> JonBenet's Siblings Appear at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- The grand jury investigating the death of  
6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey returned to work today, possibly to 
learn more about the inner workings of the Ramsey family. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel of 12 jurors arrived at the Boulder County Courthouse  
before 9 a.m. and convened in a closed-door session. It marked the 
second meeting of the jury this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Melinda Ramsey Long of Virginia and John Andrew Ramsey of  
Atlanta arrived in Denver on Wednesday, apparently to testify 
before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	They are children of John Ramsey and his first wife. JonBenet  
and her brother, Burke, are children of Ramsey and his second wife, 
Patsy. Police have said the parents are under suspicion in the 
girl's death; they deny any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ms. Long, 27, and John Andrew Ramsey, 23, were with their  
mother in Atlanta when their half sister was found dead in the 
family's Boulder home the day after Christmas in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors and law enforcement officers in Boulder declined to  
comment on the grand jury's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Long and John Andrew Ramsey have repeatedly been questioned  
by police but have rarely talked about the case in public. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Long did say in a British television documentary that her  
father ``has never, ever raised a hand to any of his children. He 
has never ever abused us in any way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury that has been investigating JonBenet's death met  
a week ago today for the first time in four months. It faces an 
Oct. 20 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	By that date they must decide whether to indict a suspect, issue  
a ``no true bill'' indicating they didn't find enough evidence to 
indict a named suspect, issue a report, or take no action.

<HEADLINE> Highway Named After Gene Autry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A freeway interchange was named to honor Gene  
Autry on what would have been the singing cowboy's 92nd birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	As a children's choir sang Autry's signature ``Back in the  
Saddle Again,'' his widow, Jackie Autry, pulled a cord Wednesday to 
unveil a green-and-white sign stating ``Gene Autry Memorial 
Interchange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The interchange of Interstate 5 and the 134 Freeway provides  
motorists with access to the Autry Museum of Western Heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that he really personified the romance of the old West  
and it was not only that he was a fine actor and musician, he had 
such a strength of character,'' said state Sen. Adam Schiff, who 
sponsored the legislation to name the interchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Autry, who played a cowboy in movies and TV, also owned major  
league baseball's Anaheim Angels franchise and broadcast stations. 
He died last year.

<HEADLINE> SFX Buys Out Agent Art Tellem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- SFX Entertainment Inc. bought out agent Arn  
Tellem on Wednesday, adding Albert Belle and Nomar Garciaparra to a 
client group that already includes Roger Clemens, Patrick Ewing, 
Alonzo Mourning, Hakeem Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
	SFX last year bought out agent David Falk for about $80 million  
plus what is now 2 million shares of stock, which is worth about 
$66 million if he still has it. With that deal, it acquired a group 
of players that included Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, SFX bought the sports business of agents Alan  
and Randy Hendricks, whose clients include Chuck Knoblauch, Ben 
Grieve, Ryan Klesko, Al Leiter and Kerry Wood, for $15.7 million, 
$5 million in deferred payments plus the chance to earn additional 
bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	With Wednesday's deal to acquire Tellem &AMP; Associates, SFX  
acquires a client list of about 20 major league baseball players 
and 35 NBA players. The price of the Tellem deal was not 
immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	SFX also owns or operates, partially or entirely, 116 venues  
including 16 amphitheaters.

<HEADLINE> Mixup May Have Doomed Mars Orbiter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The $125 million spacecraft that was  
destroyed on a mission to Mars was probably doomed by the 
embarrassing failure to convert English units of measurement to 
metric ones, NASA said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Climate Orbiter flew too close to Mars and is believed  
to have broken apart or burned up in the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA said the English-vs.-metric mixup apparently caused the  
navigation error. The company that built the spacecraft 
acknowledged it made the error. 
</P>
<P>
	The mistake was particularly embarrassing because the spacecraft  
had successfully flown 416 million miles over 9 1/2 months before its 
disappearance Sept. 23 just as it was about to go into orbit around 
the Red Planet. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials said the mistake somehow escaped what is  
supposed to be a rigorous error-checking process. A report is 
expected in mid-November, which would be soon enough to fix any 
possible similar problems with a spacecraft already en route to 
Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not make us feel good that this happened,'' said Tom  
Gavin of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``This mixup has caused 
us to look at our entire end-to-end process. We will get to the 
bottom of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	JPL said that its preliminary findings showed that Lockheed  
Martin Astronautics in Colorado submitted acceleration data in 
English units of pounds of force instead of the metric unit called 
newtons. At JPL, the numbers were entered into a computer that 
assumed metric measurements. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our previous Mars missions, we have always used metric,''  
Gavin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers were used in figuring the force of thruster firings  
used by the spacecraft to adjust its position. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad numbers had been used ever since the spacecraft's launch  
last December, but the effect was so small that it went unnoticed. 
The difference added up over the months as the spacecraft journeyed 
toward Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	Gavin said he does not expect the error to affect NASA's  
relationship with Lockheed Martin Astronautics, which has built 
several probes for the space agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin Astronautics acknowledged the mistake.  
</P>
<P>
	``We should have had them in metric units,'' said Noel Hinners,  
vice president of flight systems for Lockheed Martin Astronautics 
in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Climate Orbiter was on a mission to study the Red  
Planet's weather and look for signs of water -- information key to 
understanding whether life ever existed or can exist there. It 
carried cameras along with equipment for measuring temperature, 
dust, water vapor and clouds. 
</P>
<P>
	The orbiter's sibling spacecraft, Mars Polar Lander, is set to  
arrive Dec. 3. Gavin said investigators are trying to determine 
whether NASA made the same mistake with that spacecraft. The 
problem could be fixed if it did occur. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Polar Lander will study Mars' climate history and  
weather with the goal of finding what happened to water on the 
planet. It is equipped with a robotic arm that will collect samples 
for testing inside the spacecraft.

<HEADLINE> Memo Accuses Haskins of Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- An academic counselor says former Minnesota  
basketball coach Clem Haskins asked him to write a paper for a 
player if it would keep the athlete academically eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Counselor Rick Marsden wrote in the 1986 memo about ``a  
disturbing interaction'' he had with Haskins, who was hired that 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The document, obtained by investigators examining academic fraud  
at the university, was one of several shown to Elayne Donahue, 
former director of the academic counseling unit, during a 
deposition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are preparing a report, to be made public in  
November, on academic fraud in the basketball program and other 
alleged misconduct in the men's athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsden wrote that a player's eligibility was in jeopardy and  
that Haskins told him ``we'' must ``do whatever it takes to get 
(the student) eligible. ... Clem said that if someone doing a paper 
for an athlete would allow him the opportunity be eligible to 
compete, and therefore succeed, we need to do the paper for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marsden wrote that he was ``shocked'' by Haskins' statement and  
that he wouldn't write the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsden also said in the memo that he heard Haskins ask Susan  
Latendresse, a secretary in the basketball office in 1986, to 
process a scholarship tender to an athlete who had hired an agent 
and therefore lost his amateur status. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsden is now a counselor in another department at the  
university. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins, who resigned under pressure and accepted a $1.5 million  
buyout of his contract in June, has said he had no knowledge of any 
academic cheating in the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached by telephone Thursday, Haskins' wife, Yevette Haskins,  
said he would not comment on the memo.

<HEADLINE> Psychiatrist Settles Trading Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an unusual insider-trading case, a Maryland  
psychiatrist has agreed to pay $87,558 to settle federal 
regulators' allegations he used information from a patient on an 
upcoming corporate acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission had sued Dr. Alan Brody  
in federal court, alleging that he improperly used information from 
a patient who was a company official to benefit from stock trades. 
</P>
<P>
	In agreeing Wednesday to the settlement with the SEC, Dr. Brody  
neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. Of the $87,558.06 he agreed 
to pay, $38,000 was a civil fine, an additional $38,000 was 
restitution of his allegedly illegal trading profits and the 
remainder was interest. Dr. Brody, 47, of Potomac, Md., also agreed 
to refrain from future violations of securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Brody neither admits nor denies the allegations of the  
complaint,'' his attorney, Jake Stein, said in a statement. He 
declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't the first time the market watchdog agency has sued a  
psychiatrist for alleged insider trading, but such cases are rare. 
The SEC brought similar cases against psychiatrists and 
psychotherapists in 1986, 1991 and 1995. The most high-profile 
case, in 1991, involved the psychiatrist of the wife of Sanford 
Weill, a prominent Wall Street figure who at the time headed the 
big brokerage firm Shearson Lehman Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Psychiatric Association has an ethics code that  
requires psychiatrists to act only in their patients' interest and 
refrain from any conduct designed to ``gratify his or her own needs 
by exploiting the patient,'' said Dr. Paul Appelbaum, the group's 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Appelbaum, who heads the psychiatry department at the  
University of Massachusetts Medical Center, noted that 
psychiatrists found to have violated this ``principle of 
abstinence'' may be subject to discipline by the professional 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dr. Brody's case, the SEC alleged that he received the inside  
information during an appointment on June 11, 1996 with a patient 
who was an official of Penril DataComm Networks Inc. of 
Gaithersburg, Md., which was about to spin off a division to its 
shareholders and sell the rest of its business to Bay Networks 
Inc., then based in Santa Clara, Calif., in a $120 million stock 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The patient, who told Dr. Brody about the upcoming deal,  
believed that the information confided as part of his professional 
treatment would be held in confidence and would not be used by the 
psychiatrist for his personal benefit, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The patient had established a relationship of trust and  
confidence with Dr. Brody, and had a history of confiding in Dr. 
Brody with respect to all aspects of his personal and professional 
life for the purpose of undergoing professional treatment,'' the 
SEC said in its court filing. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Brody began to buy Penril stock within 15 minutes after the  
appointment ended, eventually buying 15,000 shares through two 
brokerage firms, according to the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 17, the public announcement by Penril and Bay drove up  
Penril's stock price by 36 percent, giving Dr. Brody $38,000 in 
profits when he sold his shares, the SEC said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Against Yen, Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell slightly against the yen  
Thursday as traders anticipated that a report from Japan's central 
bank would show an improvement in business sentiment. The dollar 
also lost ground to most other major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has been on a tear against the dollar this summer, but  
eased up a bit in the last week or so amid signs that Japan may 
take steps to slow the yen's ascent, which has been worrying 
Japanese industrialists. 
</P>
<P>
	A rising yen makes Japanese exports more expensive in world  
markets, something that could threaten an economic recovery from a 
decade-long economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen began to come back in favor Thursday as investors  
expected a report due out Monday from Japan's central bank to show 
an improvement in business sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tankan survey is a widely watched indicator of Japan's  
economy. Hopes for a recovery have been a major factor behind the 
yen's rally since May. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 106.77  
Japanese yen, down from 106.98 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0684, up from  
$1.0641 late Wednesday. The euro has been gaining ground in recent 
days on hopes that the European Central Bank may move to raise 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4969 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5036, and 1.4674 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4641. The British 
pound rose to $1.6464 from $1.6442. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8308 German 
marks, down from 1.8380; 6.1403 French francs, down from 6.1644; 
and 1,812.39 Italian lire, down from 1,819.63.

<HEADLINE> Minnesotans React to Gov. Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Anyone who was NOT offended by Gov. Jesse  
Ventura's Playboy interview, please raise your hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The former pro wrestler whose frank talk got him elected in an  
upset last fall gave an interview in which he aimed barbs at 
religion and fat people, and declared the Navy's Tailhook scandal 
was overblown. 
</P>
<P>
	And that was just the beginning of what the Reform Party's  
biggest star had to say. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the morning after the interview became public,  
Ventura got the tag-team treatment from both his political 
opponents and his own party. 
</P>
<P>
	``Minnesotans do not embrace your views on religion, on women,  
on prostitution, on drugs or conspiracy,'' Senate Majority Leader 
Roger Moe, a Democrat, said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	State Republican chairman Ron Eibensteiner said Ventura should  
consider stepping down because his ``attacks show he has a 
fundamental lack of understanding of the world he lives in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Body defended his comments by saying: ``This is Playboy.  
They want you to be provocative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One major question is whether the interview will hurt the Reform  
Party and Ventura's standing as a player in Reform Party 
presidential politics. As the party's highest-ranking elected 
official, Ventura exerts great influence. He has encouraged 
developer Donald Trump to get into the presidential race and made 
it plain that Pat Buchanan isn't welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a national level he gets attention, but it's attention that  
eerily parallels the `What's going on upstairs' attention that Ross 
Perot got,'' said Chris Gilbert, a political science professor at 
Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter. Ventura is ``no longer 
provocative; he's a potential laughingstock. It's exactly what the 
Reform Party doesn't need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The interview, which hits the newsstands Monday, was conducted  
over three days this summer with contributing editor Lawrence 
Grobel. 
</P>
<P>
	In it, Ventura called for the regulation of illegal drugs, with  
the creation of ``places where the addict can go get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pronounced organized religion ``a sham and a crutch for  
weak-minded people,'' and blamed it for the unpopularity of 
legalized prostitution, which he has said should be considered. He 
also said that President Kennedy was killed by assassins hired by 
the ``military-industrial complex'' because he was planning to 
withdraw from Vietnam. And he declared that Tailhook was ``much ado 
about nothing'' and claimed that fat people ``can't push away from 
the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura tried to clarify his remarks on religion Thursday,  
saying he doesn't need it but doesn't condemn those who do, 
including his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he sent religious leaders a letter saying he  
respects the role they play in people's lives and said his 
skepticism was shaped during his experience as a Navy SEAL in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I witnessed many instances of so-called religious leaders  
zealously marketing their beliefs to people too uneducated to 
comprehend what they were talking about and too poor to afford the 
money they were being asked to hand over,'' Ventura wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Catholic League, a Roman Catholic organization based in New  
York, called him Jesse ``The Bigot'' Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Catholic League is interested in knowing whether Ventura's  
hostility to religion represents the position of the Reform 
Party,'' said league president William Donohoe. 
</P>
<P>
	Reform Party Chairman Russ Verney said he had been deluged with  
calls and was extremely distressed, especially about the comments 
on faith and Tailhook. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been building the Reform Party based on principles,  
integrity and values and this story is just so humiliating,'' 
Verney said. ``It is contrary to everything we have been building 
in the Reform Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lynn Wong, a mortgage company manager from Coon Rapids, said  
she likes that the governor says what he wants ``instead of telling 
us what he thinks he wants us to hear.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nuclear Safeguards Have Failed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite strict rules to guard against  
unplanned nuclear chain reactions, U.S. nuclear fuel plants have 
had at least two incidents in which those safeguards failed, 
according to government and industry officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, these officials said, it is extremely rare for nuclear  
fuel to reach so-called ``criticality,'' as apparently occurred at 
the fuel plant in Japan in which three workers were exposed to high 
levels of radiation and hundreds of people were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident in Japan occurred at a fuel fabrication plant,  
similar to seven such plants operated by private companies in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said ``our thoughts and prayers are with the  
people in Japan'' because of the nuclear accident. ``You can only 
imagine how difficult this must be for them,'' said the president. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Japan incident continues to be investigated, it is  
believed the nuclear chain reaction occurred when workers placed 
more than six times the amount of uranium allowed into a vat of 
nitric acid, said an industry source, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The acid normally is used to remove impurities from recycled  
uranium left over from fabricated fuel pellets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a serious nuclear accident,'' Energy Secretary Bill  
Richardson said in a telephone interview from Russia, where he is 
visiting nuclear facilities. ``The good news is that it is not a 
widely contaminated area. It's a limited area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National  
Laboratory were monitoring atmospheric conditions to track the 
radioactive plume created when radiation rushed from the plant. 
Unlike nuclear reactors, fuel fabrication plants -- both in Japan 
and in the United States -- do not have protective containments. 
</P>
<P>
	No information on the plume was available from Livermore or the  
Energy Department late Thursday. Officials in Japan said radiation 
levels outside the plant had returned to normal by Friday morning 
there. As a result, the spread of significant radiation in the 
atmosphere became less likely as the early doses dissipated, an 
American official speculated. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said the United State and Russia were prepared to  
send a joint team of nuclear experts to help Japan deal with the 
problem. As of late Thursday, no request for such assistance had 
been received. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been a number of incidents of unplanned nuclear chain  
reactions, but most have involved very small amounts of material 
such as used in research environments. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States there has only been one incident in which  
``criticality'' had been achieved at a nuclear fuel processing 
plant. That occurred in 1964 at a plant, no longer in operation, 
near Charleston, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	A worker poured a bottle of uranium solution into a container  
when it went critical as he leaned over the vat and was killed, 
said Michael Weber, an official of the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight years ago at another fuel fabrication plant operated by  
General Electric near Wilmington, N.C., workers struggled for 
several days to keep uranium in a water-filled tank from setting 
off a nuclear chain reaction. They averted criticality by pumping 
oxygen into the tank. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took a solution and introduced it into (what) ... was not  
a suitable tank,'' said Weber, violating NRC rules for safeguarding 
the nuclear material. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are very strict controls that we put on the plants,''  
said Weber. These include specifications on how much uranium can be 
in a container, the shape of the container and the mass within a 
container. If any of these requirements are violated, criticality 
can occur, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The uranium fuel cycle is spread across a number of facilities  
in the United States. First, uranium ore is converted to 
hexafloride gas, then it is shipped to another plant for 
enrichment, and then to one of seven fuel fabrication plants that 
turn the gaseous or liquid uranium into powder and then reactor 
fuel pellets. 
</P>
<P>
	Uranium powder left over from the molding of fuel pellets often  
is put into nitric acid for purification and recycling. 
</P>
<P>
	It is at this stage where it is believed workers in Japan placed  
as much as 16 kilograms of uranium into a tank of acid that should 
have held no more than 2.4 kilograms, according to industry sources 
who have been briefed on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the NRC, the seven U.S. nuclear fuel fabrication  
plants are: an ABB Combustion Engineering plant in Hematite, Mo.; a 
General Electric plant in Wilmington, N.C.; a Westinghouse plant in 
Columbia, S.C.; a Nuclear Fuel Services plant in Erwin, Tenn.; the 
Framatome Cogema Fuels plant in Lynchburg, Va.; the BWX Technolgies 
plant, also in Lynchburg, and Siemens Power Corp. plant in 
Richland, Wash.

<HEADLINE> Search Is on for Worst Boss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- If the person at the top of your office's  
corporate ladder acts more like something at the bottom of the food 
chain, Claude Carter wants to hear from you. 
</P>
<P>
	The creator of the Web site myboss.com is seeking submissions  
for the Dumbest Boss of the Millennium Contest. The person who 
tells the funniest story gets $1,000, but it won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
	Every week, Carter receives about 150 tales of woe, with workers  
from the United States and abroad blowing the whistle on their head 
honchos. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's really no difference between what people say in Bombay  
and what they say in Boston,'' said Carter, who started his Web 
site in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to the Web site, which posts new horror stories every  
Monday, can vote for the century's most meat-headed manager. One 
winner will be picked each week of the contest's run, and then Web 
site visitors will choose the worst five stories from the weekly 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
	The contest, which started about two weeks ago, ends Nov. 29.  
Like all stories sent to myboss.com, the sender and the subject of 
their ire remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	One recent submission went like this: ``My company conducted a  
salary review and then raised the pay scale for my level. I 
immediately met with my boss because my current salary was below 
the new minimum. To fix it, he reduced my level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And another, describing what happened after a company closed its  
first big deal: ``To celebrate an excellent `team effort,' our boss 
called a meeting in the conference room and ordered two bottles of 
Dom Perignon to share with everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the room was quiet, he raised his hand to signal a toast.  
He said, `Here's to me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he thinks 100,000 Web surfers from 70 countries stop  
into his Web site each week, Carter -- whose own experiences with 
dumb bosses gave him the idea for the Web site -- gives a simple 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a large number of people out there who work for  
blockheads.''

<HEADLINE>  MLS' Revolution Fires Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Coach Walter Zenga was fired Thursday by  
the New England Revolution with two games left in the regular 
season. He was replaced by Steve Nicol, who coached the Boston 
Bulldogs of the A League in Framingham. 
</P>
<P>
	Zenga, who took over as player-coach with six games left last  
season, led the Revolution to a 10-20-4 record this year. With two 
games left, New England trails Miami by one point for the last 
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Zenga has a 5-13 record as 
a goalkeeper and will not continue as a player with the Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Brian O'Donovan said Zenga didn't want to wait  
until the end of the season to discuss a contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``He also indicated to us that he had other options in Italy and  
needed to explore them immediately,'' O'Donovan said in a team 
statement. ``We received (Wednesday) a written ultimatum insisting 
that the team reach a decision. We would have preferred to evaluate 
fully the situation during the offseason and make our decision 
then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zenga, 39, named the world's best goalkeeper after the 1990  
World Cup, played that position for the Revolution in 1997. He then 
retired from the team and returned to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 23, 1998, he was named to replace Thomas Rongen, who was  
fired by the Revolution. Zenga led the Revolution to a 3-3 record 
last year and its first playoff berth ever.

<HEADLINE>  IMF Head Warns Against Complacency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Future global financial crises can be avoided  
if governments show determination to avoid complacency, Michel 
Camdessus, the head of the International Monetary Fund, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be making a grave error if we let the return of  
relative calm in financial markets and the improvement in world 
growth prospects lead us to believe that further reforms are not 
necessary,'' Camdessus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus spoke at the closing session of this year's IMF-World  
Bank meetings a day after President Clinton said the United States 
would forgive all bilateral debt of those poor countries eligible 
for a new $27 billion debt relief initiative launched this week by 
the two organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The world has changed considerably since the IMF-World Bank  
meetings a year ago, when the global financial system was in 
turmoil as a result of the Asian currency crisis, Russia's economic 
collapse and the near failure of a large U.S. hedge fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said governments now are ``obliged to deliver on what  
has been promised ... these steps have created a strong new impetus 
to the war on poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	But Camdessus also said governments must reform the global  
financial system and involve the private sector in preventing and 
resolving crises. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference later, he welcomed the pledge by the Bank  
of Japan that it would provide sufficient cash to keep the 
country's fragile recovery going. 
</P>
<P>
	He said intervention by the Group of Seven industrialized  
countries to curb the rise of the yen against the dollar should 
only be an option of ``last resort, providing ample liquidity 
materializes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus also repeated there was ``no evidence of the theft of  
any IMF money provided to Russia.'' He said earlier it would be 
irresponsible for the international community to turn its back on 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus also brushed aside speculation he may be considering  
resigning before the end of his record-breaking third five-year 
term of office in 2002, saying, ``I enjoy my job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate announcement, the IMF said its board has approved  
a plan for a one-time off-market sale of up to 14 million ounces of 
gold to finance the debt relief initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan calls for the IMF to sell gold at market prices to some  
central banks of member countries which owe the fund money ``on the 
understanding that these central banks will use the gold to make 
the repayment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	World Bank President James Wolfensohn said he hoped Congress  
would approve President Clinton's debt relief pledge and that other 
countries would follow the U.S. example. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made U.S. debt forgiveness for 36 poor countries, mostly  
in sub-Sahara Africa, contingent on their using the money saved for 
health care, education and other basic human needs. 
</P>
<P>
	He told finance ministers and central bank governors from 182  
nations the United States could not ask these countries to choose 
between making interest payments and investing in their children's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am directing my administration to make it possible to  
forgive 100 percent of the debt these countries owe to the United 
States, when needed to help them finance basic human needs and when 
the money will be used to do so,'' Clinton said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for the poor nations said Clinton's announcement would  
put pressure on the other industrialized nations to offer 100 
percent debt relief. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's offer came on the last full day of the annual  
meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton urged Congress to see to it that America does its part  
in helping fund the initiative by approving the $970 million he 
requested last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have asked for the money and shown how it would be paid  
for,'' Clinton said in a remark that was greeted by applause, ``and 
I ask the Congress to keep our country shouldering its fair share 
of the burden.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. write-off mostly will benefit countries in sub-Sahara  
Africa that owe huge amounts of money but have few exports to 
offset their debt payments, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers 
said.

<HEADLINE> Some Clinton Friends Declined Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Thursday that some of  
his friends declined to help him buy his $1.7 million home in 
suburban New York because they didn't want to get ``dragged 
around'' and subjected to unwarranted allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamenting the attitudes in Washington, Clinton said, ``There's  
the rest of the world and the way it works and the way people view 
things. And then there's the way a lot of things around here 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president and his wife Hillary are to close on their  
five-bedroom home in Chappaqua, N.Y., in early November. 
Originally, the Clintons said they would accept a loan guarantee 
from Terry McAuliffe, a friend and major fund raiser for the 
president. But the Clintons dropped that idea amid criticism of the 
deal and began pursuing a conventional mortgage, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president refused to discuss the financing arrangements but  
said he would make them public if there is a change. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was asked specifically about reports that two wealthy  
friends, former chief of staff Erskine Bowles and former Treasury 
Secretary Robert Rubin, declined to help with the mortgage 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have anything to say about that,'' the president  
began. He said McAuliffe called and he said, `If you can get 
somebody else to do it, fine.''' Clinton said everyone thought it 
was a legitimate business arrangement and, ``No one thought there 
was anything wrong with it....'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the president added, ``I think some people didn't want  
to do it because they know they live ... in the Larry Klayman 
political press world, in which what's true is not as important as 
whether you can be dragged around and you have to spend a lot of 
money you don't have -- or you'd rather not spend -- for reasons that 
have nothing to do with anything that's real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington works differently from the rest of the country, he  
said, and then told reporters, ``You're all smiling because you 
think, `I wonder if the president made a mistake by committing the 
truth in that last remark.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Klayman is chairman of the conservative legal-rights group  
Judicial Watch which has sued the Clinton administration on 
numerous subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to Clinton's comment, Klayman said, ``It seems that  
the president is a bit testy these days after 38 scandals and an 
impeachment proceeding. ...Mr. Clinton's defensiveness and personal 
attack on me is because he knows that Judicial Watch will hold him 
accountable legally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president was asked about the mortgage deal during an  
appearance in the White House press briefing room to discuss a new 
poverty report and the budget battle with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he had to move fast to get the contract for the  
home because ``we had just a day or two to get that house. A lot of 
people wanted it for the same reason we liked it. We know that a 
lot of people liked the house. It's a nice place. We liked it. And 
so we did what was necessary to secure it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the original financing plan, the Clintons agreed to use  
their own money for the $350,000 down payment. McAuliffe put up 
$1.35 million as collateral to guarantee the mortgage.

<HEADLINE> Female Finches Like Handsome Dads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Birds have at least one thing in common with  
humans: The ladies prefer a well-dressed guy. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of researchers in France and Scotland has discovered that  
female zebra finches give an added jolt of hormones to eggs sired 
by males wearing red leg bands. When the father was wearing a green 
leg band the mothers didn't bother with the extra boost. 
</P>
<P>
	The report raises questions about the long-standing assumption  
that female birds pick better-looking males merely to get good 
genes for their offspring. In this case, at least, the mother also 
has a hand in improving the chick's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate studies have indicated that chicks from eggs that got  
the extra testosterone were more active and grew faster than 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, in the field, male finches do not wear rings, lead  
researcher Diego Gil of the University of Paris pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they do have is red beaks, which are used by females to  
choose mates. What seems to happen is that by using rings in the 
lab we have tapped into a female perceptive mechanism, and the 
female sees the red-banded male as a super-male,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new findings are being reported in a paper in Friday's  
edition of the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not something the female thinks about, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``To assume consciousness on the part of the female would be a  
big leap,'' Gil cautioned. ``We consider the differential 
investment as a physiological reaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Professor Hubert Schwabl of Washington State University, who  
first discovered that some female birds can vary the hormones in 
their eggs, termed the findings ``exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The surprising result is the influence of male attractiveness  
on these hormone levels,'' said Schwabl, who was not part of the 
research team. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet to be determined, he said, is whether the stimulation by the  
more attractive male raises the female's hormone levels and that is 
reflected in her eggs, or whether females somehow control the 
hormone levels.

<HEADLINE> FCC Wants Long-Distance Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Asked about a rumored alliance between the  
nation's second- and third-largest long-distance companies, the 
government's top telephone regulator said Thursday that generally 
no merger should be permitted that might raise prices due to less 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Communications Commission Chairman Bill Kennard said he  
would not discuss published reports of a possible deal between 
Sprint and MCI WorldCom. But Kennard did credit competition in the 
long-distance market for lowering rates for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today in America consumers are enjoying the lowest  
long-distance rates in history,'' he told business leaders gathered 
at The Wall Street Journal technology conference. ``We cannot allow 
any merger to happen in this industry that turns back the clock on 
that competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom is the nation's second-largest long-distance  
company, followed by Sprint, parent of Sprint PCS, a mobile phone 
business with 4 million wireless customers. Together, Sprint and 
MCI WorldCom control about 30 percent of the U.S. long-distance 
market, still far behind AT&AMP;T Corp.'s 60 percent share. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard emphasized that all mergers brought before the  
commission must be evaluated on their own terms. But he did 
indicate that such a deal -- if sought by the companies -- would not 
be a sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't hear me saying it's going to be fine,'' Kennard  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, following WorldCom's $37 billion takeover of MCI  
Communications Corp., Kennard indicated that the industry might be 
at its limit in terms of such colossal deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once this merger is consummated, the industry will again be  
poised just a merger away from undue concentration,'' Kennard said 
in September 1998. ``I dare say that any subsequent merger of this 
or similar magnitude between long-distance firms in the near future 
should be judged quite differently than the merger before us 
today.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Advance; Dow Up 118.72 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks made their first solid advance in nearly  
two weeks today as a government report of slower economic growth 
raised hopes that the Federal Reserve won't raise interest rates 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 118.72 at 10,332.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 16.10 at 1,284.47, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 21.30 at 2,751.57. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks rose after the Commerce Department reported that the U.S.  
economy, weighed down by record trade deficits, saw growth slow to 
an annual rate of 1.6 percent during the second quarter, the lowest 
rate of expansion in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The report provided a bit of relief for investors who have  
driven stocks lower over the past week in anticipation of the Fed's 
Oct. 5 meeting on interest rates. In a bid to cool the economy's 
sizzling growth, the Fed has raised rates twice this year and 
suggested it would do so again if signs of inflation crept into the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Enthusiasm for the gross domestic product reading was somewhat  
tempered by a second report that showed sales of new single-family 
homes unexpectedly surged 2.9 percent in August to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 983,000 units, the second-highest level on 
record. The increase occurred despite rising mortgage rates and 
surprised analysts expecting a decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Labor Department said the number of Americans  
filing for unemployment benefits last week rose by 25,000 to 
299,000, reflecting the impact of Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Claims below 300,000 are considered a sign of an extremely tight  
labor market. Many economists believe the Fed will consider the 
labor shortage in its debate on interest rates, as companies spend 
heavily to attract and retain skilled workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said some of the buying today was sparked by portfolio  
managers working to square their accounts for the end of the third 
quarter. That drew investors to shares that have held up well 
throughout the quarter, including Hewlett Packard, up 3/4 to 90, and 
Sun Microsystems, up 2 5/16 to 93 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has looked pretty lousy all week, and my sense is  
that the end of the quarter brought some people back into it 
today,'' said Ned Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities America. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq's gains were hemmed in by some of its major  
technology names. Amazon.com slipped 1/4 to 80 1/2 after rising sharply 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, shares of companies that make computer chips tumbled,  
continuing to suffer from worries that last week's earthquake in 
Taiwan will hamper production. Applied Materials fell 2 11/16 to 77 
1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 605.91 million 
shares, ahead of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index rose 2.39 to 423.91.

	BEIJING (AP) -- With huge lantern balloons swaying overhead,  
children in red, blue and green jackets turned vast Tiananmen 
Square into a sea of color Friday as China began celebrations 
feting 50 years of communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Imposing columns of tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks  
bearing surface-to-air missiles moved through Beijing before dawn, 
followed in the day's first light by garish floats for each of 
China's provinces -- white plastic horses for Inner Mongolia and a 
replica of Hong Kong's skyscraping skyline for China's newest 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Army veterans bedecked with medals from their service in the  
communist revolution sat in red felt-covered viewing stands as 
patriotic marches resonated through the square's loudspeakers. 
Ordinary citizens were kept away by a martial-law style security 
cordon that left Beijing's streets eerily empty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Communist Party's celebration Friday, costing the equivalent  
of $36 million, will showcase the nation's growing military might 
and its rapid economic progress since Mao Tse-tung stood atop the 
Gate of Heavenly Peace on Oct. 1, 1949, and declared the founding 
of the People's Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``These achievements should be attributed to the great, glorious  
and correct Communist Party of China, to the hardworking, brave and 
talented people of China and to the superior socialist system,'' 
Premier Zhu Rongji said in a speech at a gala reception of 5,000 
dignitaries on the anniversary's eve. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's festivities were to include a 2-mile long military  
parade with more than 10,000 soldiers in brand-new uniforms showing 
off the best of China's growing arsenal, mass performances and 
evening fireworks displays. The events involve more than a 
half-million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin and other senior  
leaders will stand atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace as tanks and 
trucks bearing the new Dongfeng 31 long-range missile thunder by, 
while homemade fighter jets roar overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders hope the national pride generated for the  
anniversary will redound to the Communist Party, whose public image 
has been tarnished by pervasive official corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese people have never held their heads so high and  
drawn so much attention from all over the world as they do today,'' 
the party's flagship newspaper, People's Daily, said in an 
editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	Tycoons and movie stars like action hero Jackie Chan were  
invited to attend, but pro-democracy legislators from Hong Kong, 
many of whom are routinely denied entry into China, were glaringly 
absent from the list. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge red lanterns and banners proclaiming ``Long Live the  
Great People's Republic of China'' -- scarlet symbols of happiness -- 
contrasted sharply with the grim controls imposed to ensure that 
the most patriotic event in a half-century is not disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has raised benefits for the growing legions of  
unemployed, but it also cracked down on political dissidents and 
drove out migrants and beggars. In thorough security sweeps along 
the parade route, police inspected for bombs, padlocked manholes 
and sealed mailboxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Skies cleared early Friday after heavy rains overnight  
threatened to spoil the celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Barred from the parade route, most Beijing residents will view  
the events on television and enjoyed a weeklong holiday that will 
give them a chance, once traffic restrictions are lifted Saturday, 
to enjoy improvements to their usually drab, dusty city. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebrations highlight progress made in five decades under  
communism -- the first three scarred by political turmoil, the last 
two devoted to whirlwind economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back then, conditions weren't so good,'' said 70-year-old Liu  
Baoqin, who as a young soldier stood guard during the inaugural 
National Day celebration in 1949. ``There's no comparison. It's 
like heaven and earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1949, the average Chinese life expectancy was 35 years.  
Today, it's 71. Then, two-thirds of all Chinese were illiterate; 
now, 12 percent cannot read. Then, many Chinese starved. Today, for 
most there is plenty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, we can buy anything we need or want. Look at the  
clothes we are wearing -- They're pretty good and they're not even 
our best,'' said Peng Junzhou, a retired doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	The authorities took no chances in ensuring that patriotism  
ruled the day. Households were ordered to display the red and gold 
national flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from Beijing, in Lhasa, capital of Chinese-ruled Tibet,  
ethnic Tibetans were ordered to take part in the National Day 
festivities or face possible cuts in their pay or pensions, the 
London-based monitoring group Tibet Information Network reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas human rights lobbyists urged Chinese leaders to mark  
the anniversary by releasing all political prisoners and improving 
legal protections of civil liberties. 
</P>
<P>
	``This anniversary should be an occasion to declare a general  
amnesty for all and to start the next half-century and the next 
millennium on a sound human rights footing,'' Sidney Jones of New 
York-based Human Rights Watch said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Tape Contains Evidence of Sex Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A stolen camcorder contained evidence of a more  
serious crime, which is why police say its owner never reported the 
camera missing in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	William Hampton, 44, has been charged with four counts of  
first-degree statutory sodomy and one count of using a child for a 
sexual performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say the camcorder contained all the proof they needed,  
including a 15-minute segment of Hampton committing lewd acts with 
a 4 1/2-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tape is truly disgusting,'' said Lt. Mary Warnecke,  
commander of the Police Department's sex crimes-child abuse units. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say the discovery would never have been made had the  
camera not been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	After a burglar broke into Hampton's St. Louis home earlier this  
month, the thief gave the camcorder to his mother and she sold it 
for $150. The buyer examined the camcorder, found a tape inside and 
played it. 
</P>
<P>
	After viewing the contents, the buyer notified police.  
Authorities eventually found the thief, who agreed to help police 
by leading them to Hampton's home. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to facing the state charges, federal prosecutors  
charged Hampton with producing child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	The thief had been arrested Sept. 22 on unrelated burglary  
charges and was awaiting trial. He told police he stole the 
camcorder about a week before his arrest.

<HEADLINE> Marriott To Buy Back 10.6M Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Marriott International Inc. on Thursday  
announced it was buying back 10.6 million shares worth more than 
$320 million and reported third-quarter earnings up 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotel and real estate firm credited cost control for the  
increased earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a press release, the company said it has bought back 5.6  
million shares this year and will buy 10.6 million more shares from 
time to time in the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	Marriott had about 246 million shares outstanding as of Sept.  
10. Shares closed Thursday at $32.68 3/4, up 12 1/2 cents, on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotel and lodging real estate company reported net income of  
$96 million for the quarter ending Sept. 10, compared to $86 
million in the same period a year ago. Per share earnings were 36 
cents, compared to 32 cents in the corresponding quarter a year 
ago, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $2 billion, up 11 percent from $1.8 billion in same  
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and CEO J.W. Marriott Jr. said the company's flagship  
brand -- Marriott Hotels, Resorts and Suites -- achieved higher 
profit margins through tight cost controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritz-Carlton, the company's luxury brand hotel, had a strong  
summer, he said. Occupancy at the 35 Ritz-Carlton hotels was 79.7 
percent, up 5.9 percentage points from the same quarter a year ago. 
The chain's 11,600 rooms rented for an average of $196.79.

<HEADLINE> Many Seniors Face High Drug Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Half of elderly Americans who have private  
health insurance covering drugs still spend $500 to $999 a year 
out-of-pocket on prescriptions, according to a new report from the 
AARP. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest organization for older adults released the  
study Thursday to back up its support for adding drug coverage to 
Medicare, the national health insurance program for the elderly and 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many argue that because roughly two-thirds of Medicare  
beneficiaries have some type of drug coverage, a Medicare drug 
benefit for everybody is not necessary,'' said John Rother, AARP's 
public policy director. ``But this study provides evidence that the 
current system is not working for beneficiaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Medicare now does not cover prescriptions, a majority  
of the elderly has some type of insurance covering drugs -- mainly 
through retirement benefits from jobs, HMOs or private policies 
known as Medigap. 
</P>
<P>
	The AARP study concluded that is no guarantee they will be  
spared high out-of-pocket costs. Deductibles, copayments and caps 
on benefits can leave even those with insurance financially 
exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the elderly who had out-of-pocket drug costs of $500 to  
$999, 50 percent faced those high bills in spite of having some 
insurance coverage, the study found. Among those with $1,000 or 
more in drug costs annually, 42 percent had insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The AARP study estimates that among all non-institutionalized  
Medicare beneficiaries, average per-person out-of-pocket costs for 
drugs will be $410 this year. About 13 percent will have drug costs 
between $500 and $999, and 12 percent over $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has proposed adding drug coverage to Medicare  
as option for all elderly Americans. Republican leaders in Congress 
have questioned whether any but the poorest truly need it. 
</P>
<P>
	AARP based its study on Medicare's 1995 survey of beneficiaries,  
the most recent data available.

<HEADLINE> Report: Spielberg in Deal With NBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Steven Spielberg has reached an agreement with  
NBC to create a television drama series about the United States 
Marine Corps, The New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The series, to be called ``Semper Fi,'' will chronicle the lives  
of a group of young marines from their entrance into boot camp 
through their assignment to the Marines' Special Forces unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper cited an unidentified senior NBC executive who  
said the network has agreed in principle to buy 13 episodes of the 
series from Spielberg's studio, DreamWorks SKG. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides still must work out an agreement over production  
costs for the series, which is expected to be ready for the fall 
2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot episode is to be directed by the two-time  
Oscar-winning director, and would be the first time he has directed 
for television since 1986, when he oversaw several episodes of the 
series ``Amazing Stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg already has retained the services of Dale Dye, the  
former Marine Corps captain who served as a consultant on 
Spielberg's Oscar-winning film ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the NBC 
executive said.

<HEADLINE> Ramsey Siblings Expected To Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- John Ramsey's two adult children were  
expected to testify before the grand jury that returned to work 
Thursday to investigate the death of his 6-year-old daughter, 
JonBenet. 
</P>
<P>
	Melinda Ramsey Long and John Andrew Ramsey were in Boulder, but  
prosecutors refused to say whether they testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Long, 27, who lives in Virginia, and John Andrew Ramsey, 23,  
who lives in Atlanta, are the children of John Ramsey and his first 
wife. JonBenet and her brother, Burke, are Ramsey's children with 
his second wife, Patsy. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said John and Patsy Ramsey are under suspicion in  
the girl's death. They have denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Long and John Andrew Ramsey were with their mother in  
Atlanta when JonBenet was found dead in the family's Boulder home 
the day after Christmas in 1996. They repeatedly have been 
questioned by police but have rarely talked about the case in 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Long did say in a British TV documentary that her father  
``has never, ever raised a hand to any of his children. He has 
never ever abused us in any way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury that has been investigating JonBenet's death met  
a week ago for the first time in four months. 
</P>
<P>
	By its Oct. 20 deadline, the jury must decide whether to indict  
one or more people, indicate they did not find enough evidence to 
hand down an indictment, issue a report or take no action. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Silverman, a former Denver prosecutor who has followed the  
Ramsey investigation, believes it is important for the grand jury 
to hear from the adult children. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is going to be a trial of John and Patsy Ramsey, it's  
reasonable to assume the children would be witnesses. It would be 
smart to hear what they have to say now rather than later,'' 
Silverman said.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Residents Survey Ruined Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Residents of this town founded by  
ex-slaves glumly surveyed their wrecked homes Thursday for the 
first time in the two weeks since Hurricane Floyd's floodwaters 
swallowed the town. Some found the damage too great to bear. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert and Callie Suggs said good-bye to the concrete,  
green-and-white home they built 34 years ago and where they raised 
their six children. An inch-wide crack girdled the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``All my life this was a gathering place for the family,'' Mrs.  
Suggs said. ``I would cook something every Sunday, and we would 
come here after church and pray together and eat together. I'm 
really going to miss that. I guess someday it'll be the same, but I 
don't know where.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After 8 inches of rain this week made the misery worse in  
flood-stunned eastern North Carolina, Thursday was dry and weather 
forecasters predicted more of the same for several days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Slowly but surely it's drying out,'' said National Guard  
Master Sgt. Larry Jones in Goldsboro, where this week's rain 
ruptured a dam and flooded the downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar and Neuse rivers remained well above flood stage and  
were due to crest over the next two days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still going to be a dangerous place out there for the  
next couple of weeks,'' warned Jonathan Blaes, a National Weather 
Service forecaster in Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, which brought 20 inches of rain to eastern North  
Carolina, is expected to surpass Hurricane Fran, which did $6 
billion in damage in 1996, as the state's costliest natural 
disaster. Blamed for at least 47 deaths, Floyd's floodwaters 
destroyed or heavily damaged at least 3,000 homes. About 1,500 
people remain in 18 American Red Cross shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Government relief funds began flowing toward North Carolina on  
Thursday. Vice President Al Gore announced $20.3 million in federal 
emergency funds would help families in low-income areas rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management  
Agency, and EPA administrator Carol M. Browner toured flooded 
Kinston and surveyed environmental damage near the Neuse River 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked to name the most important environmental lesson  
learned from Floyd, Browner said, ``Stay out of floodplains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials announced that starting Monday up to 3 million  
acres will be sprayed with mosquito-killing chemicals to curb a 
growing infestation blamed on the heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
	In Princeville, a community of 1,900, Mayor Delia Perkins has  
said it may be next year before residents can move back. 
</P>
<P>
	The town was engulfed by the Tar River on Sept. 17. At one  
point, brown, swirling water stood 20 feet deep near the town hall. 
The water destroyed homes and cars and wiped out the town water 
system and other infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, as bright sunshine filtered through the trees onto  
the damp streets and yards, residents for the first time saw what 
was left. 
</P>
<P>
	Maxie Harrison, 37, had to break a bathroom window to get into  
his home; floodwaters had pushed furniture and appliances up 
against the doors. White mold sprouted from door frames, a TV was 
upside down in a bedroom, and slippery, brown mud covered the 
floor. In the yard, two roosters lay dead in a cage. 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar, a green parrot that belonged to Harrison's 18-year-old  
son, Charlie, gave out a screech. Amazingly, he was still alive 
after two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, at least we got something,'' Maxie Harrison said. ``I  
got Oscar; he's one bad bird.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was at least some good news created by Floyd on Thursday --  
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge said the storm's heavy rain helped 
relieve yearlong drought conditions. Ridge lifted mandatory 
restrictions on water use in 54 of the 55 counties that had been 
under such an order since July. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland also have ended drought  
emergencies in recent weeks, thanks in part to Floyd.

<HEADLINE> Activists Mobilize for WTO Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Wash. (AP) -- Sweat streamed down longtime activist  
Jennifer Zurick's face as she climbed, foot by arduous foot, a 
nylon line hung from scaffolding four stories tall. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-dozen other veterans of teach-ins, sit-ins and street  
blockades were making similar efforts to reach the top of the metal 
structure, which rose from a grassy clearing among the evergreens 
at a farm. 
</P>
<P>
	The activists are getting ready for the ``Protest of the  
Century'' against global capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
	The showdown comes Nov. 30, when the 160 activist ``boot camp''  
graduates join tens of thousands of others from around the world in 
Seattle for the World Trade Organization's four-day Ministerial 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Protest plans include giant puppets in the streets, linking  
hands around the conference site and scaling or rappelling down 
skyscrapers to hang anti-WTO banners. 
</P>
<P>
	What are they upset about?  
</P>
<P>
	Complaints about the Geneva-based WTO include criticism of its  
sweeping powers to enforce international trade agreements. The 
organization is also under fire for overturning a U.S. ban on 
imports of shrimp caught with nets that also snare endangered sea 
turtles, and for opposing state bans on doing business with 
companies in countries with poor human-rights records. 
</P>
<P>
	``The WTO undermines environmental regulations throughout the  
world, as well as supporting regimes that jeopardize or abuse human 
rights,'' said Zurick, a member of the Monterey Action Resource 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 50,000 environmentalists, Japanese and Indian small  
farmers, union rank and file, ``fair trade'' activists and possibly 
even Zapatista guerrillas are expected to fill Seattle's streets. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference itself will draw as many as 3,000 delegates from  
the WTO's 134 member countries. It also will bring 2,000 sideline 
participants from WTO-accredited non-governmental organizations as 
well as up to 3,000 journalists, said Ray Waldmann, WTO Seattle 
Host Organization chairman and vice president of international 
relations for The Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Waldmann and other conference proponents defend the WTO, saying  
free trade improves lives. Peter Werner, a WTO spokesman in Geneva, 
dismissed activist claims his organization is anti-democratic. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO's member governments ``are represented by trade  
diplomats in WTO meetings,'' he said. ``The governments are, of 
course, elected by their citizens. Hence, anti-democratic criticism 
is a complete exaggeration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other groups preparing for the protest include the  
100,000-member Council of Canadians, which is holding a series of 
anti-WTO teach-ins and is expected to bring several hundred to the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee activists are putting together a bus convoy, a plane  
has been chartered by others in Minnesota and Wisconsin and groups 
from Malaysia to Brazil to England are sending members, according 
to the Seattle Host Committee of People for Fair Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO's actions have united many different groups, animal  
rights activist Ben White told a Seattle organizers meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter if you're for worker rights, human rights,  
children's rights,'' he said. ``It's one big package, and they have 
opened the door for us.''

<HEADLINE> Libel Judgment Against ABC Tossed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A federal court has thrown out a $10 million  
libel judgment against ABC, ruling the network's ``20/20'' news 
program didn't intentionally slant a story to make a bank executive 
look like a thief. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Alan Levan, chairman and chief executive of  
BankAtlantic, said he plans to appeal the ruling to the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm clearly disappointed, although the court has decided the  
issue on a very narrow ground that will be worthy of Supreme Court 
review,'' Alan Fein said after Wednesday's ruling from a 
three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Levan sued ABC over a 1991 broadcast that he said used false  
statements and misleading editing to attack his character. A jury 
ruled in his favor in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said ABC and producer William Willson had no  
reason to believe the overall crux of the story was false, which 
Levan's lawyers needed to prove to show the network acted with 
malice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're delighted with the court's ruling,'' said Eileen Murphy,  
spokeswoman for ABC News. She said the network would not comment 
further until executives had time to study the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The report focused on real estate partners who accused Levan of  
bilking them in deals known as ``roll-ups,'' in which real estate 
was swapped for BankAtlantic bonds at the height of the 
savings-and-loan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Fein contended the report accused Levan of knowingly misleading  
his partners into accepting a bad deal. The judges decided that, 
while the story implies Levan must have known the deal was unfair, 
``ABC does not expressly say so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides claimed high stakes in the case. Fein said the report  
caused BankAtlantic customers to close their accounts because they 
believed Levan was a crook. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC said the $10 million judgment threatened to make news  
organizations think twice before pursuing important, hard-hitting 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Levan's partners eventually won an $8 million settlement in  
class-action suits over the roll-ups, but congressional and 
regulatory investigations produced no charges.

	ABC ended up broadcasting a correction stating that the editing  
of the story may have misled some viewers about Levan's role in the 
real-estate deal. The report also said Levan refused to speak with 
ABC, whereas he declined to be interviewed on camera but had 
contacted the show several times.

<HEADLINE> Judge May Stop 'Eagles Court' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A judge says he may soon call off having an  
``Eagles Court'' in Veterans Stadium for unruly football fans 
because of fewer arrests this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The court allows unlawful fans to be arrested, tried and  
convicted in the stadium, and supporters say it has helped dampen 
rowdyism at games. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal Court Judge Seamus McCaffery says judges have been  
sitting idle this season because police are kicking fans out of the 
stadium instead of collaring them. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's nothing going on, there's no sense in having a  
court,'' McCaffery said. ``Why they are not making arrests, I don't 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffery says he is committed to having judges available for  
the historically rowdy Eagles-Dallas Cowboys matchup in two weeks. 
But he won't make any promises for future games. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner John Timoney said he would like to see the  
court continue because it helps deter serious offenses, such as 
carrying open containers and violence. But he said officers should 
not overreact and arrest fans just because they yell too loud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being an obnoxious jerk is not against the law,'' he said.  
``It's not healthy if a fan is yelling and ... a cop is locking him 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A meeting with top police commanders this week could decide how  
stadium arrests and the court will be run. Timoney would not 
comment on whether he believed officers were making enough arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffery says that when Eagles Court first began two years ago,  
police and security worked hand-in-hand. But at the first two home 
games this year, dozens of fans were ejected without facing 
penalties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	WIP sports radio talk-show host Glen Macnow said he expects fans  
to become more rowdy if they know there isn't a court waiting for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shame of it is that there are many people afraid to go to  
games, to bring their children to games, their wives to games,'' he 
said. ``If they stop the court, it's as if they are giving in to 
rowdyism.''

<HEADLINE> Racer Craven Signs Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, N.C. (AP) -- Ricky Craven has signed a one-year  
contract extension with the MidWest Transit team that will carry 
through the 2000 NASCAR Winston Cup season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see Ricky as a smart, talented driver who represents  
MidWest Transit with class, both on and off the track,'' Hal Hicks, 
president of the company, said Thursday. ``We believe the talent 
and marketability he possesses will only enhance our ability to 
sign a primary sponsor in the very near future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Craven, 33, was the Winston Cup series rookie of the year in  
1995, and finished third in the 1997 Daytona 500 after moving to 
the third car fielded by Hendrick Motorsports. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed two races due to injuries in 1997, and early in the  
1998 season took himself out of the car after experiencing problems 
later diagnosed as post-concussion syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to racing after missing three months, but was later  
let go by Hendrick Motorsports. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, he signed with MidWest Transit. In seven races with  
the team, his best finish has been 13th but has more often 
struggled near the back of the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Craven and the MidWest Transit team plan to run a full schedule  
of Winston Cup races next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've fully enjoyed the races we've run and I'm excited about  
our future together,'' Craven said.

<HEADLINE> Met Performs Original 'Lucia' Opera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                     *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' in its original version  
simply isn't as exciting as the production modern audiences are 
used to. 
</P>
<P>
	The Metropolitan Opera, with Charles Mackerras conducting,  
performed ``Lucia'' in the original version for the first time on 
Wednesday. As far as Mackerras knows, it's a first for New York. 
This version lacked most of the ringing, aria-ending high notes, 
including the high E flat that ends Lucia's famous mad scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Rost sang the title role in a pure, clear voice that was  
reminiscent of recordings by Lily Pons, whose 1931 Met debut was as 
Lucia. Rost still has plenty of coloratura singing to do and she 
sang with skill and grace. But the famous part of the mad scene in 
which soprano voice alternates with flute was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	An even more important problem with the mad scene is the  
staging. When this Nicolas Joel production was new last year, Lucia 
was outdoors and alone for her mad scene. This year, guests from 
her wedding stand on the sides of the stage. But the drama is 
greater in a traditional staging when, splattered with her 
bridegroom's blood, Lucia descends a staircase from an upstairs 
bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Frontali sang Enrico, Lucia's brother. He has a light,  
flexible baritone. Tenor Frank Lopardo sang Edgardo. He sang loud, 
sounding like he was forcing volume, through Act 1. Later, using 
more variety, he was more effective. 
</P>
<P>
	The Act 1 love duet between Edgardo and Lucia was not a high  
point on this occasion. Paul Plishka, who made his Met debut in 
1967, wasn't at his best as Lucia's tutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Singers caused original high keys of ``Lucia'' to be transposed  
down, so their high notes would be more sparkling in contrast. On 
Wednesday, the mad scene was sung in its original key of F and a 
glass harmonica, representing mental instability, was played. 
</P>
<P>
	Five more performances of the 1835 ``Lucia'' will be sung in  
October. In December, Ruth Ann Swenson will sing four performances 
of the traditional version, conducted by Edoardo Muller.

<HEADLINE> Mazda To Pay $5 Million Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mazda will pay $5.25 million to settle charges  
it violated government agreements requiring that the automaker 
clearly disclose important car leasing terms in its advertising, 
federal regulators said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil penalties include a $4.05 million fine, the largest  
obtained by the Federal Trade Commission's bureau of consumer 
protection, for what the FTC said was a failure to abide by a 
February 1997 agency order about Mazda's advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda also agreed to pay a total of $1.2 million in fines and  
costs to 24 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint and consent decree were filed Thursday in U.S.  
District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda, based in Irvine, Calif., said it has sought to comply  
with lease disclosure requirements and has put into practice new 
procedures to ensure full compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The earlier FTC order prohibited Mazda's television ads from  
misrepresenting the total due at lease inception and from 
highlighting only the most attractive terms of the lease -- such as 
low monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement also required Mazda to make a number of  
disclosures before it could state the amount of any payment. They 
included a clear and conspicuous disclosure that the transaction 
advertised is a lease, the total amount due at lease inception and 
whether a security deposit is required. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said Mazda continued to run ads in violation of the  
order until early 1998. For example, the disclosures were in small 
and unreadable print, offset by distracting images or sounds, or 
appeared on the screen for too short a time, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This substantial penalty should not only deter future  
violations of the commission's order by Mazda, but send a strong 
signal to everyone in the automobile industry -- manufacturers, 
dealers and advertising agencies -- that important leasing 
information cannot be buried in fine print,'' said Jodie Bernstein, 
director of the bureau of consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda said in a statement that consumers who leased cars between  
February 1997 and early 1998 were informed of the complete terms 
and conditions before signing any deal. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlement, the Mazda will distribute a consumer  
education brochure on vehicle leasing through its 750 U.S. dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda Motor of America Inc., doing business as Mazda North  
American Operations, is a subsidiary of Mazda Motor Corp. of 
Hiroshima, Japan.

<HEADLINE>  MLS' Revolution Fires Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Coach Walter Zenga was fired Thursday by  
the New England Revolution with two games left in the regular 
season. He was replaced by Steve Nicol, who coached the Boston 
Bulldogs of the A League in Framingham. 
</P>
<P>
	Zenga, who took over as player-coach with six games left last  
season, led the Revolution to a 10-20-4 record this year. With two 
games left, New England trails Miami by one point for the last 
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Zenga has a 5-13 record as 
a goalkeeper and will not continue as a player with the Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Brian O'Donovan said Zenga didn't want to wait  
until the end of the season to discuss a contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``He also indicated to us that he had other options in Italy and  
needed to explore them immediately,'' O'Donovan said in a team 
statement. ``We received (Wednesday) a written ultimatum insisting 
that the team reach a decision. We would have preferred to evaluate 
fully the situation during the offseason and make our decision 
then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zenga, 39, named the world's best goalkeeper after the 1990  
World Cup, played that position for the Revolution in 1997. He then 
retired from the team and returned to Italy.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Banks Agree To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia's central bank said  
Thursday that all the country's domestic financial institutions 
have signed agreements to merge into six big banking groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The 58 banks and finance companies signed memorandums of  
understanding as of Wednesday for the restructuring, according to a 
statement from Bank Negara, the central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank surprised bankers in July by announcing a  
drastic reorganization of the battered financial industry. It said 
it would force the merger of all the country's banks -- 21 
commercial banks, 25 finance companies and 12 merchant banks -- into 
six groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The authorities say the mergers were necessary to make the  
industry strong enough to compete with big foreign banks. The 
mergers are to be completed by next April. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysia's biggest bank employees union has warned that the bank  
mergers could leave some 15,000 workers jobless. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry has often been criticized for Malaysia's  
economic fragility. Many banks during the boom years issued loans 
on insufficient collateral, leaving them saddled with bad debts 
when the economy sank in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts say many of the banks were strong-armed into  
accepting the mergers. They say that the restructuring is driven by 
politics, with the government attempting to weaken bankers who are 
allies of Anwar Ibrahim, the ousted deputy prime minister and 
former finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar is serving a six-year prison sentence for his conviction  
in April of corruption charges. He also faces sodomy charges, but 
denies any wrongdoing, saying they were crafted to end his 
challenge to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.

<P>
	-- Gretchen Buchenholz of New York City, who helps young families  
with education, housing and employment programs through her 
Association to Benefit Children. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Terri and Bruce Lippert of Council Bluffs, Iowa, who have  
acted as foster parents to about 120 children over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rachel and Rick Sparkowich of Portsmouth, N.H., who have given  
about $7 million in clothing, furniture and food to the poor over 
the past two decades through their ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cordelia Taylor of Milwaukee, who founded and runs the Family  
House, which houses and cares for frail seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Lyndale and Ellyn Morrow-Yazel of Colorado Springs, Colo.  
Lyndale created an education program for her daughter Ellyn, who 
was born with Down's Syndrome, that was copied by California state 
officials. Ellyn later nursed her mother back to health after 
spinal cord injury.

	AP Investigation Uncovers Korean War Civilian Killings  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- South Korean civilian refugees were killed by  
the U.S. military in an unwritten chapter of the Korean War, 
according to an Associated Press investigation that cites villagers 
and veterans who witnessed or participated in the incident in the 
early days of the war. Many women and children were among the 
hundreds who died underneath a bridge at No Gun Ri, a hamlet about 
100 miles southeast of the South Korean capital of Seoul. American 
soldiers, in their third day at the warfront, believed that North 
Korean infiltrators were among the refugees. Once-classified 
documents show U.S. commanders issued orders to treat civilians as 
``enemy.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Indonesia Accused of Collusion  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen today  
accused the Indonesian military of ``aiding and abetting'' militia 
violence against civilians in East Timor. After meetings with 
Indonesia's top leaders he said he was encouraged that they 
understand the consequences of failing to cooperate with 
international peacekeepers. ``They are committed to seeing the 
success of the peacekeeping mission,'' Cohen told reporters after 
talks with Gen. Wiranto, the chief of the Indonesian military, and 
President B.J. Habibie. On a cautionary note, however, Cohen said 
Washington will watch to see if the Indonesians carry through on 
their expressions of good will by disarming the militias in West 
Timor who ravaged East Timor after an Aug. 30 vote for independence 
from Indonesia. 

</P>

	India Faulted for Christian Attacks  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Indian government has been unable to stop  
growing violence against Christians and has close ties to Hindu 
groups responsible for the attacks, a human rights group said in a 
report released today. Human Rights Watch said in its report that 
priests have been killed, nuns have been raped and Christian 
churches, schools and cemeteries have been destroyed. ``Despite the 
existence of comprehensive legislation to address the problem of 
religious intolerance and communal violence, the government has 
failed to prosecute offending individuals and organizations; 
instead, it has in many cases offered tacit support and indirect 
justification for the attacks,'' the report said. Human Rights 
Watch said the scale of attacks remains ``relatively small'' but 
that incidents have increased in the run-up to India's 
parliamentary elections this month.

	Yugoslav Opposition Banding Together  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A day after baton-wielding police  
battered protesters trying to march on the Yugoslav president's 
residence, opposition leaders say they are ready to band together 
to end the rule of Slobodan Milosevic. The Alliance For Change and 
the Serbian Renewal Movement expressed optimism that a meeting 
today will help bridge differences among Yugoslavia's opposition 
parties. Bickering among opposition leaders has undermined efforts 
to unseat Milosevic. More than 60 people were injured, four 
seriously, in yesterday's protests, according to opposition parties 
who organized the rallies. Police sources said three officers were 
also injured in clashes with demonstrators.

	Death Sentence for Ex-Cult Leader  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A former doomsday cult leader who spread lethal  
nerve gas in one of Tokyo's busiest subway stations in 1995 was 
sentenced to hang today for his role in the attack, which killed 12 
people. It was the first death sentence meted out in the subway 
gassing case, blamed on the Aum Shinri Kyo cult. Former cult guru 
Shoko Asahara is on trial for masterminding the assault. The Tokyo 
District Court handed down the verdict on Masato Yokoyama, 35, 
early today, said a court official, who spoke on customary 
condition of anonymity. Yokoyama was one of a squad of five Aum 
agents who released the nerve gas sarin in subway trains as they 
converged on Tokyo's central government district during morning 
rush hour. Thousands were sickened.

and Charles Barkley has escalated. Pippen unleashed a torrent of 
criticism at his teammate yesterday, calling Barkley ``selfish'' 
and ``fat' and saying he doesn't have the desire to win an NBA 
championship. Pippen was responding to criticism initiated by 
Barkley, who was angered that Pippen said he'd welcome a trade to 
the Los Angeles Lakers. ``I probably should've listened to Michael 
(Jordan) a year ago when he said that Charles will never win a 
championship because he doesn't show any dedication,'' Pippen told 
ESPN.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Opens Education Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALISADES, N.Y. (AP) -- Saying that Americans are ``hot to do the  
right thing to improve education,'' President Clinton urged the 
Republican-led Congress Thursday to approve his budget to hire new 
teachers, modernize schools and set standards in failing 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to give the schools the tools they need to do the  
job,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke before governors and business executives gathered  
for the National Education Summit, the third in a series of 
high-level meetings going back to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress struggles to enact spending bills, education remains  
a divisive issue between Republicans and Democrats. ``We're having 
a big argument in Washington on the budget,'' Clinton said, adding, 
``I don't want to get into a partisan rerun of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations Committee and the Senate moved toward  
approving similar $320 billion packages financing labor, health and 
education programs. But both faced veto threats because of cuts in 
Clinton's proposal to hire 100,000 new teachers and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Americans still retain ``a passionate sense of  
national urgency about school reform'' 16 years after a landmark 
report called ``A Nation at Risk'' deplored the ``mediocre 
educational performance'' of the nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``The country is as hot to do the right thing to improve the  
education of our children today as it was the day after the 'Nation 
at Risk' report was issued,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton spoke to the same gathering three years ago, 14  
states had standards defining what students should know at various 
grade levels. By the close of this school year, 49 states will have 
such standards in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The president urged governors to accelerate the pace of fixing  
low-performing schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The education summit is a continuation of an idea inaugurated by  
then-President Bush in 1989, when he gathered educators, governors 
and business leaders in Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	An ambitious education plan set at that gathering has fallen far  
short of its goal to make American schoolchildren first in the 
world in math and science. 
</P>
<P>
	Only in fourth-grade science did the United States lead the  
world, according to the Third International Mathematics and Science 
Study. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1989 gathering also set other broad education goals for 2000  
-- from ensuring children are properly immunized and eating the 
right foods so they are ready to learn, to raising the high school 
graduation rate to at least 90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the goals were vague. Governors thought otherwise  
and adopted them. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush launched the education reform package, Clinton, who  
headed the governor's association at the time, has popularized the 
goals with more than $1.7 billion in grants to help states set 
standards and find ways to chart progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton signed the Goals 2000: Educate America Act in 1994,  
writing the original education goals into law and adding new ones 
on teacher quality and parent involvement.

<HEADLINE> McNown Pleads No Contest to Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Chicago Bears quarterback Cade McNown,  
admitting he made a mistake nearly three years ago, pleaded no 
contest Thursday to a misdemeanor charge of illegally possessing a 
handicapped parking placard. 
</P>
<P>
	Current UCLA safety Eric Whitfield and former Bruins fullback  
Craig Walendy entered the same pleas before Municipal Judge Sam 
Ohta, joining 13 other current and former UCLA football players who 
previously agreed to a plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	All 16 have been ordered to pay $1,485 in fines and perform 200  
hours of community service, and also must spend a day meeting with 
the disabled and their advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	The final three charged in the matter were scheduled for  
arraignment Thursday in Los Angeles Municipal Court, but were 
granted continuances until Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown's lawyers, Ronald Safer and Stanley Greenberg, entered  
the no contest plea. McNown issued a statement nearly three hours 
later from the Bears' practice site in Lake Forest, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	It read: ``During offseason workouts at UCLA, I applied for a  
handicapped parking sticker. Although I was injured, the process by 
which I acquired the permit was wrong, and for that I am sorry. I 
had trouble getting around, but applying for the sticker minimized 
the needs of permanently disabled persons. I deeply regret the 
incident occurred, and hope people don't judge me on this 
particular mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown refused to comment further, citing the advice of his  
lawyers. He could not be found earlier when the Bears' locker room 
was open following practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Safer emphasized outside court that McNown never used a  
handicapped parking space, and said the state had no such evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crime is obtaining and possessing this handicap sticker,''  
Safer said. ``He did not obtain the placard through correct 
channels, and he acknowledges that. He should have followed 
procedures and seen a doctor himself instead of somebody else 
obtaining a doctor's signature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Safer said the All-American quarterback, who led the Bruins to  
the Pac-10 championship last season, believed at the time that the 
doctor's signature was valid. The lawyer wouldn't elaborate 
further. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown was a first-round draft choice of the Bears last April.  
</P>
<P>
	Deputy city attorney Brian Williams said he expected the three  
remaining men charged -- Washington Redskins running back Skip 
Hicks, Kansas City Chiefs safety Larry Atkins, and former UCLA 
linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo -- to enter no-contest pleas Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Demoff, Atkins' lawyer, said it was ``highly likely'' his  
client would do just that. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an unfortunate situation and one that is best  
resolved,'' Demoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Silber, who represents Hicks and Ayanbadejo, said his  
clients ``just aren't ready to accept what the other defendants 
have pled to already, although I'm not saying we won't. We'd like 
to get this thing resolved sooner than later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city attorney's office brought charges July 8 against 14  
current or former players alleged to be part of the disabled 
parking scam, and five more were charged Sept. 13. Nine entered 
pleas on July 28, four more on Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten, including Whitfield, are members of the current team and  
were suspended for the season's first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	California law allows people with temporary or permanent  
disabilities to obtain permits to park in special handicap spaces, 
to use metered spaces for free and to park in limited-time zones 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	The football players allegedly used the placards to avoid the  
$132-per-semester fee for parking on campus and to park in the area 
around UCLA where parking problems are chronic.

<HEADLINE>  IMF Head Warns Against Complacency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Governments should not be lulled into  
complacency by the calm prevailing in world markets and the 
improved economic growth after last year's global financial crises, 
the head of the International Monetary Fund said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michel Camdessus told finance ministers and central bank  
governors from 182 countries they must to fight complacency if they 
want to avert future crises and press on with reforming 
international financial systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be making a grave error if we let the return of  
relative calm in financial markets and the improvement in world 
growth prospects lead us to believe that further reforms are not 
necessary,'' Camdessus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus spoke at the end of the annual meetings of the World  
Bank and the IMF. The organizations earlier approved a new $27 
billion debt relief initiative intended to let 36 of the world's 
poorest countries spend money on education and health projects 
rather than on loan interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said governments now are ``obliged to deliver on what  
has been promised ... these steps have created a strong new impetus 
to the war on poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate announcement, the IMF said its board has approved  
a plan for a one-time off-market sale of up to 14 million ounces of 
gold to finance the debt relief initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other issues discussed during the nine-day sessions  
were the appreciation of the Japanese yen against the dollar, 
Ecuador's decision to default on $98 billion in bond payments, 
alleged money laundering by Russia and enlisting the private sector 
in preventing and resolving financial crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Camdessus discounted speculation he may consider  
resigning before the end of his third five-year term in 2002. World 
Bank President James Wolfensohn was reappointed to a second 
five-year term during the meetings.

<HEADLINE> Gore, With Cuomo, Stumps in NY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, N.Y. (AP) -- A day after vowing to take his campaign  
directly to the people, Vice President Al Gore hits the streets of 
this once thriving factory town Thursday with the son of a famous 
New York Democrat as his escort. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, son of former New York  
Gov. Mario Cuomo, accompanied Gore down a residential street toward 
a closed toy factory. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore chatted with bystanders and bounded up porch steps to shake  
the hands of potential voters and admire their babies. Homemade 
banners outside a nearby apartment building proclaimed ``Gore Pres. 
2000'' and ``Cuomo Gov. 2002.'' The younger Cuomo is considered a 
candidate for governor in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you see Secretary Cuomo's advance work here?,'' Gore  
called to reporters, pointing to the banners. A sparse crowd of 
about 100 greeted the pair. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's visit to this area west of Albany came one day after the  
vice president, feeling a surge from rival Bill Bradley, announced 
he was moving his campaign headquarters from Washington to 
Tennessee and challenged Bradley to a series of debates. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh evidence of Bradley's strength also was evident Thursday  
as campaign reports showed he was nearly even with Gore in fund 
raising between July and September. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, with its March 7 primary, is considered a crucial  
state for Gore. Recent polls have shown that his once hefty lead in 
the state over Bradley, a former New York Knicks star, has 
evaporated with the two now in a dead heat among Democratic voters. 
Those same polls also show Bradley, a former U.S. senator from New 
Jersey, running better than Gore against the Republican 
front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	A larger crowd of about 450 people later greeted Gore and Cuomo  
at a forum on ``Tapping America's Potential.'' Democratic mayors, 
business executives, workers and public officials joined Gore in a 
discussion of how to survive tough economic times. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also staged a fund-raising reception at a Manhattan hotel  
that aides said was expected to raise about $500,000. While some of 
Gore's own supporters have grumbled about the state of his 
campaign, he drew cheers by saying, ``The Republicans are in 
disarray. The far-right hand doesn't know what the right hand is 
doing.''

<HEADLINE>  China Celebrates 50th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- With huge lantern balloons swaying overhead,  
children in red, blue and green jackets turned vast Tiananmen 
Square into a sea of color Friday as China began celebrations 
feting 50 years of communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Imposing columns of tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks  
bearing surface-to-air missiles moved through Beijing before dawn, 
followed in the day's first light by garish floats for each of 
China's provinces -- white plastic horses for Inner Mongolia and a 
replica of Hong Kong's skyscraping skyline for China's newest 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Army veterans bedecked with medals from their service in the  
communist revolution sat in red felt-covered viewing stands as 
patriotic marches resonated through the square's loudspeakers. 
Ordinary citizens were kept away by a martial-law style security 
cordon that left Beijing's streets eerily empty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Communist Party's celebration Friday, costing the equivalent  
of $36 million, will showcase the nation's growing military might 
and its rapid economic progress since Mao Tse-tung stood atop the 
Gate of Heavenly Peace on Oct. 1, 1949, and declared the founding 
of the People's Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``These achievements should be attributed to the great, glorious  
and correct Communist Party of China, to the hardworking, brave and 
talented people of China and to the superior socialist system,'' 
Premier Zhu Rongji said in a speech at a gala reception of 5,000 
dignitaries on the anniversary's eve. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's festivities were to include a 2-mile long military  
parade with more than 10,000 soldiers in brand-new uniforms showing 
off the best of China's growing arsenal, mass performances and 
evening fireworks displays. The events involve more than a 
half-million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin and other senior  
leaders will stand atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace as tanks and 
trucks bearing the new Dongfeng 31 long-range missile thunder by, 
while homemade fighter jets roar overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders hope the national pride generated for the  
anniversary will redound to the Communist Party, whose public image 
has been tarnished by pervasive official corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese people have never held their heads so high and  
drawn so much attention from all over the world as they do today,'' 
the party's flagship newspaper, People's Daily, said in an 
editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	Tycoons and movie stars like action hero Jackie Chan were  
invited to attend, but pro-democracy legislators from Hong Kong, 
many of whom are routinely denied entry into China, were glaringly 
absent from the list. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge red lanterns and banners proclaiming ``Long Live the  
Great People's Republic of China'' -- scarlet symbols of happiness -- 
contrasted sharply with the grim controls imposed to ensure that 
the most patriotic event in a half-century is not disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has raised benefits for the growing legions of  
unemployed, but it also cracked down on political dissidents and 
drove out migrants and beggars. In thorough security sweeps along 
the parade route, police inspected for bombs, padlocked manholes 
and sealed mailboxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Skies cleared early Friday after heavy rains overnight  
threatened to spoil the celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Barred from the parade route, most Beijing residents will view  
the events on television and enjoyed a weeklong holiday that will 
give them a chance, once traffic restrictions are lifted Saturday, 
to enjoy improvements to their usually drab, dusty city. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebrations highlight progress made in five decades under  
communism -- the first three scarred by political turmoil, the last 
two devoted to whirlwind economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back then, conditions weren't so good,'' said 70-year-old Liu  
Baoqin, who as a young soldier stood guard during the inaugural 
National Day celebration in 1949. ``There's no comparison. It's 
like heaven and earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1949, the average Chinese life expectancy was 35 years.  
Today, it's 71. Then, two-thirds of all Chinese were illiterate; 
now, 12 percent cannot read. Then, many Chinese starved. Today, for 
most there is plenty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, we can buy anything we need or want. Look at the  
clothes we are wearing -- They're pretty good and they're not even 
our best,'' said Peng Junzhou, a retired doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	The authorities took no chances in ensuring that patriotism  
ruled the day. Households were ordered to display the red and gold 
national flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from Beijing, in Lhasa, capital of Chinese-ruled Tibet,  
ethnic Tibetans were ordered to take part in the National Day 
festivities or face possible cuts in their pay or pensions, the 
London-based monitoring group Tibet Information Network reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas human rights lobbyists urged Chinese leaders to mark  
the anniversary by releasing all political prisoners and improving 
legal protections of civil liberties. 
</P>
<P>
	``This anniversary should be an occasion to declare a general  
amnesty for all and to start the next half-century and the next 
millennium on a sound human rights footing,'' Sidney Jones of New 
York-based Human Rights Watch said in a statement.

and its rapid economic progress since Mao Tse-tung stood atop the 
Gate of Heavenly Peace on Oct. 1, 1949, and declared the founding 
of the People's Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``These achievements should be attributed to the great, glorious  
and correct Communist Party of China, to the hardworking, brave and 
talented people of China and to the superior socialist system,'' 
Premier Zhu Rongji said in a speech at a gala reception of 5,000 
dignitaries on the anniversary's eve. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's festivities were to include a 2-mile long military  
parade with more than 10,000 soldiers in brand-new uniforms showing 
off the best of China's growing arsenal, mass performances and 
evening fireworks displays. The events involve more than a 
half-million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin and other senior  
leaders will stand atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace as tanks and 
trucks bearing the new Dongfeng 31 long-range missile thunder by, 
while homemade fighter jets roar overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders hope the national pride generated for the  
anniversary will redound to the Communist Party, whose public image 
has been tarnished by pervasive official corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese people have never held their heads so high and  
drawn so much attention from all over the world as they do today,'' 
the party's flagship newspaper, People's Daily, said in an 
editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	Tycoons and movie stars like action hero Jackie Chan were  
invited to attend, but pro-democracy legislators from Hong Kong, 
many of whom are routinely denied entry into China, were glaringly 
absent from the list. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge red lanterns and banners proclaiming ``Long Live the  
Great People's Republic of China'' -- scarlet symbols of happiness -- 
contrasted sharply with the grim controls imposed to ensure that 
the most patriotic event in a half-century is not disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has raised benefits for the growing legions of  
unemployed, but it also cracked down on political dissidents and 
drove out migrants and beggars. In thorough security sweeps along 
the parade route, police inspected for bombs, padlocked manholes 
and sealed mailboxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Skies cleared early Friday after heavy rains overnight  
threatened to spoil the celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Barred from the parade route, most Beijing residents will view  
the events on television and enjoyed a weeklong holiday that will 
give them a chance, once traffic restrictions are lifted Saturday, 
to enjoy improvements to their usually drab, dusty city. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebrations highlight progress made in five decades under  
communism -- the first three scarred by political turmoil, the last 
two devoted to whirlwind economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back then, conditions weren't so good,'' said 70-year-old Liu  
Baoqin, who as a young soldier stood guard during the inaugural 
National Day celebration in 1949. ``There's no comparison. It's 
like heaven and earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1949, the average Chinese life expectancy was 35 years.  
Today, it's 71. Then, two-thirds of all Chinese were illiterate; 
now, 12 percent cannot read. Then, many Chinese starved. Today, for 
most there is plenty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, we can buy anything we need or want. Look at the  
clothes we are wearing -- They're pretty good and they're not even 
our best,'' said Peng Junzhou, a retired doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	The authorities took no chances in ensuring that patriotism  
ruled the day. Households were ordered to display the red and gold 
national flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from Beijing, in Lhasa, capital of Chinese-ruled Tibet,  
ethnic Tibetans were ordered to take part in the National Day 
festivities or face possible cuts in their pay or pensions, the 
London-based monitoring group Tibet Information Network reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas human rights lobbyists urged Chinese leaders to mark  
the anniversary by releasing all political prisoners and improving 
legal protections of civil liberties. 
</P>
<P>
	``This anniversary should be an occasion to declare a general  
amnesty for all and to start the next half-century and the next 
millennium on a sound human rights footing,'' Sidney Jones of New 
York-based Human Rights Watch said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Daly Feels Good On, Off Course  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. (AP) -- John Daly doesn't want anyone to get  
the wrong idea. He is drinking again, but this isn't the kind of 
drinking that led to a smashed-up hotel room in Florida two years 
ago or led to outrageous behavior on the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	Not yet, anyway.  
</P>
<P>
	While Daly says he believes he can handle drinking this time  
around, he conceded Thursday that his life, much like his golf 
game, holds no guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know what's going to happen with me,'' Daly said  
after an even-par 72 in the Buick Challenge, his first tournament 
back since admitting he has resumed drinking, which cost him a 
lucrative contract with Callaway Golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody goes through ups and downs, and I don't want anybody  
bailing me out any more,'' Daly said. ``It's not like I'm going to 
get drunk every day or every night. That's not what I want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Take Wednesday night, for example.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had four Miller Lites and a big chimichanga,'' Daly said.  
Then he and his fiancee called it a night. In his lifelong battle 
against alcoholism, this night was a draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to quit drinking,'' he said. ``I just don't want  
to get drunk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly was all smiles Thursday in the first round of the Buick  
Challenge. Grossly overweight in olive-colored pants that bagged 
around his ankles he went through at least one cigarette per hole, 
signed autographs during his round and then headed out to the 
driving range. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he is free again, no longer bound by his contract with  
Callaway Golf that required him to stay off the bottle and out of 
casinos. He says he wants to play like the slugger who won the PGA 
Championship and British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	What Daly cannot say is whether another night awaits like the  
one in Jacksonville Beach, Fla., two years ago, when he poured down 
shots and ripped up his hotel room in a drunken rage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what to think,'' said Jay Haas, one of several  
PGA Tour peers confused by Daly's return to drinking. ``I suppose 
past history shows he shouldn't be doing what he's doing. Whether 
he can handle it this time remains to be seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly's latest attempt to stay sober ended after a 26-month run  
that cost him his Callaway contract when he refused to go back to a 
rehab center for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
	From a business standpoint, Daly said he regrets parting ways  
with 80-year-old founder Ely Callaway, who is a distant relative to 
the Callaway clan that developed the plush resort where the Buick 
Challenge is being played this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly turned his back on about $3 million, but he said maybe  
that's for the best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Mr. C. made it too easy for me,'' he said. ``The money  
was too good and I didn't practice hard enough. It's going to make 
me hungry, that money not coming in like it was. We've got great 
purses. There's a ton of money out there, and it's time for me to 
earn my money again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Daly said he finally reached the conclusion that  
drinking is part of his life. ``It's in my blood,'' is the chilling 
phrase he told Golf World magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said he came to a crossroads and took a long, hard look in  
both directions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was either golf and drinking, or no golf and no drinking,''  
he said. ``I made a decision to keep playing golf. This is what I 
do. This is my talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the drinking, Daly told himself, is part of the package.  
</P>
<P>
	``I could give up the game and probably stay sober and do  
speeches and stuff,'' he said. ``It would be a hell of a lot easier 
because I'd be out of the spotlight and out of the game. But I 
can't do both. There ain't no way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly admits that pressure to stay sober helped drive him to  
drink again. He said he was trying to live up to everyone else's 
expectations, and ``you can't make somebody do something they don't 
want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 33 years old,'' he said. ``It's a decision I have to  
make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he envisions the day when he no longer has a craving for  
a drink. A statement two weeks ago on his Web site -- 
gripitandripit.com -- said his commitment to live a sober life 
remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
	When will that day come? Daly could only shrug.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's still one day at a time,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Senate GOP To Vote on Test Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After months of delay, Senate Republican  
leaders today did a turnabout and agreed to vote next week on a 
treaty to ban all nuclear testing worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senate's Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota,  
called the gesture hollow because it allowed only a single day's 
debate, and rejected the overture. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity,  
said an informal Democratic count showed they were at least 15 
votes short of the 67 needed to pass the treaty. The tally 
suggested all 45 Democrats and seven Republicans would vote for the 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack of support for the pact clearly figured into the GOP change  
of strategy, said a senior Republican official, who also spoke on 
the condition of anonymity. Both sides have vote counts showing the 
treaty would be easily defeated, the GOP official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he would  
schedule 10 hours of debate on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, 
which has been signed by 152 nations, for Oct 6. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Lott called the treaty ``bad for the country  
and dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration and congressional Democrats have been  
leaning on the GOP leadership to bring up the measure, increasing 
the pressure in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact has been bottled up in the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee by chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's offer would have required the unanimous consent of the  
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle immediately objected, saying, ``Ten hours of debate is  
totally insufficient amount of time for a treaty as important as 
this is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called for hearings by the committee.  
</P>
<P>
	But Helms stood to assert that his panel had held at least nine  
hearings touching on the subject. He likened Democrats turning 
their back on a vote after pressing for it so long as ``rodents 
running to the hills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it were not so pitiful, this behavior would have been  
amusing,'' Helms said as the Senate erupted in a heated, 
unscheduled, debate on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	The switch in strategy by the Republican leadership appeared to  
catch Democrats off guard. Those on both sides of the issue 
suggested that if a vote were held now, it was unlikely that 
supporters could muster the 67 votes -- or two thirds of the Senate 
-- needed to ratify the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	However, not all Democrats agreed with Daschle.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., a leading Senate sponsor of the pact,  
said the approach outlined by Lott and Helms was ``all right with 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Bring it up next week,'' and let the votes fall where they  
may, asserted Dorgan. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, Helms had refused to bring the treaty to a vote in  
his panel in a separate dispute with the administration on other 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 pact includes a pledge against all testing of nuclear  
devices and sets up a global system of sensors to monitor 
compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	It was signed by 152 nations, but ratification is moving slowly.  
So far, only 18 of the 44 nations with nuclear capabilities that 
must ratify the wide-ranging treaty have taken action. 
</P>
<P>
	The third anniversary of the treaty's opening for signature was  
Sept. 23. A conference will be held Oct. 6-8 in Vienna on the panel 
to consider what measures might be taken to get non-ratifying 
members to join. 
</P>
<P>
	Only nations that ratified the treaty could participate in the  
conference -- leaving the United States without direct influence. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the treaty, all 44 states with some nuclear capacity must  
sign for it to take effect. Even one holdout -- by, say, North Korea 
-- could keep the treaty from taking effect.

<HEADLINE> Death Sentence in Rape, Murder Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A man who raped and killed a church volunteer  
after she brought a box of free food to his family was sentenced to 
death Thursday by a judge who called the crime ``shockingly evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Sansing, 31, had pleaded guilty to murder to ensure that  
his wife, Kara, 29, would not also face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Sansing, a former warehouse stocker with a long criminal  
history, admitted murdering the volunteer, Trudy Calabrese, in 
February 1998. Mrs. Sansing, who admitted helping her husband in 
the attack, was sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Calabrese, 41, had come to the Sansings' home after the  
Living Springs Assembly of God in Glendale got a call for emergency 
food from a man who identified himself as John Sansing. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Sansing struck her from behind repeatedly with  
a stick and both Sansings -- who have four children -- tied her with 
electrical cords and gagged her with a sock. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Ms. Calabrese was blindfolded, her head was covered  
with a plastic bag and she was beaten, raped and stabbed. Her body 
then was dragged into the back yard and partially covered with 
cardboard boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple also stole about $1 from her.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Cook Suspended for One Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Mets reliever Dennis Cook was suspended  
for one game and fined $2,000 Thursday by the National League for 
bumping the cap of an umpire this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension, given for ``overly aggressive behavior and  
making contact with an umpire,'' will not take effect until after 
NL president Len Coleman hears an appeal from the players' 
association on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no comment until I talk to Mr. Coleman,'' said Cook,  
who admitted he was ``a little bit surprised'' by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook was removed from the Mets' 9-3 loss to Atlanta Tuesday  
night after walking Gerald Williams in the eighth inning and got 
into an animated argument with plate umpire Alfonzo Marquez. 
</P>
<P>
	During the argument, Cook's cap bumped the cap of Marquez, one  
of the 25 new umpires hired this month. Cook also drew a line with 
dirt over the plate to point out where he thought his pitches went. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a difference of opinion,'' Cook said Tuesday about the  
ball-strike calls. ``I expressed mine. He expressed his. I'm 
frustrated. I thought some of the pitches were good pitches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cook still maintains he made no contact with Marquez.  
</P>
<P>
	The punishment to a key member of the Mets bullpen comes with  
the team in the middle of a tight race for the NL wild card. If 
Cook is to miss a game, Friday might be the least costly because 
the Mets will start another left-hander, Kenny Rogers, against 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Kenny pitching, the need for a left-handed reliever is  
not as great tomorrow,'' manager Bobby Valentine said.

<HEADLINE> Suit Over Girl's Death Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A woman whose daughter was illegally adopted by  
Joel Steinberg and later beaten to death by him accepted $985,000 
Thursday to settle a wrongful-death lawsuit she filed against 
several city agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, Michele Launders, refused to comment on the  
settlement. But her lawyer, Joseph Famighetti, said: ``It gives her 
closure and allows her to get on with her life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Launders, who was unwed when her daughter was born in 1981,  
charged that Steinberg, a lawyer, defrauded her when he accepted 
$500 to place the infant with an adoptive family. Instead of 
putting the baby up for adoption, Steinberg took her home to his 
companion, Hedda Nussbaum, named the child Lisa, and killed her six 
years later by hitting her on the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Nussbaum testified that they used cocaine while the girl lay  
dying on the bathroom floor. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, Ms. Launders sued Steinberg, Ms. Nussbaum, the Police  
Department and other city agencies. She charged that the agencies 
knew Lisa was being abused and did nothing to protect her. 
</P>
<P>
	In settling the case, the city admitted no wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Nussbaum, 57, will donate $500 to a children's charity to  
settle the case against her. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg is serving up to 25 years for manslaughter.

<HEADLINE> Execs More Bullish on 4th Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American executives are bullish about the final  
three months of 1999, according to a Dun &AMP; Bradstreet survey that 
reports the first gain in the outlook for exports since the Asian 
financial crisis arose in mid-1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of approximately 3,000 executives, conducted in  
August, had especially strong results in its indexes measuring 
sentiment about exports, sales, profits and employment. 
</P>
<P>
	A boost in hiring plans might further tighten labor markets at a  
time when the unemployment rate is at a 29-year low of 4.2 percent, 
possibly leading to significant wage increases, the 
business-information company said. 
</P>
<P>
	But executives surveyed said they did not expect wage pressures  
to significantly increase inflation. Two-thirds of those responding 
said they expected prices in the fourth quarter either to be the 
same as, or lower than, they were a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey reported 66 percent of the executives expect sales to  
rise in the fourth quarter, 58 percent expect higher profits and 38 
percent plan to hire additional workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The export index surged 19 points from its all-time low of 12 in  
the last quarterly survey in June, rising to 31. That also 
represents a gain of 6 points from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Other optimism indexes also were up substantially from the  
previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our survey indicates that during the last quarter of the  
millennium U.S. businesses expect to turn in very strong results,'' 
said David T. Kresge, chief economist for Dun &AMP; Bradstreet. ``For 
the first time in nearly two years, they see foreign demand for 
U.S. goods picking up significantly, adding to the continued 
strength in domestic spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few executives fear Year 2000 computer problems, Kresge said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Only 10 to 15 percent of respondents expect Y2K to have any  
impact at all on sales, investments, or inventories in the fourth 
quarter. And, among those who think that Y2K will have any effect, 
the great majority expect it to have a positive, rather than a 
negative, influence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, which was conducted by telephone, has a margin of  
error of less than 2 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins WR Green Sprains Ankle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Miami Dolphins wide receiver Yatil Green,  
plagued by injuries during his three-year career, sprained his left 
ankle Thursday and is listed as questionable for Monday night's 
game against the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a slight ankle sprain,'' Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson  
said. ``We don't really know if there's going to be any swelling on 
it or not, but right now we're listing him as questionable. We'll 
know more tomorrow after we see if it swells up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green, a backup who has two catches for 13 yards this season,  
rolled the same ankle in training camp, but that was minor compared 
to the injuries the 6-foot-2 Miami native suffered during his first 
two years in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, the 15th overall pick in the 1997 draft, missed his  
rookie season with a torn ligament in his right knee. Then he 
ruptured the ligament graft in the same knee during training camp 
in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said that if Green does not play, receiver Larry Shannon  
would be activated from the practice squad.

<HEADLINE> Season Removes Cloud From Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A handwritten note leaning against a  
chalkboard in the Cincinnati Reds clubhouse captures their season 
in two sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks for bringing baseball back to Cincinnati,'' a fan wrote  
in neat script. ``It's been a great season no matter what 
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been more than great -- it's been amazing.  
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in years, the Reds are making news for  
something other than Marge Schott's mouth. They're bucking the 
small-market blues by contending for a playoff spot with a limited 
payroll and boundless enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	They've become baseball's darlings and revived a franchise with  
one improbable season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been getting a lot of calls lately from all over the  
country,'' said manager Jack McKeon, who at 68 is old enough to be 
some of his players' grandfather. ``I think we're the sentimental 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody would like to see us go far, all the way to  
the World Series, because we're scrappy and we have an interesting 
bunch of guys and we have a low payroll. I don't think the 
big-money guys would like to see us get in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The big-money guys have dominated the playoffs in recent years  
as salaries escalated and the gap widened between the haves and 
have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams like the Reds, who had a $33 million opening day payroll,  
usually drop out of contention as the season wears on. This team 
hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
	After a day off Thursday, the Reds finish the season with three  
games at Milwaukee that will decide whether they make the playoffs. 
They were tied for first in the NL Central with Houston and led the 
New York Mets by 1 1/2 games for the wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	``You couldn't have scripted it any better,'' first baseman Sean  
Casey said. ``We're going into the last weekend of the season with 
the postseason on the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds have held their own against teams that have outspent  
them 2-to-1. The six major league teams that already have clinched 
playoff berths had opening day payrolls ranging from $61 million to 
$85 million. The Mets' was $63 million, while Houston's was $52 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one said we were supposed to be here,'' cleanup hitter Greg  
Vaughn said. ``We were supposed to pack our bags and fly to 
Milwaukee for the last series and then go on our way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forced to do more with less, the Reds have gotten by with young  
players and part-time players filling their part without complaint. 
They've reveled in the role of underdog. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire was so impressed by the Reds' spirit last weekend  
that he wanted to talk about them, not his latest record-tying 
homers during a series at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are the perfect example of what the game is all about,''  
McGwire said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the Reds have been the perfect example of what  
was wrong with baseball. Schott received punishments for 
inflammatory comments and the team went three years without a 
winning record as it slashed payroll and rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott has been muzzled by baseball and is in her final days as  
owner -- she has agreed to sell control of the team to three limited 
partners for $67 million, a deal that should be signed in early 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the spotlight has been on players like Casey, who  
arrived last year in a trade and is so personable that he's known 
as ``The Mayor'' because he seems to know everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are people,'' said Casey, who loves to talk whether  
he's meeting fans or greeting an opposing runner at first base. ``I 
always think everyone wants to have a good conversation, if you can 
have it. Maybe I seem a little naive. I just enjoy people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds have been a good conversation piece since the  
offseason, when general manager Jim Bowden substantially improved 
his club through trades and free-agent signings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds got the kind of break that a small-market team needs to  
compete when the San Diego Padres offered to trade Vaughn, who was 
coming off a 50-homer season. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn has hit 43 homers, driven in 114 runs and become the  
first player in franchise history with 40 homers, 100 RBIs and 15 
steals in a season. He carried the team through September with 14 
homers, matching Frank Robinson's franchise record for one month. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the one that took all the pressure off our young  
players,'' Bowden said. ``You don't go out and get 40-homer, 
100-RBI guys, and you don't win without them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only downside to the season has been the fans' reluctance to  
get carried away by it. The Reds drew 2 million for the first time 
since 1993, but had hoped for more. 
</P>
<P>
	In their World Series championship season of 1990, the Reds drew  
2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a few bad years, it takes the fans a while to get  
serious,'' McKeon said. ``They say, 'Are they for real or not?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds picked up for the last home series, when the Reds made  
one remarkable comeback after another that proved they're for real. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very special team,'' catcher Eddie Taubensee said.  
``I'm having more fun this year than I ever have. Whether we make 
the playoffs or not, it's something I'll never forget.''

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- When Congress passed the International  
Religious Freedom Act last October, it wanted to make fighting 
religious persecution worldwide a national priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Easier said than done.  
</P>
<P>
	The law's implementation was the subject of a conference this  
week at Trinity College, and participants at times disagreed 
sharply on whether government actions -- and the law itself -- will 
be an incentive or a barrier to broader religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven McFarland, the new executive director of the Commission  
on International Religious Freedom, a body the law established to 
make policy recommendations, fears that the U.S. government could 
become its own obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department, he charges, has not complied with the  
act's requirement to name by Sept. 1 those countries deemed 
responsible for ``particularly severe violations of religious 
freedom.'' When a country is so designated, the president has 90 
days to report to Congress on action to be taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the State Department is willing to name Cuba, Sudan and  
particularly China will be the litmus test of its commitment to 
ending religious persecution, McFarland says. Those countries were 
cited for religious rights violations in the State Department's 
first report on religious freedom, an 1,100-page document mandated 
by the bill and released this month. 
</P>
<P>
	In China, the report said, government intolerance of religious  
activity outside officially sponsored churches had led to 
harassment, prolonged detention, imprisonment in labor camps and 
police closure of places of worship. 
</P>
<P>
	``China is going to be the proof of the pudding,'' McFarland  
said during a break between conference sessions. ``No question in 
my mind they're a serious violator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is considering all  
available evidence as she decides what action to take, said Thomas 
Farr, director of the State Department's Office of International 
Religious Freedom. ``The secretary is aware of the IRF Commission's 
strong recommendation on China and is weighing it carefully,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some human rights activists and scholars, on the other hand,  
worry about potential repercussions from singling out and 
sanctioning countries such as China. Even suspending cultural 
exchanges could discourage the kind of engagement that leads 
governments to make changes, says Mickey Spiegel, a China expert at 
Human Rights Watch. 
</P>
<P>
	But Laura Bryant, an aide to Rep. Bob Clement (D-Tenn.) and a  
co-drafter of the bill, says that naming violators is necessary to 
ensure that the State Department exerts pressure, whether through 
behind-the-scenes negotiations or tougher measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The law gives the president a range of options to punish a  
country that violates religious rights, including private or public 
condemnation, cancellation of scientific and cultural exchanges, 
suspension of some U.S. aid, cancellation of state visits, and the 
banning of new U.S. credits. The president may waive sanctions if 
he decides that it is in the national interest to do so or that the 
offending country has improved. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also set up the independent, 10-member bipartisan  
commission that McFarland heads, which will release its own report 
offering policy recommendations on religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarland formerly directed the Center for Law and Religious  
Freedom, part of the Christian Legal Society, an organization of 
evangelical Protestant lawyers. As chairman of the watchdog 
commission, he has said he will encourage religious Americans to 
take up the fight for religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Several participants at the Trinity conference expressed concern  
about whether the U.S. government can counter perceptions abroad 
that it cares most about protecting Christians. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant says such fears are unfounded. While Christian  
conservatives were influential in the enactment of the statute, and 
an earlier proposed statute that focused more heavily on 
Christians, the new law doesn't target any one religion, she says. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department officials have said repeatedly that they will  
fight persecution of all religious groups, and will apply the law 
uniformly to countries. The department's annual report looks at the 
treatment of Buddhists, Muslims and Hindus, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Emory University law professor Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im  
says many remember the early pro-Christian rhetoric and believe the 
United States is only interested in aiding American missionaries 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Paul Martin, executive director of Columbia University's  
Center for the Study of Human Rights, goes further. In such 
countries as Russia, France, Belgium, and Germany, he says, many 
see Congress' action as ``part of a larger American imperialism.'' 
That could be lessened, he says, if U.S. activity was part of a 
more coordinated international human rights effort. 
</P>
<P>
	But T. Jeremy Gunn, an executive fellow at the U.S. Institute of  
Peace who worked at the State Department's religious freedom 
office, says that members of minority religions, such as Baptists 
and Pentecostals in Russia, appreciate U.S. involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I hear from them is: `We are so pleased a country such as  
the U.S. is concerned about this issue,''' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	An-Na'im says that many foreign observers anticipate that the  
United States will go easy on its allies. Skeptics are going to 
watch, he says, to see if Sudan is punished while Saudi Arabia and 
Israel go free. All three countries were criticized for violating 
religious rights in the State Department report. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarland, meanwhile, is waiting to see if the State Department  
designates China as a violator. The commission has already drafted 
a press release objecting to a failure to single out China, he 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully,'' he says, ``it will never have to be used.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Walker Has Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado Rockies right fielder Larry Walker was  
recovering at home Thursday after an operation to repair cartilage 
in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, who leads the majors with a .379 average, is expected to  
make a full recovery by spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Bothered by injuries ranging from a broken collarbone to a torn  
rotator cuff, Walker has played 150 or more games just once in his 
11 seasons with Montreal and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's durability was a major factor last spring as he  
negotiated a $75 million, six-year contract extension that starts 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pretty much cursed,'' Walker said last week. ``There's a  
cloud, I guess. They say that people who get hurt aren't flexible. 
Well, I'm flexible, but I get hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite starting only 111 games this year and playing in 127  
Walker hit 37 home runs, scored 108 runs and had 115 RBIs. He also 
had 11 stolen bases and hit .461 at Coors Field -- the highest home 
average since the Elias Sports Bureau began tracking such records 
25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker is the first player to hit .360 or better in three  
consecutive seasons since Hall of Fame outfielder Al Simmons did it 
for the Philadelphia A's from 1929-31.

<HEADLINE> Mixup May Have Doomed Mars Orbiter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Converting English measurements into metric  
units isn't exactly rocket science, but NASA is blaming the loss of 
its $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter on a metric mishap. 
</P>
<P>
	The monumental goof caused the spacecraft to fly too close the  
Red Planet and burn up or break apart in the atmosphere it was to 
have studied, the space agency said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe had successfully flown 416 million miles in 9 1/2 months  
before vanishing just as it was starting to circle Mars early on 
Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not make us feel good that this happened,'' said Tom  
Gavin of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``This mix-up has caused 
us to look at our entire end-to-end process. We will get to the 
bottom of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A final report on the mission is expected by Nov. 19 -- enough  
time to fix any problems with another Mars-bound spacecraft that is 
scheduled to land in early December. 
</P>
<P>
	In a preliminary report, JPL said the spacecraft's builder,  
Lockheed Martin Astronautics, submitted acceleration data in 
English units of pounds of force instead of the metric unit called 
newtons. At JPL, the numbers were entered into a computer that 
assumed metric measurements. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our previous Mars missions, we have always used metric,''  
Gavin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Noel Hinners, vice president of flight systems for Lockheed  
Martin Astronautics in Denver, admitted the numbers should have 
been submitted in metric units. Lockheed officials are reviewing 
contracts to see whether NASA specified units of measurement. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad numbers had been used since the spacecraft's launch last  
December, but the effect was so small that it went unnoticed. The 
difference added up over the months as the spacecraft journeyed 
toward Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	Mission navigators crunched the numbers to help understand the  
position of the spacecraft during flight. The calculations measured 
the force of small thruster firings that helped counteract the 
effects of natural forces such as the solar wind -- energy particles 
streaming from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA and outside experts will investigate the mechanisms that  
should have caught the discrepancy in numbers, said Edward Weiler, 
NASA's associate administrator of space science. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem here was not the error, it was the failure of ...  
the checks and balances in our processes to detect the error,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The blunder is not expected to affect NASA's relationship with  
Lockheed, which has built several probes for the space agency, 
including the Magellan probe to Venus and the Mars Global Surveyor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This country has not gone 100 percent metric,'' said Chris  
Jones, program manager for JPL's Mars Surveyor Program. 
``(Companies) continue to use the English system of units, and 
that's something we have dealt with effectively on other 
programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The orbiter's sibling spacecraft, the Mars Polar Lander, is set  
to arrive Dec. 3. Gavin said investigators are trying to determine 
whether NASA made the same mistake with that spacecraft. It also 
was built by Lockheed Martin Astronautics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Climate Orbiter was on a mission to study the planet's  
weather and look for signs of water -- information key to 
understanding whether life ever existed or can exist there. It 
carried cameras along with equipment for measuring temperature, 
dust, water vapor and clouds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Polar Lander will study climate history and weather  
with the goal of finding what happened to water on the planet. It 
is equipped with a robotic arm that will collect samples for 
testing inside the spacecraft.

<HEADLINE> Infant, Maternal Death Rates Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Infant and maternal mortality rates have dropped  
by more than 90 percent since 1900, according to federal officials 
who called it one of the century's most significant advances in 
public health. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate of infants who die before age 1 went from 100 per 1,000  
live births in 1915 to fewer than 7.2 per 1,000 in 1997. The 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the decline was 
unparalleled by other mortality reductions this century. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at the number of babies that have been saved  
during the 20th century, it's enormous,'' said Dr. Solomon Iyasu of 
the CDC's Division of Reproductive Health. ``At the beginning of 
the century, 10 percent of all babies were dying. Now it's less 
than 1 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the turn of the 20th century, six to nine out of every 1,000  
women died of pregnancy-related complications. The rate was less 
than 0.1 per 1,000 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Early efforts to combat infant mortality focused on improving  
living conditions in urban areas, such as establishing safe 
drinking water and sewage and trash disposal. Rising standards of 
living, educational levels and access to health care also 
contributed to the decline. In addition, women started having fewer 
children and spacing them further apart. 
</P>
<P>
	But there wasn't much decline in maternal mortality rates during  
the first three decades of the century, not until health care 
providers shifted their focus from infant health problems to a more 
holistic approach that included the mother, Iyasu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Delivery practices were the main factor in the high number of  
deaths among pregnant women -- most births were in the home and 
obstetrics was a specialty shunned by many physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	The death rate began decreasing during the 1930s and 1940s with  
the introduction of penicillin and other antibiotics along with the 
availability of safer blood supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The declines slowed during the 1950s and early 1960s, primarily  
because of inadequate programs to reduce deaths among children who 
were born premature or with a low birth weight. The CDC said 
Medicaid and other federal programs implemented during the late 
1960s helped reverse that. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1990s, the downward trend continued as cases of  
sudden infant death syndrome dropped 50 percent after parents were 
urged to place sleeping infants on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is that the infant mortality rate and the  
maternal mortality rate has declined for all groups during the 
century but there is still a gap that we need to concentrate on,'' 
Iyasu said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example: Black infants are more than twice as likely to die  
than whites and black women are more than three times as likely to 
die as a result of pregnancy-related complications than whites.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon To Look at U.S. Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Army Secretary Louis Caldera today promised a  
``complete and thorough review'' of accounts of mass killings of 
South Korean civilians by U.S. soldiers early in the Korean war. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera said The Associated Press account ``clearly has raised  
new information that demanded that it be looked into.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said the Pentagon ``wants to get to the bottom  
of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he was briefed on the AP report today. Asked about  
it at a White House question-and-answer session, he responded by 
endorsing the inquiry ordered by Defense Secretary William Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to look into this,'' Clinton said. ``He wants to get  
to the bottom of it. He wants to examine all the available 
information and evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera said a previous review by the Pentagon ``found nothing  
in the official records'' but more examination is required. 
</P>
<P>
	``These reports are, of course, very disturbing,'' he told a  
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said he was not aware of any new information to support  
the claims by South Koreans of killings in 1950 at a village 100 
miles from Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	Accounts of South Korean villagers and of a dozen ex-GIs who  
either witnessed or were involved in the killings were reported by 
the AP on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, called the AP  
report ``obviously deeply troubling. I intend to discuss this with 
Defense Department officials to attempt to determine the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Jakarta today, Cohen said that ``to the  
degree that any substantive information is forthcoming, we 
certainly would look at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, however, ``This has been examined on several occasions  
in the past and I am not aware that there is any information that 
would corroborate or support that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera said the review would take at least a year and it was  
too early to speculate on compensation to the Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
	He said officials would interview the soldiers who were in the  
units identified by the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	``This review will go beyond the documentary records,'' he said.  
``It will be an all-encompassing review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The killings took place during three days in late July 1950, the  
American veterans said, when their Army battalion killed a large 
number of South Korean refugees beneath a railroad bridge at a 
hamlet called No Gun Ri. 
</P>
<P>
	With the soldiers' statements confirming much of their account,  
the Korean claimants called today for a U.S. investigation into the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Koreans have said in a series of petitions, including the  
latest one rejected in 1997 by the Korean government, that some 300 
refugees lay dead under the bridge's twin arches. About 100 others 
were killed in a preceding attack by U.S. Air Force planes, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the U.S. government will meet our demands and console  
the wandering souls of those who died an unfair death,'' the 
claimants said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. military has said repeatedly it found no basis for the  
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera said the early weeks of the conflict were chaotic and  
U.S. soldiers at that time were ill-trained and ill-equipped. He 
said that was ``not an excuse'' for the reported acts.

<HEADLINE> Ford Guilty of Michigan DWI in '97 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Phil Ford's arrest this week for  
driving while impaired wasn't his first. The assistant North 
Carolina basketball coach pleaded guilty to a similar charge in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure was published today in The News &AMP; Observer of  
Raleigh and came as North Carolina officials were making little 
comment on Ford's future at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	An official at the 52nd District Court in Rochester, Mich.,  
confirmed Wednesday that Ford was arrested for, and later pleaded 
guilty to, a similar charge. He was on a recruiting trip at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	UNC athletics director Dick Baddour said he was aware that Ford  
had a problem in Michigan but did not know the entire scope of 
Ford's arrest and guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1997, Coach Dean Smith was still the coach,'' Baddour said.  
``He knew about a previous alcohol-related incident and handled it 
internally, and I have complete confidence that he handled it 
correctly. We were aware of a previous incident, but we were not 
aware of a conviction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, Smith and current head coach Bill Guthridge could not be  
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In Michigan, Ford was stopped by officers on Interstate 75 in  
the Detroit suburb of Auburn Hills at 12:45 a.m. on Sept. 20, 1997. 
Police records showed Ford's blood alcohol level was 0.26 percent -- 
significantly over Michigan's legal limit of 0.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also had an open container of alcohol in the car.  
</P>
<P>
	One month after Smith retired and Guthridge was promoted to head  
coach, Ford pleaded guilty to the Michigan charges on Nov. 11, 
1997. He was fined $600 plus court costs and required to attend 
alcohol highway safety classes and Alcoholics Anonymous classes 
upon his return to North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford was stopped Monday night by Durham police and charged with  
DWI after a test showed his blood alcohol level was .24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, North Carolina's all-time leading scorer as a player, is  
on medical leave for an undisclosed period of time. A first court 
appearance was scheduled for Oct. 21 in Durham County court. 
</P>
<P>
	John Parks, spokesman for the North Carolina Department of Motor  
Vehicles, said the Michigan conviction was reported to North 
Carolina officials and any subsequent convictions would be a second 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone is convicted of a second DWI within three years,  
then it's a four-year suspension 1/8of the driver's license 3/8,'' 
Parks said.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Tackle Spending Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With fiscal 2000 tolling at midnight, Senate  
and House committees are tackling different versions of a massive 
social spending bill -- despite veto threats from the White House 
over education programs. 
</P>
<P>
	As lawmakers went to work today, Congress had completed only  
five of the 13 annual spending bills for the new fiscal year -- 
including one for the District of Columbia government that 
President Clinton vetoed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two of the bills have been signed into law, financing the  
Treasury Department and military construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike four years ago, there's no threat of a federal  
shutdown. Clinton was expected to sign a temporary measure keeping 
the government operating for another three weeks while the 
politicians sort through their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, neither side was backing down.  
</P>
<P>
	The White House wanted higher spending for the environment,  
housing and other programs, while Republicans were cutting some 
Clinton initiatives and shifting dollars into their own priorities, 
such as programs that give states more leeway in apportioning the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are prepared to veto bills that have the wrong  
priorities,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta warned during 
a Wednesday visit to the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	The labor, health and education spending bill is the biggest of  
all, totaling about $320 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The House version pared Clinton proposals for hiring teachers,  
expanding Head Start and some health programs for the poor. And 
though the Senate bill eased many of the House reductions, the 
White House was threatening to veto either one -- chiefly because 
they provided less than he wants for hiring thousands of new 
teachers next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans charged that the drive for new teachers was a  
political ploy aimed at playing to teachers' unions and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been polled,'' said Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. ``That's  
why this has been put forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Senate voted by a near party-line 53-45 for a  
GOP plan providing $1.2 billion that states could use for hiring 
teachers, buying school equipment or other educational purposes -- 
contingent on passage of a separate bill creating the new programs. 
Clinton proposed $1.4 billion, including money to continue paying 
the first 29,000 teachers hired last year and to hire 8,000 more, 
but it was rejected by a party-line 54-44. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the scenes, Republican leaders seemed to be on the verge  
of resolving two internal GOP disputes that have stalled two major 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	A long standoff seemed to be over on the Air Force's proposed  
purchase of its first six F-22 stealth fighters. In a victory for 
House foes of the warplane, leaders of the two chambers were ready 
to provide $1 billion to purchase up to six test models, but delay 
production of the final version for at least a year, said officials 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	And despite lingering opposition, leaders were also near  
agreement on a $70 billion agriculture bill that would include 
close to $9 billion in emergency aid for farmers hurt by low crop 
prices. It would omit controversial provisions that would have 
opened food and medicine sales to Cuba and blocked a new federal 
milk-pricing system. 
</P>
<P>
	And House-Senate bargainers reached agreement Wednesday on a $50  
billion measure for transportation programs, including increased 
spending for highways, mass transit and aviation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a win for the automobile industry, the measure would prevent  
the government from increasing fuel efficiency standards, 
continuing a prohibition Congress has imposed for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also forbid states from selling information about  
drivers without their consent, though Senate language was dropped 
that would have cut highway funds to states that ignore the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the House, things were moving slowly as Republicans  
lacked the votes even to try to push a $12.6 billion foreign aid 
bill through the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans reiterated their pledge to not use any Social  
Security surpluses to pay for spending bills, and launched 
television commercials accusing Democrats of planning to do so. But 
Clinton administration officials said Republicans were already 
breaking their own pledge. 
</P>
<P>
	New cost estimates provided Congress by the Congressional Budget  
Office showed that current GOP spending plans would eat into Social 
Security surpluses by about $18 billion next year, according to 
documents obtained by The Associated Press. The finding was similar 
to a projection CBO provided lawmakers last month.

	Stocks Close Higher; Dow Up 123.47  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rallied sharply today for the first time  
in nearly two weeks as a government report of slower economic 
growth raised hopes that the Federal Reserve won't raise interest 
rates next week. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 123.47 
at 10,336.95, the index's second gain in eight sessions. It was 
also the Dow's biggest point gain since Sept. 3. Broader stock 
indicators were higher as well. The Nasdaq composite index rose 
16.26 to 2,746.53. A growing sense that the Fed may leave rates 
unchanged next week helped bond prices rise, pushing yields lower.

	Economic Growth Slows in 2nd Qtr.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 1.6  
percent, its slowest in four years, in the second quarter, the 
Commerce Department said today. However, many private economists 
believe the slowdown is only a brief pause. They are looking for 
growth in the current quarter to be at a rate of 4 percent or 
higher. On other subjjects, the government said corporate profits 
decreased at an annual rate of $9.5 billion in the second quarter, 
the worst performance in five years. And the Labor Department said 
the number of U.S. workers filing for unemployment benefits last 
week rose by 25,000 to 299,000, reflecting the impact of Hurricane 
Floyd. 

</P>
<P>
	Consumer Spending Outpaces Earnings  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer spending outpaced earnings in the  
second quarter, the government said today. Spending rose at an 
annual rate of 4.8 percent and sent the personal savings rate -- 
savings as a percentage of disposable income - to a record low of 
negative 1.3 percent in the second quarter. 

</P>
<P>
	New Single-Home Sales Rise 2.9 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of new single-family homes unexpectedly  
surged 2.9 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 983,000 units, the second-highest level on record, the Commerce 
Department said. The increase occurred despite rising mortgage 
rates and surprised analysts expecting a decline. In July, 955,000 
units were sold, reflecting a sharp downward revision from the 
government's previous estimate. Sales were up in all parts of the 
country except the South.

	Kaiser Labor Dispute Reaches a Year  
</P>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- The labor dispute at Kaiser Aluminum &AMP;  
Chemical Corp. turned a year old today. Members of the United 
Steelworkers of America scheduled rallies at the gates of two 
Kaiser plants in the Spokane area of Washington. They also 
announced they would escalate their public relations war against 
the company. Kaiser President Raymond J. Milchovich, in a full-page 
ad in The Spokesman-Review newspaper, blamed the union for 
prolonging the dispute. More than 2,900 Steelworkers at five Kaiser 
plants went on strike last Sept. 30 in a dispute over wages, 
benefits and, especially, job security. The workers later offered 
to return to work while negotiations continued. But the company 
locked them out.

	Marriott To Buy Back 10.6M Shares  
</P>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Marriott International Inc. today announced  
it was buying back 10.6 million shares worth more than $320 
million. It also reported that third-quarter earnings were up 12 
percent. The hotel and real estate firm credited cost control for 
the increased earnings. Marriott said net income was $96 million 
for the quarter ending Sept. 10, compared to $86 million in the 
same period a year ago. Per share earnings were 36 cents, compared 
to 32 cents in the corresponding quarter a year ago, the company 
said. Sales were $2 billion, up 11 percent from $1.8 billion in 
same period last year.

	Judge OKs Boeing Settlement  
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A federal judge today approved a $15 million  
settlement of a racial discrimination lawsuit brought against The 
Boeing Co., saying it was the best way to encourage racial 
cooperation at the company. A group of black employees at the 
world's leading maker of commercial airplanes had argued before 
U.S. District Judge John Coughenour last week that the settlement 
was inadequate. But in his opinion, he said the settlement has a 
greater chance of fostering a cooperative relationship between 
Boeing and its African-American employees than would a series of 
protracted individual disputes.''

	Greyhound To Install Bus Lifts  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To resolve allegations of discrimination,  
Greyhound Lines Inc. agreed today to phase in lift-equipped buses 
for disabled riders two years before it is required to have them. 
The Justice Department reached the out-of-court agreement with the 
nation's largest intercity bus company after receiving a number of 
complaints that Greyhound drivers and employees had violated the 
Americans With Disabilities Act by discriminating against the 
disabled. Most of the complaints involved refusal to aid a disabled 
person in boarding a bus, injuries that occurred when disabled 
riders were carried on or off buses or other alleged mistreatment, 
the department said.

	Mazda To Pay $5 Million Fine

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mazda will pay $5.25 million to settle charges  
it violated government agreements requiring that the automaker 
clearly disclose important car leasing terms in its advertising, 
federal regulators said today. The civil penalties include a $4.05 
million fine, the largest obtained by the Federal Trade 
Commission's bureau of consumer protection, for what the FTC said 
was a failure to abide by a February 1997 agency order about 
Mazda's advertising. Mazda also agreed to pay a total of $1.2 
million in fines and costs to 24 states. The complaint and consent 
decree were filed today in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court agreed to  
reconsider its ruling against the Clinton administration's claim of 
veto power over the export or Internet posting of data-scrambling 
encryption codes for computer messages. A panel of the 9th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 in May that encryption codes, 
which make computer files unreadable without a key, contain 
expressions of ideas and cannot be suppressed indefinitely by 
government officials.

	Global Ban on Internet Taxes Sought  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration and Congress are  
urging that the World Trade Organization impose a permanent global 
ban on taxes and tariffs aimed specifically at Internet commerce. 
Of particular concern is the ``bit tax'' on transmission of digital 
data proposed by a recent United Nations report as a way for 
developing countries to gain revenue. The tax would increase based

<HEADLINE> Heat Signs Three, Waives One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Free agent guard Corey Brewer and forwards Jamie  
Watson and Jermaine Walker signed contracts on Thursday with the 
Miami Heat. The club also waived forward Mark Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the signings weren't released.  
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, 6-foot-2, was drafted by the Heat with the 51st pick of  
the 1998 draft out of Oklahoma. Last season, Brewer played for New 
Jersey of the USBL, averaging 13.2 points, 4.4 assists and 4.6 
rebounds in 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, 6-7, played three games for the Heat last season before  
being waived Feb. 19. He was drafted by Utah with the 47th pick of 
the 1994 draft and played 2 1/2 years with the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, 6-7, averaged 26.6 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.6 assists  
in 22 games last season for Gulf Coast of the USBL. Prior to that, 
he averaged 19.6 points and 6 rebounds per game for Jacksonville of 
the USBL. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis signed with the Heat as a free agent Aug. 6. He appeared

<HEADLINE> Encephalitis Virus Kills Five in NY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's quite a scientific expedition -- testing  
birds up and down the East Coast to track the encephalitis virus 
that has killed five people and infected 38 others in the New York 
City area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to look at all kinds of urban birds -- crows,  
pigeons, starlings and sparrows,'' said Andrew Spielman, an expert 
on mosquito-borne diseases at the Harvard School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Nile strain of the virus has been found in dead crows  
in the New York area. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention is now collecting blood samples from city pigeons and 
also looking at ticks as possible carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York's Queens borough, where the first cases of  
encephalitis were reported last month, the CDC and the city's 
health department planned to take blood samples door-to-door, with 
300 households selected at random and on a voluntary basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to get a better understanding of the symptoms caused  
by West Nile virus, as well as possible risk factors for 
infection,'' said Ned Hayes, the CDC's medical epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing the infection might spread with the fall bird migration,  
experts also are testing dead birds from Maryland to Florida. No 
sign of the virus has appeared in those birds, said Roger Nasci, a 
CDC entomologist. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus is believed to have been transmitted by mosquitoes  
that typically feed off birds. Six new cases were confirmed 
Wednesday, including a 79-year-old woman from the borough of Queens 
who died Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have been spraying  
pesticides to kill as many mosquitoes as possible before the first 
winter chills. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Neal Cohen, the city's health commissioner, said mosquito  
density has declined substantially, probably by 90 or 95 percent 
since the second citywide spraying a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The encephalitis cases found in New York originally were blamed  
on the St. Louis strain. But late last month, some dead crows were 
spotted near the Bronx Zoo. Subsequently, 20 zoo birds died and 
tested positive for the African strain, said zoo spokeswoman Linda 
Corcoran. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Nile virus -- never before recorded in the Western  
Hemisphere -- probably entered the United States in infected birds. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms of the strain -- fever and headache -- are similar to  
those of the St. Louis strain but generally are milder. In rare 
cases, the virus can cause neurological disorders and death. The 
elderly, young and those with weakened immune systems are most 
vulnerable.

<HEADLINE> Danforth Hires Aide for Waco Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The special counsel investigating whether the  
government covered up aspects of the 1993 Waco siege appointed a 
deputy on Wednesday to head the inquiry's dealings in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	John Danforth, a former Republican senator from Missouri who is  
setting up investigative offices in St. Louis and Washington, named 
Stuart Levey as associate special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Levey, 36, a partner in the Washington law firm Miller, Cassidy,  
Larroca &AMP; Lewin, ``brings perspective and experience that will be 
important to our effort to conduct a first-rate investigation,'' 
Danforth said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Levey hiring is among several Danforth has made in recent  
weeks as he assembles his investigative team. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Danforth earlier this  
month to head a new inquiry into the siege after the Justice 
Department and FBI were forced to recant six years of denials that 
potentially incendiary tear-gas projectiles were fired in the hours 
before the siege's fiery end. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate task force and the House Government Reform Committee  
have launched their own inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth has pledged to answer the ``dark questions'' of whether  
the government killed Branch Davidians during the standoff and then 
engaged in a cover-up. Davidian leader David Koresh and some 80 
followers died during the fiery climax to the 51-day siege, some 
from the fire, others from gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has denied that any shots were fired during the  
standoff. Reno and FBI officials insist the fire was started by 
Davidians inside the compound, not federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, who is using St. Louis as his base of operations, told  
The Washington Post this week that he has recruited a chief of 
staff, a team of 12 to 15 lawyers, and postal inspectors. Former 
U.S. Attorney Edward Dowd Jr. is Danforth's deputy in St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Nixes Free Trade-Job Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said  
Thursday there are countless economic arguments in support of free 
trade but job creation is not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, returning to a theme he has sounded several times  
this year, mounted a strong defense for the benefits the U.S. 
economy has enjoyed from reducing trade barriers. But he said he 
regretted that supporters have tried to link trade policies with 
job creation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We too often try to promote free trade on the mistaken ground  
that it will create jobs,'' Greenspan said in a speech prepared for 
a meeting of business executives in Minneapolis. Copies of the 
speech were distributed here. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade can influence the type of jobs that an economy can create,  
but not the overall number, Greenspan said. By opening up a country 
to competition, he said, free trade enhances productivity by 
forcing industry into more productive fields to the benefit of 
workers, who see their salaries increase. 
</P>
<P>
	But the overall number of jobs is influenced my other economic  
factors, Greenspan said, putting forth an argument made by a large 
number of economists. They contend that overall employment is 
influenced much more by factors such as interest rate policies, 
that can boost or depress consumer demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to find credible evidence that trade has  
affected the level of employment in this country over the long 
run,'' Greenspan said. ``Indeed, we are currently experiencing the 
widest trade deficit in history with a level of unemployment close 
to record lows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's remarks represented the latest in a series of  
speeches he has given this year seeking to counter what he views as 
rising protectionist sentiments as America's trade deficit has 
soared over the past two years. A global financial crisis has cut 
sharply into U.S. export markets and increased the flow of low-cost 
imports into this country. 
</P>
<P>
	``The campaign to expand free trade is never won,'' Greenspan  
said. ``Legislation to further lower trade barriers ... is becoming 
increasingly difficult to pass in Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States will serve as hosts this December to a meeting  
in Seattle of the 134-nation World Trade Organization, where a new 
round of global trade liberalization talks will be launched. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the U.S. delegation will attend the session without the  
congressional authorization it needs to complete the negotiations 
because President Clinton has been unable in five years to get the 
measure through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said he also was concerned that as formal trade  
barriers were being reduced, more countries were resorting to other 
forms of protectionism such as raising tariffs through findings 
that goods were being ``dumped'' at unfairly low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``While these forms of protection have often been imposed under  
the label of promoting fair trade, oftentimes they are just simple 
guises for inhibiting competition,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has supported a number of dumping  
cases filed in recent months by the steel industry, which argued 
they were losing millions of dollars in sales because of a flood of 
cheap imports into the country as a result of the Asian financial 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said the U.S. economy has benefited greatly from  
lowering trade barriers, which has increased competition and forced 
American businesses into more innovative fields paying higher wages 
for workers. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the transition from obsolete technologies to newer  
technologies does represent lost jobs for workers through no fault 
of their own. He urged support for the transition through job 
training programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a great tragedy were we to stop the wheels of  
progress because of an incapacity to assist the victims of 
progress,'' Greenspan said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Climb; Dow Ends Up 123.47 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rallied sharply Thursday for the first  
time in nearly two weeks as a government report of slower economic 
growth raised hopes that the Federal Reserve won't raise interest 
rates next week after all. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 123.47 to close at  
10,336.95, the index's second gain in eight sessions. It was also 
the Dow's biggest point gain since Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher as well. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 rose 14.34 to 1,282.71, and the Nasdaq composite index 
rose 15.89 to 2,746.16. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks rose after the Commerce Department reported that the U.S.  
economy, weighed down by record trade deficits, saw its growth slow 
to an annual rate of 1.6 percent during the second quarter, the 
lowest rate of expansion in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The report on the nation's gross domestic product provided some  
relief for investors who have driven stocks lower over the past 
week as they pessimistically awaited the Fed's Oct. 5 meeting on 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In a bid to cool the economy's sizzling growth, the Fed has  
raised rates twice this year and suggested it would do so again if 
signs of inflation crept into the economy. Before Thursday, many 
investors were worried that the Fed would moves rates higher a 
third time. 
</P>
<P>
	But a growing sense that the Fed might leave rates unchanged  
next week helped bond prices rise, pushing yields lower. The yield 
on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.06 percent Thursday 
afternoon, compared with 6.12 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock market may have overreacted to the latest signals on  
what the Fed will do,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist 
at Edward Jones in St. Louis. Skrainka believes the Fed will leave 
rates unchanged next Tuesday, but may signal a willingness to raise 
rates later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Enthusiasm for the GDP reading was somewhat tempered by a second  
report that showed sales of new single-family homes surged 2.9 
percent in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 983,000 
units, the second-highest level on record. The increase occurred 
despite rising mortgage rates and surprised analysts expecting a 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Labor Department said the number of Americans  
filing for unemployment benefits last week rose by 25,000 to 
299,000, reflecting the impact of Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Claims below 300,000 are considered a sign of an extremely tight  
labor market. Many economists believe the Fed will consider the 
labor shortage in its debate on interest rates, as companies spend 
heavily to attract and retain skilled workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said some of Thursday's buying was sparked by portfolio  
managers working to square their accounts for the end of the third 
quarter. That drew investors to shares that have held up well 
throughout the quarter, including Hewlett Packard, up 1 1/2 to 90 3/4, 
and Sun Microsystems, up 1 1/2 to 93 1/16. Apple Computer rose 4 3/16 
to 63 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has looked pretty lousy all week, and my sense is  
that the end of the quarter brought some people back into it 
today,'' said Ned Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities America. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclical companies, whose fortunes are tied to the economy, also  
fared well. General Electric rose 2 1/8 to 118 9/16 and 3M rose 2 to 
96 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq's gains were hemmed in by some of its major  
technology names. Amazon.com slipped 15/16 to 79 13/16 after rising 
sharply on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, shares of companies that make computer chips tumbled,  
continuing to suffer from worries that last week's earthquake in 
Taiwan will hamper production. Applied Materials fell 2 1/8 to 77 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of health maintenance organizations plunged after The  
Wall Street Journal reported trial lawyers are preparing to launch 
class-action lawsuits against certain HMOs. United HealthCare fell 
11 13/16 to 48 11/16, and Aetna fell 10 7/16 to 49 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow lost 5.78 percent during the quarter, but is still up  
12.6 percent on the year. The Nasdaq managed a 2.2 percent rise for 
the quarter and is up 25.2 percent since Jan. 1, while the S&AMP;P, 
down 6.6 percent over the quarter, is still 4.4 percent higher for 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 1.02 billion 
shares, compared with 1.01 billion in the previous session.

<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gained 5.78 to

<HEADLINE> States Want To Duck Smoking Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators from several states are working to  
derail penalties in an anti-smoking law that could cost their 
states $37 million in drug treatment money. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri stands to lose the most -- $9.6 million -- among seven  
states and the District of Columbia that missed their targets for 
curtailing underage smoking. Violations are determined by 
investigations into how many retailers are selling tobacco to 
minors. 
</P>
<P>
	For those that miss the mark, the law slashes 40 percent of this  
year's block grants for substance abuse and treatment programs. 
States may appeal the penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sen. Christopher Bond of Missouri and Democratic Sen.  
Tom Harkin of Iowa said Thursday they worked out a deal to help 
states dodge the penalty with an amendment to spending legislation 
under full Senate consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``This amendment allows Missouri to avoid the huge penalty by  
devoting a modest amount of money to solving the problem and making 
sure that kids can't buy cigarettes,'' Bond said. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would allow states to avoid penalties by committing  
new funds toward initiatives to keep minors from buying tobacco 
products. Missouri would have to commit $1.2 million and might have 
to pass legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan sent Bond a letter dated Wednesday  
asking for help from Congress. State officials have said the 
resulting cuts could limit services ranging from treatment for 
pregnant crack addicts to housing for addicted kids 
</P>
<P>
	``A loss of this magnitude,'' Carnahan wrote, ``would not only  
completely undermine our ability to reach the goals of the Synar 
law in the future, but would decimate our efforts to combat 
substance abuse overall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan's spokesman, Jerry Nachtigal, said Thursday the  
governor is open to ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would certainly consider this as an option if we don't  
prevail on our appeal,'' Nachtigal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1992 law was named for the late Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla.,  
and requires states to pass laws banning tobacco sales to anyone 
under age 18 with aggressive enforcement measures that include 
random, unannounced inspections using decoy buyers at groceries and 
other retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration supports an easing of the penalties.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Missouri, states that would be penalized are  
Delaware, $2.2 million; Iowa, $5 million; Minnesota, $8.4 million; 
Oregon, $6 million; Rhode Island, $2.4 million; and Wyoming, 
$980,950. The District of Columbia would lose nearly $2 million.

<HEADLINE> Court Reconsiders Encryption Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court agreed Thursday to  
reconsider its ruling against the Clinton administration's claim of 
veto power over the export or Internet posting of data-scrambling 
encryption codes for computer messages. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 in  
May that encryption codes, which make computer files unreadable 
without a key, contain expressions of ideas and cannot be 
suppressed indefinitely by government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Thursday, the full court announced that a majority of its  
active judges had voted to grant a government request to refer the 
case to an 11-judge panel for a new hearing. No date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, however, the administration announced it would  
allow high-tech companies to sell the most powerful data-scrambling 
technology overseas with almost no restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	That decision, issued over law enforcement objections, was  
designed to help U.S. companies compete against foreign rivals. It 
also helps consumers protect the privacy of their e-mail and online 
credit-card purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	The case before the appeals court involved a mathematician's  
challenge to Commerce Department regulations that treat 
high-powered encryption codes like military weapons, forbidding 
their export without a license. The rules also apply to the posting 
of encryption codes on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In a May 6 ruling, the appellate panel said the lack of  
timetables or standards for such licensing allowed the government 
to restrain free expression indefinitely, with no clear criteria 
for review. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department asked for a rehearing, saying the ruling  
would diminish the government's ability to keep encryption 
technology from falling into the hands of ``potentially hostile 
foreign parties.''

<HEADLINE> Investors Want More Gibson Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A major shareholder in Gibson Greetings Inc.  
has asked for clearance to acquire a 20 percent stake in the 
nation's third biggest greeting card company, and another investor 
has obtained a 5.3 percent stake. 
</P>
<P>
	The actions were made public yesterday in filings with the  
Securities and Exchange Commission. Shareholders have been calling 
for the company to do something to improve its value after almost a 
yearlong decline in its stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent Tuesday to Gibson chief executive Frank  
O'Connell, cigarette executive Bennett LeBow and his New Valley 
Corp. requested a meeting with Gibson's board to discuss tripling 
New Valley's stake from 6.8 percent to 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC filings yesterday also revealed that California millionaire  
Joseph Harrosh acquired a 5.3 percent stake in Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson is the third-largest U.S. card maker behind Hallmark and  
American Greetings. 
</P>
<P>
	LeBow, who controls the cigarette company Liggett Group, asked  
Gibson to rescind or amend the ``poison pill'' provision that 
forces would-be suitors to negotiate with Gibson's board before 
making a takeover attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Gibson's continued significant operating losses and  
declining stock price, it would be in the best interests of all 
stockholders for New Valley to have substantial representation on 
the board of directors ...'' the letter stated. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter also said Gibson must restructure operations as soon  
as possible to significantly reduce its cost structure and 
concentrate its business on Internet opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday  
night. A recording said the office was closed for the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson shares rose $1.12 1/2 to $5.31 1/4 Wednesday. The stock was  
almost $21 a share a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Bush Criticizes GOP-Led Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- In a rare dispute with Congress,  
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush on Thursday 
criticized a GOP plan to squeeze money from a program for the 
working poor to meet budget targets. 
</P>
<P>
	He also signaled his displeasure with trends that suggest  
Congress may exceed spending limits in place since the 1997 
balanced-budget deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they ought to balance their budget on the backs  
of the poor,'' said the two-term Texas governor and Republican 
presidential front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP-led Congress is mulling several bookkeeping gimmicks to  
keep a promise to avoid spending portions of the budget surplus 
reserved for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	One proposal accepted by Republican House leaders would produce  
$8 billion in savings by spreading the earned income tax credit 
over 12 monthly payments rather than the lump sum now paid with tax 
refunds. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say the tactic would be unfair, because it would  
siphon money from working families who earn less than $30,000 a 
year. Bush agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned about the earned income tax credit. I'm  
concerned for someone who is moving from near-poverty to middle 
class,'' said Bush, whose is trying to build an election coalition 
by blending traditional conservative values with moderate rhetoric. 
Afterward, his spokeswoman Karen Hughes confirmed that Bush was 
criticizing the proposal to change the earned income tax credit 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Bush's remarks, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,  
R-Texas, who sponsored the proposal, said: ``This is not balancing 
on the backs of the poor. They don't lose a dime.'' DeLay later 
said Bush would realize that poor people will not lose any money. 
``It's obvious Mr. Bush needs a little education on how Congress 
works. I don't think he knew what he was talking about,'' DeLay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the self-professed ``compassionate conservative,''  
signaled in August that his long-awaited tax proposal would revise 
the earned income tax program. Bush has delayed revealing his tax 
plan, in part to ensure that tax cuts to wealthy Americans are 
offset by relief for voters in the middle class and near-poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks at a news conference during a swing through Silicon  
Valley marked the first time he has spoke against the spending 
plan. Bush has close ties to Congress and the GOP establishment, a 
point that his Democratic and Republican opponents could use 
against him if Republican lawmakers mishandle the politics of the 
budget debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office says current Republican  
spending proposals would exceed two-year-old spending caps set for 
fiscal 2000 and eat into the Social Security surplus. Asked about 
the report, Bush said, ``The administration and Congress should 
hold to the spending caps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not elaborate.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate office of Arizona's John McCain, who is also running  
for the Republican presidential nomination, chafed at Bush's 
criticism of congressional Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's press secretary Nancy Ives replied by saying, ``If we  
were to eliminate the pork that's in the spending bills right now, 
we wouldn't have to rely on budget gimmicks; we would have the 
money to spend on low-income Americans and hard-working families 
instead of spending that money on special interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Accused the Clinton administration of refusing to help the  
high-technology industry deal with a laundry list of issues before 
Congress until he began courting the industry on the campaign 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
	--Promised to debate his rivals, but only ``when the people start  
paying attention.'' Fellow GOP presidential candidates, trailing 
him badly in polls and money-raising, want to test his handle on 
issues.

<HEADLINE> Fleet-BankBoston Merger Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Massachusetts regulators approved Fleet Financial  
Group's takeover of BankBoston on Thursday, removing the final 
obstacle to the creation of New England's largest bank and the 
eighth biggest in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies plan to file documents Friday with state  
regulators that will seal the deal, which already has been cleared 
by federal regulators, is now expected to close on Friday, the 
companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation voted 3-0 to  
approve the $16 billion takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet, currently the nation's ninth-largest bank, has $69.7  
billion in deposits and $104.4 billion in assets. No. 15 BankBoston 
has $48.5 billion in deposits and $73.5 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators had required that Fleet and BankBoston sell  
off 306 branches to ensure the new company wouldn't dominate the 
market. On Thursday, the banks announced they would sell off an 
additional seven branches in Connecticut to satisfy state 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also pledged to lend $14.6 billion over the next  
five years in affordable mortgages, small business loans and other 
programs for low- to moderate-income people.

<HEADLINE> Court To Reconsider Encryption Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court said Thursday it  
would take another look at the government's power to regulate 
data-scrambling technology known as encryption. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, a three-judge panel ruled encryption programs and the  
mathematical formulas used to write them could not be suppressed by 
the government because they contain expressions of ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Thursday, a majority of the full court's 21 active judges  
agreed to grant the government's request for another hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is vital to the software industry, which uses  
encryption to protect e-mail and electronic commerce, from credit 
card numbers to company data. The current restrictions, which treat 
high-powered encryption codes like military weapons, require a 
Commerce Department license for either export or Internet posting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said it feared the May ruling would  
prevent it from keeping encryption technology out of the hands of 
terrorists and hostile nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has offered some concessions to the  
industry by promising to reduce export restrictions. But it said 
new regulations, due in December, still would require government 
permission to sell scrambling technology to foreign governments and 
would ban sales to Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, North Korea and 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokeswoman Gretchen Michael said she didn't  
know how the new regulations might affect the case being appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was brought by Daniel Bernstein, a professor at the  
University of Illinois at Chicago who developed an encryption 
program in 1990 but found he was unable to get an export license to 
sell it overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Cindy Cohn said the administration's new regulations  
are unlikely to remove the roadblocks Bernstein faced. 
</P>
<P>
	The government still appears to be claiming an absolute right to  
block the export of encryption codes, without defining what can and 
cannot be exported, she said. And it appears to still require a 
case-by-case review of the export or posting of source codes, the 
researchers' mathematical formulas for writing encryption codes, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the May decision, the appeals court panel said the government  
can't block the expression of ideas in encryption codes without 
setting clear standards and timetables and guaranteeing quick 
judicial review. 
</P>
<P>
	The existing regulations ``allow the government to restrain  
speech indefinitely, with no clear criteria for review,'' said 
Judge Betty Fletcher in the 2-1 ruling. That, she wrote, prevents 
professors such as Bernstein from engaging in valuable scientific 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
	An 11-judge panel of the same appeals court will be chosen to  
rehear the case. No date has been scheduled.

<HEADLINE> Power Equipment Engines Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 118,000 engines in various brands of  
outdoor power equipment were recalled Thursday because of a faulty 
fuel shutoff valve that poses a fire hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	Tecumseh Products of Grafton, Wis., recalled the engines, which  
primarily run snow blowers made by eight companies. They also were 
included in augers, post hole diggers, log splitters, shredders, 
irrigators and ventilating fans made by the companies. Gasoline can 
leak from a small hole in the engine's fuel line. 
</P>
<P>
	Two incidents of leaks have been reported, but no injuries, the  
Consumer Product Safety Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mass merchandise stores and factory dealerships sold power  
equipment with the engines from June through this month for $800 to 
$2,000. The engines involved with the recall have a DOM number, or 
date of manufacture, from 9121 to 9233. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should stop using the equipment and call 888-271-4048  
to arrange a free repair.

<HEADLINE> Buckeye's Look To Stop Badger's Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- At some point in the Wisconsin-Ohio State  
game Saturday, Ron Dayne will be running with the ball at full 
speed when he confronts a lone Buckeyes defender. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it'll be time for the potential tackler to decide how best  
to leash the Great Dayne. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has to grab a piece of something, and he'll come  
down,'' Buckeyes defensive end Rodney Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe. Maybe not. The thing is, the 250-plus pound running back  
loves inflicting embarrassment -- if not pain -- on those confident 
enough to tackle him by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to have some contact because I miss playing defense,''  
Dayne said. ``I used to play defense in high school. Once I run 
over somebody, you know I feel a little bit better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before a team studies game films of Dayne, it must first study  
physics. Such as, what happens when a large, speeding object runs 
into a smaller, stationary one? 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly think it could happen. I think a man can get hurt  
from trying to tackle another man,'' Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Buckeyes are exactly looking forward to it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say that's exciting because it's not going to be  
too easy, not going to be easy at all,'' linebacker Na'il Diggs 
said of a possible Diggs-Dayne introduction. ``But I'm always up 
for a challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne is a load, to say the least. And he has been for a lot of  
defenses that have more experience and perhaps more talent than 
Ohio State's, which surrendered 525 yards a week ago to Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne has 5,175 yards and needs just 3 to pass Ohio State's  
Archie Griffin and move into fifth place on the NCAA career rushing 
list. With 82 more yards, he'll pass Georgia's Herschel Walker for 
fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key to stopping him is to not let him get full momentum  
going forward,'' defensive end James Cotton said. 
</P>
<P>
	But what if it's just one defender and Dayne?  
</P>
<P>
	``He's human. It's not impossible. It can be done,'' linebacker  
Courtland Bullard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne is listed at 5-foot-10, 248 pounds, but Ohio State coach  
John Cooper said he appears to be a lot heavier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes rely on their safeties for run support, meaning  
195-pound Gary Berry and 203-pound freshman Donnie Nickey likely 
will be called on to abandon deep responsibilities to plug gaps up 
front. On sweeps, Dayne will more than likely make the acquaintance 
of cornerbacks Nate Clements (190 pounds) and Ahmed Plummer (193). 
</P>
<P>
	``If he gets through the linebackers and gets to a safety, and  
the safety gets run over, I think it's up to the safety to get up 
the next play and hit him just as hard,'' Diggs said. ``I don't see 
any of our safeties backpedaling trying to soften up on him because 
he ran them over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Plummer said stopping Dayne is the responsibility of the  
Buckeyes' front seven. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our job is not to stop the run; our job every game is to stop  
the pass,'' Plummer said. ``Hopefully Na'il and James Cotton and 
all of these other great linebackers and defensive linemen can stop 
the run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan limited Dayne to 88 yards on 22 carries and one  
touchdown in a 21-16 win last week. But Dayne still left 
black-and-blue marks on several potential tacklers on his rumble 
through the record book. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a guy who's 250-plus pounds, he's got good speed,'' Cooper  
said. ``You put him in the open and he will flat run over you. 
Very, very seldom do you see one guy knock him down.''

<HEADLINE> Thomas of White Sox Begins Rehab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Frank Thomas dismissed rumors he was feuding with  
Chicago White Sox manager Jerry Manuel, saying Thursday he was 
happy with the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas visited his teammates for the first time since a Sept. 13  
operation to remove a bone spur in his right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very serious injury,'' Thomas said.  
</P>
<P>
	If Thomas had ruptured tendons, he could have been sidelined for  
more than one year. Instead, he will begin weight-bearing exercises 
next week and predicted he will be 100 percent by spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas still needs to repair what was perceived to be a bad  
relationship with Manuel. The two reportedly argued after a 
doubleheader on Sept. 6, when Thomas told Manuel he was unavailable 
to pinch hit because of the pain in his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Manuel reportedly sent Thomas home for disciplinary reasons.  
Thomas said Thursday he was sent home to see doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no problem with Jerry Manuel and I,'' Thomas said.  
``Jerry Manuel was upset that I couldn't play. Of course, he wanted 
me to play the rest of the season and I couldn't. That's the way it 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said he was getting treatment during the entire  
doubleheader in Texas for his sore ankle, which he said started 
bothering him Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	He also sparred with Manuel over playing first base. Manuel  
wanted him on the field, while Thomas wanted to be the designated 
hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's humbling to hear all the bad things about me this year,''  
Thomas said. ``I was having a great season. I'm happy with the 
season. We're playing well. We're winning as a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas finished with a .305 average, 15 homers, 77 RBIs, 87  
walks and 74 runs. It was the first time he did not drive in 100 
runs, draw 100 walks, score 100 runs or hit at least 20 homers 
since 1990, his first full season in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas ignored hitting coach Von Joshua until Sept. 1 when the  
two had their first session together -- at Manuel's insistence. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, Manuel said, ``Our biggest goal as a staff is to  
get Frank back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said he expects to hit more in the off season and do more  
agility drills, predicting he will return to form in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stuck out like a sore thumb on this team all year,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Dips, Japanese Stocks Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar fell against the yen today, while  
Japanese share prices gained amid increased buying interest from 
both domestic and U.S. pension funds on the last day of the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 105.66 yen, down 1.24 yen from late Wednesday  
in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 106.98 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 323.18  
points, or 1.87 percent, to close at 17,605.46. On Wednesday, the 
average closed down 43.42 points, or 0.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the currency market, the dollar traded between 105.55 yen and  
107.35 yen, as speculation continued on whether the Bank of Japan 
might ease credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Monetary easing could weaken the yen against the U.S. currency,  
while a strong yen could derail Japan's recovery from recession by 
making Japanese exports more expensive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan usually increases money supply at the midpoint  
of Japan's fiscal year. The first half ended today. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said some overseas investors mistook today's action for  
an easing in monetary policy, pushing the dollar to an intraday 
high of 107.35 yen. But the move was later interpreted as a routine 
adjustment in the money supply, leading investors to sell dollars 
again and pushing the currency lower, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar is likely to be supported by the specter of BOJ's  
easing for the near term,'' said Minoru Shioiri, assistant manager 
of foreign exchange at Nippon Credit Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In the stock market, local and U.S. pension funds bought a broad  
range of international blue chips to enhance their portfolios at 
the end of the month, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several investment trusts were also active buyers, targeting  
small- and mid-sized issues in particular, as well as other 
high-growth stocks, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiroichi Nishi, deputy general manager at Nikko Securities Co.,  
said the stock market was boosted by some bullish factors, 
including the dollar's brief rise above 107 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section of the Tokyo stock exchange was  
estimated at 526.27 million shares, up from 373 million shares 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancers outnumbered retreaters 1,084 to 195, while 68 issues  
were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 34.91 points, or 2.39 percent, to 1,493.02. 
The index closed down 11.18 points, or 0.76 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 112.24 yen, down  
slightly from 112.52 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.7100 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.6750 percent. Its 
price fell 0.21 points to 99.91.

<HEADLINE> Marks &AMP; Spenceer Overhauls Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Ailing British retailer Marks &AMP; Spencer PLC is  
overhauling its management board structure to respond more quickly 
to customer needs, the company said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the company's most senior directors will retire early as  
a result. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves are the latest step in chief executive Peter  
Salsbury's effort to reverse the plunging fortunes of one of 
Britain's most venerable department store chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Marks &AMP; Spencer's pretax profits for the year ending March 31  
fell 41 percent from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has warned that profits for the first half of this  
fiscal year would be almost half last year's level, due largely to 
unseasonably warm weather that hurt initial sales of its autumn 
line of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past year, Marks &AMP; Spencer has trimmed the size of its  
board to 14 from 21 members, and it has halved the number of its 
management layers. Company directors will now report directly to 
Salsbury rather than through divisional managing directors. 
</P>
<P>
	``This structure supports the key strategic steps ahead, such as  
the better procurement of merchandise, further development of the 
relationship with our customer, new selling channels and the 
cultural transformation of the business'', Salsbury said. 
</P>
<P>
	Directors Andrew Stone and James Benfield will both take early  
retirement. Stone, 57, has managed the company's clothing business 
in Britain. Benfield, 50, was replaced last week as marketing 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the chain announced it was closing its 38 Canadian  
stores after mounting losses. It also began laying off hundreds of 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Marks &AMP; Spencer said it will sell its 25  
Kings Super Market stores in New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Congress On Verge of Deal on F-22's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force appears to have been thwarted in  
its quest to get the first, combat-ready models of its prized F-22 
stealth fighter as a House-Senate fight over the 
ultra-sophisticated warplane draws to a close. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders were expected to announce as early as  
today that they have agreed to provide $1 billion for the Air Force 
to buy test models of the F-22. 
</P>
<P>
	But production of final versions of the radar-evading aircraft  
would have to wait at least until 2001, said congressional 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	While cautioning that ``it's never done until it's done,'' House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters today that a deal on 
the F-22 was close. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope we would finish that bill quite quickly,''  
Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force had wanted to begin buying production planes  
during the coming year. It has already spent $25 billion to develop 
the F-22 and plans to spend an additional $40 billion to build 339 
of them. They would replace the F-15 jet fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	The F-22s, which the Air Force envisions as the cornerstone of  
its fleet for the early 21st century, would cost nearly $200 
million apiece, making it the most expensive jet fighter ever 
built. 
</P>
<P>
	But House critics led by Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., argued that  
the money was needed for other military projects and that the F-22 
was not ready for production. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision would mark a setback for the Lockheed Martin Corp.,  
the prime contractor, the Clinton administration and the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, struck during a closed-door meeting of Republican  
congressional leaders Wednesday night, would end weeks of stalemate 
that blocked progress on a nearly $270 billion bill to run the 
military through fiscal 2000, which begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a good breakthrough,'' House Majority Leader Dick  
Armey, R-Texas, an F-22 supporter, said while leaving the meeting. 
But he and other lawmakers would provide no details. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 billion would probably be enough to purchase three or  
four of the test aircraft, one official said, which would be used 
for trials that would help determine the plane's final 
configuration. The Air Force could buy up to six of the test 
models, but probably would have to request additional money next 
year to buy that many. 
</P>
<P>
	In its defense bill, the Senate had provided $1.85 billion this  
year, enough to buy six of the planes. But the House deleted the 
money in July, arguing that the plane's computers were not fully 
tested and that the money was needed for other defense programs. 
</P>
<P>
	During weeks of bargaining, the House offered about $1 billion,  
or enough for three or four test fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	House negotiators also offered to support $500 million the  
Senate has approved for construction of a giant LHD-8 transport 
ship at the Ingalls shipyard in Pascagoula, Miss., hometown of 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately learned whether the money for the  
Mississippi ship was included in the agreement. Lott has long 
favored the shipbuilding project, but had been unable to persuade 
the House to go along.

<HEADLINE> 2 Canadian Airlines' Future Weighed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Canada has two major airlines: Canadian Airlines,  
which is going broke, and Air Canada, whose disappointing 
performance has left its stock price languishing. A takeover 
specialist called Onex Corp. says it wants to buy both and turn 
them into a single, profitable company. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Airlines, which says it has only enough cash to keep  
going until next spring, has little choice in the matter. But Air 
Canada, the former national carrier that is now private, believes 
Onex's $4 billion bid is really an American plot -- led by rival 
American Airlines -- to take over the Canadian airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the accusations, the Canadian government worries about  
foreign domination of its skies and consumer advocates wonder if 
anyone cares about how air passengers will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The acrimony began in late August after Toronto-based Onex  
offered $1.2 billion in cash and stock and $2.7 billion in debt 
assumption to take over the Canadian carriers. Air Canada charged 
that the bid was merely a front for an American Airlines, whose 
parent, AMR Corp., is backing Onex. AMR owns 25 percent of Canadian 
and would own 15 percent of the new airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada chief executive officer Robert Milton told Maclean's  
magazine that American Airlines ``is playing a brutal game of 
chicken with Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But AMR chairman Donald Carty said American has no interest in  
running a Canadian airline. What it wants is routes to Asia from 
Vancouver and to Europe from Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the Onex bid, it appeared that Air Canada was sitting  
back and waiting for Canadian to go bust. After its smaller 
competitor failed, Air Canada could pick up the pieces for little 
or nothing. Less than two weeks before Onex made its bid, Air 
Canada offered to buy Canadian's international routes, its most 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian called the offer ``just not acceptable.'' Now, pushed  
by the Onex offer, Air Canada is expected to come up with a 
counterproposal soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada has had problems of its own. Its stock, which traded  
at $5.50 a share after going public in 1988, now hovers in the 
$3.50 to $4 range. The Onex offer has a value of about $5.85 a 
share, although Onex says it really would be $8.25 if stockholders 
accept shares in the new merged airline as partial payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Reid, a professor of business strategy at Queens  
University, says the real issue in the takeover fight is whether 
there should be an airline monopoly in Canada. Travelers want 
convenient departure times and reasonable prices, and for that, 
there must be competition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Monopoly is not good for the traveler,'' he says. ``The  
nationality of ownership isn't important ... it's a question of 
whether there will be competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Hillard, vice president of the Consumers Association of  
Canada, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to see Canadians having to fly from Vancouver to  
Toronto via Chicago just to get a decent fare,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian government has joined in, concerned about who will  
own the country's airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government remains absolutely committed to a  
Canadian-controlled airline industry,'' Transport Minister David 
Collenette said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Harry Gow, president of the lobby group Transport 2000, said  
of the takeover fight, ``this is a case of the chickens jumping 
into the pot and cooking themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``AMR is not something we want to have dominating the Canadian  
market, but they can hardly be blamed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some say that in the larger scheme of things, Canada is a  
battleground for two competing integrated airline networks -- 
American's Oneworld, with partners like Canadian Airlines, Quantas 
of Australia and British Airways and Star Alliance, with United 
Airlines, Air Canada and Germany's Lufthansa. 
</P>
<P>
	These networks allow travelers to accumulate and redeem  
frequent-flyer points on any of the allied airlines. Travelers can 
also buy a ticket through one carrier to the destinations of any of 
its partners, allowing each airline to offer hundreds of 
international destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Onex merger plan, American and Oneworld would come out  
on top, shutting out United and Star Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The main question, however, is whether Canada can support two  
major airlines. Evidence seems to indicate no, but some say 
Canadian Airlines' problems have always been poor management, not 
lack of market. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what solution emerges, it seems certain Canada is  
headed toward an airline monopoly. That, says business professor 
Reid, is going to put heavy pressure on the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``A better way forward, whichever airline becomes the  
monopolist, is to open our skies to competition from any carrier, 
domestic or foreign, that meets Canada's standards for 
airworthiness and safety,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 1,400 Blind Workers May Lose Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When a government agency made a decision that  
would furlough six blind workers, Bob Berrang was caught off-guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The general manager for the Virginia Industries for the Blind  
thought he had landed good jobs for the workers in Franconia, Va., 
as customer service representatives for the General Services 
Administration, the government's purchasing agent and landlord. 
</P>
<P>
	``Six is a lot,'' Berrang said. ``We've been looking for other  
opportunities for those folks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A GSA decision to close eight government supply facilities,  
including the one in Franconia, means more than 1,400 blind workers 
face the same plight, say people who run associations for the 
blind. 
</P>
<P>
	The facilities, which employ the blind and sell products they  
make to federal agencies, will begin to shut down in mid-October as 
the GSA tries to streamline operations. 
</P>
<P>
	GSA Administrator David Barram said Wednesday the impact on the  
blind workers was inadvertent and he promised to implement a plan 
to help organizations that employ blind workers market their 
products to the government through other avenues. 
</P>
<P>
	In line with a 1938 law, the government has long given special  
consideration to organizations that sell products -- of competitive 
price and quality -- made by the blind. The unemployment rate for 
this group is more than 70 percent, say advocates for the blind. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Industries for the Blind -- the umbrella group for  
88 organizations that provide services and jobs to the blind -- has 
been scrambling to find customers for more than $135 million of 
goods normally bought by GSA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our agencies produce everything from (computer) mouse pads to  
mops for staffers in the city to soldiers in Kosovo,'' said the 
group's president, Jim Gibbons. ``We are looking for a plan we can 
wrap our arms around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barram said the GSA had no choice but to change its purchasing  
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commercial and federal market place is changing,'' he said  
in a statement. ``Super stores, e-commerce, Internet buying and the 
government purchase card have revolutionized the way everyone 
buys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Local organizations for the blind are struggling with the  
planned shutdown of the eight GSA facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Rhinesmith, president of York Industries for the Blind in  
Pennsylvania, said he ``saw the writing on the wall'' and began 
looking for other customers four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, at the San Antonio Lighthouse, which employs 120  
blind workers, president Bob Plunkett last week introduced a 
three-day work week and laid off 23 part-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern in San Antonio is not what is being done, but how  
it is being done ... without any real consideration to the impact 
of a small but very important program,'' Plunkett said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Amax Accepts $1.8B Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. accepted a sweetened  
$1.8 billion offer from Phelps Dodge Corp., the nation's largest 
copper producer, ending their six-week takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge said the merger with Cyprus, announced Thursday,  
would create a lower-cost global copper producer and allow the 
companies to integrate operations in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge raised its bid to $19.74 a share from $19.02 to  
persuade Cyprus Amax to abandon its plans to merge with rival 
Asarco Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely pleased that we were able to reach a  
negotiated agreement with Cyprus Amax that is clearly in the best 
interest of both companies,'' said Douglas C. Yearley, Phelps Dodge 
chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge originally made a tandem offer in August to acquire  
Asarco, and also was rebuffed. Yearley said he is still interested 
in acquiring the New York-based copper producer. 
</P>
<P>
	But he now must beat out a higher bid from Mexico's top copper  
producer, Grupo Mexico SA. 
</P>
<P>
	Asarco spokesman Jerry Cooper declined to comment on the Phelps  
Dodge-Cyprus deal, saying only that Asarco intended to explore 
``all alternatives available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge offered $7.61 in cash and 0.2203 of a Phelps Dodge  
share for each Cyprus Amax share. Shareholders of Cyprus Amax will 
have the option of receiving $20.54 a share in cash for their 
stock, or 0.3550 Phelps Dodge shares for each Cyprus Amax share 
they hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect the copper markets will improve in a year or two and  
that means the stock prices for Phelps Dodge will increase,'' said 
John Taraba, a Cyprus vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal could close as early as mid-October.  
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Phelps Dodge fell 25 cents to $55.06 1/4 Thursday on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where shares of Cyprus rose 37 1/2 cents to 
$19.62 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Wilmington, Del., Sues Gun Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Delaware's biggest city on Wednesday  
became the latest municipality in the nation to sue the gun 
industry to recover the costs of dealing with urban shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilmington's lawsuit seeks millions of dollars from 12 gun  
manufacturers and several firearms trade associations. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last three years, gunfire has killed 29 people and  
injured 319 in Wilmington, said Mayor James Sills Jr. City 
officials say the problem is aggravated by drug traffickers who 
make Wilmington a stop between Baltimore and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is similar to ones filed in other cities, including  
New Orleans, Chicago and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Firearms industry representatives say the lawsuits do nothing to  
prevent crime and are aimed at driving gunmakers out of business.

<HEADLINE> Kaiser Labor Dispute Reaches a Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- The labor dispute at Kaiser Aluminum &AMP;  
Chemical Corp. turned a year old on Thursday, with both sides doing 
plenty of talking, but not to each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the United Steelworkers of America scheduled rallies  
at the gates of two Kaiser plants in the Spokane area of 
Washington. They also announced they would escalate their public 
relations war against the nation's fifth largest aluminum maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser President Raymond J. Milchovich, in a full-page ad in The  
Spokesman-Review newspaper, blamed the union for prolonging the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,900 Steelworkers at five Kaiser plants went on  
strike last Sept. 30 in a dispute over wages, benefits and, 
especially, job security. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers later offered to return to work while negotiations  
continued. But on Jan. 14 the company locked them out, saying it 
would be in a weaker negotiating position with disgruntled workers 
in the plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an anniversary that none of us wanted to see,''  
Milchovich wrote. ``Kaiser has offered the Steelworkers Union a 
contract that provides for wage and benefit increases in exchange 
for productivity improvements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the leaders of most major religious groups in  
Eastern Washington released a letter urging the company and union 
to end the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``The human suffering and pain that this situation has caused  
needs to be acknowledged,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	It called on the company to end the lockout and both sides to  
commit to negotiating a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 of the workers operate the two Spokane-area plants.  
The rest work at much smaller operations in Tacoma, Wash., 
Gramercy, La., and Newark, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The five plants have been operating with managers and  
replacement workers since the strike began. There have been 
occasional talks, but no new negotiations are scheduled. Kaiser has 
lost almost $93 million in the three quarters since the dispute 
began. 
</P>
<P>
	In its latest offer, Kaiser proposed pay increases of $3.13 per  
hour over the length of a 5-year contract, plus some benefits 
improvements. The company said base wages for its workers are more 
than $40,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kaiser is also demanding that 700 jobs be eliminated at the  
five plants, which it contends can be accomplished mostly by 
attrition. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also wants 239 jobs currently covered by the  
Steelworkers' contract to be given to nonunion workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelworkers plan to escalate their campaign against Kaiser.  
That will include expanded efforts to end The Boeing Co.'s use of 
Kaiser aluminum produced by replacement workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelworkers have repeatedly implied that the aluminum produced  
by the replacements is of lower quality, but the company and some 
of its customers have denied that.

<HEADLINE> Northern Iowa Star Kicked Off Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR FALLS, Iowa (AP) -- Sean Stackhouse, Northern Iowa's  
leading scorer last year, was kicked off the basketball team 
Thursday after being convicted on felony drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Stackhouse had been suspended since his arrest on March 10, less  
than two weeks after Northern Iowa's 9-18 season ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Stackhouse, a junior college transfer, averaged 16.4 points a  
game for the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Stackhouse, 22, of Chicago, was convicted Wednesday of  
possession of marijuana with the intent to deliver and failure to 
affix a drug tax stamp. Both crimes carry a possible five years in 
prison. Sentencing is scheduled Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had hoped for Sean's return,'' coach Sam Weaver said in a  
statement Thursday. ``But due to his present status and the court's 
decision, we have no choice but to remove him from scholarship and 
dismiss him from the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally feel that Sean is a good young man who made a  
terrible mistake,'' Weaver said. ``He has two supportive parents 
who will help him through this. I hope he can recover from this 
sometime and will be able to go on to a productive life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stackhouse was arrested after a raid on a Cedar Falls home,  
where he was found with packages of marijuana. A plastic bag with 
traces of marijuana also was found in his dormitory room on campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Police searched the home after intercepting a package believed  
to contain marijuana that had been mailed there from New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Stackhouse had waived a jury trial and was found guilty  
Wednesday by District Court Judge James Beeghly.

<HEADLINE> IMF Head Warns Against Complacency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Future global financial crises can be avoided  
if governments show determination to avoid complacency, Michel 
Camdessus, the head of the International Monetary Fund, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be making a grave error if we let the return of  
relative calm in financial markets and the improvement in world 
growth prospects lead us to believe that further reforms are not 
necessary,'' Camdessus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus spoke at the closing session of this year's IMF-World  
Bank meetings a day after President Clinton said the United States 
would forgive all bilateral debt of those poor countries eligible 
for a new $27 billion debt relief initiative launched this week by 
the two organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The world has changed considerably since the IMF-World Bank  
meetings a year ago, when the global financial system was in 
turmoil as a result of the Asian currency crisis, Russia's economic 
collapse and the near failure of a large U.S. hedge fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said governments now are ``obliged to deliver on what  
has been promised ... these steps have created a strong new impetus 
to the war on poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	But Camdessus also said governments must reform the global  
financial system and involve the private sector in preventing and 
resolving crises. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference later, he welcomed the pledge by the Bank  
of Japan that it would provide sufficient cash to keep the 
country's fragile recovery going. 
</P>
<P>
	He said intervention by the Group of Seven industrialized  
countries to curb the rise of the yen against the dollar should 
only be an option of ``last resort, providing ample liquidity 
materializes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus also repeated there was ``no evidence of the theft of  
any IMF money provided to Russia.'' He said earlier it would be 
irresponsible for the international community to turn its back on 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus also brushed aside speculation he may be considering  
resigning before the end of his record-breaking third five-year 
term of office in 2002, saying, ``I enjoy my job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate announcement, the IMF said its board has approved  
a plan for a one-time off-market sale of up to 14 million ounces of 
gold to finance the debt relief initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan calls for the IMF to sell gold at market prices to some  
central banks of member countries which owe the fund money ``on the 
understanding that these central banks will use the gold to make 
the repayment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	World Bank President James Wolfensohn said he hoped Congress  
would approve President Clinton's debt relief pledge and that other 
countries would follow the U.S. example. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made U.S. debt forgiveness for 36 poor countries, mostly  
in sub-Sahara Africa, contingent on their using the money saved for 
health care, education and other basic human needs. 
</P>
<P>
	He told finance ministers and central bank governors from 182  
nations the United States could not ask these countries to choose 
between making interest payments and investing in their children's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am directing my administration to make it possible to  
forgive 100 percent of the debt these countries owe to the United 
States, when needed to help them finance basic human needs and when 
the money will be used to do so,'' Clinton said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for the poor nations said Clinton's announcement would  
put pressure on the other industrialized nations to offer 100 
percent debt relief. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's offer came on the last full day of the annual  
meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton urged Congress to see to it that America does its part  
in helping fund the initiative by approving the $970 million he 
requested last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have asked for the money and shown how it would be paid  
for,'' Clinton said in a remark that was greeted by applause, ``and 
I ask the Congress to keep our country shouldering its fair share 
of the burden.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. write-off mostly will benefit countries in sub-Sahara  
Africa that owe huge amounts of money but have few exports to 
offset their debt payments, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers 
said.

<HEADLINE>  MLS' Revolution Fires Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Coach Walter Zenga was fired Thursday by  
the New England Revolution with two games left in the regular 
season. He was replaced by Steve Nicol, who coached the Boston 
Bulldogs of the A League in Framingham. 
</P>
<P>
	Zenga, who took over as player-coach with six games left last  
season, led the Revolution to a 10-20-4 record this year. With two 
games left, New England trails Miami by one point for the last 
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Zenga has a 5-13 record as 
a goalkeeper and will not continue as a player with the Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Brian O'Donovan said Zenga didn't want to wait  
until the end of the season to discuss a contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``He also indicated to us that he had other options in Italy and  
needed to explore them immediately,'' O'Donovan said in a team 
statement. ``We received (Wednesday) a written ultimatum insisting 
that the team reach a decision. We would have preferred to evaluate 
fully the situation during the offseason and make our decision 
then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zenga, 39, named the world's best goalkeeper after the 1990  
World Cup, played that position for the Revolution in 1997. He then 
retired from the team and returned to Italy.

<HEADLINE> Former First Lady on Campaign Trail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Barbara Bush isn't satisfied that ``one  
out of every eight Americans is governed by a Bush.'' She wants to 
make that all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The former first lady said Thursday that she was delighted to be  
back on the campaign trail, this time on behalf of her oldest son, 
George W. Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner. ``I love 
the candidate,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bush spoke at a $100-a-plate lunch that aides said was her  
first public appearance on behalf of her son's presidential 
campaign. Coupled with a $1,000 per person reception, she raised 
$100,000 for the Bush campaign, which reported Thursday that it had 
collected more than $56 million thus far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The matron of a political dynasty, Mrs. Bush noted that her sons  
govern the second- and fourth-largest states in the nation and are 
striving to move higher as Bush, the Texas governor, seeks the 
Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``One out of every eight Americans is governed by a Bush,'' Mrs.  
Bush said. ``With your help, we'll make that all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's brother Jeb Bush is governor of Florida.  
</P>
<P>
	Former President Bush will be in Iowa next week campaigning for  
his son, but Eric Woolson, a campaign spokesman, said there are no 
plans to have mom and dad campaign extensively. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect we'll probably see them back in the state before the  
caucuses, but we don't anticipate they'll be doing very much,'' 
Woolson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting briefly with reporters, Mrs. Bush dismissed suggestions  
of improper behavior in her son's personal life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't bother me, because there's nothing wrong with his  
personal life at all, so it doesn't bother me,'' Mrs. Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has admitted to irresponsible behavior as a young man, but  
has not detailed that action. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has campaigned less extensively in the state than some of  
his rivals, but he has a host of big-name backers to fill in for 
him and Mrs. Bush drew a crowd of several hundred to the luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has other things to do and I was out in this part of the  
world,'' Mrs. Bush said when a reporter asked why she was 
campaigning instead of her son. 
</P>
<P>
	During her speech, Mrs. Bush recounted her history of  
campaigning in Iowa dating back to 1979, when her husband 
unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``If his father and I had had crowds like this, our life would  
have been considerably easier,'' Mrs. Bush said. The former 
president was ousted by Bill Clinton in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	While her campaign time will be limited, Mrs. Bush said she'll  
do her part to help her son become the next president. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's overwhelming to a mother to even say those words,'' Mrs.  
Bush said.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Defaults on $6B Brady Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Creditors faced a decision on whether to press  
Ecuador for full payment of its $6 billion debt after the South 
American country became the first ever to default on its 
U.S.-guaranteed ``Brady bonds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brady bonds, named after former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas  
Brady, were created to resolve the Latin American debt crisis of 
the 1980s. They are partly backed by U.S. Treasury securities. 
Though other nations have restructured their payments, no country 
before Ecuador has ever defaulted. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure to make a $98 million interest payment on Thursday  
had been expected for weeks and should have little short-term 
impact, said Ramon Aracena, an economist with the Institute of 
International Finance in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, however, it could make borrowing harder for other  
developing countries as investors perceive them as being on riskier 
financial ground. Ecuador's prospects for long-term growth could be 
damaged as well, because having assets seized overseas to pay the 
debt would leave the government fewer resources to create jobs, 
Aracena said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Chase Manhattan Corp., which has acted as an  
agent for creditors, counted votes Thursday on whether investors 
should press for full repayment or allow a financial restructuring. 
Chase said the voting was to continue Friday because neither camp 
had the required votes needed to decide a course of action. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were some hopeful developments.  
</P>
<P>
	At the country's capital of Quito, President Jamil Mahuad said  
Thursday that his government had signed a letter of intent with the 
International Monetary Fund for a $400 million loan that could lead 
to $1.3 billion in overall international aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador is laboring under its worst economic crisis in 70 years,  
and the South American nation of 12 million people has so far been 
unable to come up with the $98 million interest payment that was 
due Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Mahuad said Ecuador would take advantage of a grace  
period, deferring the interest payment until Thursday and buying 
time to build consensus for restructuring. The deadline passed 
Thursday without the payment. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF officials urged Ecuador to develop a new economic strategy  
and reach a comprehensive accord with creditors before collecting 
the 18-month $400 million credit. The deal hinges on Ecuador 
passing austerity measures and tax increases that most lawmakers 
there oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at United Nations headquarters in New York, Ecuador's  
foreign affairs minister said repairing damage from last year's 
widespread flooding, coupled with the economic hardship of 
declining oil prices -- the nation's primary export -- made it 
difficult for Ecuador to meet its loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Benjamin Ortiz Brennan told the assembly  
Ecuador ``is preparing to commence a process of restructuring these 
obligations that will enable it to share, in a more equal way, the 
debt load among all the actors of this financial relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not provide details, and no one from the Ecuador Mission  
immediately returned phone calls seeking explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem of restructuring is complicated because no  
individual or institutional investor holds a majority of Ecuador's 
Brady bonds, and there appeared to be no coordinated group for 
Ecuadorian officials to negotiate with. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like the old days when the banks made the loans,''  
said Andrew Tuck, of Chase, the acting fiscal agent between Ecuador 
and its Brady investors. ``We live in a different world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuck said investors began faxing instructions to Chase weeks  
ago, indicating whether they favored accelerating Ecuador's debt 
payments -- in effect calling in the loan for full or partial 
payment immediately -- or seizing a portion of the country's 
collateral to make payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Ecuador's total public debt is $13 billion -- expected to  
top 117 percent of the country's gross domestic product by Dec. 31 
-- President Mahuad has said he would limit the debt restructuring 
to Brady bonds.

<HEADLINE> Stolen Camera Shows Attack Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A man who allegedly videotaped himself wearing  
a diaper and molesting a 4-year-old girl was arrested after his 
camcorder was stolen and re-sold with the tape still inside. 
</P>
<P>
	William Hampton, 44, was charged with sodomy and using a child  
for a sexual performance. Hampton, who's being held on $200,000 
bail, also faces a federal count of producing child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say the 15-minute tape was found in the camera stolen  
from Hampton's St. Louis home earlier this month. The camera's 
buyer contacted police, and it was linked to a 17-year-old burglar 
whose mother had sold it for $150. 
</P>
<P>
	The thief, whose name wasn't released, was arrested Sept. 22 on  
unrelated burglary charges. He told police he stole the camcorder 
about a week before his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Mary Warnecke, commander of the St. Louis Police  
Department's sex crimes and child abuse unit, said the girl on the 
tape is the daughter of one of Hampton's former girlfriends. 
Hampton had custody of the girl one day a week for more than a 
year, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe his role was to be a fatherly figure to the girl,''  
Warnecke said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the tape apparently was made in Hampton's  
home within the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl remains in her mother's care and is expected to receive  
counseling. Police said the mother had been unaware of the sex acts 
or the taping.

<HEADLINE> Protest Outside Clinton's New Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) -- As some neighbors cringed, two dozen  
candle-carrying protesters marched at the house President Clinton 
wants to buy in a protest seeking stronger U.S. action in East 
Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the protesters, who sang quietly, the demonstration  
Wednesday night drew reporters, photographers and TV trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be 30 times worse when they move here,''  
said Ken Kosyk, an investment counselor who lives on the next 
block. ``It's aggravating to the town as a whole. But what can you 
do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton have agreed  
to buy a $1.7 million house in the town, which would satisfy New 
York's residency requirement should Mrs. Clinton decide, as 
expected, to run for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Westchester People's Action Coalition figured a protest at  
Clinton's future home would attract his attention, demonstrators 
said. The group wants Clinton to take stronger action to prevent 
killings of independence-minded East Timorese. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping to get him interested,'' said Vincent Romano, who  
was holding up one corner of a mock coffin. Police kept the 
protesters behind a barricade. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House had no comment.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid Might Sale PCS Health Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a bid to stem rising debt, Rite Aid Corp. is  
considering the sale of part of its PCS Health Systems division, 
just eight months after buying the pharmacy benefits manager for 
$1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has received unsolicited offers for PCS that value  
the division at more than $1.5 billion and may be willing to sell 
part of the operation, Rite Aid spokeswoman Karen Rugen said 
Thursday, confirming a report in The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	But, she added, ``we are not actively looking for a buyer for  
PCS,'' and the company would be careful not to sell any part of the 
division that benefits Rite Aid's core, retail drug business. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid chief executive Martin Grass disclosed the plans in an  
impromptu conference call with securities analysts Wednesday, the 
Journal reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The call, held after the close of the markets, was meant to  
reassure investors about the Camp Hill, Pa.-based company's 
prospects amid rising debt and mixed sales results released earlier 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal in the near future is to de-leverage the company and  
focus on cash generation going forward,'' he said. ``We have the 
ability to meet all our scheduled obligations going forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid's debt has risen to $5.1 billion from $3.6 billion a  
year ago, mostly because of the PCS purchase from Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., 
the Journal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass said Rite Aid has received ``unsolicited offers'' for PCS  
that value the company at more than $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid, the nation's No. 3 drugstore chain, reported that  
sales at stores open a year or longer, rose 8.3 percent in 
September, and prescription sales growth was up 16.7 percent. But 
other merchandise, so-called front-end sales, fell 2 percent in the 
four weeks ended Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid's stock rose 56 1/4 cents per share to $13.18 3/4, or 3.3  
percent, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass also said the company plans to sell 250 of its  
poorer-performing Western stores. It recently agreed to sell 38 of 
those stores in California for $186 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is talking to six potential buyers, which he didn't  
identify.

<HEADLINE> Bills and Marino Butt Heads Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- There's one thing the Buffalo Bills  
can always count on when they play Miami: Dan Marino will be there 
to make their lives miserable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills have handled Marino better than any AFC East rival  
over the years, but Miami has won five straight at home against the 
Bills, including in last season's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time you play Miami, you think of Dan Marino,'' Bills  
cornerback Ken Irvin said. ``A lot of teams prepare their game plan 
around him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of Buffalo's plan for Monday night's game in Miami  
apparently involves a pre-emptive strike of kindness. That's 
because Pat Bowlen lit a fire under Marino before the season when 
the Broncos owner said, ``Dan Marino, if he isn't on his last legs, 
he's very close to being on his last legs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big mistake. The Bills won't go there, but they won't back off.  
``He's the greatest still playing,'' defensive end Marcellus Wiley 
said. ``But we're coming. We have something to prove -- that we're 
also one of the elite teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins quarterback, 38, occupies 46 pages of the team  
media guide and a prominent place in the minds of Buffalo 
defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quick release, hasn't been sacked,'' Wiley said. ``I heard  
he's chasing a ring this year. Looks good on film. His presence 
alone is enough to inspire a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino is especially tough at home, but he proved he can win  
anywhere when he steered the Dolphins to a stunning 38-21 victory 
over the defending Super Bowl champion Broncos at Mile High Stadium 
in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino is 13-16 against Buffalo without the luxury of a  
consistent running game. Marino has completed 62 percent of his 
career passes against the Bills for 7,302 yards and 49 touchdowns 
with 33 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 17th season, Marino has thrown for more yards -- 59,349,  
including this season's 436 -- than anyone in NFL history. He's 
thrown more passes (8,047) for more completions (4,799) and more 
touchdowns (411) with more interceptions (237) than anyone, and is 
the fifth-ranked passer in the AFC this season. He's thrown to Mark 
Clayton, Mark Duper and Nat Moore; he's still throwing to O.J. 
McDuffie, who led the league in receptions with 90 last year and 
now leads Miami with eight. 
</P>
<P>
	``He throws the ball as well as anybody ever has in this game,''  
said Bills quarterback Doug Flutie, who is 3-1 in NFL starts 
against Marino and whose Boston College Eagles narrowly lost to 
Marino's No. 2 Pittsburgh Panthers in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino's best deep threat is Tony Martin, averaging 22 yards per  
catch. ``Tony and Dan are just now getting on the same page, 
because (Martin) missed a lot of training camp,'' Miami coach Jimmy 
Johnson said. ``Tony made some big plays for us in the opening game 
against Denver. He's extremely smooth, he catches the ball 
extremely well, and we've got to get the ball in his hands more 
than we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mmiami's offense is improved over last season. It's deeper,  
faster, better-balanced. Marino still makes it go. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you have Dan Marino, you have a ready-made offense,''  
Bills coach Wade Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has done everything he can to wean his Dolphins off an  
over-reliance on Marino. The Dolphins averaged 3.4 yards per carry 
last year, worst in the NFL, and sputtered in short-yardage 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
	They know they have to pick up the running game to complement  
the pass, but injuries have made things tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were making some progress last year,'' said Johnson, who  
lost left tackle Richmond Webb, LG Mark Dixon and RG Kevin 
Donnalley. ``Once those three got banged up from about midseason 
on, we went back to our security blanket of Dan throwing the 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	``When that happens, you don't have the consistency, you start  
to turn the ball over more and you have some problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Kevin Gogan and tight end Hunter Goodwin have provided  
depth, and the Dolphins have run the ball six more times than they 
have thrown it, but with little success: Miami is averaging 3 yards 
per carry. 
</P>
<P>
	Believe it or not, that could be bad news for the Bills.  
</P>
<P>
	``Problem is, if you stop the running game you force Dan Marino  
to throw,'' Phillips said.

<HEADLINE> Some Unhappy With Anthrax Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top military commanders told Congress today  
that the mandatory program to inoculate soldiers with an anthrax 
vaccine is imperative because several nations are developing the 
biological weapon for use in battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen last year ordered all 2.4  
million active duty and reserve troops to get the anthrax vaccine 
as protection against biological warfare. Some 340,000 service 
members have been immunized so far. 
</P>
<P>
	About 220 troops have refused to take it because of questions  
about its safety and efficacy. Symptoms reported after the shots 
have included fever, dizziness, blackouts and joint and muscle 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 10 countries in this world that have already taken  
the steps to put anthrax in a bomb or a missile,'' Deputy Defense 
Secretary John Hamre testified before the House Armed Services 
personnel subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamre singled out Iraq as posing a potential threat, saying in  
1997 the military received evidence that Iraq had weapons 
containing anthrax. ``We have got absolute, incontrovertible 
evidence we have this threat,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamre and Gen. Anthony Zinni, who leads U.S. forces in the  
Persian Gulf region, said troops at risk must be vaccinated or they 
would die if exposed to the biological weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't send them into combat without bullets... and we're  
not going to send them into combat without protection against an 
agent we know they will use against us to kill our troops,'' Hamre 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing was the second in as many days as House lawmakers  
questioned military officials about the safety and effectiveness of 
the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense officials and the Army surgeon general repeatedly said  
the vaccine was safe. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, some National Guard and reserve troops told  
lawmakers at a separate hearing that questions about the safety of 
the inoculations could push pilots and other reservists to leave 
the military. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dread and the fear is out there on the flight line. People  
are afraid. They're angry,'' Lt. Col. Thomas Heemstra, a pilot with 
the Indiana Air National Guard, told the Government Reform national 
security subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel uncomfortable with the vaccine,'' said Maj. Cheryl  
Hansen, an Air Force Reserves nurse based in Pennsylvania. ``We're 
faced with either resigning or taking the vaccine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House panels also released Defense Department data  
indicating that 32,681 reserve and National Guard members had 
received one or more shots of the vaccine, but almost half had not 
received follow-up shots on time. In some cases, entire units had 
missed the schedule by a month or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Chris Shays, R-Conn., chairman of the national security  
subcommittee, said that was troubling in light of a Defense 
Department policy document that says any deviation from the 
FDA-approved six-shot regime over 18 months meant officials were 
``less certain'' of ``the protective effect on humans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Charles Cragin, a deputy assistant defense secretary, told  
lawmakers that most reservists and National Guard members were 
listed as overdue for shots because there was a delay in entering 
the data into a central computer system. He also said the number of 
reserve and guard members receiving shots was closer to 27,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the overdues are a result of delayed reporting rather  
than lack of timeliness for the shots,'' Cragin testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Shays responded: ``Either ... (the data system) is inaccurate or  
compliance with the FDA-prescribed shot regimen in reserve 
component units is routinely failing. In either event, the program 
has a serious problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers also tried to reconcile the assurances of military  
officials that the vaccine program was safe and successful with 
anecdotal reports from reservists who said morale was plummeting 
and colleagues would resign rather than take the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the total U.S. military force are National Guard and  
reserve troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Heemstra, an airline pilot who was recently asked to resign as  
an F-16 squadron commander after refusing to take his first shot, 
predicted his squadron would lose 50 percent of its pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the guinea pigs,'' Heemstra said. ``It's a serious  
safety issue. People are sick.''

<HEADLINE> Pistons Center Reportedly To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS (AP) -- Detroit center Bison Dele has reportedly  
told the Pistons he plans to retire, although his agent said the 
decision could change after Dele returns to the United States in 
about 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going through an epiphanal moment in his life,'' agent  
Dwight Manley said. ``We'll sit down with the team when he gets 
back and we'll discuss everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dele, 30, told the Pistons of his intentions this week and has  
resisted management's efforts to persuade him to return, The 
Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me that he was tired and his heart was not in it,''  
Joe Dumars, Pistons director of player of personnel, told the News. 
``He said he did not have the motivation to keep on playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dele was in the Middle East, Manley told The Associated Press,  
and could not be reached for comment. Pistons spokesman J.J. Carter 
said he did not know of Dele's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously with Bison, anything can happen, and we are very  
hopeful that he shows up,'' coach Alvin Gentry told the News. ``We 
hope he comes to camp, and we would welcome him with open arms. He 
is a very integral part of this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pistons players are scheduled to report to training camp Monday;  
the first practices will be Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dele, a 6-foot-11 center, was about to begin his third season in  
Detroit. He stands to walk away from about $30 million, with five 
years left on a contract that called for him to receive $45 million 
for seven seasons. He was the team's highest-paid player. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pistons now could begin training camp without a starting  
center. For now, they will use Terry Mills, Christian Laettner or 
Eric Montross. 
</P>
<P>
	Dele spent two seasons in Detroit after signing as a free agent,  
and his relationship with his teammates was known to be strained. 
Dele's name came up frequently in trade rumors over the summer, 
although Manley acknowledged that there has been little interest 
from other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	When the team signed Michael Curry as a free agent in August, he  
came to Dele's defense at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be the first to say that Bison Dele is not a  
scapegoat for this team,'' Curry said. ``I felt in the last couple 
of years, because of what the team accomplished before he got here 
and with his salary, I think that he has been used as a scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bison is just like another member of this team -- we need him  
to play and play hard. He's going to have his ups and downs just 
like everybody else, but he is part of our family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after joining the Pistons, Dele admitted his passion for  
basketball was not the greatest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never really had the kind of passion for basketball that my  
dad had for music,'' said Dele, whose father was a member of the 
Platters. ``If I had the same kind of passion for basketball as my 
dad had for music, I probably would be a better player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dele came to the Pistons after playing nine regular-season games  
and in the playoffs for the Chicago Bulls during their fifth 
championship season. 
</P>
<P>
	In Detroit, Dele averaged 10.5 points and 6.2 rebounds last  
season, 16.2 points and 8.9 rebounds the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Before last season, Dele changed his name from Brian Williams,  
saying he made the switch after studying his family's roots.

<HEADLINE> Spielberg Among Arts Honorees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Aretha Franklin, Steven Spielberg and  
August Wilson passed through a White House receiving line, 
President Clinton was overheard telling one guest, ``If I could 
make Keillor laugh, I knew that I had achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humorist Garrison Keillor, director Spielberg, soul diva  
Franklin, playwright Wilson, and 14 others, as well as the 
Juilliard School for the performing arts, were awarded national 
arts and humanities medals Wednesday, chosen by the White House as 
American cultural treasures. 
</P>
<P>
	The medals go to individuals or institutions supporting the  
growth and availability of the arts and humanities to the general 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives America a chance to recognize our sons and daughters  
who have enriched our lives, made us laugh, made us think, made us 
cry, lifted us up when we were down,'' Clinton said at a White 
House dinner honoring the medal winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Clinton referred to Keillor -- a writer and  
radio impresario best known for his public radio show, ``A Prairie 
Home Companion'' -- as ``our modern-day Mark Twain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``With imagination, wit and also with a steel trap mind and deep  
conviction, Garrison Keillor has brought us together,'' said the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Keillor's humor and variety show about life in a  
fictitious small town in Minnesota ``constantly reminds us how 
we're all connected and how it ought to keep us a little humble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a ceremony at Constitution Hall near the White House, Clinton  
said this year's winners of the National Medal of Arts and the 
National Humanities Medal ``defined in their own unique ways a part 
of who we are as a people and what we're about as a nation as we 
enter a new century and a new millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Indian ballet dancer Maria Tallchief and folk singer  
Odetta were among the musicians, writers and arts patrons so 
honored this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Odetta's 50 years of performing American folk and gospel reminds  
``us all that songs have the power to change the heart and change 
the world,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tallchief helped put an American stamp on classical ballet,  
until recent decades a primarily European discipline, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 winners of the National Medal of the Arts are:  
</P>
<P>
	--Arts patron Irene Diamond, who gave more than $73 million to  
the arts through foundations and personal gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	--Franklin, the ``Queen of Soul'' who has won 17 Grammys.  
</P>
<P>
	--Designer and architect Michael Graves, who created some of  
century's most admired structures, including the Riverbend Music 
Center in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	--Odetta, the ``Queen of American Folk Music,'' who created a  
groundbreaking sound with her voice and guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Juilliard School of performing arts in New York, which  
includes among its alumni comedian-actor Robin Williams, cellist 
Yo-Yo Ma and jazz and classical trumpeter and composer Wynton 
Marsalis. 
</P>
<P>
	--Writer and director Norman Lear, who created some of the most  
popular television social comedies, including ``All in the 
Family,'' ``Good Times'' and ``The Jeffersons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Actress and producer Rosetta LeNoire, who boasts a more than  
60-year career that includes numerous movies, Broadway productions 
and TV shows, including ``Family Matters'' and ``Amen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Arts administrator Harvey Lichtenstein, who was president of  
the Brooklyn Academy of Music for 32 years and established it as a 
leading arts center. 
</P>
<P>
	--Singer Lydia Mendoza, who brought Mexican-American music to the  
public's attention and became famous in Latin America with her 
signature song, ``Mal Hombre.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Sculptor George Segal, who made a career of sculpting  
environments, including a life-sized bread line at the Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	--Tallchief, who was the New York City Ballet's longtime prima  
ballerina. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 winners of the National Humanities Medals are:  
</P>
<P>
	--Librarian Patricia M. Battin, who organized a national campaign  
to save millions of decaying books by putting their content on 
microfilm. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and journalist Taylor Branch,  
whose books, including ``Parting the Waters: America in the King 
Years,'' made him an authority on the civil rights movement. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mexico Governor Supports Drug Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Gov. Gary Johnson has taken his  
controversial stance on drugs a step further by announcing that he 
supports the legalization of substances such as marijuana and 
heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am advocating that I think legalization is a viable  
alternative to what we are now doing,'' the Republican said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he had no plans to propose legislation to make  
drugs legal in New Mexico, but said he personally supported 
legalization as a national policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor, who has acknowledged using marijuana and cocaine  
in the 1970s, is an avid athlete who doesn't drink alcohol or use 
drugs. He contends the national war against drugs has failed to 
stop the flow or use of drugs and it consumes too much money that 
could be better used to stop violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the highest ranking elected official to promote drug  
legalization. 
</P>
<P>
	In the upcoming issue of Playboy magazine, Minnesota Gov. Jesse  
Ventura recommends the less drastic approach of decriminalization. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prohibition of drugs causes crime. You don't have to  
legalize it, just decriminalize it. Regulate it. Create places 
where the addict can go get it,'' he told the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Johnson stopped short of advocating legalization  
and instead focused on decriminalization. That would treat drug 
possession much like a traffic violation and make it punishable by 
a small fine. 
</P>
<P>
	But Johnson now says decriminalization would not eliminate the  
black market economy of drug trafficking. Legalization would allow 
governments to regulate, tax and control drugs, much like alcohol 
and tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson expressed support for legalizing marijuana and heroin.  
He said he didn't know enough about the potential long-term effects 
of other illegal drugs, such as cocaine, to advocate their 
legalization. He said many health problems involving heroin abuse 
stem from dirty needles rather than the drug itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's latest position stirred new criticism from some  
Republicans, who say he is going against the party's national 
platform that backs strong criminal penalties for drug-related 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the next thing he'll do is be bold enough to smoke a  
joint on TV,'' said Republican state Sen. Billy McKibben. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a spokesman for the Office of National Drug Control  
Policy described the New Mexico governor as the ``poster child for 
the drug legalization movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is barred from seeking a third consecutive term in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Consolidated Papers Avert Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WISCONSIN RAPIDS, Wis. (AP) -- Members of unions representing  
about 2,800 paperworkers at Consolidated Papers Inc. ratified a 
six-year contract Thursday, averting a strike that had been 
authorized for Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders said 93 percent of the membership voted, and 77  
percent of those voted to ratify the pact, which includes wage 
increases of 3 percent each year. 
</P>
<P>
	With the first raise, the average wage will be $17.29 an hour,  
said Leon Towne, vice president and Region 10 director for the 
Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy (PACE) Workers' 
International Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The papermakers at several Consolidated Papers plants in central  
Wisconsin rejected the company's first contract offer three weeks 
ago, leading to talks this week that involved a federal mediator. 
The old contract expired last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The stumbling block had been the fringe benefits package, Towne  
said. The company's latest offer included some ``structural 
changes'' in the health benefits package that made it better for 
workers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of five locals voting on the new contract had  
recommended approval of the contract, Towne said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good wage and benefit package,'' he said. ``Within  
the industry, it is a good offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Steele, a Consolidated Papers vice president who negotiated  
the deal, said the company was pleased to have resolved the issues 
that blocked earlier proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have consistently believed that a strike would have been a  
`lose-lose' situation, damaging to both the company and to union 
members,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The papermakers is the largest union at the company. A strike  
would have been the first by the papermakers union since 1957 and 
first major strike at the company since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	Consolidated Papers is North America's largest producer of  
coated printing papers and a major manufacturer of specialty papers 
for the printing and publishing industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The company employs about 6,800 workers. Labor contracts with  
four other unions also have expired, said Tim Laatsch, a 
Consolidated Papers spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Consolidated Papers earned $102.4 million on sales of $2 billion  
in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Schwarzenegger Has Mulled Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- First Warren Beatty, now Arnold  
Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
	As rumors swirl that the liberal Beatty may run for president,  
Schwarzenegger, a Republican, says he has thought ``many times'' 
about seeking office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The possibility is there because I feel it inside,'' the  
Kennedy in-law said in an interview in the November issue of Talk 
magazine. ``I feel there are a lot of people in politics that are 
standing still and not doing enough. And there's a vacuum -- 
therefore, I can move in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not right now, apparently.  
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' the actor's spokeswoman, Catherine Olim, said Thursday.  
``He is not thinking about running for office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One possibility for the ``Terminator'' star and husband of Maria  
Shriver is the California governorship, which is up for grabs in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidency is out, though. The Austrian-born Schwarzenegger  
is a U.S. citizen, but only natural-born citizens are eligible 
under the Constitution.

<HEADLINE> `Save the Grizzlies' Campaign Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- A group of prominent  
officials led by former mayor Art Phillips unveiled a `We Love Our 
Grizzlies' campaign Thursday in response to continued speculation 
that new owner Bill Laurie was prepared to move the franchise to 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a basketball fan. I really felt sick (when the Grizzlies  
were sold). If the team left, I couldn't cheer for the St. Louis 
Grizzlies,'' Phillips said. ``If you're a basketball fan, you go 
out there and buy tickets. That's the only way we're going to keep 
basketball in this town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group wants to generate sustained interest in the team by  
inspiring more ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie, married to Wal-Mart fortune heir Nancy Laurie, purchased  
the Grizzlies for $200 million a week ago. He also recently bought 
the NHL St. Louis Blues and the downtown St. Louis Kiel Center 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference announcing the purchase, Laurie repeatedly  
said he had ``no current plan to move the Grizzlies,'' but that 
left many Vancouverites skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the day of the sale as ``Black Thursday,'' Phillips  
said it was imperative that Grizzlies fans rally behind the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first message we want to get out to people is it's not  
inevitable (the team will move). And the second is that they can do 
something about it,'' said Phillips, a devout Grizzlies fan who 
served a four-year term as Vancouver mayor in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea what the odds are. I know that we could win, I  
know we could lose. But I sure as hell don't want to walk away from 
this and just quit because there's a chance of losing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Grizzlies drew an average 16,725 last season, their  
season-ticket sales have reportedly dropped dramatically. The team 
won't release how many season-ticket subscribers remain after 
surpassing the NBA-required 12,500 in its expansion year. 
</P>
<P>
	Current Vancouver mayor Phillip Owen was on hand to offer the  
city's moral support. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on hand at the news conference was former Grizzlies owner  
Arthur Griffiths, who brought the team to Vancouver in 1995 before 
eventually selling his share to John McCaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an element of the business community and the fans on  
the street that are of the view that this franchise is important to 
them,'' said Griffiths. ``I'm here as a fan.''

<HEADLINE> Mass. Court: Student Can Sue School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In a case that could affect disciplinary decisions  
at private colleges nationwide, Massachusetts' appeals court ruled 
Thursday that a former Brandeis University student accused of rape 
should be allowed to sue the school for suspending him. 
</P>
<P>
	David Arlen Schaer was a 20-year-old junior when a female  
student accused him of raping her in February 1996 in her dorm 
room. She complained to school officials about a month later, and 
Schaer was brought before a disciplinary board of six students and 
two faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
	He claimed they engaged in consensual sex; she claimed she was  
raped. Schaer was never charged criminally. 
</P>
<P>
	The disciplinary panel found he committed the violations  
charged, and suspended him from campus between May and August of 
that year. The suspension prohibited him from working on a 
biomedical research project at a Brandeis lab that summer. 
</P>
<P>
	When a campus appeal failed, Schaer sued the school and  
administrators for compensatory damages. A judge dismissed the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	The appellate court, however, ruled Thursday that the case  
should not have been tossed aside. 
</P>
<P>
	The court questioned the validity of the campus disciplinary  
hearing, saying some of the testimony would never have been allowed 
in a court of law. 
</P>
<P>
	As an example, the court cited the testimony of a campus police  
officer who said when she saw the female student one month after 
the encounter: ``She looked like a rape victim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not apparent ``on what possible basis a police officer  
could know such a thing,'' the court wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Another witness testified that Schaer was a ``self-motivated  
egotistical bastard who had no respect for women,'' something the 
court said was ``without rudimentary foundation'' and ``unfairly 
prejudicial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Lipton, Schaer's attorney, said colleges need to take a  
closer look at the way they discipline students. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should understand the gravity, the really serious impact  
this kind of process has on people, and how it can ruin their 
lives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaer graduated from Brandeis in 1997 and is now pursuing  
graduate work in biology. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandeis officials declined to comment on the case, but  
spokesman Dennis Nealon said the university does not take 
disciplinary cases lightly. ``Officials here go to great lengths to 
let students know from the very first day what is and what is not 
acceptable behavior,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court decision will affect private colleges  
everywhere, said Harvey Silverglate, a defense attorney and 
co-author of ``The Shadow University: The Betrayal of Liberty on 
America's Campuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Private colleges have generally gone on the assumption that  
they can do whatever they want,'' Silverglate said. ``Courts look 
at these on a case-by-case basis and usually private colleges get 
away with all kinds of outrageous conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In many instances, Silverglate said, students accused of a crime  
on campus would be better off if they were prosecuted in court. At 
least then, he said, due process would be assured.

<HEADLINE> High Camp, Low Humor in 'Epic' Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                     *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Holy Nebuchadnezzar! ``Epic Proportions'' is a  
high-camp, neo-biblical sitcom, a show that would fit nicely on 
Carol Burnett's old TV program as a 15-minute sketch. 
</P>
<P>
	On Broadway, and at an hour and a half, the play falters. This  
happens despite an accomplished crew of comics, including the 
delicious Kristin Chenoweth, and some genuinely funny moments that 
make you wish the evening were better than it actually is. 
</P>
<P>
	``Epic Proportions,'' which opened Thursday at the Helen Hayes  
Theater, feels inflated and overbuilt. Co-authors David Crane and 
Larry Coen pile joke upon joke -- about the Red Sea, camels, Moses, 
Caesar, the plagues of Egypt, etc. -- whether they are funny or not. 
</P>
<P>
	The playwrights have set the comedy in the 1930s during the  
making of a big-budget biblical movie, not unlike the films churned 
out by legendary mogul Cecil B. DeMille. 
</P>
<P>
	Louise Goldman, their peppy heroine (played by Chenoweth), is  
the motion picture's ``atmosphere personnel director,'' in charge 
of the epic's 4,000 extras. Among the teeming thousands are two 
brothers, Benny and Phil. Each falls in love with the lass -- and a 
triangle develops as disasters hamper the making of this 
sword-and-sandal drama. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds promising. There are even hints of sweetness that should  
have found its way into the show. They never quite surface in this 
relentless production that Jerry Zaks has directed with whip in 
hand. It moves at a furious pace, afraid to stop and let the 
characters and the plot breathe. 
</P>
<P>
	This puts a strain on the actors, but they handle it admirably.  
Chenoweth excels at playing comic determination as anyone knows who 
saw her Tony-winning performance as Sally in last season's revival 
of ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.'' She is in full command 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Tudyk (the blond) and Jeremy Davidson (the one with the  
brown hair) make an appealing pair of battling brothers. Ruth 
Williamson, a queen of deadpan comedy, delivers in a variety of 
roles, most hilariously as a cigarette-smoking Cleopatra who has 
trouble dealing with that darn asp. And Richard B. Shull, who has a 
great craggy, comic face, gets giggles as the DeMille-like 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	David Gallo has designed a bright, colorful setting, vaguely  
suggesting a desert that owes more to a Hollywood back lot than to 
the Sinai Peninsula. Much of it is filled by a wide staircase 
eerily reminiscent of the set for the disastrous musical version of 
``Carrie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Epic Proportions'' is too slight an evening for Broadway,  
especially at a $65 top ticket price. As the evening grinds away, 
this ``Epic'' looks smaller and smaller.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Buchanan Having Tough Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- A silver-studded, black-leather dog collar  
hangs in Ray Buchanan's locker, a reminder of better times for the 
Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, ``Big Play Ray'' keeps winding up on the wrong side  
of his nickname. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFC champions are winless after three games, and Buchanan, a  
Pro Bowler who led the team with seven interceptions in 1998, has 
been burned on three touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the bad stuff comes, some guys fold real quick,'' said  
Buchanan, who also has been penalized twice for pass interference 
and once for illegal contact. ``I've been beaten by some of the 
best. But I have the mentality to go out there and win my share of 
the battles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just eight months ago, Buchanan was a major attraction during  
Super Bowl week. He adorned himself with the aforementioned dog 
collar, symbolizing the Falcons' underdog status against Denver, 
and engaged in an entertaining war of words with Shannon Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, there are two sides to life as an NFL cornerback.  
When you line up one-on-one with a 6-foot-2 receiver who runs the 
40 in just a shade over four seconds, there's a fine line between 
glory and humiliation 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to get beat. It's how you come back that  
matters,'' Buchanan said. ``I haven't changed. I'm still the same, 
competitive cornerback I've been throughout my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there was a hint of frustration in Buchanan's words, like  
someone who's been left behind on a deserted island while everyone 
else hopped on the rescue boat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to point fingers at my teammates and say, `Look  
at the pass rush' or `Look at where the safety is supposed to 
be,''' he said. ``But when you see yourself (getting beat) on ESPN 
and CNN, it's difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons have managed only two sacks this season, allowing  
receivers plenty of time to get open. Also, Buchanan clearly feels 
he should have gotten some help in last Sunday's humiliating 35-7 
loss at St. Louis, when the Rams went long on two touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
	On third-and-18, Torry Holt got behind Buchanan and hauled in a  
38-yard scoring strike from Kurt Warner. Then Isaac Bruce slipped 
open down the middle and grabbed a 46-yard pass, a futile swipe by 
Buchanan actually arriving a split-second early before he tumbled 
to the turf. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all starts up front,'' said Buchanan, who has broken up  
four passes to lead the team and also has one of the Falcons' two 
interceptions. ``You can have Deion Sanders or Darrell Green at 
cornerback, but it doesn't matter if you don't have a pass rush.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons defensive line, one of the best in the NFL last  
season, has admittedly struggled this year. End Chuck Smith is 
still bothered by a sore toe, suffered early in training camp, 
while tackles Shane Dronett (calf) and Travis Hall (thumb) could 
miss Sunday's game against the Baltimore Ravens with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real tough right now,'' Buchanan said. ``You can't take  
any chances. You've got to play passive and try to protect 
yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lester Archambeau will likely move from end to tackle to help  
fill in for the injured players, with first-round pick Patrick 
Kerney taking over on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are really bad right now,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``We  
aren't putting pressure on the quarterback. I wish I knew why. We 
have just got to keep working at it, because you don't all of a 
sudden become that bad that quick with the same people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is willing to share the blame on both long touchdowns  
by the Rams -- ``I had a chance to make a play and I didn't'' -- but 
he felt victimized by the officials in the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Minnesota, he was called for a 52-yard pass interference  
penalty trying to defend Minnesota's Randy Moss, setting up a 
2-yard scoring pass to Cris Carter, who also beat Buchanan. The 
Falcons lost 17-14. 
</P>
<P>
	In Week 2, the Atlanta cornerback was flagged again for  
interference and also for illegal contact in a 24-7 loss to Dallas.

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Discovered in Man's Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. (AP) -- A school district groundskeeper was  
in custody after a search of his home turned up a stockpile of 
assault weapons and 50,000 rounds of ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had served a warrant at the man's house Wednesday  
morning to search for maintenance equipment allegedly stolen from 
the district, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Peacock, an employee with the Capistrano Unified School  
District, was arrested for investigation of receiving stolen 
property, said Orange County sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino. 
</P>
<P>
	He was being held on $10,000 bail. No charges had been filed by  
early today. 
</P>
<P>
	The weapons, which included eight machine guns and several World  
War II-vintage carbines, were stored inside two safes at the home. 
</P>
<P>
	``They found 80 assault weapons, some of which appear to be  
fully automatic,'' said sheriff's Lt. Tom Garner. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the missing maintenance equipment also was recovered.  
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't immediately known how or why he obtained the weapons,  
Amormino said. The federal bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 
is helping authorities trace the origin of the guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies also found stacks of magazines at the house, including  
``Solder of Fortune,'' ``Guns of the World,'' ``Combat'' and ``The 
Ultimate Sniper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peacock, 43, was hired by the district in 1993 and worked at its  
42 campuses as needed, said spokeswoman Julie Jennings. She said he 
has been on disability for five months.

<HEADLINE> Full Probe Sought on Korea Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The South Korean and U.S. governments  
promised full investigations Thursday into accounts of mass 
killings of refugees by U.S. Army troops at the South Korean hamlet 
of No Gun Ri in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors of No Gun Ri, reacting to an Associated Press report  
in which their accounts were corroborated by U.S. veterans, had 
demanded a full inquiry by Washington to ``console the wandering 
souls of those who died.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The news of AP's findings on No Gun Ri was headlined on front  
pages and in newscasts throughout South Korea. ``The truth cannot 
be hidden forever,'' said the independent MBC-TV network. 
</P>
<P>
	The survivors' group says 300 people were killed in the mass  
shooting after 100 died in an air attack in late July 1950, during 
the early weeks of the Korean War. Ex-GIs speak of anywhere from 
100 to ``hundreds'' dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about No Gun Ri at a Parliament hearing on ministry  
matters Thursday, the South Korean defense minister, Cho Sung-tae, 
said he may ask for U.S. cooperation in the South Korean probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ministry is checking whether it is true or not,'' he said  
of the report. ``If necessary, we will try to get declassified U.S. 
military documents and will conduct a field investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton told reporters Defense  
Secretary William Cohen ``wants to get to the bottom of it.'' The 
president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, called the 
news report ``obviously deeply disturbing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Army Secretary Louis Caldera, briefing reporters, said the AP  
``clearly has raised new information that demanded that it be 
looked into.'' He said he expects a Pentagon investigation to take 
at least a year and to include interviews with veterans of the Army 
unit involved at No Gun Ri. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Pentagon confirms the allegations, he said, compensation  
to the survivors would be ``appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press reported Wednesday that a dozen Army  
veterans, in AP interviews, corroborated the core of the Koreans' 
account of the killings at No Gun Ri, 100 miles southeast of Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP also reported, based on declassified U.S. military  
archives, that U.S. commanders at the time issued orders to their 
troops to shoot civilians to guard against disguised North Korean 
enemy among columns of South Korean refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The survivors had filed a claim with the South Korean Government  
Compensation Committee in 1997, but it was rejected last year 
because a five-year statute of limitations had expired long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of futility, the ``Petitioners of No Gun Ri'' group  
was jubilant over the U.S. news report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never been happier before. Now I can rest in peace when  
I die,'' said Park Sun-yong, 75, who said her small son and 
daughter were killed by U.S. soldiers at No Gun Ri. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the group demanded that the U.S. and South  
Korean governments launch immediate investigations, that ``the U.S. 
president and Congress make an apology and compensation,'' and that 
the United States build a memorial to the dead at the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the U.S. government will meet our demands and console  
the wandering souls of those who died an unfair death,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group found strong support among South Korean commentators.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the course of history, truth should never be allowed to  
remain buried,'' said Seoul's mass-circulation daily Dong-A Ilbo in 
an editorial urging an investigation and compensation. ``Soldiers 
should never slaughter innocent refugees for the sake of 
convenience and efficiency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also won support in the United States.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. National Council of Churches, which had previously  
championed the Korean claimants' cause before the Pentagon, said in 
New York that ``the South Korean victims and their relatives 
deserve justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The council's general secretary, the Rev. Dr. Joan B. Campbell,  
also praised the courage of the American veterans who talked 
publicly about the events. 
</P>
<P>
	But in both countries, some veterans of the 1950-53 Korean War,  
in which U.S. troops helped save South Korea against a North Korean 
invasion, voiced misgivings about the disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea must be ``very careful about accusing veterans from  
our blood-tied ally,'' said Park Jong-in, a retired South Korean 
brigadier general and war historian. 
</P>
<P>
	``We owe what we are today, our economic prosperity, to the  
blood those old soldiers shed in a foreign country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leader of the U.S. Korean War Veterans Association called  
the news report ``propaganda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if it did happen,'' said Harley Coon, ``I don't think we  
need to hear this really. I can't see where it's going to do anyone 
any good. It's certainly not going to shed any good light on our 
military.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate official comment from communist North  
Korea.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Declares War on a Painting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- City officials have fired another round in their  
escalating fight with the Brooklyn Museum of Art, accusing the 
museum of displaying controversial work just to drive up its value. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusations made Wednesday by Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota and  
the city's top lawyer, Michael Hess, came a day after the museum 
sued to stop Mayor Rudolph Giuliani from freezing its funding over 
the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has threatened to cut city funding to the museum  
because of its decision to display an exhibit that includes a black 
Madonna decorated with elephant dung and pornographic cutouts. The 
funding amounts to $7 million, or about one-third of the museum's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The pieces are from advertising executive Charles Saatchi's  
collection. Lhota and Hess say the museum's board planned the 
``Sensation'' exhibition so the works would fetch high prices at 
auction once the show closes. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum's board members are ``shilling for a British subject  
who is a multimillionaire and trying to enhance his art 
collection,'' Lhota said. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited a New York Observer article which said that after the  
show closed in London, Saatchi auctioned 128 pieces from his 
collection, many of them by artists in the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, on a fund-raising trip in California, said he has been  
in touch with Lhota and Hess about their accusations. He said the 
project raises the question whether a publicly funded museum should 
engage in ``shock commercialization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andree Corroon, a spokeswoman for Christie's, which is helping  
sponsor the show, said the auction house had no plans for an 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bewildering accusation has absolutely no substance, is  
absolutely not true,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the museum called the accusations ``preposterous  
and misleading.'' The show opens Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a federal judge has been asked to decide whether to  
restore the museum's funding. The museum sued the city on Tuesday, 
saying Giuliani's act violates the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the Senate agreed unanimously Wednesday to a  
non-binding measure calling for the withholding of federal funds 
from the museum unless it cancels the exhibit. Independent Sen. Bob 
Smith of New Hampshire said the museum has received $500,000 from 
the National Endowment for the Arts in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, singer David Bowie -- who recorded an audio tour  
for museum visitors -- joined leaders of major New York City museums 
in support of the Brooklyn Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sensation represents some of the best, worst but definitely  
most extreme of the high-profile work to have come out of Britain 
in the last 10 years or so,'' Bowie said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders of two dozen cultural institutions -- including the  
Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Modern Art -- signed a letter 
protesting the mayor's funding cut.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Launches Web Site on Y2K Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Travelers heading overseas can now use the  
Internet to get information on the readiness of some 90 countries 
to handle year 2000 transportation problems, although a lack of 
detail brought complaints from a senator. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Web site, www.fly2k.dot.gov, was activated Thursday by  
the Transportation Department. It will be updated regularly and 
serve as the federal government's clearinghouse for Y2K travel 
information during the next three months. 
</P>
<P>
	For those interested in Australia's readiness, for example, the  
site says: ``Reports indicate steps are under way in the civil 
aviation Y2K programs of this country. However, there is 
insufficient information available to estimate the overall status 
of Y2K preparations at this time. It is difficult to estimate the 
likelihood, length or severity of any disruptions in the civil 
aviation system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same description is included for numerous other countries,  
followed by a recommendation that travelers ``be prepared to cope 
with disruptions and delays in services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such scant specifics brought complaints from Sen. Christopher  
Dodd, D-Conn., during a hearing on the transportation industry's 
2000 readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying carriers should be forthright themselves, Dodd threatened  
to introduce legislation grounding any U.S. aviation certificate 
holder that does not respond to a government questionnaire about 
Y2K readiness by mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Mead, inspector general of the Transportation  
Department, told the hearing that 1,900 certificate holders have 
yet to respond. The Federal Aviation Administration said none are 
major airlines and many are manufacturing companies or one-plane 
crop-dusters. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd also complained groups such as the International Air  
Transport Association, which represents 265 international airlines, 
were not making public all the information they had from members. 
An official of the association said airlines agreed to provide the 
information only if it was not made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Windmuller, who testified for the transport association,  
said passengers should trust the airlines to use the information 
wisely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine any of our member airlines would ever  
compromise safety,'' Windmuller said. 
</P>
<P>
	The year 2000 problem can plague older computers because some  
were designed to recognize years in a two-digit format, such as 
``99'' for 1999. Some systems may malfunction when the new century 
starts if they confuse ``00'' for 1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	That is of particular concern in aviation, where computers  
control everything from radar to runway lights. In June, the FAA 
announced that it had repaired and tested all of its computers, and 
U.S. and Canadian airlines recently offered the same assurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions linger about the readiness of airports both  
domestically and abroad, and the readiness of international 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	In launching the new site, Transportation Secretary Rodney  
Slater said that the top three travel destination from the United 
States -- Canada, Britain and Japan -- report they will be fully Y2K 
ready by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, the Web site covers almost 90 countries with direct  
service to and from the United States.

<HEADLINE> Ovitz Hopeful for LA NFL Franchise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- After trying for five years to bring an NFL  
team to Los Angeles, Michael Ovitz believes he is closer than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about it for the first time in years; feel we have  
the best shot we've ever had,'' Ovitz said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm bullish, but it's not locked up.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz said he and his backers, who hold an option on land at  
Hollywood Park, have met all the NFL's criteria. But the Hollywood 
dealmaker noted that the proposal still must be approved by 24 of 
the league's 31 owners if a deal is to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 97-acre parcel adjacent to the race track in Inglewood,  
southwest of downtown Los Angeles, became available earlier this 
week when Marvin Davis, who held the option, dropped his bid for 
the expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's expansion committee is scheduled to meet Tuesday in  
Atlanta, with the owners convening the following day. Ovitz plans 
to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the myriad possibilities are that the owners will decide  
then on whether to place the league's 32nd team in Houston or Los 
Angeles, or simply put off making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the league has said it eventually wants teams in both  
cities, the owners also might consider promising one city the 
expansion team and committing to move an existing franchise to the 
other city sometime in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the league considered Ovitz a serious candidate for a  
team, NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said: ``Very much so. We're looking 
forward to going to Atlanta and discussing our opportunities in Los 
Angeles and Houston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz, whose group includes grocery billionaire Ron Burkle and  
actor Tom Cruise, could be awarded the expansion franchise without 
a decision on the actual stadium site. Ovitz said his first 
priority was to secure a team for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he noted that Hollywood Park already was approved by  
the team owners as a potential stadium site several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz began his quest for an NFL team when the Raiders left the  
LA Coliseum and the Rams left Anaheim after the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The league picked Los Angeles over Houston last March, but made  
that commitment conditional on receiving an agreeable stadium and 
financing plan from LA by Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	That date passed without action, and the league resumed  
negotiations with Houston as well as continuing talks with groups 
from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Ovitz joined with city officials from  
suburban Carson to propose building a hacienda-style stadium as 
part of a shopping mall complex. The NFL instead zeroed in on the 
Coliseum, but those negotiations stalled and the league opened the 
bidding again to prospective owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the NFL asked Ovitz's group to provide  
up-front money to make clear it was serious about getting a team. 
He said that matter was being negotiated with the league. 
</P>
<P>
	While believing his group has a solid proposal, Ovitz  
acknowledged, ``It's up to the owners. Who knows how things will 
turn out?''

<HEADLINE> Judge Approves Boeing Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A federal judge on Thursday approved a $15  
million settlement of a racial discrimination lawsuit brought 
against The Boeing Co., saying it was the best way to encourage 
racial cooperation at the company. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of black employees at the world's leading maker of  
commercial airplanes had argued before U.S. District Judge John 
Coughenour last week that the settlement was inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This settlement has a greater chance of fostering a  
cooperative relationship between Boeing and its African-American 
employees than would a series of protracted individual disputes,'' 
Coughenour wrote in his opinion. ``This last point must be a 
crucial consideration for anyone who is primarily interested in 
future race relations within the company, as both the plaintiffs 
and the objectors maintain they are here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement affecting approximately 13,000 past and present  
employees had been announced in January by Boeing's chairman, 
Philip M. Condit, and civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	It covered lawsuits filed last year on behalf of black Boeing  
workers who alleged discrimination against blacks was common at 
Boeing plants, especially in selecting people for promotion. The 
lawsuits also alleged that blacks were harassed and faced 
retaliation when they complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to spend $15 million to  
compensate the workers, pay their legal fees and set up programs to 
fight discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people weren't happy with terms,'' Oscar Desper III, lead  
attorney for the plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit, said 
Thursday. ``Some will benefit monetarily and some will not, but all 
will benefit from the changes we're going to make at the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some workers complained that the settlement failed to provide  
enough money and wouldn't do enough to prevent further bias. Some 
critics also complained that they had never been allowed to vote on 
the agreement and in some cases said they first learned of the 
settlement from news reports or superiors at Boeing rather than 
from their own lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we're disappointed. From the record we created and  
the horror stories we heard from our clients -- and their passion, 
their absolute passion -- we did not believe it would be approved,'' 
said Scott Burr, who assisted Philadelphia attorney Alan B. Epstein 
in seeking to overturn the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Burr said his firm was pursuing a class-action discrimination  
suit on behalf of Philadelphia employees of Boeing when Desper's 
Seattle firm reached the settlement with Seattle-based Boeing in 
January. Epstein had asked the judge last week to either reject the 
$15 million settlement as inadequate or rule that those employees 
bringing the Philadelphia suit should not have been included in the 
Seattle settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughenour ruled Thursday that the settlement was fair and that  
it also was appropriate to include the workers in the Philadelphia 
class-action suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge wrote that several objectors to the settlement  
``consider the amount of damages awarded to be an insult. And even 
more view Boeing's promises of future reforms with skepticism. The 
Court finds it difficult to reconcile these compelling personal 
statements with the more positive view of the settlement expressed 
by the Reverend Jesse Jackson and other experts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coughenour wrote that it was appropriate to include all Boeing  
workers in part because ``The plaintiffs allege that the root of 
Boeing's race discrimination problems are companywide policies 
which encourage favoritism among groups of white workers, and which 
tend to exclude African-Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burr said it was not clear yet whether her his firm would appeal  
Coughenour's decision or file individual lawsuits on behalf of 
those plaintiffs who had dropped out by the judge's April 23 
deadline rather than remain parties to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased with today's court ruling,'' Condit said  
in statement released by Boeing. ``The court's approval today 
allows Boeing to continue its movement forward not only on the 
commitments outlined in the settlement but toward the company's 
vision of a culture of inclusion, where diverse groups and ideas 
flourish.''

<HEADLINE> Timor Peacekeepers Can Cross Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Amid reports of a militia buildup in  
West Timor, Australia said today that peacekeepers in East Timor 
are authorized to cross the border into the Indonesian territory if 
engaged in a battle with militiamen. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia warned peacekeepers against entering West Timor,  
saying such action could lead to a clash between the Australian-led 
mission, known as Interfet, and Indonesian soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Interfet cannot enter West Timor without permission,''  
Indonesian military spokesman Maj. Gen. Sudradjat said, according 
to the Antara news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has bristled over what it calls the foreign troops'  
aggressive style and lack of respect for its sovereignty. About 400 
outraged Indonesian students threw rocks and gasoline bombs at the 
Australian Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital. Three people 
were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want war with Australia. If Australia enters West Timor,  
there will be war,'' protester Yakum Lindo said. 
</P>
<P>
	A smaller protest was held outside the U.S. Embassy as Defense  
Secretary William Cohen visited the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Militiamen went on a rampage of killing and arson in East Timor  
following an Aug. 30 independence vote, forcing hundreds of 
thousands of East Timorese to flee to West Timor, the other half of 
the island that remains part of Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Many were reportedly forced into West Timor. Access to refugee  
camps there has been severely limited, with allegations that the 
militias are conducting a campaign of intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Defense Minister John Moore told Australian  
Broadcasting Corp. radio that the peacekeepers can cross briefly 
into West Timor if involved in a battle with the militias. So far, 
no such clashes have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have intelligence information that says that there are  
numbers there,'' Moore said. ``We don't know what their intentions 
are, but we are prepared for any eventualities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A senior U.S. defense official said Wednesday that pro-Indonesia  
militias -- numbering between 2,000 and 4,000 -- may be preparing to 
launch guerrilla raids on the peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, meeting Indonesian leaders in Jakarta, accused  
Indonesia's military of collusion in militia violence in East Timor 
and said it must change its ways before Washington will restore 
normal ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian military chief Gen. Wiranto denied allegations his  
troops forcibly evicted people from East Timor. ``They 
spontaneously fled from their homes to seek a peaceful place for 
their safety,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But some Timorese residents had a different story to tell.  
</P>
<P>
	``The military did it. They forced people out and they forced  
them onto trucks and they took them somewhere,'' said Joao da 
Conceao da Silva, whose sister and brother are among thousands who 
he claims were deported from the southern town of Aielu to West 
Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said, `We will kill anyone who refuses,''' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a leader of East Timor's anti-Indonesia Falintil  
guerrillas ventured into Dili today for the first time in three 
years to discuss cooperation with the international force. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornelio Goma, the guerrillas' second-in-command for the capital  
area, said his 500 fighters would keep their 100 weapons -- ``all 
sorts of weapons, semiautomatics, old guns, new guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Falintil will not hand over weapons ... we are the national  
liberation force of East Timor,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Falintil, which fought a decades-long struggle for East Timor's  
independence, will likely form the core of an independent East 
Timor government and its army. On Wednesday, Falintil rebels manned 
roadblocks and guarding areas of East Timor where international 
peace forces have not reached. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. relief workers said Falintil will be enlisted to help  
distribute aid in the eastern part of the province. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. relief coordinator Ross Mountain said the humanitarian  
situation is gradually improving. The first mass food distribution 
in the capital is scheduled for Saturday at five sites, handing out 
enough to feed 100,000 people for a month, World Food Program 
spokeswoman Annie Spring said.

<HEADLINE> Oilers and NHL To Honor Gretzky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Edmonton will officially welcome home  
its favorite adopted son, Wayne Gretzky, Friday night by lifting 
his jersey to the ceiling of the rink where he helped the Oilers 
win four Stanley Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, between 5,000 and 15,000 fans are expected to jam the  
square in front of City Hall, where Gretzky will officially change 
the name of the expressway that runs past the Skyreach Center to 
Wayne Gretzky Drive. The rink already has a bronze statue of him in 
front. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it's on to Skyreach Center and the retirement ceremony,  
prior to the Oilers' home opener against Gretzky's last team, the 
New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers have said the the ceremony will include ex-Oilers  
Mark Messier and Jari Kurri, along with current Edmonton coach 
Kevin Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gretzky tribute will continue at each NHL club's home  
opener. Those games will feature special ``99 The Great One'' 
tributes on their corner dashboard signage, commemorating Gretzky's 
outstanding career achievements and contributions to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Gretzky's No. 99 jersey will be retired at the NHL  
All-Star celebration at Toronto Feb. 5.

<HEADLINE> Immigrants Go on Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARMVILLE, Va. (AP) -- About a dozen Immigration and  
Naturalization Service detainees say they are conducting a hunger 
strike to protest the government's ongoing efforts to deport them. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters have been held for months and, in some cases,  
years because their countries of origin -- Cuba, Cambodia and Iran, 
among them -- refuse to take them back. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the men face deportation for criminal convictions.  
Others told The Washington Post they don't have criminal records. 
</P>
<P>
	The men said they went on the hunger strike earlier this month.  
While they said they are sustaining themselves with only water and 
occasional bites of food, Lewis Barlow, the superintendent at 
Piedmont Regional Jail, said some have been purchasing soup and 
snacks at the jail's commissary. 
</P>
<P>
	Jail officials said they are monitoring the health of detainees  
who have refused meals and only one inmate has required medical 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	INS spokeswoman Ernestine Fobbs said Wednesday the agency  
reviews deportation cases on a regular basis and has sent two 
officers to Piedmont to hear complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a similar hunger strike in Florida this spring by  
Cuban detainees, the Washington office of the INS said it was 
examining 43 cases of individuals under long-term detention to 
identify those eligible for release pending deportation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the men at Piedmont said they have seen no sign of  
such a review. 
</P>
<P>
	``Theoretically, they're supposed to have a procedure, but in  
practice it hasn't happened,'' said Beverly Yeskolski, a lawyer who 
represents one of the detainees. ``These people are sitting in jail 
indefinitely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fobbs said the INS is monitoring the situation.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are taking this seriously and are working toward a  
reasonable solution of the matter,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Farm Bill Nears Passage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For two lawmakers, it took a pledge of special  
subsidies for dairy farmers. For another, it was a favor sought by 
his home-state cattle ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
	One such promise at a time, Republican congressional leaders  
were on the verge of breaking an impasse on an agricultural 
spending bill that would preserve the 40-year-old Cuban embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders hoped to get a House-Senate conference committee to  
approve an agreement today that would include nearly $9 billion in 
emergency farm assistance while excluding a provision sought by 
farm groups that would allow the sale of food and medicine to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	House leaders were still negotiating today with three GOP  
members of the committee. ``Nothing is decided yet,'' said one of 
them, Rep. George Nethercutt of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Wisconsin Democrats on the panel announced their support  
late Wednesday after winning a pledge that the measure also would 
include $125 million in special subsidies for dairy farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, Rep. David Obey and Sen. Herb Kohl, both  
from Wisconsin, predicted that the deal would get approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Obey is the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations  
Committee, while Kohl is the senior Democrat on the Senate's 
agricultural appropriations subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Another panel member, Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., announced his  
support for the deal because of a provision requiring meatpackers 
to report the prices they pay for livestock. ``That means a lot ... 
I'm happy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders came under fire from members of their own party for  
refusing to allow the Cuba provision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be foolhardy if we addressed the emergency, but  
failed to address this structure where farmers are not able to 
market their products around the world,'' said Sen. John Ashcroft, 
R-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	House leaders didn't want non-spending provisions in the bill,  
said John Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to get this thing done,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Some farm groups, including the huge American Farm Bureau  
Federation, wanted lawmakers to reject the proposed deal because it 
failed to include the dairy and trade provisions and may not have 
enough money to cover farmers' weather-related losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also weighed in Wednesday against  
the agreement because of the Cuba issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to opening trade with Cuba, the Ashcroft amendment  
would bar the president from stopping sales of agricultural 
products and medical supplies to other countries without 
congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers from dairy states in the South and East wanted to  
use the spending bill to overturn a new nationwide milk-pricing 
system that was scheduled to take effect Friday. A federal judge on 
Tuesday postponed implementation of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohl and Obey support the new system and fought to keep the  
issue it out of the bill.

<HEADLINE> Bank Opens Targeting Gay Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- The first bank to target a national  
homosexual market has opened its doors in Pensacola and will begin 
doing business Oct. 11 on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	G&AMP;L Bank -- the initials stand for gay and lesbian -- is among a  
small number of Internet-focused banks and the first to obtain a 
thrift charter for Internet lending, founder Steven Dunlap said 
Wednesday. Its sole walk-in office began operating last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Homophobia runs rampant in the banking industry,'' said G. Kay  
Griffin, the bank's chairwoman, president and chief executive 
officer. ``Many banks think a couple needs to have a marriage 
certificate to show that they are creditworthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet operations will be open around the clock, seven  
days a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank investors David Richbourg and Norman Ricks, both retired  
businessmen, were the first same-sex couple to open a joint 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the first time we were able to go into a bank as a  
couple, and be treated with the same respect that other couples 
have been treated in the past,'' Richbourg said. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Ricks have been together for 26 years.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every time we bought property together or applied for a loan,  
it was always candy-coated that we were business partners, and in 
some areas, it was frowned upon that we were borrowing together,'' 
Richbourg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank is capitalized at about $19 million with 70  
stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Demographic surveys suggest about 21 million homosexuals live in  
the United States with $800 billion in spending power. About 9.2 
million gays and lesbians regularly use the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Bush Criticizes GOP-Led Congess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- In a rare dispute with Congress,  
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush on Thursday 
criticized a GOP plan to squeeze money from a program for the 
working poor to meet budget targets. 
</P>
<P>
	He also signaled his displeasure with trends that suggest  
Congress may exceed spending limits in place since the 1997 
balanced-budget deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they ought to balance their budget on the backs  
of the poor,'' said the two-term Texas governor and Republican 
presidential front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP-led Congress is mulling several bookkeeping gimmicks to  
break a deadlock over spending priorities in time for Friday's 
start of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	One proposal accepted by Republican House leaders would produce  
$8 million in savings by spreading the earned income tax credit 
over 12 monthly payments rather than the lump sum now paid with tax 
refunds. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say the tactic would be unfair, because it would  
siphon money from working families who earn less than $30,000 a 
year. Bush agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned about the earned income tax credit. I'm  
concerned for someone who is moving from near-poverty to middle 
class,'' said Bush, whose is trying to build an election coalition 
by blending traditional conservative values with moderate rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
	The self-professed ``compassionate conservative'' signaled in  
August that his long-awaited tax proposal would expand the earned 
income tax program. Bush has delayed revealing his tax plan, in 
part to ensure that tax cuts to wealthy Americans are offset by 
relief for voters in the middle class and near-poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks at a news conference during a swing through Silicon  
Valley marked the first time he has spoke against the spending 
plan. Bush has close ties to Congress and the GOP establishment, a 
point that his Democratic and Republican opponents could use 
against him if Republican lawmakers mishandle the politics of the 
budget debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office says current Republican  
spending proposals would exceed two-year-old spending caps set for 
fiscal 2000 and eat into the Social Security surplus. Asked about 
the report, Bush said, ``The administration and Congress should 
hold to the spending caps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not elaborate.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush also:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Accused the Clinton administration of refusing to help the  
high-technology industry deal with a laundry list of issues before 
Congress until he began courting the industry on the campaign 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
	--Promised to debate his rivals, but only ``when the people start

him badly in polls and money-raising, want to test his handle on

	Japan Contains Nuclear Reaction  
</P>
<P>
	TOKAIMURA, Japan (AP) -- Hours after a leak of radioactive gas  
seriously injured three workers, an uncontrolled nuclear reaction 
at a uranium processing plant in northeastern Japan was contained 
early Friday. Government officials said Thursday's accident -- which 
may have also contaminated 34 people -- spewed a gas containing 
alpha, beta and gamma radiation into the atmosphere. Earlier, more 
than 310,000 people within six miles of the plant were ordered to 
stay in their homes. The facility is located in Tokaimura, 70 miles 
northeast of Tokyo.

	Congress Struggles With Spending Bills  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shadowed by presidential veto threats,  
Congress struggled to complete action on spending bills today as 
the government closed the books on the 1999 fiscal year. President 
Clinton denounced a plan to save money by slowing income-support 
payments to millions of working poor families. Minutes earlier, he 
signed legislation keeping agencies open through Oct. 21. Just four 
of the 13 annual spending bills have been signed into law. One has 
been vetoed and five others face veto threats. The fiscal year 
begins tomorrow.

	U.S. Orders Korean War Deaths Probe  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered a  
top-level investigation today of accounts of mass killings of 
Korean civilians by U.S. soldiers at No Gun Ri in 1950. Accounts by 
American veterans and South Korean villagers who said they 
witnessed killings at the No Gun Ri railroad bridge early in the 
Korean War -- including six ex-GIs who said they shot civilians -- 
were reported by The Associated Press yesterday. President Clinton 
gave assurances that the Pentagon ``wants to get to the bottom of 
it,'' and South Korea promised its own investigation.

	Infant, Maternal Death Rates Drop  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Touting what they called one of the century's  
most significant advances in public health, federal officials said 
today that infant and maternal mortality rates have dropped by more 
than 90 percent since 1900. The rate of infants who die before age 
1 went from 100 per 1,000 live births in 1915 to less than 7.2 per 
1,000 in 1997, the CDC said. At the turn of the 20th century, six 
to nine out of every 1,000 women died of pregnancy-related 
complications. The rate was less than .1 per 1,000 in 1997.

	Bradley Upbeat After Financial Reports

<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Democratic presidential hopeful Bill  
Bradley was clearly upbeat today as new campaign finance reports 
showed that he had more money in the bank than Vice President Al 
Gore. Buoyed by the fresh spending figures, Bradley said at a news 
conference, ``I don't think we have momentum, I think we have a 
little traction.'' Bradley raised an estimated $6.7 million between 
July and September, spokeswoman Anita Dunn said. Gore raised around 
$6.5 million during the same period.

	At Least 10 Dead in Mexico Quake

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A strong earthquake along the Pacific coast  
rattled much of Mexico today, killing at least 10 people and 
damaging hundreds of buildings. The U.S. Geological Survey in 
Golden, Colo., said the magnitude-7.5 quake was centered between in 
Oaxaca state, 280 miles south of Mexico City. The force of the 
quake was felt hundreds of miles away, as far south as Guatemala 
and very strongly in Mexico City to the north.

	Academics, Retailers Honor Bar Code  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Academics from some of the nation's top Ivy  
League schools joined executives from Wal-Mart and other retailers 
today to praise the bar code -- that ubiquitous collection of lines 
and numbers that made its debut 25 years ago. At a daylong 
conference at the Smithsonian Institution, the executives and 
researchers recalled the earliest days of the humble technology. 
Retail and grocery industries describe universal price codes -- 
scanned an estimated 5 billion times each day -- as among the most 
significant advances ever.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- After 40 years of tormenting players and  
fans with swirling winds, frigid temperatures and blankets of fog, 
Candlestick Park closed its baseball career today as the Los 
Angeles Dodgers beat the San Francisco Giants 9-4. The game was 
attended by 61,389 fans, the largest regular-season crowd in 
Candlestick history. The Giants move to $319 million Pacific Bell 
Park in downtown San Francisco next season, leaving Candlestick -- 
which opened on April 12, 1960 -- to the NFL's 49ers.

<HEADLINE> NY Gallery Owner Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bullets as party favors? It was part of an art  
gallery show, but police say it was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Boone, owner of the Mary Boone Gallery, was arrested  
Wednesday on charges of illegal distribution of ammunition, said 
police Sgt. Ellen Tietjen. Police allegedly found a vase filled 
with 100 rounds of 9 mm bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to the Fifth Avenue gallery were reportedly invited to  
help themselves to cartridges and take them home. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this were simply someone handing bullets out on the street,  
you would criticize us greatly for not doing something about it,'' 
said police spokeswoman Marilyn Mode. ``This is an unsupervised 
exhibit with a glass vase filled with bullets, live ammunition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one-man show of sculptor Tom Sachs featured homemade guns --  
his signature object. Sachs' work deals with consumer culture, 
packaging and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	When the guns were deemed functional, criminal possession of a  
weapon and criminal possession of a shotgun were added to the 
charges, Mode said. 
</P>
<P>
	Misdemeanor charges carry a maximum penalty of a year in jail,  
plus fines.

<HEADLINE> Athens Chooses Logo for 2004 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A white wreath-shaped olive branch  
floating in a sky and sea blue field was presented Thursday as the 
new logo for the Athens 2004 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The logo was unveiled at a special ceremony at the Zappeion  
Palace, across the street from the all-marble Panatheniac Stadium 
that hosted the first modern Olympics in 1896. 
</P>
<P>
	It replaced a logo that looked like a flaming A, for Athens,  
hovering over a blue shape resembling a boat or cauldron. 
</P>
<P>
	In ancient times, the olive tree was considered sacred in Athens  
and was considered a sign of peace. The symbol was chosen to 
represent peace, democracy and civilization. It also harks back to 
the ancient Olympic truce, when ancient Greek city states declared 
peace during the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The logo unveiling was attended by Juan Antonio Samaranch,  
president of the International Olympic Committee, Greek President 
Costis Stephanopoulos and Premier Costas Simitis and other 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``This emblem will be capture the attention of the world for  
many years,'' Samaranch said. ``Athens and Greece have a greater 
responsibility than others because the history of the Olympics 
belongs to you.''

<HEADLINE> Underwood Released From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Miami Dolphins player Dimitrius Underwood  
was released Thursday from Sparrow Hospital, where he was being 
treated after a suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	A hospital operator who would not give her name said Underwood  
was released but would not say when, or where he went. Lansing 
television station WSYM said he was released at 10:38 a.m. 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as Thursday morning, Underwood was listed in fair  
condition at the hospital, four days after police found him 
bleeding on a city street from a self-inflicted knife wound. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the ex-Michigan State defensive standout slashed his  
neck Sunday at the Lansing home of his twin 17-month-old children 
and their mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's college coach, Nick Saban, said he was saddened by  
what his ex-player is going through. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really disappointed that as his coach, there wasn't  
something that I could do to help this guy accomplish what he wants 
to accomplish,'' Saban said on Detroit television station WJBK. 
</P>
<P>
	A day before trying to kill himself, Underwood was arrested on a  
warrant accusing him of nonpayment of child support. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found him with the knife wound 13 hours after a woman  
posted his bond and Underwood left the jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was a first-round draft pick by the Minnesota Vikings.  
But he left the team in August without explanation a day after 
signing a five-year, $5.3 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter later found him in a Philadelphia hotel, and  
Underwood said he had been torn between his faith in God and his 
football career. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood later decided to return to football to support his  
family, and the Miami Dolphins picked him up on waivers. He played 
one exhibition game on Sept. 2, then injured his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson said Tuesday that the team was  
placing Underwood on the reserved-nonfootball injury list.

<HEADLINE> Fannie Mae Relaxing Credit Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mortgage-market giant Fannie Mae, seeking to  
help more low-income consumers become homeowners, is relaxing its 
credit requirements for loans to people with ``slightly impaired'' 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Many consumers with damaged credit histories don't qualify for  
lower-cost conventional mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new program announced Thursday, qualified borrowers  
will be able to get mortgages at interest rates as much as 2 
percentage points below what they would normally pay for so-called 
``subprime'' loans from finance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Those approved for the mortgages will be granted an additional  
reduction of 1 percentage point in the third year of the loan if 
they make the first 24 monthly payments on time. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a $100,000 mortgage from a ``subprime'' lender  
would typically come with a 30-year fixed rate of 11.5 percent and 
a monthly payment of $990. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new Fannie Mae program, the mortgage would come with  
an initial rate of 9.5 percent and a monthly payment of $841. After 
24 months without delinquent payments, the rate would be reduced to 
8.5 percent with a monthly payment of $769. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will begin on a pilot basis in 15 states and the  
District of Columbia and is expected to be available nationwide by 
next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``There remain too many borrowers whose credit is just a notch  
below what our underwriting has required who have been relegated to 
paying significantly higher mortgage rates,'' said Franklin Raines, 
Fannie Mae's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae didn't specify how it defines ``slightly impaired''  
credit, since the definition could vary from one consumer to 
another based on their specific circumstances, company officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials said the new mortgages will be available to all  
qualified borrowers, although they should mostly help low-income 
and minority consumers, who tend to have worse credit records than 
higher-income and white consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related move, the Fannie Mae Foundation announced an  
educational campaign to provide consumers with information about 
their credit and the role it plays in the home-buying process. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey released in July by Fannie Mae found that only two in  
five Americans understand that if they chronically fail to pay 
bills on time, they will have major problems getting lenders' 
approval for a mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
	For some people, that lack of awareness could stand in the way  
of home ownership even as other obstacles such as racial 
discrimination or the inability to save for a down payment have 
crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Fannie Mae and the NAACP formed a partnership to  
provide as much as $110 million in financing for families that 
can't afford big down payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae, a congressionally chartered, publicly traded  
company, is the largest of several U.S. corporations that buy 
mortgages from original lenders such as banks and finance 
companies. Washington-based Fannie Mae retains some of the 
mortgages in its portfolio and packages others into securities for 
resale to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The program initially will be available in Arizona, California,  
Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, 
Indiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, 
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	EDITOR'S NOTE: Consumers seeking more information on the  
program, called Timely Payment Rewards, can call Fannie Mae's 
Consumer Resource Center at 1-800-7FANNIE from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 
p.m. EDT Monday through Friday.

<P>
	TOKAIMURA, Japan (AP) -- The radiation levels outside a uranium  
processing plant in northeastern Japan had returned to normal 
Friday morning and experts said that they did not believe there was 
a serious threat to local residents. Still, officials described 
Thursday's uncontrolled nuclear reaction as the most serious 
accident ever at a nuclear facility in Japan. A leak of radioactive 
gas seriously injured three workers and possibly contaminated 34 
others. An order for more than 310,000 residents to stay in doors 
remained in effect.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From President Clinton on down, Democratic  
Party loyalists today applauded Vice President Al Gore's latest 
campaign shakeup. Gore said he will personally open his new 
Tennessee headquarters next Wednesday. Clinton told reporters at 
the White House that he and the vice president had long talked 
about Gore relocating and loosening up his personal campaign style. 
The president suggested that he had pressed the changes because the 
same strategy worked for his Little Rock, Ark.-based campaign in

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted today to make it a crime to  
harm a fetus during a violent act against a pregnant woman. It is a 
key bill this year for opponents of legalized abortion, and the 
administration threatened a veto. The bill, said leading abortion 
foe Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., ``recognizes in law the 
self-evident truth that an assault on a pregnant woman is an attack 
on two victims.'' The legislation, which passed 254-172, makes it a 
separate offense to injure or kill a fetus in the commission of a 
federal crime of violence against a pregnant woman.

out-of-pocket on prescriptions, according to a new report from the 
AARP. The nation's largest organization for older adults released 
the study today to back up its support for adding drug coverage to 
Medicare, the national health insurance program for the elderly and 
disabled. Although a majority of the elderly has some type of 
insurance covering drugs, the study concluded that is no guarantee 
they will be spared high out-of-pocket costs.

<HEADLINE> Seminoles Return to Scene of Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Top-ranked Florida State hopes history  
doesn't repeat itself Saturday when the Seminoles meet winless Duke 
in Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State's last visit to the old Gator Bowl ended in  
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years and one month ago, Florida State was upset 30-26 by  
Southern Mississippi and quarterback Brett Favre. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State coach Bobby Bowden has reminded his players of  
that game over and over. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must guard against overconfidence,'' said Bowden, who well  
remembers each of his team's rare defeats over the past dozen 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just look ... Memphis almost beats Tennessee, Louisiana Tech  
beats Alabama and Central Florida almost beats Georgia,'' Bowden 
said. ``You can see that Duke can very well beat Florida State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But history also would indicate Duke (0-3) is in big trouble  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	For starters, Duke has never defeated the Seminoles (4-0, 3-0  
Atlantic Coast Conference). For that matter, they've never come 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, in a game played in Orlando, the Seminoles scored 54  
points -- in the first half! 
</P>
<P>
	Since joining the ACC, Florida State has averaged 54 points a  
game in seven previous meetings, winning last year's outing 62-13. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Seminoles appear to be rounding into mid-season form.  
Last week at North Carolina, it took them less than seven minutes 
to score four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The perplexing thing is why we shut it off,'' Bowden said,  
noting liberal substitutions and a dropoff in intensity probably 
accounted for Florida State's offensive slowdown in the game's 
final three periods. 
</P>
<P>
	First-year Duke coach Carl Franks is still trying to get his  
first win while Bowden, only weeks away from his 70th birthday, is 
aiming to pin down his 297th overall and 224th at Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils just don't seem to have the horsepower -- or a  
Favre for that matter -- to be much of a threat. They are averaging 
11.7 points and 281 yards a game -- against Vanderbilt, Northwestern 
and East Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	But the day shouldn't be a complete waste for the Devils.  
</P>
<P>
	Duke will collect $800,000 for selling its home date to  
Jacksonville sponsors and Franks, a former assistant to Steve 
Spurrier at Florida, is counting on the exposure to help him 
recruit in the football-rich Sunshine State. 
</P>
<P>
	Franks has already appealed to his 1999 club to do its best in  
what appears to be a massive mismatch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the only team in the country that gets to play the  
number one team Saturday,'' he said. ``I think you enjoy, as an 
athlete, playing against the very best.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Approves Boeing Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A $15 million settlement of a racial  
discrimination lawsuit against the Boeing Co. is adequate, despite 
the strident objections of a number of employees in the dispute, a 
judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Court has heard a series of powerful arguments ... from  
objectors in this case,'' U.S. District Judge John Coughenour wrote 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Several consider the amount of damages awarded to be an  
insult. And even more view Boeing's promises of future reforms with 
skepticism. The Court finds it difficult to reconcile these 
compelling personal statements with the more positive view of the 
settlement expressed by the Rev. Jesse Jackson and other experts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement affecting approximately 13,000 past and present  
employees had been announced in January by Boeing's chairman, 
Philip M. Condit, and civil rights leader Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	It covered two class-action lawsuits filed last year on behalf  
of black Boeing workers who alleged that discrimination against 
blacks was common at Boeing plants, especially in selecting people 
for promotion. The lawsuits also alleged that blacks were harassed 
and faced retaliation when they complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to spend $15 million to  
compensate the workers and set up programs to fight discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of black employees at the world's leading maker of  
commercial airplanes had argued before Coughenour last week that 
the settlement was inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people weren't happy with terms,'' Oscar Desper III, lead  
attorney for some plaintiffs, said Thursday. ``Some will benefit 
monetarily and some will not, but all will benefit from the changes 
we're going to make at the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some workers complained that the settlement failed to provide  
enough money and wouldn't do enough to prevent further bias. Some 
critics also complained that they had never been allowed to vote on 
the agreement and in some cases said they first learned of the 
settlement from news reports or superiors at Boeing rather than 
from their own lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we're disappointed. From the record we created and  
the horror stories we heard from our clients -- and their passion, 
their absolute passion -- we did not believe it would be approved,'' 
said Scott Burr, who assisted Philadelphia lawyer Alan B. Epstein 
in seeking to block the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Burr said his firm was pursuing a class-action discrimination  
lawsuit on behalf of Philadelphia employees of Boeing when Desper's 
Seattle firm reached the settlement with Seattle-based Boeing in 
January. Epstein had asked the judge last week to either reject the 
$15 million settlement as inadequate or rule that those employees 
bringing the Philadelphia suit should not have been included in the 
Seattle settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughenour ruled Thursday that the settlement was fair and that  
it also was appropriate to include the workers in the Philadelphia 
class-action suit. 
</P>
<P>
	It was fair to include all Boeing workers in part because ``The  
plaintiffs allege that the root of Boeing's race discrimination 
problems are companywide policies which encourage favoritism among 
groups of white workers, and which tend to exclude 
African-Americans,'' Coughenour wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Epstein said Thursday it was not yet clear whether his firm  
would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing was pleased with the ruling, Condit said in a statement.  
</P>
<P>
	``The court's approval today allows Boeing to continue its  
movement forward not only on the commitments outlined in the 
settlement but toward the company's vision of a culture of 
inclusion, where diverse groups and ideas flourish,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the $15 million, more than $3.25 million will be paid to 70  
named plaintiffs and 194 other class members whose claims surfaced 
during litigation, Boeing said. Another $3.4 million will be 
distributed among some 3,400 members of the settlement class who 
filed claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement reserves $3.64 million for improvements,  
including revising Boeing's selection process for managers, 
improving the promotions process for hourly employees and putting 
in place a new system to investigate equal-opportunity complaints 
from employees, Boeing said.

<HEADLINE> McCain Hopes To Reclaim Home Turf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate John  
McCain returned to Arizona on Thursday with plans to reclaim the 
home turf advantage from George W. Bush, the GOP front-runner who 
was endorsed by that state's governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wonderful to be home,'' McCain told about 450 supporters  
gathered at the Hayden Square Amphitheater. ``Let me tell you my 
friends, I have no doubt and you have no doubt, we will win the 
state of Arizona. We will win easily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trip home ended a four-day announcement tour by the U.S.  
senator. 
</P>
<P>
	During stops in Annapolis, Md., where he graduated from the  
Naval Academy, and the early primary states of New Hampshire, South 
Carolina, Michigan, Washington and California, McCain stressed his 
campaign's core issues -- decreasing the influence of money in 
politics, strengthening the military and restoring pride in public 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must stop the corruption in Washington, D.C.,'' he said.  
``I am committed to it and until I draw my last breath, I will 
fight for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also hoped the rally, held across the street from his  
first congressional office in Tempe, would showcase his support in 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the governor of Texas, made his first campaign visit to  
the state Tuesday and left with endorsements from Gov. Jane Hull 
and former Rep. John Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	One political analyst said Hull's decision was bad, but not  
fatal, for McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a blow, but it's not a knock-out blow,'' said Jeanne  
Clarke, political science professor at the University of Arizona in 
Tucson. ``Being the maverick that he is, his strength is with the 
regular people.''

<HEADLINE> Unheralded Red Sox Reach Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Mo Vaughn stood outside his home and pondered the  
Red Sox future after he escaped a stormy relationship with Boston 
management for a new life with the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's never as bad as you think it is, and it's never as good  
as you think it is,'' he said last Thanksgiving eve after agreeing 
to sign with Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten months later, his teammates couldn't agree more.  
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox were expected to struggle without Vaughn, their  
leader and only legitimate power threat. Many picked them for last 
place in the AL East. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, with Cy Young Award shoo-in Pedro Martinez, AL batting  
leader Nomar Garciaparra and a bunch of unheralded players, they 
are in the playoffs for the second straight year for the first time 
since 1915-16. And they have a shot at their first World Series 
title since 1918. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn, 10 months after making his comment in suburban Easton,  
Mass., is finishing a disappointing season with the AL West's 
last-place team. 
</P>
<P>
	The current Red Sox have succeeded without his big bat.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're not a bunch of bombers,'' said closer Rod Beck, a  
late-season acquisition from the Chicago Cubs who added depth to an 
already strong bullpen. ``They hit their share of homers but they 
get on base. They put the ball in play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck was on the mound Wednesday night when shortstop Garciaparra  
caught a line drive and stepped on second for a double play that 
ended Boston's 6-2 win at Chicago and clinched at least a wild-card 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
	With the second game of the doubleheader still to play -- and the  
feeling that the Red Sox were far from their ultimate goal -- the 
celebration was subdued. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope that we stay focused and take a little step  
further than last year,'' Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox were eliminated in the first round of their last  
three playoff appearances, including losing at Cleveland in 1995 
and 1998. They'll open this year's division series next Wednesday 
at Cleveland if the Indians have the AL's best record or at Texas 
if the Rangers overtake the Indians for that distinction. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland has the big names -- Roberto Alomar, Manny Ramirez,  
Kenny Lofton, Dave Justice, Omar Vizquel -- but Boston won the 
season series 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox manager Jimy Williams has done a masterful job juggling  
his lineup so no player sits on the bench for long. There were few 
complaints from players who felt they should play more. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also had to juggle his starting rotation because of  
injuries. Now, it may be as strong as it's been all season with 
Martinez, his brother Ramon, Bret Saberhagen and Kent Mercker. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Martinez, 23-4 and the league leader in ERA and  
strikeouts, would get two starts if the best-of-5 division series 
goes the limit. 
</P>
<P>
	There's even a chance that closer Tom Gordon, who made his first  
appearance since June 5 on Wednesday, could be healthy enough for 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the key to Boston's first consecutive 90-win seasons since  
1977-79 has been contributions from lesser-known players. 
</P>
<P>
	Players like center fielder Darren Lewis, hitting only .242  
after the clincher but with an ability to hit-and-run, sacrifice, 
steal and play brilliant defense. Many of his teammates got a taste 
of postseason play last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time the guys have been through it,'' he said. ``But,  
more than anything, we have to look at the fact that our pitching's 
done so well and we've played good defense all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Boston's best stretch came from Sept. 3-15, when it went  
9-3 on a tough road trip to Seattle, Oakland, New York and 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox began the season with five straight wins but by July  
25 were only 53-46. Since then, they were 38-21 through Wednesday's 
games. They've done all that with only one pitcher having more than 
10 wins, one hitter batting over .300 and no one with 30 homers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our two guys that we rely on a lot are Nomar and Pedro,''  
Saberhagen said. ``It doesn't matter if those guys have great 
years. You've got to have other guys step up and have good years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows the Red Sox can put a contender out there year in  
and year out, even though we lost one of our most recognizable 
players,'' general manager Dan Duquette said, referring to losing 
Vaughn, but who acquired Mercker, Beck and designated hitter Butch 
Huskey for the stretch run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, we won one playoff game. This year, we'd like to  
win a lot of playoff games.''

<HEADLINE> New Bank To Target Gay Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- The first bank to cater to a national  
homosexual market has opened its doors in Pensacola and will begin 
doing business Oct. 11 on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	G&AMP;L Bank -- the initials stand for gay and lesbian -- is among a  
small number of Internet-focused banks and the first to obtain a 
thrift charter for Internet lending, founder Steven Dunlap said 
Wednesday. Its sole walk-in office began operating last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Homophobia runs rampant in the banking industry,'' said G. Kay  
Griffin, the bank's chairwoman, president and chief executive 
officer. ``Many banks think a couple needs to have a marriage 
certificate to show that they are creditworthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet operations will be open around the clock, seven  
days a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank investors David Richbourg and Norman Ricks, both retired  
businessmen, were the first same-sex couple to open a joint 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the first time we were able to go into a bank as a  
couple, and be treated with the same respect that other couples 
have been treated in the past,'' Richbourg said. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Ricks have been together for 26 years.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every time we bought property together or applied for a loan,  
it was always candy-coated that we were business partners, and in 
some areas, it was frowned upon that we were borrowing together,'' 
Richbourg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank is capitalized at about $19 million with 70  
stockholders. Demographic surveys suggest about 21 million 
homosexuals live in the United States with $800 billion in spending 
power.

<HEADLINE> Mazda To Pay $5.25 Million Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mazda will pay $5.25 million to settle charges  
it violated government agreements requiring that the automaker 
clearly disclose important car leasing terms in its advertising, 
federal regulators said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil penalties include a $4.05 million fine, the largest  
obtained by the Federal Trade Commission's bureau of consumer 
protection, for what the FTC said was a failure to abide by a 
February 1997 agency order about Mazda's advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda also agreed to pay a total of $1.2 million in fines and  
costs to 24 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint and consent decree were filed Thursday in U.S.  
District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Mazda Motor of America Inc. agreed Thursday to pay a  
$900,000 penalty and to modify its reporting of emission control 
defects in order to settle allegations it violated the Clean Air 
Act, the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department and the Environmental Protection Agency filed the  
settlement in U.S. District Court here to resolve civil claims that 
Mazda failed to promptly report defective emission control devices 
in its MPV minivans. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda, based in Irvine, Calif., said it has sought to comply  
with lease disclosure requirements and has put into practice new 
procedures to ensure full compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The earlier FTC order prohibited Mazda's television ads from  
misrepresenting the total due at lease inception and from 
highlighting only the most attractive terms of the lease -- such as 
low monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement also required Mazda to make a number of  
disclosures before it could state the amount of any payment. They 
included a clear and conspicuous disclosure that the transaction 
advertised is a lease, the total amount due at lease inception and 
whether a security deposit is required. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said Mazda continued to run ads in violation of the  
order until early 1998. For example, the disclosures were in small 
and unreadable print, offset by distracting images or sounds, or 
appeared on the screen for too short a time, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This substantial penalty should not only deter future  
violations of the commission's order by Mazda, but send a strong 
signal to everyone in the automobile industry -- manufacturers, 
dealers and advertising agencies -- that important leasing 
information cannot be buried in fine print,'' said Jodie Bernstein, 
director of the bureau of consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda said in a statement that consumers who leased cars between  
February 1997 and early 1998 were informed of the complete terms 
and conditions before signing any deal. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlement, the Mazda will distribute a consumer  
education brochure on vehicle leasing through its 750 U.S. dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda Motor of America Inc., doing business as Mazda North  
American Operations, is a subsidiary of Mazda Motor Corp. of 
Hiroshima, Japan.

<HEADLINE> Variety of Winners on NASCAR Tracks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Elliott Sadler would like to see the  
recent run of first-time winners continue Sunday at Martinsville 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	That would give the Winston Cup rookie at least a shot at his  
first checkered flag in NASCAR's top series. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team's probably good enough to do it, but probably not me  
yet,'' said Sadler, who drives for the Wood Brothers, whose race 
shop is just a few miles up the road in Stuart, Va. ``I'm going to 
try to force the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Considering that the last 11 short track races in Winston Cup  
have produced 11 different winners, it appears that anything is 
possible going into the NAPA AutoCare 500, the last of eight events 
this season on tracks shorter than one mile. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to make the show and run 500 laps on Sunday.  
That's our goal,'' said Sadler, whose season had been overshadowed 
by fellow rookie Tony Stewart, who picked up a win last month in 
Richmond, Va., and is fourth in the points. 
</P>
<P>
	Sadler is 24th in the standings and has managed only one top-10  
finish so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can finish in the lead lap, we're going to be happy,''  
Sadler said. ``But, anything can happen at this place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The list of short track winners since the 1998 spring race in  
Bristol, Tenn., includes Ricky Rudd, the defending winner in the 
fall race in Martinsville, as well as Jeff Gordon, Bobby Hamilton, 
Terry Labonte, Mark Martin, Jeff Burton, Rusty Wallace, John 
Andretti, Dale Jarrett, Dale Earnhardt and rookie Tony Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that it's just that the competition is that good  
now,'' said Jarrett, who went into today's opening of practice and 
qualifying holding a 257-point lead over Martin in the season 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-generation NASCAR star says there are so many drivers  
so close in competition these days that when ``somebody hits on 
something for a particular race and gets good track position at the 
end of the race'' he can get an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett says that isn't true just on the short tracks, either.  
He points out there have been 11 different winners in the first 27 
races this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You talk about parity in other sports,'' he said. ``I think we  
have that much here that when you get on short tracks where 
handling is the total key, that you don't have too many other 
things. (Aerodynamics) don't matter that much. The engine 
combination or having a lot of horsepower doesn't come into play 
that much, so you bring more people into the mix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudd, who hasn't won since taking the race here last year, needs  
to win in the final seven events of this season to extend his 
string of 16 straight years with at least one victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time winner on Martinsville's .533-mile oval runs his  
own team and says that having a one-car operation is a handicap at 
most tracks in this day of rich, multi-car teams. But not at the 
short ovals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these teams are putting millions of dollars a year in  
an aerodynamic program, and those millions spent make a big 
difference at tracks like Dover or a Charlotte or an Atlanta or 
Michigan,'' Rudd said. ``But that does absolutely no good for a 
Martinsville or a Bristol. At those type of tracks, that money is 
not money wisely spent because you can just about rule out 
aerodynamics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin has what he thinks is a simple explanation for the  
procession of winners here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Martinsville is really, really, really tough. When you put 43  
cars on that track, that's about 10 cars more than what you'd 
really like to see out there.''

<HEADLINE> Marriott To Buy Back 10.6M Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Marriott International Inc. on Thursday  
announced it was buying back 10.6 million shares worth more than 
$320 million and reported third-quarter earnings up 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotel and real estate firm credited cost control for the  
increased earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a press release, the company said it has bought back 5.6  
million shares this year and will buy 10.6 million more shares from 
time to time in the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	Marriott had about 246 million shares outstanding as of Sept.  
10. Shares opened Thursday at $32.12 1/2 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotel and lodging real estate company reported net income of  
$96 million for the quarter ending Sept. 10, compared to $86 
million in the same period a year ago. Per share earnings were 36 
cents, compared to 32 cents in the corresponding quarter a year 
ago, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $2 billion, up 11 percent from $1.8 billion in same  
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and CEO J.W. Marriott Jr. said the company's flagship  
brand -- Marriott Hotels, Resorts and Suites -- achieved higher 
profit margins through tight cost controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritz-Carlton, the company's luxury brand hotel, had a strong  
summer, he said. Occupancy at the 35 Ritz-Carlton hotels was 79.7 
percent, up 5.9 percentage points from the same quarter a year ago. 
The chain's 11,600 rooms rented for an average of $196.79.

<HEADLINE>  Stockton, Hornacek Sign With Jazz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- John Stockton and Jeff Hornacek will  
return to take another shot at winning an NBA title, eager to give 
the Utah Jazz as much time as their aging bodies allow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz on Thursday announced that Stockton, 37, signed a  
two-year contract and Hornacek, 36, agreed to a one-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	It remains to be seen whether the oldest backcourt in the NBA  
can lead Utah back to the NBA Finals, in which Utah lost in 1997 
and 1998. Both players made it clear they're coming back to pursue 
the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go for it. You're always trying to win a championship,''  
Hornacek said when asked if this season marks his last chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms weren't disclosed for either contract. Published reports  
say Stockton, the NBA's career leader in assists and steals, will 
be paid $22 million while Hornacek's deal is worth $5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Jazz owner Larry Miller said during a news conference that he  
negotiated directly with the players, as he has done for years. 
Stockton said he was never concerned he wouldn't get a good deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of faith in each other,'' Stockton said. ``I  
really had a restful summer even though I was unemployed the whole 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, forward Karl Malone signed a four-year, $66.5  
million contract. With Stockton and Hornacek back, Utah is 
committed to the trio that took the team to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone turned 36 in July. Although the clock has been ticking on  
the Jazz for years, it's clear from the length of the Stockton and 
Hornacek contracts the stroke of midnight can't be too far away. 
</P>
<P>

a little on Thursday but didn't recant.

<HEADLINE>  Stockton, Hornacek Sign With Jazz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- John Stockton and Jeff Hornacek will  
return to take another shot at winning an NBA title, eager to give 
the Utah Jazz as much time as their aging bodies allow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz on Thursday announced that Stockton, 37, signed a  
two-year contract and Hornacek, 36, agreed to a one-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	It remains to be seen whether the oldest backcourt in the NBA  
can lead Utah back to the NBA Finals, in which Utah lost in 1997 
and 1998. Both players made it clear they're coming back to pursue 
the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go for it. You're always trying to win a championship,''  
Hornacek said when asked if this season marks his last chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms weren't disclosed for either contract. Published reports  
say Stockton, the NBA's career leader in assists and steals, will 
be paid $22 million while Hornacek's deal is worth $5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Jazz owner Larry Miller said during a news conference that he  
negotiated directly with the players, as he has done for years. 
Stockton said he was never concerned he wouldn't get a good deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of faith in each other,'' Stockton said. ``I  
really had a restful summer even though I was unemployed the whole 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, forward Karl Malone signed a four-year, $66.5  
million contract. With Stockton and Hornacek back, Utah is 
committed to the trio that took the team to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone turned 36 in July. Although the clock has been ticking on  
the Jazz for years, it's clear from the length of the Stockton and 
Hornacek contracts the stroke of midnight can't be too far away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all realize this is coming to an end,'' Stockton said.  
</P>
<P>
	Miller said just as he rooted for John Elway to win the Super  
Bowl, he's hopeful that Malone, Stockton and Hornacek can win the 
NBA title before they retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all important to the Jazz, to be sure, but also for  
what they mean to the game, these guys deserve to win a 
championship,'' Miller said.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Victims Get Tax Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taxpayers along the East Coast affected by  
Hurricane Floyd will have more time to file returns or make 
payments, the Internal Revenue Service announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In all counties declared disaster or emergency areas, taxpayers  
will now have until Oct. 15 to file returns or make payments if 
they were due on or after Sept. 14. In addition, penalties for late 
employment or excise tax deposits will be waived if those deposits 
are made by Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	In six hard-hit states -- Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, North  
Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia -- the new deadline is even 
later, on Jan. 31, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS previously suspended audits, seizures and levies in  
places affected by the storm and provided help for taxpayers who 
want to claim uninsured losses on either 1998 amended returns or on 
their 1999 returns.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals' Rice Has Heart Ailment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona Cardinals defensive end Simeon Rice  
missed practice Thursday after developing an irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Vince Tobin said doctors didn't immediately rule Rice out  
of Sunday's game against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I understand right now, they think he'll be able to  
play, but he has to be examined tomorrow morning,'' Tobin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice's condition was described as atrial fibrillation -- a rapid,  
uncoordinated series of contractions that could interfere with 
blood flow. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, the No. 3 choice in the 1996 draft, leads the Cardinals  
this season with three sacks in three games. If he is unable to 
play, he will be the third starter from last year's defensive line 
to miss a game. Defensive tackles Eric Swann, who is recovering 
from knee surgery, and Mark Smith missed the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith ended his holdout last week and played briefly in a 24-10  
loss to San Francisco on Monday, bruising a knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin said Smith had fluid on the knee this week, but was  
expected to play against Dallas.

<HEADLINE> Expanding Economy Benefits Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The percentage of children living in poverty  
sank to a near 20-year low and the overall poverty rate in the 
South was at a record low as American household incomes rose in 
1998 for the fourth straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	The median income -- meaning half of households earned more and  
half less -- rose by about $1,300 last year to $38,900, the Census 
Bureau said Thursday in its annual income and poverty report. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a 3.5 percent increase in a year, tied for the largest  
since 1978, allowing American families more money for things that 
matter -- sending their children to college, buying a home, 
purchasing a car, saving for retirement,'' President Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jump finally pushed household income above where it was in  
1989, the year before the nation slid into its most recent 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The current economic upswing, which began in 1991, took until  
1997 to raise incomes back to 1989 levels. Last year -- the eighth 
year of what has become the nation's longest peacetime economic 
expansion -- incomes finally surpassed 1989, by 2.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a million fewer Americans had incomes below the  
federal poverty level in 1998 -- 34.5 million compared with 35.6 
million in 1997. That pulled the poverty rate down from 13.3 
percent to 12.7 percent -- about the same, statistically speaking, 
as the 13.1 percent rate of pre-recession 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the poverty level was $16,700 for a family of four and  
$8,300 for an individual. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the Americans climbing out of poverty in 1998  
-- nearly 650,000 -- were children under 18 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	The poverty rate among children sunk to 18.9 percent last year  
from 19.9 percent in 1997, the first time it has been below 20 
percent by a statistically significant margin since 1980. However, 
children still have the highest poverty rate of any age group. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly is very good that child poverty is down, but  
there remain 13.5 million children living in poverty in this 
country,'' said Deborah Weinstein, director of the Children's 
Defense Fund's family income division. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinstein said 3 million of those poor children live in  
households headed by an adult that works full time, according to 
calculations based on the new Census figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Families are struggling with low wages and the message is if  
we want families who are doing their part to work -- if we want them 
to get out of poverty -- we have to do our part. That means help 
with child care, transportation, food stamps,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	By region, the South -- historically the poorest part of the  
country -- is now leading the nation's decline in poverty. In 1998, 
the poverty rate in the South fell to a record low of 13.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Southerners, even more those living in other regions, are seeing  
a shift to industries requiring more skilled workers and increased 
emphasis on training to fill those higher paying jobs, said Steven 
Cochrane, an economist with Regional Financial Associates in West 
Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see it from the high tech industries in Raleigh-Durham, to  
banking in Charlotte, to the auto industry moving into Alabama,'' 
said Cochrane. 
</P>
<P>
	Poverty rates in the West have almost matched the South since  
1994, holding at 14 percent in 1998. There also was little change 
in poverty rates in the Northeast and Midwest last year -- 12.3 
percent and 10.3 percent, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the poverty rate among Hispanic Americans in 1998  
fell to 25.6 percent from 27.1 percent; for whites, it declined to 
8.2 percent from 8.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The poverty rate for blacks stayed about the same, holding at a  
record low of 26.1 percent reached last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census Bureau said the gap between the wealthiest and  
poorest Americans remained essentially the same between 1997 and 
1998, as it has since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference between men's and women's earnings did not change  
much either, with women earning 73 cents for every dollar earned by 
men, compared with 74 cents in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Median income rose in all four regions of the country, with the  
biggest increase in the Midwest: 4.4 percent to $40,600. Incomes in 
the West increased 3 percent to $41,000; by 2.8 percent to $40,600 
in the Northeast and by 2.6 percent to $35,800 in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen states showed significant increases in median income  
when two-year averages, for 1996-97 and 1997-98, were compared: 
Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Minnesota, 
Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Utah, Vermont, 
Washington and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	By the same measure, the median income decreased only in Alaska,  
although incomes in that state remain among the highest in the 
country, at close to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The poverty rate dropped significantly in two states, New Mexico  
and Virginia, while one state, North Dakota, showed an increase.

<HEADLINE> Nieman Foundation Curator Leaving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Bill Kovach, curator of the Nieman  
Foundation at Harvard University since 1989, will step down from 
the post in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Kovach, 67, cited ``personal and practical'' reasons in a letter  
sent to the foundation's advisory board this week, including a wish 
to spend more time with his family. He also said he wanted to step 
aside for a curator with broader knowledge of communications 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have struggled to keep abreast of this change and what it  
means to the fellows who come to the Nieman experience,'' Kovach 
said. ``But I grow distant from direct experience. The university 
and future fellows are, as we say these days, ready for an 
upgrade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kovach said his plans include writing books, including a memoir.  
</P>
<P>
	Working journalists in the United States and abroad are selected  
for Nieman fellowships for an academic year of study at Harvard. 
The fellowships were established in 1938 through a bequest of Agnes 
Wahl Nieman in memory of her husband, Lucius, founder and publisher 
of The Milwaukee Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four journalists are participating this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Kovach came to Harvard as a Nieman fellow himself in 1988 after  
resigning as editor of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	He was named curator in August 1989.  
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Kovach has been the very model of a curator for the  
Nieman Foundation,'' Harvard President Neil L. Rudenstine said. 
``He commands instant respect in this country and abroad and has 
constantly enhanced the quality and the reach of the Nieman Fellows 
program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before he became editor in Atlanta in 1986, he was a reporter at  
the Johnson City (Tenn.) Press-Chronicle and The Tennessean in 
Nashville and a reporter, editor and Washington bureau chief of The 
New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudenstine will select a successor.

<HEADLINE> Trump Criticizes Political Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donald Trump says he is considering a run for  
the White House not out of vanity but because ``I am convinced the 
major parties have lost their way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an opinion column published in Thursday's editions of The  
Wall Street Journal, Trump cited two reasons for a possible 
presidential candidacy, mostly likely as a Reform Party candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``First,'' he said, ``Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura has strongly  
encouraged me to seek the nomination, and I highly respect Jesse as 
the embodiment of the political qualities America needs and voters 
reward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reason No. 2 was Pat Buchanan, who is considering bolting the  
Republican presidential race to seek the Reform Party nomination. 
``He has the virtue of plain speaking, but he often says stupid 
things,'' Trump said. 
</P>
<P>
	He took issue with the current crop of presidential candidates  
for being slow to react to Buchanan's controversial comments about 
World War II. ``They are so concerned with winning votes that they 
cannot even find it in themselves to immediately denounce a man who 
winks at barbarism,'' Trump said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump was not available Thursday for interviews, said his  
spokeswoman, Norma Foerderer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans are captives of their right wing. The  
Democrats are captives of their left wing,'' he wrote in the 
newspaper. ``I don't hear anyone speaking for the working men and 
women in the center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would run the country like a business based upon  
three principles: one term, two-fisted policies, and no excuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Touting his years of business experience, he said he has the  
acumen needed to handle the economic downturn some experts are 
predicting for the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	He also made assurances the government would not invest Social  
Security retirement funds in the stock market, calling the notion 
the ``craziest idea'' in American politics since the five 
presidential bids by the late comedian, Pat Paulsen. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said he would cut better trade deals with foreign partners  
and rid the United States of its ``habit of mistaking the easy 
availability of cheap, sweatshop-produced products for solid and 
sustainable economic stability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If President Trump does the negotiating, we'll get a better  
deal for American workers and their families, and our economy will 
not be as vulnerable to global pressures as it is today. Watch our 
trade deficit dwindle,'' he promised. 
</P>
<P>
	And don't expect Trump to play Mr. Nice Guy to foreign  
adversaries. North Korea would learn ``its worthless promises of 
civilized behavior would cut no ice.'' And Cuba would see a 
reversal in its recent improved relations with the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normalization is pure lunacy,'' Trump said, particularly with  
``the most abnormal political figure in our hemisphere: Fidel 
Castro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said he will run only if he becomes convinced that he can  
win, ``a decision I will make later this year.''

<HEADLINE> There May Be Diamonds in Planets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Think the sky at night twinkles like diamonds?  
Well, there may be real diamonds hidden beneath the clouds of 
Neptune and Uranus. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, are trying  
to figure out just what the interiors of those giant gaseous 
planets are like -- and a new experiment suggests they may be 
diamond factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Physicist Laura Robin Benedetti set out to study how methane, a  
major constituent of these planets, reacts under certain 
conditions. She first exposed methane to intense pressure like that 
expected in the planets' interior, and then shot a laser through it 
to reach the huge temperature of 3,000 degrees Kelvin. 
</P>
<P>
	The methane broke down into two different forms of carbon,  
including flecks of diamond, she reports Friday in the journal 
Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Methane may make up 10-15 percent of Neptune's mass, she wrote.  
That's a lot of material for making diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Understanding this kind of chemical reaction can help scientists  
learn what these faraway planets really are like, as well as help 
``obtain a general understanding of planet formation and 
evolution,'' Benedetti wrote. The formation of diamonds on Neptune, 
for example, could be part of a chemical cycle that affects the 
heat produced inside the planet and even its structure.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's jobless rate improved in August, falling to  
4.7 percent from the previous month's record high 4.9 percent, the 
government announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate fell largely on a shift of unemployed men into the  
jobholders' bracket, the Management and Coordination Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless rate for men stood at 4.7 percent in August, down  
from July's record 5.1 percent. The rate for women was unchanged at 
4.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While the total number of jobholders fell by 350,000 to 65.11  
million in August from the year-earlier month, that figure rose 
from July's 64.97 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate had worsened in recent months, increasing  
pessimism about the nation's economy, which is struggling to emerge 
from its worst downturn in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires in Tokyo had forecast  
the overall jobless rate would stay at 4.9 percent in August.

<HEADLINE> Schwarzenegger Has Mulled Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- First Warren Beatty, now Arnold  
Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
	As rumors swirl that the liberal Beatty may run for president,  
Schwarzenegger, a Republican, says he has thought ``many times'' 
about seeking office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The possibility is there because I feel it inside,'' the  
Kennedy in-law said in an interview in the November issue of Talk 
magazine. ``I feel there are a lot of people in politics that are 
standing still and not doing enough. And there's a vacuum -- 
therefore, I can move in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not right now, apparently.  
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' the actor's spokeswoman, Catherine Olim, said Thursday.  
``He is not thinking about running for office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One possibility for the ``Terminator'' star and husband of Maria  
Shriver is the California governorship, which is up for grabs in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidency is out, though. The Austrian-born Schwarzenegger  
is a U.S. citizen, but only natural-born citizens are eligible 
under the Constitution.

<HEADLINE> Encephalitis Virus Kills Five in NY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's quite a scientific expedition -- testing  
birds up and down the East Coast to track the encephalitis virus 
that has killed five people and infected 38 others in the New York 
City area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to look at all kinds of urban birds -- crows,  
pigeons, starlings and sparrows,'' said Andrew Spielman, an expert 
on mosquito-borne diseases at the Harvard School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Nile strain of the virus has been found in dead crows  
in the New York area. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention is now collecting blood samples from city pigeons and 
also looking at ticks as possible carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York's Queens borough, where the first cases of  
encephalitis were reported last month, the CDC and the city's 
health department planned to take blood samples door-to-door, with 
300 households selected at random and on a voluntary basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to get a better understanding of the symptoms caused  
by West Nile virus, as well as possible risk factors for 
infection,'' said Ned Hayes, the CDC's medical epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing the infection might spread with the fall bird migration,  
experts also are testing dead birds from Maryland to Florida. No 
sign of the virus has appeared in those birds, said Roger Nasci, a 
CDC entomologist. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus is believed to have been transmitted by mosquitoes  
that typically feed off birds. Six new cases were confirmed 
Wednesday, including a 79-year-old woman from the borough of Queens 
who died Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have been spraying  
pesticides to kill as many mosquitoes as possible before the first 
winter chills. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Neal Cohen, the city's health commissioner, said mosquito  
density has declined substantially, probably by 90 or 95 percent 
since the second citywide spraying a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The encephalitis cases found in New York originally were blamed  
on the St. Louis strain. But late last month, some dead crows were 
spotted near the Bronx Zoo. Subsequently, 20 zoo birds died and 
tested positive for the African strain, said zoo spokeswoman Linda 
Corcoran. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Nile virus -- never before recorded in the Western  
Hemisphere -- probably entered the United States in infected birds. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms of the strain -- fever and headache -- are similar to  
those of the St. Louis strain but generally are milder. In rare 
cases, the virus can cause neurological disorders and death. The 
elderly, young and those with weakened immune systems are most 
vulnerable.

<HEADLINE> Bucs' Sapp Wins Defensive Honors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay's Warren Sapp was honored Thursday  
as the NFC defensive player of the month for September. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth-year pro, who anchors the NFL's top-ranked defense,  
had 16 tackles in three games and shares the league lead in sacks 
with four. 
</P>
<P>
	``It says that this defense is playing great, and they picked  
the loud mouth out of the group,'' said Sapp, who broke two bones 
in his left hand last week and is listed as questionable for 
Sunday's game against the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll take it. It's just a tribute to all the work that we do  
out here every day, and my teammates around me. I always give them 
credit because without them, I'm just one person out there trying 
to do a job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sapp tied a team record with three sacks in Tampa Bay's 14-point  
victory over Philadelphia in Week 2 and is one of the reasons the 
Bucs have limited opponents to 143.3 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Tony Dungy has held the two-time Pro Bowl selection out of  
contact work in practice this week, but is hopeful that Sapp will 
be able to play at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The lineman's hand and wrist remain in a hard cast that would be  
replaced by a softer version for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to see if I can dupe them into cutting it off  
(Friday) at the X-ray,'' Sapp said. ``But I don't think I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dungy said a decision on whether Sapp plays may not be made  
until Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to say, but my thought is he'll play,'' the coach  
said, adding that the defensive tackle's performance in helping the 
Bucs to a 2-1 start has been worthy of the recognition Sapp 
received. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had a good month. He got off to a good start. He's played  
three very good games for us,'' Dungy said. ``We kind of expect 
those kinds of performances, but I think the accolades are 
well-deserved.''

<HEADLINE> NHL Season Opens Friday Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Dallas Stars do not believe in standing pat.  
</P>
<P>
	When they open the NHL season Friday night at home against the  
Pittsburgh Penguins, they will have a different look from the team 
that won the Stanley Cup in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone will be Pat Verbeek, Dave Reid, Craig Ludwig, Tony Hrkac  
and Roman Turek. Highly regarded prospects Jamie Pushor, Juha Lind 
and Pavel Patera are among those replacing the veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Stars should be a younger, faster team. Not that they'll  
neglect the type of physical defense that helped them win their 
first Cup in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't a whole new offensive system,'' Stars coach Ken  
Hitchcock said. ``This is just a system that's based on more use of 
what we have as a team. We have more speed, so let's make better 
use of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to become more of a team that's going to come out  
cleaner, rather than jam it in areas and try to jam it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Stars are raising the Cup banner in Dallas, the New  
York Rangers will play at Edmonton in the other NHL opener Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's games, it will be Carolina at Boston, Toronto at  
Montreal, Ottawa at Philadelphia, New Jersey at Atlanta, the New 
York Islanders at Tampa Bay, Washington at Florida, Buffalo at 
Detroit, Phoenix at St. Louis, Los Angeles at Nashville, Anaheim at 
Dallas, the Rangers at Vancouver, and Calgary at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	In not bringing back Ludwig, the Stars lost one of their last  
players from their days in Minnesota. The remaining North Stars are 
Mike Modano and Derian Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the fact we lost some players from last year, we have  
a lot of talent left,'' said Guy Carbonneau, at 39 years, 6 months, 
the oldest player in the NHL this season. ``The kids in training 
camp showed a lot of promise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars think that repeating as Cup champions will be  
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was an unbelievable season, going all year being the  
best team in the league and being able to win the Stanley Cup,'' 
Carbonneau said. ``I think the same goal is in our mind this year, 
but we know it'll be much harder than it was last year because 
everybody wants to try to beat the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Edmonton, the Rangers-Oilers game will feature a tribute to  
Wayne Gretzky. Before finishing his career in New York last season, 
the NHL's all-time scoring leader led the Oilers to four Stanley 
Cups during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's action, the Thrashers will play their inaugural  
regular-season game at Philips Arena, one of four new arenas in the 
NHL this season. The others are the Los Angeles Kings' STAPLES 
Center, the Colorado Avalanche's Pepsi Center, and the Carolina 
Hurricanes' Raleigh Entertainment &AMP; Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers have sold more than 13,000 season tickets.  
</P>
<P>
	``The last four or five months, the build-up has been real  
good,'' general manager Don Waddell said. ``I think the city's 
ready for it. We've got a new venue and I think we're going to have 
a lot of excitement in Atlanta.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Hopes Perot Holds No Grudge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George W.  
Bush hopes Ross Perot doesn't hold grudges. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Bush backers are suggesting that allies of Perot are urging  
Pat Buchanan to drop out of the Republican presidential race and 
seek the Reform Party nomination. They fear a Buchanan-Perot 
alliance would create a strong third-party challenge that could 
siphon votes from Bush if he won the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the GOP front-runner, was asked if he agreed that Perot  
was out to get him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard for me to tell. I hope not,'' he said at a Wednesday  
news conference. ``I hope that people enter the political process 
with what's best for the country in mind (and) not ... make 
decisions based on person vendettas. I don't know Mr. Perot well 
enough to be able to tell you whether he's got personal animus 
toward me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he recalled with some detail Perot's last-minute endorsement  
of Texas Gov. Ann Richards in her 1994 campaign against Bush. He 
defeated her to win his first term. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that was an interesting endorsement,''' Bush said  
</P>
<P>
	And he gave Perot partial credit for President Clinton's 1992  
victory over his father, former President George Bush. Perot, the 
Reform Party founder, drew 19 percent of the vote, much of it from 
the elder Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	That same year, Buchanan nearly upset the incumbent president in  
the New Hampshire primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always thought in the 1992 campaign it was hard for my  
dad to get traction in the race because Patrick J. Buchanan and 
then Ross Perot inflicted a series of cuts,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perot, who had been at odds with the elder Bush over  
prisoner-of-war issues, holds no grudges, according to Reform Party 
chairman Russell Verney. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Perot has no personal animus toward George, George W. or  
any other Bush,'' he said. The former president has only himself to 
blame for the defeat, Verney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're looking for the death of a thousand cuts in 1992,  
they should start with ``Read my lips'' and follow up with the 
worst executed election in the history of the country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan and Perot are expected to talk this week by telephone  
about the Republican's prospective change of parties, knowledgeable 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan plans to decided by mid-October whether to leave the  
party.

<HEADLINE> Tough Week To Be an Artist in NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The message on the wall of the Brooklyn Museum  
of Art looked like a traffic sign: ``Danger. ART.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Danger, indeed.  
</P>
<P>
	New York's art world has rarely been more hazardous than it was  
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	A dispute over an exhibit containing a dung-plastered portrait  
of the Virgin Mary threatens to cost the Brooklyn Museum of Art 
millions in city funds. An art dealer was busted for distributing 
live ammunition from an artist's ``bullet bowl'' at her gallery. 
And another artist was arrested after flinging horse manure at the 
Brooklyn museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Artists are discovering the two toughest critics in New York may  
be Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest flap in the centuries-old battle over what  
constitutes art started with Giuliani taking on the Brooklyn museum 
over an exhibit that previously played in London and includes the 
picture of the Virgin Mary and dissected pigs floating in 
formaldehyde. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani ripped the exhibit as ``sick stuff'' and promised to  
withhold $7 million in annual city funding, touching off a court 
battle that remains unsettled. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Thursday, the city made good on a threat to sue to evict  
the museum from a site it has held for more than a century. The 
lawsuit, filed in state court, claims the ``Sensation'' exhibit 
violates terms in a lease requiring the museum ``to educate and 
enlighten schoolchildren and the public,'' and to provide free 
admission on most days. Exhibit tickets are $9.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers on both sides also squared off in federal court, where  
museum attorney Floyd Abrams accused the city and the mayor of 
``seeking to punish the museum for exercising its First Amendment 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Nina Gershon set a hearing for next week on  
the museum's request for an injunction barring the city from 
cutting off funding. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit is still scheduled to open on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, Mary Boone was arrested at her Fifth Avenue  
gallery after visitors to the one-man show by artist Tom Sachs were 
invited to take home a souvenir: a 9 mm bullet. A vase filled with 
100 live bullets was found by police on the reception desk. 
</P>
<P>
	The ammunition was in keeping with Sachs' work -- his signature  
artwork is homemade guns. Police, after determining the guns were 
functional, seized them along with the bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	Boone was charged with illegal distribution of ammunition and  
other misdemeanors. ``This is an outrageous attack on the artists' 
right to express themselves,'' she said after being arraigned late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday afternoon, self-proclaimed artist Scott LoBaido was  
grabbed by police for throwing the horse manure at the Brooklyn 
museum. He said the excrement embodied his First Amendment right to 
protest the upcoming exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	Police disagreed, taking him away after less than five minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm expressing myself creatively!'' shouted LoBaido, who  
charged that the upcoming exhibit was anti-Catholic, as police led 
him off. ``You can't stop me.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Defaults on $6B Brady Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ecuador on Thursday became the first nation ever  
to default on its U.S.-guaranteed ``Brady bonds'' debt, and its 
creditors were undecided on whether to attempt to force the South 
American country to pay the full $6 billion it owes bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady bonds, named after former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas  
Brady, were created to resolve the Latin American debt crisis of 
the 1980s. They are partly backed by U.S. Treasury securities. 
Though other nations have restructured their payments, no country 
before Ecuador has ever defaulted. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were some hopeful developments.  
</P>
<P>
	At the country's capital of Quito, President Jamil Mahuad said  
Thursday that his government had signed a letter of intent with the 
International Monetary Fund for a $400 million loan that could lead 
to $1.3 billion in overall international aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure to make a $98 million interest payment had been  
expected for weeks and should have little short-term impact, said 
Ramon Aracena, an economist with the Institute of International 
Finance in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, however, it could make borrowing harder for other  
developing countries as investors perceive them as being on riskier 
financial ground. Ecuador's prospects for long-term growth could be 
damaged as well, because having assets seized overseas to pay the 
debt would leave the government fewer resources to create jobs, 
Aracena said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Chase Manhattan Corp., which has acted as an  
agent for creditors, counted votes Thursday on whether investors 
should press for full repayment or allow a financial restructuring. 
Chase said the voting was to continue Friday because neither camp 
had the required votes needed to decide a course of action. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador is laboring under its worst economic crisis in 70 years,  
and the South American nation of 12 million people has so far been 
unable to come up with the $98 million interest payment that was 
due Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Mahuad said Ecuador would take advantage of a grace  
period, deferring the interest payment until Thursday and buying 
time to build consensus for restructuring. The deadline passed 
Thursday without the payment. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF officials urged Ecuador to develop a new economic strategy  
and reach a comprehensive accord with creditors before collecting 
the 18-month $400 million credit. The deal hinges on Ecuador 
passing austerity measures and tax increases that most lawmakers 
there oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at United Nations headquarters in New York, Ecuador's  
foreign affairs minister said repairing damage from last year's 
widespread flooding, coupled with the economic hardship of 
declining oil prices -- the nation's primary export -- made it 
difficult for Ecuador to meet its loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Benjamin Ortiz Brennan told the assembly  
Ecuador ``is preparing to commence a process of restructuring these 
obligations that will enable it to share, in a more equal way, the 
debt load among all the actors of this financial relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not provide details, and no one from the Ecuador Mission  
immediately returned phone calls seeking explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem of restructuring is complicated because no  
individual or institutional investor holds a majority of Ecuador's 
Brady bonds, and there appeared to be no coordinated group for 
Ecuadorian officials to negotiate with. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like the old days when the banks made the loans,''  
said Andrew Tuck, of Chase, the acting fiscal agent between Ecuador 
and its Brady investors. ``We live in a different world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuck said investors began faxing instructions to Chase weeks  
ago, indicating whether they favored accelerating Ecuador's debt 
payments -- in effect calling in the loan for full or partial 
payment immediately -- or seizing a portion of the country's 
collateral to make payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Ecuador's total public debt is $13 billion -- expected to  
top 117 percent of the country's gross domestic product by Dec. 31 
-- President Mahuad has said he would limit the debt restructuring 
to Brady bonds.

<HEADLINE> Economic Growth Slows in 2nd Qtr. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy, weighted down by record  
trade deficits, saw growth slow to an annual rate of 1.6 percent in 
the spring -- worse than previously estimated and the smallest gain 
in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	But many private economists believe the slowdown reported today  
by the Commerce Department was only a brief pause. They are looking 
for growth to rebound in the current July-September quarter to a 
sizzling rate of 4 percent or higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.6 percent second-quarter increase in the gross domestic  
product -- the total output of goods and services -- from April 
through June marked the slowest growth since the spring of 1995 
when the economy grew at a 0.4 percent rate. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second report, sales of new single-family homes  
unexpectedly surged 2.9 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 983,000 units, the second-highest level on record, 
the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase occurred despite rising mortgage rates and  
surprised analysts expecting a decline. In July, 955,000 units were 
sold, reflecting a sharp downward revision from the government's 
previous estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were up in all parts of the country except the South. The  
median price for a new home -- meaning half of all homes sold in 
August sold for less and half sold for more -- was $150,800, down 
from $157,000 in July. But the average home price hit a record high 
of $198,300 in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-quarter GDP increase was slightly weaker than the 1.8  
percent rate the government reported one month ago. The government 
had initially estimated, in July, that the economy grew by a 2.3 
percent rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The slowdown came after a surprisingly brisk growth at an annual  
rate of 4.3 percent in the first three months of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to keep the economy from overheating and prevent an  
outbreak of inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest 
rates twice this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed policy-makers next meet Oct. 5, and many economists do not  
expect another interest-rate increase at that time. They cite low 
inflation and no clear interest-rate-increase signals from Fed 
Chairman Alan Greenspan or other key Fed members. 
</P>
<P>
	An inflation gauge tied to second-quarter GDP rose 1.9 percent,  
less than the 2.1 percent the government estimated one month ago. 
In the first quarter of this year, that inflation measure rose 1.2 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The GDP report said economic growth was reduced by 1.36  
percentage points by a second-quarter trade deficit. That was a 
bigger reduction than the estimated loss of 1.34 percentage points 
in growth reported by the government last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the second-quarter trade deficit's drag on the economy  
wasn't as bad as the first-quarter deficit, which shaved 2.23 
percentage points off economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	During the April-June quarter the trade deficit swelled to $34.4  
billion, a little wider than previously thought, as a 15.1 percent 
jump in imports overwhelmed a 4.9 percent rise in exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The surging trade imbalance reflects the impact of the global  
financial crisis, which has cut into American export sales while 
increasing competition on U.S. manufacturers from a flood of 
cheaper imports. However, with economies in Asia and Latin America 
on the mend, foreign demand for U.S. products is picking up. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the government said the profits of U.S. companies  
decreased at an annual rate of $9.5 billion in the second quarter, 
a bigger decline than the $9.2 billion previously estimated. In the 
first quarter of the year, profits rose at a $47.1 billion rate. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to facing stiff price competition from imports, U.S.  
companies are being pinched by increasing labor costs resulting 
from the lowest unemployment rate in 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report today, the Labor Department said the number of  
Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week rose by 25,000 
to 299,000, reflecting the impact of Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	The booming U.S. economy has been powered by robust consumer  
spending, which accounts for two-thirds of total economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said today that consumer spending in the second  
quarter rose at an annual rate of 4.8 percent. That compares with 
an estimated 4.6 percent rate a month ago and with a torrid 6.7 
percent pace in the January-March quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers continue to spend more than they earn, pulling the  
nation's personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage of 
disposable income -- to a record low of negative 1.3 percent in the 
second quarter, the same as previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Business investment rose at an annual rate of 10.8 percent in  
the second quarter. Spending for new homes and apartments was up at 
a 7.1 percent rate. 
</P>
<P>
	All the changes show the economy growing at an annual rate of  
$31 billion in the second quarter of the year, pushing the 
country's total output of goods and services to $7.8 trillion, 
after adjusting for inflation.

<HEADLINE> Ex-GIs Tell AP of Korea Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	From freshly dug foxholes, the GIs looked out over their  
gunsights. Hundreds of civilians, many of them women and children, 
were moving toward their lines, trying to cross to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The young American soldiers, new at the warfront, were wary.  
Orders had come down: No one crosses the line. ``It was assumed 
there were enemy in these people,'' veteran Herman Patterson 
remembers. 
</P>
<P>
	A terrible episode was about to unfold in a ``forgotten war,'' a  
chapter of the 1950-53 Korean conflict that would remain unwritten 
until a dozen ex-soldiers, in interviews with The Associated Press, 
corroborated the allegations of South Koreans who say they survived 
a mass killing at the U.S. Army's hands. 
</P>
<P>
	In late July 1950, the American veterans said, their Army  
battalion killed a large number of South Korean refugees beneath a 
railroad bridge at a place called No Gun Ri. 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-GIs speak of 100, 200 or simply hundreds dead. The Koreans,  
whose claim for compensation was rejected last year, say 300 were 
shot to death at the bridge and 100 died in a preceding U.S. air 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The veterans described other refugee killings as well in the  
war's first weeks, when U.S. commanders ordered their troops to 
shoot civilians, citizens of an allied nation, as a defense against 
disguised enemy soldiers, according to once-classified documents 
found by the AP in U.S. military archives. 
</P>
<P>
	Six veterans of the 1st Cavalry Division said they fired on the  
civilians at No Gun Ri, and six others said they witnessed the mass 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just annihilated them,'' said ex-machine gunner Norman  
Tinkler of Glasco, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	After five decades, none gave a complete, detailed account. But  
the ex-GIs agreed on such elements as time and place, and on the 
preponderance of women, children and old men among the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Some said they were fired on from among the refugees beneath the  
bridge. But others said they don't remember hostile fire. One said 
they later found a few disguised North Korean soldiers among the 
dead. But others disputed this. 
</P>
<P>
	Some soldiers refused to shoot what one described as ``civilians  
just trying to hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 30 Korean claimants -- survivors and victims' relatives --  
said what happened July 26-29, 1950, was an unprovoked, three-day 
carnage. ``The American soldiers played with our lives like boys 
playing with flies,'' said Chun Choon-ja, a 12-year-old girl at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed with new evidence that U.S. GIs had confirmed much of  
their account, the Korean claimants called for a U.S. investigation 
into the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the U.S. government will meet our demands and console  
the wandering souls of those who died an unfair death,'' the 
claimants said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen said today that the claims could  
be examined if there were new evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not aware of any evidence that would support or  
substantiate those claims. But to the degree that any substantive 
information is forthcoming, we certainly would look at it,'' he 
told a press conference in Jakarta, Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. military has said repeatedly it found no basis for the  
allegations. On Wednesday, after the AP report was released, 
Pentagon spokesman P.J. Crowley said, ``We just have no information 
in historical files to lend any clarity to what might have happened 
in July 1950.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AP's research also found no official Army account of the  
events. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Korean government said it will investigate whether the  
survivors' claims are true or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``With keen attention, we'll try to verify the truth of all  
related things concerning the case,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Chang Chul-kyun said. ``Any further action will be decided after 
those efforts are finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reported death toll would make No Gun Ri one of only two  
known cases of large-scale killings of noncombatants by U.S. ground 
troops in this century's major wars, military law experts note. The 
other was Vietnam's My Lai massacre, in 1968, in which more than 
500 Vietnamese may have died. 
</P>
<P>
	From the start of the 1950-53 conflict, North Korean atrocities  
were widely reported -- the killing of civilians and summary 
executions of prisoners. But the story of No Gun Ri has remained 
undisclosed for a half-century. 
</P>
<P>
	Some elements of the No Gun Ri episode are unclear: What chain  
of officers gave open-fire orders? Did GIs see gunfire from the 
refugees or their own ricochets? How many soldiers refused to fire? 
How high in the ranks did knowledge of the events extend? 
</P>
<P>
	The troops dug in at No Gun Ri, 100 miles southeast of Seoul,  
South Korea's capital, were members of the 7th Cavalry, a regiment 
of the 1st Cavalry Division. The refugees who encountered them had 
been rousted by U.S. soldiers from nearby villages as the invading 
army of communist North Korea approached, the Korean claimants 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth week of the Korean War. Word was circulating  
among U.S. troops that northern soldiers disguised in white peasant 
garb might try to penetrate American lines via refugee groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was assumed there were enemy in these people,'' ex-rifleman  
Herman W. Patterson of Greer, S.C., said of the civilian throng. 
</P>
<P>
	As they neared No Gun Ri, leading ox carts, with children on  
their backs, the hundreds of refugees were ordered off the dirt 
road by American soldiers and onto parallel railroad tracks, the 
Koreans said. 
</P>
<P>
	What then happened under the concrete bridge cannot be  
reconstructed in full detail. Although some ex-GIs poured out 
chilling memories, others offered only fragments, or abruptly ended 
their interviews. Over the three days, soldiers were dug in over 
hundreds of yards of hilly terrain, and no one -- Korean or American 
-- saw everything. 
</P>
<P>
	But the veterans corroborated the core of the Koreans' account:  
that American troops kept the large group of refugees pinned under 
the No Gun Ri railroad bridge and killed almost all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just wholesale slaughter,'' said Patterson.  
</P>
<P>
	Both the Koreans and several ex-GIs said the killing began when  
American planes suddenly swooped in and strafed an area where the 
white-clad refugees were resting. Bodies fell everywhere, and 
terrified parents dragged their children into a narrow culvert 
beneath the tracks, the Koreans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some ex-GIs believe the strafing was a mistake, that the pilots  
were supposed to strike enemy artillery miles up the road. But 
declassified U.S. Air Force reports from mid-1950, found by the AP, 
show that pilots also sometimes deliberately attacked ``people in 
white,'' apparently suspecting disguised North Korean soldiers were 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-GI Delos Flint said he and other soldiers were caught in the  
U.S. air attack and piled into the culvert with the refugees. Then 
``somebody -- maybe our guys -- was shooting in at us,'' he recalled. 
The soldiers managed to slip out. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Col. Robert M. Carroll, then a first lieutenant,  
remembers 7th Cavalry riflemen opening fire on the refugees from 
nearby positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is right after we get orders that nobody comes through,  
civilian, military, nobody,'' said Carroll, of Lansdowne, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days earlier, 1st Cavalry Division headquarters had issued  
an order: ``No refugees to cross the front line. Fire everyone 
trying to cross lines. Use discretion in case of women and 
children.'' A neighboring U.S. Army division, in its order, said 
civilians ``are to be considered enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts in the law of war told the AP that such orders, to shoot  
civilians, are plainly illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll said he got the rifle companies to cease fire. ``I  
wasn't convinced this was enemy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He then shepherded a boy to safety under a double-arched  
concrete railroad bridge nearby, where shaken and wounded Koreans 
were gathering. He saw no threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``There weren't any North Koreans in there the first day. ... It  
was mainly women and kids and old men,'' recalled Carroll, who said 
he then left the area and knows nothing about what followed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans directed the refugees into the 80-foot-long bridge  
underpasses and after dark opened fire on them from nearby 
machine-gun positions, the Koreans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans said the heavy-weapons company commander, Capt.  
Melbourne C. Chandler, after speaking with superior officers by 
radio, had ordered machine-gunners to set up near the tunnel mouths 
and open fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chandler said, `The hell with all those people. Let's get rid  
of all of them,''' said Eugene Hesselman of Fort Mitchell, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know if they were North or South Koreans. ... We  
were there only a couple of days and we didn't know them from a 
load of coal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler and other key officers are dead. The colonel who  
commanded the battalion, Herbert B. Heyer, 88, of Sandy Springs, 
Ga., told the AP he knew nothing about the shootings and ``I know I 
didn't give such an order.'' Veterans said the colonel apparently 
was leaving operations to subordinates at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korean claimants said those near the tunnel entrances died  
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``People pulled dead bodies around them for protection,'' said  
survivor Chung Koo-ho, 61. ``Mothers wrapped their children with 
blankets and hugged them with their backs toward the entrances. ... 
My mother died on the second day of shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some ex-soldiers said gunfire was coming out of the underpasses,  
but others don't remember any. None of the ex-GIs interviewed 
supported one veteran's statement that he and others afterward 
discovered ``at least seven'' dead North Korean soldiers in the 
underpasses, in uniform under peasant white. 
</P>
<P>
	Some GIs didn't fire, veterans said. ``It was civilians just  
trying to hide,'' said Flint, of Clio, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	All 24 South Korean survivors interviewed individually by the AP  
said they remembered no North Koreans or gunfire directed at the 
Americans. One suggested the Americans were seeing their own 
comrades' gunfire ricocheting through from the tunnels' opposite 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Relevant U.S. Army documents say nothing about North Korean  
soldiers killed under a bridge or anything else about No Gun Ri. 
</P>
<P>
	The precise death toll will never be known. The survivors  
believe 300 were killed at the bridge and 100 in the air attack. 
Ex-GIs close to the bridge generally put the dead there at about 
200. ``A lot'' also were killed in the strafing, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	One battalion lieutenant located by the AP said he was in the  
area but knew nothing about the killing of civilians. ``I have 
honestly never, ever heard of this from either my soldiers or 
superiors or my friends,'' said John C. Lippincott of Stone 
Mountain, Ga. He said he could have missed it because ``we were 
extremely spread out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In authoritarian, U.S.-allied South Korea, the survivors were  
long discouraged from speaking out. In 1997, in a liberalized 
political atmosphere, they filed a claim with South Korea's 
Government Compensation Committee. But the committee rejected it in 
April 1998, saying a five-year statute of limitations had expired 
long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP reconstructed U.S. troop movements from map coordinates  
in declassified U.S. war records, narrowed the possibilities among 
Army units, then spent months tracing veterans -- some 130 
interviews by telephone and in person -- to pinpoint the companies 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government's civil liability may be limited. It is  
largely protected by U.S. law against foreign lawsuits related to 
``combatant activities,'' although the claimants say the killings 
were not directly combat-related. 
</P>
<P>
	War crimes prosecution appears even less likely. The U.S.  
military code condemns indiscriminate killing of civilians, even if 
a few enemy soldiers are among a large number of noncombatants 
killed, legal experts note. But prosecution so many years later is 
a practical impossibility, they say.

<HEADLINE> College Football Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Bring on the Heisman candidates. Michigan welcomes the  
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Wolverines held Wisconsin running back Ron Dayne  
to 88 yards -- none in the second half -- in beating the Badgers. Now 
they get a shot at Purdue quarterback Drew Brees. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 4 Michigan's matchup with No. 11 Purdue is one of the  
highlights of Saturday's college football schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Saturday, No. 1 Florida State plays at Duke, No. 3 Florida  
is home against No. 21 Alabama, No. 5 Texas A&AMP;M at Texas Tech, No. 
6 Nebraska meets Oklahoma State, No. 7 Tennessee plays Auburn, No. 
8 Virginia Tech is at No. 24 Virginia, and No. 10 Georgia plays 
LSU. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, No. 12 Ohio State meets Wisconsin, No. 13 Kansas  
State is at No. 15 Texas, No. 14 Michigan State plays Iowa, No. 16 
Mississippi State visits Vanderbilt, No. 17 Marshall is at Miami, 
Ohio, No. 19 East Carolina meets Army, No. 20 Arkansas is at 
Kentucky, No. 22 Syracuse plays Tulane, No. 23 Oklahoma is at Notre 
Dame, and No. 25 Oregon is at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend began Thursday night with No. 9 Georgia Tech at home  
against Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Two teams -- No. 2 Penn State and No. 18 Miami -- are idle.  
</P>
<P>
	After stalling Dayne's run at Ricky Williams' NCAA rushing  
record, Michigan's pass defense gets tested against Brees, who has 
completed 107 of 172 passes for 1,315 yards and 10 TDs, and is 
fourth nationally in total offense at 343.2 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw for 405 yards and three touchdowns -- one a  
school-record 99-yarder -- in last week's 31-23 win over 
Northwestern. That victory extended Purdue's winning streak to 10 
games, longest in the nation and longest for the Boilermakers since 
winning 11 straight from 1928-30. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees decided the performance was ``so-so.'' That's because he  
brings a perfectionist approach to his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I should complete every pass, unless I'm trying to  
throw the ball away to avoid a sack,'' he said. ``Having that goal 
makes me a better player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Joe Tiller understands.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes he has a tendency to be a little too hard on  
himself,'' he said. ``He's a very competitive person and he wants 
to be right every time. He actually does believe he can play a 
perfect game and complete every pass. I appreciate that. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's tough on himself right after a game. What's good about  
him is he forgets quickly and gets on to the next game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan has a double-barrel quarterback situation with Tom  
Brady and Drew Henson sharing the work. So far, it's worked for the 
Wolverines, who, like Purdue, are 4-0 and 1-0 in the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida hasn't lost at home since 1994 and its early season  
victory over defending champion Tennessee is testimony to the 
strength of the Gators. None of that scares Alabama defensive end 
Kenny Smith, who boldly predicted a victory for the Crimson Tide in 
The Swamp Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to us to have a good game and break that streak,''  
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	If they do, Shaun Alexander will have to be on top of his game.  
</P>
<P>
	With Dayne's Heisman credentials put in doubt by Michigan, and  
Texas Tech's Ricky Williams finished for the season because of a 
sprained knee, Alexander might be the nation's best running back. 
He has scored 10 of the Tide's 17 touchdowns this season and is 624 
yards away from the school rushing record. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee is struggling at 2-1 after managing only 10 first  
downs and 216 yards of offense in a 17-16 victory over Memphis. 
There also are academic allegations hanging over the Volunteers, 
and co-captain and cornerback Dwayne Goodrich was suspended after 
being arrested for disorderly conduct last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they'll get no sympathy from Auburn, down to third-string  
quarterback Jerry Klein after Ben Leard separated a shoulder and 
Gabe Gross decided to concentrate on baseball.

<HEADLINE> Abbott, Feds Disagree on Test Kits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Abbott Laboratories and the federal government  
are locked in a dispute over how the pharmaceutical company 
manufactures its medical test kits. 
</P>
<P>
	The kits are placed into hospital and laboratory diagnostic  
machines and used to measure patient drug and disease levels. 
</P>
<P>
	If North Chicago-based Abbott doesn't change its practices, the  
Food and Drug Administration could order the company to halt 
production of the kits. 
</P>
<P>
	``If those discussions are not successful, the government has  
advised the company it will file a complaint for injunctive relief 
which would include cessation of manufacturing and sale for a 
period of time of a number of diagnostic products,'' says a 
statement issued by the company.''The company would resist that 
lawsuit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA has refused to comment about its investigation of  
Abbott. But letters on the agency's Web site say quality controls 
involving kits used for several Abbott diagnostic machines are 
suspect. The agency noted the company failed to send a letter to 
customers about a machine's software defect, which had been causing 
incorrect test results to be reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The kits under suspicion are manufactured at Abbott's North  
Chicago plant. The FDA has not expressed concern about diagnostic 
operations at other Abbott plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is still able to make and ship the kits. But Abbott  
contends the dispute could delay production at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	If the FDA orders a production halt, it would not be the first  
time it has taken such action against the company. Abbott last year 
was forced to suspend shipments of its clot-busting drug Abbokinase 
as the result of an FDA investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott is working to meet federal standards for Abbokinase  
production before the product, which had earned the company $250 
million a year, can be shipped again.

<HEADLINE> Economic Growth Slows in 2nd Qtr. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy, weighted down by record  
trade deficits, saw growth slow to an annual rate of 1.6 percent in 
the spring -- worse than previously estimated and the smallest gain 
in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	But many private economists believe the slowdown reported today  
by the Commerce Department was only a brief pause. They are looking 
for growth to rebound in the current July-September quarter to a 
sizzling rate of 4 percent or higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can anticipate a pretty strong bounce back,'' said  
Ken Mayland, an economist with KeyCorp. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.6 percent second-quarter increase in the gross domestic  
product -- the total output of goods and services -- from April 
through June marked the slowest growth since the spring of 1995 
when the economy grew at a 0.4 percent rate. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second report, sales of new single-family homes  
unexpectedly surged 2.9 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 983,000 units, the second-highest level on record, 
the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase occurred despite rising mortgage rates and  
surprised analysts expecting a decline. In July, 955,000 units were 
sold, reflecting a sharp downward revision from the government's 
previous estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were up in all parts of the country except the South. The  
median price for a new home -- meaning half of all homes sold in 
August sold for less and half sold for more -- was $150,800, down 
from $157,000 in July. But the average home price hit a record high 
of $198,300 in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-quarter GDP increase was slightly weaker than the 1.8  
percent rate the government reported one month ago. The government 
had initially estimated, in July, that the economy grew by a 2.3 
percent rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The slowdown came after a surprisingly brisk growth at an annual  
rate of 4.3 percent in the first three months of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to keep the economy from overheating and prevent an  
outbreak of inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest 
rates twice this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed policy-makers next meet Oct. 5, and many economists do not  
expect another interest-rate increase at that time. They cite low 
inflation and no clear interest-rate-increase signals from Fed 
Chairman Alan Greenspan or other key Fed members. 
</P>
<P>
	An inflation gauge tied to second-quarter GDP rose 1.9 percent,  
less than the 2.1 percent the government estimated one month ago. 
In the first quarter of this year, that inflation measure rose 1.2 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were lifted by the GDP report. The Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 49.70 points in late morning trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The GDP report said economic growth was reduced by 1.36  
percentage points by a second-quarter trade deficit. That was a 
bigger reduction than the estimated loss of 1.34 percentage points 
in growth reported by the government last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the second-quarter trade deficit's drag on the economy  
wasn't as bad as the first-quarter deficit, which shaved 2.23 
percentage points off economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	During the April-June quarter the trade deficit swelled to $34.4  
billion, a little wider than previously thought, as a 15.1 percent 
jump in imports overwhelmed a 4.9 percent rise in exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The surging trade imbalance reflects the impact of the global  
financial crisis, which has cut into American export sales while 
increasing competition on U.S. manufacturers from a flood of 
cheaper imports. However, with economies in Asia and Latin America 
on the mend, foreign demand for U.S. products is picking up. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the government said the profits of U.S. companies  
decreased at an annual rate of $9.5 billion in the second quarter, 
a bigger decline than the $9.2 billion previously estimated. In the 
first quarter of the year, profits rose at a $47.1 billion rate. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to facing stiff price competition from imports, U.S.  
companies are being pinched by increasing labor costs resulting 
from the lowest unemployment rate in 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report today, the Labor Department said the number of  
Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week rose by 25,000 
to 299,000, reflecting the impact of Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	The booming U.S. economy has been powered by robust consumer  
spending, which accounts for two-thirds of total economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said today that consumer spending in the second  
quarter rose at an annual rate of 4.8 percent. That compares with 
an estimated 4.6 percent rate a month ago and with a torrid 6.7 
percent pace in the January-March quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers continue to spend more than they earn, pulling the  
nation's personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage of 
disposable income -- to a record low of negative 1.3 percent in the 
second quarter, the same as previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Business investment rose at an annual rate of 10.8 percent in  
the second quarter. Spending for new homes and apartments was up at 
a 7.1 percent rate. 
</P>
<P>
	All the changes show the economy growing at an annual rate of  
$31 billion in the second quarter of the year, pushing the 
country's total output of goods and services to $7.8 trillion, 
after adjusting for inflation.

<HEADLINE> Tough Week To Be an Artist in NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The message on the wall of the Brooklyn Museum  
of Art looked like a traffic sign: ``Danger. ART.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Danger, indeed.  
</P>
<P>
	New York's art world has rarely been more hazardous than it was  
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	A dispute over an exhibit containing a dung-plastered portrait  
of the Virgin Mary threatens to cost the Brooklyn Museum of Art 
millions in city funds. An art dealer was busted for distributing 
live ammunition from an artist's ``bullet bowl'' at her gallery. 
And another artist was arrested after flinging horse manure at the 
Brooklyn museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Artists are discovering the two toughest critics in New York may  
be Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest flap in the centuries-old battle over what  
constitutes art started with Giuliani taking on the Brooklyn museum 
over an exhibit that previously played in London and includes the 
picture of the Virgin Mary and dissected pigs floating in 
formaldehyde. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani ripped the exhibit as ``sick stuff'' and promised to  
withhold $7 million in annual city funding, touching off a court 
battle that remains unsettled. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Thursday, the city made good on a threat to sue to evict  
the museum from a site it has held for more than a century. The 
lawsuit, filed in state court, claims the ``Sensation'' exhibit 
violates terms in a lease requiring the museum ``to educate and 
enlighten schoolchildren and the public,'' and to provide free 
admission on most days. Exhibit tickets are $9.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers on both sides also squared off in federal court, where  
museum attorney Floyd Abrams accused the city and the mayor of 
``seeking to punish the museum for exercising its First Amendment 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Nina Gershon set a hearing for next week on  
the museum's request for an injunction barring the city from 
cutting off funding. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit is still scheduled to open on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, Mary Boone was arrested at her Fifth Avenue  
gallery after visitors to the one-man show by artist Tom Sachs were 
invited to take home a souvenir: a 9 mm bullet. A vase filled with 
100 live bullets was found by police on the reception desk. 
</P>
<P>
	The ammunition was in keeping with Sachs' work -- his signature  
artwork is homemade guns. Police, after determining the guns were 
functional, seized them along with the bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	Boone was charged with illegal distribution of ammunition and  
other misdemeanors. ``This is an outrageous attack on the artists' 
right to express themselves,'' she said after being arraigned late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday afternoon, self-proclaimed artist Scott LoBaido was  
grabbed by police for throwing the horse manure at the Brooklyn 
museum. He said the excrement embodied his First Amendment right to 
protest the upcoming exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	Police disagreed, taking him away after less than five minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm expressing myself creatively!'' shouted LoBaido, who  
charged that the upcoming exhibit was anti-Catholic, as police led 
him off. ``You can't stop me.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees Extend Disabled Fans Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Disabled baseball fans will receive fair access  
to Yankee Stadium for postseason games under an interim agreement 
reached between the federal government, the New York Yankees and 
city officials, U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal requires the Yankees to substantially change ticketing  
and pricing policies, as they had during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The government had joined a private lawsuit that alleged the  
Yankees and the city discriminated against the disabled by failing 
to make the Bronx stadium accessible to those who need special 
accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the club had offered six price levels for the general  
public for regular-season games, including $8 seats, it had 
required those who needed wheelchair seats to pay $26 or $50. The 
$50 seats were the only unobstructed views. 
</P>
<P>
	With the changes, the unobstructed view seats in the postseason  
will be reduced 68 percent for the division series, from $125 to 
$40, 65 percent for the American League championship series, from 
$200 to $70, and 50 percent for the World Series from, $300 to 
$150. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining wheelchair seats and an accompanying seat for a  
guest will be priced at the lowest price levels in the stadium, $12 
for the division series, $30 for the AL championship series and $40 
for the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, those buying wheelchair seats will be able to purchase  
tickets for the postseason through Ticketmaster or through a 
designated operator by calling (718) 537-4432 from noon to 5 p.m. 
on Saturday or between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A trial in the case has been set for Dec. 6.

<HEADLINE> NY Philharmonic Dir. Moving to LA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Deborah Borda, one of the two women managing a  
major U.S. orchestra, is leaving after nine years as executive 
director of the New York Philharmonic to take a top job at the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Borda, 50, will become executive vice president and managing  
director of the Los Angeles orchestra. She replaces Willem 
Wijnbergen, who was abruptly relieved of his duties in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Her new duties include overseeing management of the Hollywood  
Bowl and construction of the new Disney Hall designed by Frank O. 
Gehry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of like running the New York Philharmonic, Carnegie  
Hall and Tanglewood,'' Ms. Borda said Wednesday in an interview 
with The New York Times after informing the New York Philarmonic 
board of directors of her decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I have another great burst of energy coming here,  
and this is where I want to put it,'' Ms. Borda said in today's Los 
Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	She is being paid about $400,000 per year in New York, but  
declined to discuss her new salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Borda reconfigured the New York Philharmonic's  
administration and finances, stepping up fund raising, while music 
director Kurt Masur introduced audience-building strategies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Borda, a native of New York, is a violist and trained at  
London's Royal College of Music and Boston's New England 
Conservatory of Music. 
</P>
<P>
	The other female leader of a major orchestra is Deborah Card of  
the Seattle Symphony.

<HEADLINE> Death Sentence in Rape, Murder Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A man who raped and killed a church volunteer  
after she brought a box of free food to his family was sentenced to 
death Thursday by a judge who called the crime ``shockingly evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Sansing, 31, had pleaded guilty to murder to ensure that  
his wife, Kara, 29, would not also face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Sansing, a former warehouse stocker with a long criminal  
history, admitted murdering the volunteer, Trudy Calabrese, in 
February 1998. Mrs. Sansing, who admitted helping her husband in 
the attack, was sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Calabrese, 41, had come to the Sansings' home after the  
Living Springs Assembly of God in Glendale got a call for emergency 
food from a man who identified himself as John Sansing. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Sansing struck her from behind repeatedly with  
a stick and both Sansings -- who have four children -- tied her with 
electrical cords and gagged her with a sock. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Ms. Calabrese was blindfolded, her head was covered  
with a plastic bag and she was beaten, raped and stabbed. Her body 
then was dragged into the back yard and partially covered with 
cardboard boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple also stole about $1 from her.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeking Ban on Internet Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Trade Organization should impose a  
permanent global ban on taxes and tariffs that specifically target 
Internet commerce, the Clinton administration and some members of 
Congress agree. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation introduced Thursday by Rep. Christopher Cox,  
R-Calif., and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., urges U.S. trade officials to 
work during the WTO's November meeting in Seattle for the permanent 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also says the United States should oppose an attempt  
by any nation to impose the ``bit tax'' on transmission of digital 
data. The tax, which would increase based on the size of a computer 
file being transferred, was proposed recently in a United Nations 
report on ways for developing countries to capture revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure we arrest this threat before it's too  
late,'' Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Internet companies, Cox added, have questioned the Clinton  
administration's commitment to the ban, but Wyden said Treasury 
Secretary Lawrence Summers telephoned to offer full support for 
their nonbinding resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need strong U.S. leadership to develop fair rules and a  
level playing field for a healthy global electronic marketplace,'' 
Wyden said. ``Both political parties have a reason to be 
supportive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 130-nation WTO last year adopted a one-year moratorium on  
Internet tariffs and discriminatory taxes, but several European 
countries have expressed interest in attempting to impose their 
value-added taxes on goods sold online there. France, for example, 
has a 20.6 percent value-added tax on goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan and Egypt, among others, want to ``keep their options  
open,'' Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to get everyone to understand that this would be  
mutually assured destruction,'' Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestically, Cox and Wyden agreed that a federal commission  
appointed by Congress should be left free to recommend future U.S. 
tax policy on e-commerce by its April deadline. But if the 
19-member panel deadlocks or is ``hijacked,'' in Wyden's words, by 
one faction or another, Congress should consider giving it more 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, created as part  
of a law banning new U.S. Internet taxes for three years, is 
divided between members who fear loss of government revenue to 
tax-free Internet business and those who argue that sales taxes or 
other taxes would hamper the medium's growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're interested in is, what can they agree on?'' Cox  
said. ``Naturally, everyone is not in harmony. Anything that group 
could agree on would likely be good policy.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Sued Over Police Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lawyers for a 2-year-old girl whose father  
was shot by police and framed for assault have filed a $20 million 
claim against the city, alleging negligence and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Javier Ovando spent more than two years in prison on false  
charges, depriving his daughter, Destiny Ovando, of even meeting 
him, attorney Gregory Smith said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody who has a child knows that the first three years of  
a child's life are the most important time for bonding,'' Smith 
said. ``I think she's going to suffer greatly from that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the city and the Los Angeles Police Department  
declined to comment. The city has 45 days to review the claim, 
which was filed Tuesday. If it rejects it, the girl's lawyers can 
sue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to set an example that law enforcement officers are  
going to pay attention to,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovando and his daughter met for the first time Wednesday,  
KCBS-TV reported. No details were available, and Smith did not 
immediately return a message left at his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovando was released from prison two weeks ago after prosecutors,  
investigating corruption in an LAPD anti-gang unit, discovered 
evidence that the officers had planted a gun on Ovando and lied 
about the events leading up to his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting left Ovando paralyzed from the waist down.  
</P>
<P>
	One officer has been fired and 11 others put on leave as a  
result of the corruption investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Destiny's mother, Monique Valenzuela, is no longer involved with  
Ovando but hopes that her daughter will form a relationship with 
him. The mother and Ovando have spoken once on the phone since his 
release.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Testify in Cisneros Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a move that could have subjected him to  
questions about his own fidelity and credibility, President Clinton 
had agreed to testify as a defense witness at the sex-and-lies 
trial of former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros, lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was prepared to tell jurors he knew -- before  
naming Cisneros to the housing post in 1993 -- that the prospective 
Cabinet member had made payments to an ex-mistress, said lawyers 
familiar with the situation. Clinton did not think the past affair 
should disqualify Cisneros, the lawyers old The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 22 had been cleared on the president's schedule for his  
testimony, which likely would have occurred at a location away from 
the trial such as the White House, the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros struck a last-minute plea bargain, and there was no  
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said they  
understood the risks of letting Clinton inject himself into a sex 
case so soon after his own impeachment trial, but they said he made 
clear he wanted to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros, who resigned in 1996, was charged with misleading the  
FBI during his background investigation about the size of payments 
he made to ex-mistress Linda Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was prepared to tell jurors that Cisneros had disclosed  
the affair and the payments to him in 1993 and that the president 
weighed those issues and did not think Cisneros should be 
disqualified, one lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's testimony, however, would not have addressed the core  
allegation of whether Cisneros was truthful about the exact size of 
the payments to Ms. Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	The president had no recollection of precisely how much the  
payments that Cisneros mentioned might have been, said another 
lawyer familiar with the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there were earlier overtures, Cisneros' lawyers  
formally asked the president to testify a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Gillers, a New York University law professor, said  
Clinton's appearance at the trial would have been a ``double-edged 
sword'' for both the defendant and star witness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every defendant looks to call people that have credibility,  
charisma and fame in order to impress the jury, so that would have 
been terrific,'' Gillers said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton probably would have faced a grueling  
cross-examination about his affair with Monica Lewinsky and the 
fact that he was the first sitting president ever to be fined for 
lying in a court case, Gillers said. A judge fined Clinton more 
than $80,000 for false testimony in the Paula Jones sexual 
harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prosecutors would have been able to introduce evidence of  
Clinton's own falsity under oath and his misleading statements to 
the American people,'' Gillers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, if I were a lawyer for a client prepared to do that,  
I would tell him his conduct is reckless. It may be the pinnacle of 
friendship, but it is entirely self-destructive,'' Gillers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers calculated that prosecutors would not grill a  
president too extensively about an issue Americans were long since 
tired of -- especially in front of a jury in Washington where the 
president remains popular, the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of the legal team also believed Clinton risked  
another type of embarrassment if he refused to testify for a friend 
and allowed his story to come up at the trial in his absence, the 
lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros and Clinton have remained supportive during each  
other's personal crises. 
</P>
<P>
	When the allegations against Cisneros were first being  
investigated, Clinton said his housing secretary was ``a man of 
integrity and character'' who ``regrets any mistakes he made.'' He 
called Cisneros after the plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros admitted to the FBI when he was being considered for  
Clinton's Cabinet that he had had an affair with Ms. Jones in the 
late 1980s. He also acknowledged he paid her money. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was charged with 18 felonies alleging he concealed  
precisely how much he paid Ms. Jones -- which prosecutors said was 
more than $250,000 between 1989 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros pleaded guilty Sept. 7 to a single misdemeanor, ending  
a four-year, $9 million-plus independent counsel investigation. He 
must pay a $10,000 fine but faces no prison time.

<HEADLINE>  NHL Season Opens Friday Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Dallas Stars do not believe in standing pat.  
</P>
<P>
	When they open the NHL season Friday night at home against the  
Pittsburgh Penguins, they will have a different look from the team 
that won the Stanley Cup in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone will be Pat Verbeek, Dave Reid, Craig Ludwig, Tony Hrkac  
and Roman Turek. Highly regarded prospects Jamie Pushor, Juha Lind 
and Pavel Patera are among those replacing the veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Stars should be a younger, faster team. Not that they'll  
neglect the type of physical defense that helped them win their 
first Cup in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't a whole new offensive system,'' Stars coach Ken  
Hitchcock said. ``This is just a system that's based on more use of 
what we have as a team. We have more speed, so let's make better 
use of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to become more of a team that's going to come out  
cleaner, rather than jam it in areas and try to jam it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Stars are raising the Cup banner in Dallas, the New  
York Rangers will play at Edmonton in the other NHL opener Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's games, it will be Carolina at Boston, Toronto at  
Montreal, Ottawa at Philadelphia, New Jersey at Atlanta, the New 
York Islanders at Tampa Bay, Washington at Florida, Buffalo at 
Detroit, Phoenix at St. Louis, Los Angeles at Nashville, Anaheim at 
Dallas, the Rangers at Vancouver, and Calgary at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	In not bringing back Ludwig, the Stars lost one of their last  
players from their days in Minnesota. The remaining North Stars are 
Mike Modano and Derian Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the fact we lost some players from last year, we have  
a lot of talent left,'' said Guy Carbonneau, at 39 years, 6 months, 
the oldest player in the NHL this season. ``The kids in training 
camp showed a lot of promise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars think that repeating as Cup champions will be  
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was an unbelievable season, going all year being the  
best team in the league and being able to win the Stanley Cup,'' 
Carbonneau said. ``I think the same goal is in our mind this year, 
but we know it'll be much harder than it was last year because 
everybody wants to try to beat the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Edmonton, the Rangers-Oilers game will feature a tribute to  
Wayne Gretzky. Before finishing his career in New York last season, 
the NHL's all-time scoring leader led the Oilers to four Stanley 
Cups during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's action, the Thrashers will play their inaugural  
regular-season game at Philips Arena, one of four new arenas in the 
NHL this season. The others are the Los Angeles Kings' STAPLES 
Center, the Colorado Avalanche's Pepsi Center, and the Carolina 
Hurricanes' Raleigh Entertainment &AMP; Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers have sold more than 13,000 season tickets.  
</P>
<P>
	``The last four or five months, the build-up has been real  
good,'' general manager Don Waddell said. ``I think the city's 
ready for it. We've got a new venue and I think we're going to have 
a lot of excitement in Atlanta.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Raises $24M, Far Behind Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's presidential  
campaign, facing a strong challenge from Bill Bradley, spent almost 
as much as it raised in the last three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign raised around $6.5 million and spent about $6  
million, leaving him with between $9.5 million and $10 million in 
the bank, according to senior advisers who spoke Wednesday on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign disclosed its numbers on the same day Gore  
announced he was shifting the operation from Washington to 
Nashville, Tenn. He called the move ``an opportunity for 
transformation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was expected to release his fund-raising figures today.  
The Gore campaign was braced to learn that the challenger had a 
better fund-raising quarter than the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigns are required to report to the Federal Election  
Commission by Oct. 15 how much money they have raised and spent 
since July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican front-runner George W. Bush has raised more than $53  
million, including more than $16 million between July and 
September. The figure excludes money raised through direct mail 
solicitations and from people who contribute on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other Republicans, Gary Bauer reported raising around $2  
million between July and September, increasing his fund-raising 
total to about $5.4 million. Elizabeth Dole's campaign expects to 
report that her total for the year also had topped $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, the Gore campaign has raised $24 million and spent $14  
million. Because he is accepting federal funds for the campaign, 
Gore is limited as to how much he can spend during the primary 
season to about $40 million, plus legal and accounting costs. 
</P>
<P>
	His early spending has raised concerns that, if he secures the  
Democratic nomination, he will press up against the limits and be 
unable to respond to Bush, who is not accepting federal funds and 
can spend as much as he can raise. In 1996, Republican presidential 
nominee Bob Dole hit the spending cap months before the national 
conventions and could not answer millions of dollars in advertising 
by the Clinton-Gore campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore advisers said the campaign has been spending heavily on  
fund raising, including direct mail, and has hired dozens of 
staffers in Iowa, New Hampshire, New York and California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking down the road, unless he makes changes, he could be in  
the position Dole was in 1996, essentially being unable to spend 
money with months left before the conventions, facing an opponent 
with plenty of money left to spend,'' said Anthony Corrado, a 
professor of government at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. 
``They have to get leaner in their spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gore advisers acknowledged that the campaign was cutting  
spending and reducing the number of aides and amount of equipment 
at events. In addition, as the campaign winds down its fund raising 
later this year, it will be able to move employees to the 
Democratic National Committee payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to Nashville also is expected to result in a trimming  
of campaign staff. It also was designed to shake up a campaign that 
found the road to the White House not as smooth as it once 
appeared, especially in the wake of Bradley's strength in both fund 
raising and polling. 
</P>
<P>
	``You run the risk of looking desperate but these folks are  
desperate,'' former Dole campaign chairman Scott Reed said. 
``They've managed to spend almost 50 percent of their resources and 
they find themselves in a competitive race four months before the 
first vote is cast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a riff on a motto from the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign, Reed  
had this advice for Gore: ``It's the spending, stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore advisers said they would have enough money to wage a  
full-scale campaign through next summer's nominating convention, 
helped by a DNC-financed advertising effort. The DNC recently 
brought in Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell, a top fund-raiser, to 
be general chairman.

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense System To Be Tested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An anticipated collision over the Pacific this  
weekend is seen as the first test of a national missile defense 
system that critics argue could increase -- not reduce -- the nuclear 
threat it aims to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Launching Saturday night from a California base is a Minuteman  
missile that has the potential to carry a nuclear warhead anywhere 
in the 50 states. Some 4,300 miles away in the Pacific Ocean, a 
booster rocket will fire an interceptor. 
</P>
<P>
	If the two collide, at a combined speed of 16,000 miles per  
hour, the force would reduce both missiles to harmless space dust 
140 miles above the earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minuteman, shot out to sea from Vandenberg Air Force Base,  
has a dummy warhead and a decoy balloon. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4,500-mile-per-hour intercepting missile -- a 55-inch long,  
120-pound device that looks like scuba diving equipment -- is a 
Raytheon-built Exoatomsopheric Kill Vehicle that will be fired from 
Meck Island in the Marshalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the land-based protective shield that will cost  
tens of billions of dollars if fully deployed are looking for a 
spectacular success. That would help compel approval by President 
Clinton or his successor, and set the nation on a course of at 
least limited protection against outside nuclear attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The most ardent proponents look to the test now scheduled  
Saturday night as a first step toward reviving a space-based Star 
Wars type system, although that is not part of current planning. 
</P>
<P>
	The limited ``hit-to-kill'' system is designed to knock down  
missiles launched by rogue states or terrorists; it could not ward 
off a multimissile attack from a major nuclear power. The CIA says 
North Korea, Iran and Syria all are developing long-range missiles 
that could hit the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's test contrasts with earlier tests aimed at  
shorter-range launches against U.S. troops in the field. Those 
tests have missed more than they have hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon is playing down expectations for the long-postponed  
interceptor test, although even critics of the technology expect a 
successful collision. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the very first test of a national missile defense  
system. This is mainly to see if we can actually hit something,'' 
said Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, spokesman for the Pentagon's Ballistic 
Missile Defense Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if we miss and we know exactly why we miss, we will  
consider it a success,'' he said in an interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more tests are scheduled before a June 2000 deployment  
readiness review by the Pentagon and a presidential decision on 
initial deployment, expected shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two of the three have to intercept before the Pentagon  
will go ahead with broader testing, Lehner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the outcome, the tests are raising political and  
practical concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This represents a serious misalignment between prevailing U.S.  
attitudes and prevailing international attitudes,'' said John 
Steinbruner, a senior Brookings Institution analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	He compared missile defense systems with the overuse of  
antibiotics, which results in more resistant strains of disease. 
With more weapons and more ways of stopping them, the chance of 
nuclear accident increases, Steinbruner said at a news briefing 
sponsored by the Union of Concerned Scientists, which opposes the 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Deployment of a possible 20 interceptors in Alaska by 2001, if  
approved, would put the United States in violation of the 
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty with Russia, said Steinbruner. 
Further deployments also are being considered for North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the test itself is likely to bring protests from Russia  
and China and increase resistance to any change in the ABM treaty 
with Russia, which prohibits any system designed to defend the 
whole country. The Clinton administration hopes to renegotiate the 
treaty in order to allow a limited system. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the interceptor test is flawed because conditions  
are unreal and too few tests are planned before a decision to 
deploy.

<HEADLINE>  McGwire, Sosa To Go Head-to-Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Just like in the movies, the sequel to the  
great home run derby will try to top the original. It may not quite 
surpass it, but it will come close. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire vs. Sosa, man to man, face to face.  
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs wind up the season with  
a three-game series starting Friday night that would be totally 
meaningless except for the home run title at stake. The Cardinals 
are 11 games below .500, and the Cubs had only three more victories 
than Sammy Sosa has homers entering Thursday night's game in 
Philadelphia, yet there's no denying a certain electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those miracle coincidences that both these guys  
are playing the last three games of the season against each 
other,'' Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. ``What a treat for 
our fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire took the lead for the first time since Aug. 18 when  
he hit Nos. 62 and 63 in a doubleheader sweep of the San Diego 
Padres Wednesday night. He has homered in each of the last four 
games, although he insists his charge has absolutely nothing to do 
with wanting to top Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever wins this home run title, we're both over 60 home  
runs,'' McGwire said. ``So nobody loses, right? 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no `I want to beat him, he wants to beat me.' That's  
not going on, but I know the press is trying to get it going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, who was ahead 55-51 entering September, had a 30 at-bat  
homer drought this month and was one behind heading into Thursday 
night's game in Philadelphia. He was the first player to hit 60 in 
consecutive seasons and the first to beat Roger Maris' 1961 record 
of 61 in consecutive seasons, but just like last year he's trailing 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not Superman. I'm human, just like everybody else,'' Sosa  
said. ``I'm allowed to struggle sometimes. I'm allowed to go longer 
without hitting a home run sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Busch Stadium figures to have at least a semblance of the  
atmosphere during McGwire's record 70-homer season from 1998, with 
the series sold out for months. The scene may more closely resemble 
the lower-key setting for McGwire's 500th career homer last month, 
however, when 50 or 60 outside media requests were filled, instead 
of the 700 or so during the Maris chase at the height of 
McGwire-mania. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what you get with a sequel.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was totally different; last year was a record,''  
McGwire said. ``Here, everybody is talking about a home run title, 
which up until this last year nobody ever talked about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who had 65 homers with three games to go last year,  
believes fans are disappointed there won't be another challenge to 
the record. 
</P>
<P>
	``People, I think, are spoiled from what we've done last year,''  
McGwire said. ``They constantly want more, more, more. It's hard to 
comprehend that what we've done this year is harder than what we 
did last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa echoed those sentiments.  
</P>
<P>
	``The people expect us to go out there and hit a home run every  
at-bat,'' Sosa said. ``They have to understand that we don't play 
by ourselves, there's a guy out there trying to get me out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa has said several times that McGwire's encore is perhaps  
more impressive than his record-setting season, because it would be 
natural for most players to relax after such an achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, with me, no,'' McGwire said. ``I'm just speaking for  
myself, but I would never allow that to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said he's been more mentally weary this year than  
last year, mostly because the Cardinals are winding up another 
disappointing season, and can't wait for it all to end. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also been stung by criticism that 50 home runs isn't such a  
notable accomplishment, noting that only he and Sosa have done it 
the last two years. Ken Griffey Jr., who had 48 and could do it 
three straight years, was the only other player in striking 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I can't understand is people can't accept what's  
happening, they always have to find a reason why it's happening,'' 
McGwire said. ``There's no reason; it's just happening. So accept 
it. Enjoy the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has a combined three homers in 26 at-bats against the  
Cubs' three scheduled starters, Jon Lieber, Andrew Lorraine and 
Steve Trachsel. Trachsel has surrendered two homers in 15 at-bats, 
including McGwire's 62nd last year, Lieber has allowed one homer in 
10 at-bats and Lorraine has walked and struck out McGwire in his 
only two appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa has only one home run in 25 at-bats against the Cardinals'  
scheduled starters. He's 3-for-15 with one homer against Mark 
Thompson, the Cardinals' starter on Friday, 1-for-5 with no homers 
against Garrett Stephenson and 1-for-5 with no homers against Larry 
Luebbers, who gets the call on Sunday.

<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0648 in late European trading, up from

<HEADLINE> Internet Tuition Bidding Offered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A new Internet service wants to treat college  
tuition like an auction, matching students financial ``bids'' to 
colleges willing to offer discounted tuition rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The service, eCollegebid.org, asks students to submit the amount  
they are willing or able to pay to attend college. 
</P>
<P>
	Students also are asked to specify a region of the country they  
would like to be in, an area of study, whether they want to commute 
or live in a dorm and what interests they have. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidders find out the identity of the school they might attend  
only if their bid is accepted. The service is free, and students 
are under no obligation to accept once they are matched with a 
university. 
</P>
<P>
	Founders of Falls Church, Va.-based eCollegebid.org say they  
have identified up to 800 private colleges and universities that 
could participate, and a few have signed up. 
</P>
<P>
	Founder Tedd Kelly would not name them. He said that although  
the service has fewer than a dozen schools signed up at the moment, 
he expects to have many more by Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said the service is targeting schools with leftover seats  
at the end of the admissions cycle, particularly liberal arts 
schools in the Midwest that are likely to take students with SAT 
scores between 800 and 1,000 and grade-point averages of 2.5 to 
2.9. 
</P>
<P>
	Founders say the service appeals to families who make too much  
money to qualify for financial aid, but not enough to pay tuition 
in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce Smith, executive director of the National Association of  
College Admissions Counselors, said the service preys on families' 
anxiety about the high cost of a college education. 
</P>
<P>
	``That there are colleges that are so desperate to get a body  
with some money is the wrong message to send about education,'' 
Smith told The Boston Globe for a story in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	``One would hope that a college is recruiting a student to come  
because they have a good match, an academic environment, something 
that suggests a student should be there other than 'I can afford to 
pay.'''

<HEADLINE> Suit Over Girl's Death Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A woman whose daughter was illegally adopted and  
later beaten to death by the same man has accepted $985,000 to 
settle a wrongful-death lawsuit she filed against several city 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, Michele Launders, refused to comment on the  
settlement. But her lawyer, Joseph Famighetti, said: ``It gives her 
closure and allows her to get on with her life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Launders, who was unwed when her daughter was born in 1981,  
charged that Joel Steinberg, a lawyer, defrauded her when he 
accepted $500 to place the infant with an adoptive family. Instead 
of putting the baby up for adoption, Steinberg took her home to his 
companion, Hedda Nussbaum, named the child Lisa, and killed her six 
years later by hitting her on the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Nussbaum testified that they used cocaine while the girl lay  
dying on the bathroom floor. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, Ms. Launders sued Steinberg, Ms. Nussbaum, the Police  
Department and other city agencies. She charged that the agencies 
knew Lisa was being abused and did nothing to protect her. 
</P>
<P>
	In settling the case, the city admitted no wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Nussbaum, 57, will donate $500 to a children's charity to  
settle the case against her. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg is serving up to 25 years for manslaughter.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. AD Takes Findings To SEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee athletic director Doug  
Dickey on Thursday hand-delivered to the Southeastern Conference 
the school's preliminary findings in an alleged academic fraud 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Four players have been suspended as a result of the internal  
investigation, and Dickey has said that he would like to establish 
the eligibility of the players before Saturday's game against 
Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee president J. Wade Gilley told the Chattanooga  
Times-Chattanooga Free-Press on Thursday that he hadn't read the 
preliminary report which Dickey took to Birmingham, Ala., to 
present to SEC commissioner Roy Kramer, but said there are 
``basically two issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``One is with the individual players. Did they break the  
rules?'' Gilley said. ``And the other is with institutional 
control. An institution can't depend on the head of the tutoring 
department'' to watch the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee was investigating allegations that athletic department  
tutors did schoolwork for athletes, a possible violation of school 
honor codes and NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN reported earlier this week that internal memos show  
high-level administrators in Tennessee's athletic department were 
told four tutors might have done schoolwork for at least five 
unidentified football players, a baseball player and a female 
athlete. Three of the football players have transferred. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this information was passed on to campus authorities  
charged with investigating possible rules infractions, university 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	If that was the case, punishment could be forthcoming.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now you would involve institutional control and if that is  
found, then you'd be talking about major violations,'' said Jim 
McCullough, the SEC's associate commissioner for eligibility, 
financial aid and NCAA rules interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
	McCullough said how quickly Tennessee gets a response depends on  
what's in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the investigation shows, and we agree, that there's no  
violation, then we wouldn't send the report on (to the NCAA),'' he 
said. ``If we find, in our best estimation, that there is a 
violation, we would support an athletic department's investigation 
and forward it to the NCAA.''

<HEADLINE> Greyhound To Install Bus Lifts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Greyhound Lines Inc. reached an agreement with  
the Justice Department today under which the bus company will begin 
phasing in lift-equipped buses for disabled passengers two years 
before it is required to have them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said the out-of-court agreement also  
makes other improvements in service for disabled riders and 
resolves a number of complaints that Greyhound drivers and 
employees had violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by 
discriminating against the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the complaints involved refusal to aid a disabled person  
in boarding a bus, injuries that occurred when disabled riders were 
carried on or off buses or other mistreatment, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carrying people with disabilities onto buses is often  
dangerous and humiliating,'' said Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant 
attorney general in charge of the civil rights division. ``This 
agreement is an important step towards eliminating carrying in 
intercity transportation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee added that the agreement is important for disabled people  
because ``intercity bus service is often the only affordable form 
of transportation for many people with disabilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Department of Transportation rules require that Greyhound and  
all other bus operators provide lift-equipped bus service on 48 
hours notice, beginning Oct. 28, 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greyhound agreed to take two steps before that deadline:  
</P>
<P>
	--Between now and March 31, 2000, Greyhound will begin providing  
lift-equipped buses or station-based boarding devices along its 
major routes and will try to make them available on its other 
routes if passengers call Greyhound's toll-free ADA Hotline, 
1-800-752-4841, 48 hours before they travel. At first, the company 
does not expect to be able to fill all requests for equipment but 
will still provide assistance, by carrying if necessary, to get on 
and off at all stops, including for rest and meals. 
</P>
<P>
	--Beginning April 1, 2000, Greyhound's ``Access Greyhound''  
program will guarantee accessible buses between any of the 2,600 
locations it serves if it has 48 hours notice -- except when there 
are sudden breakdowns in the bus or the lift, an unforeseen lack of 
trained personnel, an unusually high demand or the service at a 
particular site would be very costly. The company will still 
provide assistance even if a lift-equipped bus cannot be found. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in October 2001, all newly purchased or leased buses  
will have lifts and Greyhound will provide lift-equipped buses 
between any locations on 48 hours' notice. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also agreed to train all its employees in assisting  
disabled riders, set up an internal dispute resolution procedure to 
handle complaints from disabled riders within 90 days, inform 
passengers of their rights, set up an advisory committee of 
disability rights advocates and remove other barriers in Greyhound 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Greyhound will pay more than $17,500 in damages,  
including payments from $500 to $4,000 to 14 individuals who 
complained about its service. These include allegations by people 
who said they were refused passage or boarding assistance because 
of their impaired vision or mobility, were inappropriately carried 
on or off buses or were verbally harassed.

<HEADLINE> ABC Tackles Falling NHL Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It's no secret the NHL has struggled to lure TV viewers. After  
Fox tried for five seasons, now it's ABC's turn, and their strategy 
is cross-promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC, along with fellow Disney-owned ESPN, will try to halt  
plummeting NHL ratings that have dropped 33 percent since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are an awful lot of markets where they don't seem to  
care about hockey,'' said ABC Sports president Howard Katz. ``And 
we've got to change that. There are plenty of places on the network 
to promote the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katz has vowed to develop player personalities, have players  
make cameo appearances on ABC prime-time shows, and promote the 
sport on both ABC and ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	For Fox, it's a case of ``Been there. Done that.''  
</P>
<P>
	They did profile vignettes for the first two seasons, had NHL  
stars on shows such as ``Beverly Hills 90210'' and promoted their 
national coverage on local NHL games shown on Fox Sports Net. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried all that and our promotional campaigns even won  
international awards,'' said Fox executive producer Ed Goren. 
``Hockey got more exposure in the last five years than it got in 
the 20 years before. It's just not that simple to say more 
promotion will raise the ratings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Disney shelled out $600 million for the next five  
seasons, ABC will only show four regional telecasts in the regular 
season, along with the All-Star game and numerous playoff contests. 
</P>
<P>
	The season begins on ESPN Friday at 7:30 p.m. EDT with a tribute  
and jersey retirement for Wayne Gretzky in Edmonton. The cable 
network will switch to the banner-raising ceremony in Dallas, 
followed by the Stars-Penguins game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew when we made the deal, ABC had contractual  
commitments, but we know over the years that they'll do more,'' NHL 
commissioner Gary Bettman said of ABC's lack of games. 
</P>
<P>
	While both the NHL and ABC expect Disney to make a profit on the  
big-money deal, Fox was unable to do it paying more than half the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every loser says the winner overpaid and every winner says  
they'll make money,'' Goren said. ``If they are going to make money 
off this package, it'll take some creative accounting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although ABC-ESPN won't have the benefit of Gretzky or Mario  
Lemieux, new rule changes should make the game more appealing on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-on-four overtime where the loser receives one point will  
add scoring chances and aggressive play. And players can now be in 
the crease as long as they don't interfere with the goaltender. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of new things,'' said John Davidson, the  
former Fox lead analyst who switch to the studio show with ABC. 
``The four-on-four in overtime and the crease change -- I like it so 
far. From what it seems to me, it looks like the players are going 
for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FINALE?:* Could Chris Berman have broadcast his last regular  
season major league baseball game on ESPN? 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't think so.  
</P>
<P>
	With the two entities in a dispute now in court because ESPN has  
televised late-season baseball games on ESPN2 for the second 
straight season and put NFL games on ESPN, the future of the 
baseball's regular season package are up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball terminated the deal earlier this year, and a trial is  
scheduled for November. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought about it, but not very much,'' Berman said. ``I  
have thought that tonight's (Wednesday's) game could be my last, 
but hopefully we can work it out. The higher-ups at baseball know 
deep down that ESPN is best for baseball and baseball is best for 
ESPN.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *REPLACEMENT PROGRAMMING:* After losing pro football two years  
ago, NBC has had to scramble for replacement sports programming 
during the NFL season. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest certainly won't grab the ratings of a pro football  
game -- not even an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's inaugural ``Gravity Games,'' which comes along five years  
after ESPN's X Games debuted, airs for five consecutive Sunday's 
beginning this week at 4 p.m. EDT. It was taped in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw what they had done and realized we weren't reaching the  
young audience we needed,'' said John Miller, NBC senior vice 
president of programming. ``We've got a multiyear commitment to the 
event.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	TUBE BITS:@ Marv Albert makes his return to NBC Saturday at 1:30  
p.m. EDT when he co-hosts the Basketball Hall of Fame enshrinement 
ceremony. ``I don't look at it as dramatic. It's been helpful to do 
it step-by-step and I'm very thankful that it's all moved back into 
place so nicely,'' Albert said. ... Chris Myers had reconstructive 
knee surgery after being injured in a touch football game, but 
still worked as host of Fox Sports Net's Sunday ``NFL This 
Morning.'' ... Fox Sports Net has passed on televising the 
Outrigger Hotels Rainbow Classic holiday college basketball 
tournament, which had been broadcast on ESPN for the past four 
years. ... CNBC's weekly edition of ``The Olympic Show'' will 
feature NBC Olympic host Bob Costas Saturday at 7:30 p.m. EDT.

<HEADLINE>  Unheralded Red Sox Reach Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Mo Vaughn stood outside his home and pondered the  
Red Sox future after he escaped a stormy relationship with Boston 
management for a new life with the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's never as bad as you think it is, and it's never as good  
as you think it is,'' he said last Thanksgiving eve after agreeing 
to sign with Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten months later, his teammates couldn't agree more.  
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox were expected to struggle without Vaughn, their  
leader and only legitimate power threat. Many picked them for last 
place in the AL East. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, with Cy Young Award shoo-in Pedro Martinez, AL batting  
leader Nomar Garciaparra and a bunch of unheralded players, they 
are in the playoffs for the second straight year for the first time 
since 1915-16. And they have a shot at their first World Series 
title since 1918. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn, 10 months after making his comment in suburban Easton,  
Mass., is finishing a disappointing season with the AL West's 
last-place team. 
</P>
<P>
	The current Red Sox have succeeded without his big bat.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're not a bunch of bombers,'' said closer Rod Beck, a  
late-season acquisition from the Chicago Cubs who added depth to an 
already strong bullpen. ``They hit their share of homers but they 
get on base. They put the ball in play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck was on the mound Wednesday night when shortstop Garciaparra  
caught a line drive and stepped on second for a double play that 
ended Boston's 6-2 win at Chicago and clinched at least a wild-card 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
	With the second game of the doubleheader still to play -- and the  
feeling that the Red Sox were far from their ultimate goal -- the 
celebration was subdued. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope that we stay focused and take a little step  
further than last year,'' Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox were eliminated in the first round of their last  
three playoff appearances, including losing at Cleveland in 1995 
and 1998. They'll open this year's division series next Wednesday 
at Cleveland if the Indians have the AL's best record or at Texas 
if the Rangers overtake the Indians for that distinction. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland has the big names -- Roberto Alomar, Manny Ramirez,  
Kenny Lofton, Dave Justice, Omar Vizquel -- but Boston won the 
season series 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox manager Jimy Williams has done a masterful job juggling  
his lineup so no player sits on the bench for long. There were few 
complaints from players who felt they should play more. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also had to juggle his starting rotation because of  
injuries. Now, it may be as strong as it's been all season with 
Martinez, his brother Ramon, Bret Saberhagen and Kent Mercker. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Martinez, 23-4 and the league leader in ERA and  
strikeouts, would get two starts if the best-of-5 division series 
goes the limit. 
</P>
<P>
	There's even a chance that closer Tom Gordon, who made his first  
appearance since June 5 on Wednesday, could be healthy enough for 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the key to Boston's first consecutive 90-win seasons since  
1977-79 has been contributions from lesser-known players. 
</P>
<P>
	Players like center fielder Darren Lewis, hitting only .242  
after the clincher but with an ability to hit-and-run, sacrifice, 
steal and play brilliant defense. Many of his teammates got a taste 
of postseason play last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time the guys have been through it,'' he said. ``But,  
more than anything, we have to look at the fact that our pitching's 
done so well and we've played good defense all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Boston's best stretch came from Sept. 3-15, when it went  
9-3 on a tough road trip to Seattle, Oakland, New York and 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox began the season with five straight wins but by July  
25 were only 53-46. Since then, they were 38-21 through Wednesday's 
games. They've done all that with only one pitcher having more than 
10 wins, one hitter batting over .300 and no one with 30 homers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our two guys that we rely on a lot are Nomar and Pedro,''  
Saberhagen said. ``It doesn't matter if those guys have great 
years. You've got to have other guys step up and have good years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows the Red Sox can put a contender out there year in  
and year out, even though we lost one of our most recognizable 
players,'' general manager Dan Duquette said, referring to losing 
Vaughn, but who acquired Mercker, Beck and designated hitter Butch 
Huskey for the stretch run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, we won one playoff game. This year, we'd like to  
win a lot of playoff games.''

	``It's never as bad as you think it is, and it's never as good  
as you think it is,'' he said last Thanksgiving eve after agreeing 
to sign with Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten months later, his teammates couldn't agree more.  
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox were expected to struggle without Vaughn, their  
leader and only legitimate power threat. Many picked them for last 
place in the AL East. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, with Cy Young Award shoo-in Pedro Martinez, AL batting  
leader Nomar Garciaparra and a bunch of unheralded players, they 
are in the playoffs for the second straight year for the first time 
since 1915-16. And they have a shot at their first World Series 
title since 1918. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn, 10 months after making his comment in suburban Easton,  
Mass., is finishing a disappointing season with the AL West's 
last-place team. 
</P>
<P>
	The current Red Sox have succeeded without his big bat.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're not a bunch of bombers,'' said closer Rod Beck, a  
late-season acquisition from the Chicago Cubs who added depth to an 
already strong bullpen. ``They hit their share of homers but they 
get on base. They put the ball in play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck was on the mound Wednesday night when shortstop Garciaparra  
caught a line drive and stepped on second for a double play that 
ended Boston's 6-2 win at Chicago and clinched at least a wild-card 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
	With the second game of the doubleheader still to play -- and the  
feeling that the Red Sox were far from their ultimate goal -- the 
celebration was subdued. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope that we stay focused and take a little step  
further than last year,'' Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox were eliminated in the first round of their last  
three playoff appearances, including losing at Cleveland in 1995 
and 1998. They'll open this year's division series next Wednesday 
at Cleveland if the Indians have the AL's best record or at Texas 
if the Rangers overtake the Indians for that distinction. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland has the big names -- Roberto Alomar, Manny Ramirez,  
Kenny Lofton, Dave Justice, Omar Vizquel -- but Boston won the 
season series 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox manager Jimy Williams has done a masterful job juggling  
his lineup so no player sits on the bench for long. There were few 
complaints from players who felt they should play more. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also had to juggle his starting rotation because of  
injuries. Now, it may be as strong as it's been all season with 
Martinez, his brother Ramon, Bret Saberhagen and Kent Mercker. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Martinez, 23-4 and the league leader in ERA and  
strikeouts, would get two starts if the best-of-5 division series 
goes the limit. 
</P>
<P>
	There's even a chance that closer Tom Gordon, who made his first  
appearance since June 5 on Wednesday, could be healthy enough for 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the key to Boston's first consecutive 90-win seasons since  
1977-79 has been contributions from lesser-known players. 
</P>
<P>
	Players like center fielder Darren Lewis, hitting only .242  
after the clincher but with an ability to hit-and-run, sacrifice, 
steal and play brilliant defense. Many of his teammates got a taste 
of postseason play last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time the guys have been through it,'' he said. ``But,  
more than anything, we have to look at the fact that our pitching's 
done so well and we've played good defense all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Boston's best stretch came from Sept. 3-15, when it went  
9-3 on a tough road trip to Seattle, Oakland, New York and 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox began the season with five straight wins but by July  
25 were only 53-46. Since then, they were 38-21 through Wednesday's 
games. They've done all that with only one pitcher having more than 
10 wins, one hitter batting over .300 and no one with 30 homers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our two guys that we rely on a lot are Nomar and Pedro,''  
Saberhagen said. ``It doesn't matter if those guys have great 
years. You've got to have other guys step up and have good years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows the Red Sox can put a contender out there year in  
and year out, even though we lost one of our most recognizable 
players,'' general manager Dan Duquette said, referring to losing 
Vaughn, but who acquired Mercker, Beck and designated hitter Butch 
Huskey for the stretch run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, we won one playoff game. This year, we'd like to  
win a lot of playoff games.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Sitcom Is First Cancellation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC's ``Mike O'Malley Show'' earned a grim  
distinction Thursday by becoming the first of the season's three 
dozen new series to be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	A terse announcement from NBC declared an immediate production  
halt for the sitcom, with no more episodes scheduled for broadcast. 
``O'Malley'' had aired twice, with this week's episode losing 
one-third of the audience that watched its lead-in show, ``Will &AMP; 
Grace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Repeats of other NBC comedies will air in the former  
``O'Malley'' slot (9:30 to 10 p.m. EDT Tuesday) following the 
conclusion of baseball playoff coverage, NBC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starring actor-comedian O'Malley as a 30-ish bachelor trying to  
behave like an adult, the series had been troubled from the outset. 
The pilot was rewritten and reshot this summer, but still got 
dismal reviews. Its Sept. 21 debut shared an inauspicious 54th 
place in the Nielsen ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Thursday, O'Malley thanked his crew and said he  
was heartbroken by NBC's decision. ``Then again,'' he said, ``I 
always wanted to be No. 1, and now I can say I am No. 1 to be 
canceled.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Advance Farm Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Showering favors on key lawmakers' states,  
congressional leaders on Thursday ended the impasse on a $8.7 
billion farm-relief package without yielding to producers' demands 
that they ease the Cuban trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	The farm aid is included in an annual spending bill for the  
Agriculture Department that was cleared for action on the House and 
Senate floors as early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It offers $7.5 billion for growers hurt by a second year of low  
market prices and $1.2 billion for farmers who lost crops to 
drought and floods. Moving separately through Congress is $500 
million for hurricane-related farm losses in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good amount of money that we ought to go with  
quickly,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure was stalled in a House-Senate negotiating committee  
for more than a week because GOP leaders refused to let it address 
the Cuba issue or any changes in new milk-pricing rules. They 
coaxed a majority of the panel's 28 members to endorse the bill 
without those provisions and finally secured the last two 
signatures Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were all over me to get this out of the station,'' said  
one of the two, Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., referring to the House 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the committee's approval was a variety of special  
provisions for the lawmakers' home-state farmers: $125 million in 
subsidies for dairy producers, a requirement that meatpackers start 
reporting the prices they pay for cattle and hogs, and a guarantee 
that livestock producers would get $200 million in drought aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was expected to meet some opposition in the House and  
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have people who are upset about what's not in the bill and  
you have people who are upset about what's in,'' said Sen. Pat 
Roberts, R-Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Eastern senators said that they were considering a  
filibuster because they felt the disaster relief was insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us from the Northeast have voted (for) federal  
assistance for Florida hurricanes, California earthquakes, Oklahoma 
tornados, and now we have a genuine natural disaster in the 
Northeast and we're not getting the response we need,'' said Sen. 
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Democrats and Republicans were angry that GOP leaders  
prevented the committee from meeting and voting on the Cuba 
measure, which had passed the Senate, 70-28. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process was manipulated,'' complained Sen. John Ashcroft,  
R-Mo., the amendment's sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certain elements of the House are more concerned with  
continuing the Cold War than with helping our nation's farmers,'' 
said Jim Dornan, a spokesman for Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash. 
``But we will be back to fight this another day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers from dairy states in the South and East wanted to  
use the must-pass spending bill to overturn a new nationwide 
milk-pricing system that was scheduled to take effect Friday. A 
federal judge on Tuesday postponed implementation of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Midwestern lawmakers, who support the new pricing system,  
successfully convinced GOP leaders to keep it out of the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations Committee may have eliminated some  
opposition to the bill by agreeing Thursday to put in another 
spending measure $508 million for crop and livestock losses in 
North Carolina due to Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a down payment, but it will go a long way to  
meeting the staggering losses our farm families have suffered in 
the flood,'' said Rep. David Price, D-N.C.

<HEADLINE> Caps' GM McPhee Suspended, Fined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For picking a fight at the other team's  
dressing room, Washington Capitals general manager George McPhee 
ended up with a cast on his right thumb, a ripped suit, a $20,000 
fine -- and a one-month suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	McPhee was fined and suspended until Nov. 1 by the NHL on  
Thursday, barring him from games and practices and any business on 
behalf of the Capitals for the first 10 games of the regular 
season. He is believed to be the first NHL general manger ever 
suspended for fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight occurred when McPhee, upset that Chicago had used a  
lineup of brawlers in a fight-filled Sept. 25 game at Columbus, 
Ohio, confronted Blackhawks coach Lorne Molleken. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least two things are clear,'' NHL commissioner Gary  
Bettman, who held a hearing with McPhee on Wednesday, said in a 
statement. ``First, Mr. McPhee made a deliberate decision to 
proceed to the Chicago Blackhawks dressing room area immediately 
following the conclusion of the game with the intention of 
confronting coach Molleken. 
</P>
<P>
	``Second, after a heated verbal exchange, Mr. McPhee punched  
coach Molleken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McPhee was then surrounded and punched by Blackhawks players.  
The arm of McPhee's suit was torn, and police had to intervene to 
stop the melee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both the decision to confront Mr. Molleken in the Blackhawks  
dressing room area and the physical contact which resulted from 
that confrontation were clearly improper and, I find, constituted 
conduct which was prejudicial to and against the welfare of the 
league and the game of hockey,'' Bettman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one, especially an NHL club executive or general manager,  
is free, even in the emotion of the moment, to engage in conduct 
that is clearly inappropriate. Actions such as those engaged here 
by Mr. McPhee will not be tolerated in the NHL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McPhee's duties over the next month will be handled by several  
Capitals officials, with director of hockey operations Shawn 
Simpson acting as the point of contact with other teams on issues 
such as trades. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the decision is harsh, but I understand the  
commissioner's rationale,'' McPhee said. ``This kind of conduct can 
never happen again in this league. Being involved in a physical 
confrontation is unprofessional, undignified and I am sorry that it 
ever happened. I however can never regret standing up for the 
Washington Capitals for what is right in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Washington coach Ron Wilson was fined $5,000 and  
Chicago owner Bill Wirtz was fined $3,000 for violating a gag order 
by making comments about the fight when the league was conducting 
its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blackhawks issued a statement saying it disagreed with  
Bettman's action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dollars cannot be the determining factor in instances of  
vigilantism,'' the statement read. ``A more appropriate method is 
censure ... by vote of the National Hockey League Board of 
Governors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league took no action against the Blackhawks, who had  
several fight-plagued exhibition games. McPhee telephoned Chicago 
general manager Bob Murray several days before the game, asking 
that the Blackhawks use the lineup with more skill players. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the league suspended Chicago defenseman Dave  
Manson for one game for drawing a match penalty for attempting to 
injure Washington's Steve Konowalchuk. 
</P>
<P>
	McPhee was given full support by the Capitals organization.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's our guy,'' team president Dick Patrick said. ``He has a  
passion for hockey, and part of that passion apparently spilled 
over here.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen at midday  
Friday ahead of the release of a central bank survey. Tokyo stocks 
rose as Japan's jobless rate improved. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 105.75 yen, up 0.09 yen from late Thursday in  
Tokyo but below its late New York level of 106.77 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 176.80 points,  
or 1 percent, to close the morning session at 17,782.26. On 
Thursday, the average climbed 323.18 points, or 1.87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, traders were largely focused on the Bank  
of Japan's quarterly survey of business sentiment, due out Monday. 
Lingering worries by traders over an accident at a nuclear plant 70 
miles north of Tokyo on Thursday had largely subsided. 
</P>
<P>
	An accidental nuclear reaction at a uranium processing plant was  
contained early Friday, nearly a full day after a leak of 
radioactive gas seriously injured three workers and possibly 
contaminated 34 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the Bank of Japan's upcoming Tankan survey, economists  
surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires forecast it will show confidence at 
large manufacturers will have improved from the last survey three 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey is a widely watched indicator of Japan's economy.  
Hopes for a recovery from Japan's worst downturn in 50 years have 
been a major factor behind the yen's rally since May. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders also watched the central bank for further signs of a  
change in the central bank's monetary policy amid the yen's recent 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	They are focused on whether the Bank of Japan is prepared to  
boost market liquidity to help strengthen the yen. Japanese 
officials said during last weekend's Group-of-Seven meeting that 
they were prepared to do just that if yen strength continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Monetary easing could weaken the yen against the U.S. currency.  
Japan fears that a strong yen could derail its recovery from 
recession by making exports more expensive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 113.14 yen, up from  
112.24 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices jumped following news Japan's  
unemployment rate for August improved from the previous month, 
spurring further optimism over the country's budding economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless rate fell to 4.7 percent from July's record high 4.9  
percent, the government announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The nuclear accident was having little impact on the overall  
market, helped by the yen's steadiness against the dollar and 
continued hopes for an economic recovery in Japan, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose  
123.47 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,336.95. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 5.03 points, or 0.33 percent, to 1,501.80. 
The TOPIX closed up 91 points, or 2.39 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.7000 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.7100 percent. Its 
price rose 0.09 point to 100.00.

<HEADLINE> Armored Car Robbery Man Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A man has been sentenced to five months  
in prison and five months of house arrest for his role in the $17 
million Loomis, Fargo &AMP; Co. robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Graham Mullen, who sentenced Mike  
Goodman on Wednesday, said he would recommend that he be allowed to 
serve the time under work-release. Goodman also was sentenced to 
two years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman, 28, and his wife, Kim, each pleaded guilty in March to  
one count of money laundering for their role in the 1997 robbery of 
a vault at the armored car company -- one of the biggest heists of 
its kind in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say the couple received $10,000 to help Michele  
Chambers convert $200,000 in cash into a bank check at a First 
Union branch where Mrs. Goodman worked. Mrs. Chambers is the wife 
of Steven Chambers, one of the heist's ringleaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank check helped the Chamberses buy a $635,000 house in the  
weeks after the heist in Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers is serving an 11-year sentence for money laundering,  
bank larceny and conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire. His wife was 
sentenced earlier this week to more seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	All but one of the 21 defendants in the robbery of the Loomis,  
Fargo vault pleaded guilty. The other one went to trial and was 
convicted.

<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A strong earthquake rocked southern Mexico  
today, causing buildings to sway in the capital for several 
minutes. There were reports that at least some people were injured 
when homes collapsed in the southern state of Oaxaca. Mexican 
television quoted local seismologists as saying the quake had a 
preliminary magnitude of 7.4. The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, 
Colo. said the magnitude was 7.5. The quake was 35 miles 
north-northwest of Puerto Angel, a Pacific coast city in Oaxaca. 
The state capital, Oaxaca City, is a popular tourist destination.

another government shutdown.'' He accused the Republican Congress

account of mass killings of South Korean civilians by U.S. soldiers 
early in the Korean war and President Clinton said Cohen ``wants to 
get to the bottom of it.'' Clinton said he was briefed on The 
Associated Press report today. Accounts of South Korean villagers 
and of a dozen ex-GIs who either witnessed or were involved in the 
killings were reported by the AP yesterday. Sandy Berger, Clinton's 
national security adviser, called the report ``obviously deeply 
troubling.''

workers were hospitalized -- two in critical condition -- and 11 
others were contaminated. Fears remain of a possible continued 
nuclear reaction at the plant. The government's top spokesman 
called the accident ``unprecedented.'' About 150 people were 
evacuated from the town of Tokaimura, 70 miles northeast of Tokyo. 
More than 310,000 people were ordered not to leave their homes and 
officials shut down schools and train service in the region.

into the final quarter of the year. On the Republican side, Texas 
Gov. George W. Bush continued to shatter fund-raising records, 
reporting raising more than $56 million through the end of 
September. He has about $37 million cash on hand. Bradley raised an 
estimated $6.7 million between July and September, a spokeswoman 
said today. Gore raised around $6.5 million during the same period,

former Chilean dictator should be sent to Spain to face charges of 
torture. Pinochet, who remained under police guard at a rented 
mansion west of London during the four-day hearing, is supposed to 
attend Bow Street Magistrate's Court for the judgment by Deputy 
Chief Magistrate Ronald Bartle. An official Chilean government 
report said 3,197 people were killed or disappeared after Pinochet 
toppled elected Marxist President Salvador Allende in a bloody 1973 
coup.

``We will be making a grave error if we let the return of relative

whether the nation's largest auto insurer cheated customers by 
paying only for cheap auto-body repair parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissatisfied policyholders are suing State Farm for $5.4  
billion. Deliberations resumed this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say so-called aftermarket parts, which are modeled on  
factory originals but made without factory specifications, fail to 
provide the same level of fit, finish, corrosion resistance and, in 
some cases, safety, as parts made for automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're junk,'' plaintiffs' attorney Don Barrett said  
Wednesday in closing arguments of the six-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
	He contends State Farm deliberately withheld concerns about the  
parts' quality and safety. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm, which covers one of every five cars in the United  
States, insists the parts are good and that they saved 
policyholders $233 million on premiums last year alone. Attorneys 
for the Bloomington, Ill.-based insurer said their opponents failed 
to provide any substantial proof of their claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't even bothered to show you a photo of a bad repair  
to a State Farm customer,'' said Barney Shultz, the company's lead 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accuses State Farm of breach of contract for failing  
to restore customers' cars to pre-accident condition and consumer 
fraud for failing to properly disclose its use of the parts. The 
lawsuit combines the potential claims of 4.7 million current and 
former State Farm policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs are seeking $1.4 billion in damages on the breach of  
contract claim and nearly $4 billion in actual and punitive damages 
for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury must decide whether State Farm broke its contract with  
consumers by specifying use of the imitation parts. The consumer 
fraud count will be decided by Williamson County Judge John 
Speroni.

<HEADLINE>  Timor Peacekeepers Can Cross Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Amid reports of a militia buildup in  
West Timor, Australia said today that peacekeepers in East Timor 
are authorized to cross the border into the Indonesian territory if 
engaged in a battle with militiamen. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia warned peacekeepers against entering West Timor,  
saying such action could lead to a clash between the Australian-led 
mission, known as Interfet, and Indonesian soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Interfet cannot enter West Timor without permission,''  
Indonesian military spokesman Maj. Gen. Sudradjat said, according 
to the Antara news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has bristled over what it calls the foreign troops'  
aggressive style and lack of respect for its sovereignty. About 400 
outraged Indonesian students threw rocks and gasoline bombs at the 
Australian Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital. Three people 
were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want war with Australia. If Australia enters West Timor,  
there will be war,'' protester Yakum Lindo said. 
</P>
<P>
	A smaller protest was held outside the U.S. Embassy as Defense  
Secretary William Cohen visited the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Militiamen went on a rampage of killing and arson in East Timor  
following an Aug. 30 independence vote, forcing hundreds of 
thousands of East Timorese to flee to West Timor, the other half of 
the island that remains part of Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Many were reportedly forced into West Timor. Access to refugee  
camps there has been severely limited, with allegations that the 
militias are conducting a campaign of intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Defense Minister John Moore told Australian  
Broadcasting Corp. radio that the peacekeepers can cross briefly 
into West Timor if involved in a battle with the militias. So far, 
no such clashes have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have intelligence information that says that there are  
numbers there,'' Moore said. ``We don't know what their intentions 
are, but we are prepared for any eventualities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A senior U.S. defense official said Wednesday that pro-Indonesia  
militias -- numbering between 2,000 and 4,000 -- may be preparing to 
launch guerrilla raids on the peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, meeting Indonesian leaders in Jakarta, accused  
Indonesia's military of collusion in militia violence in East Timor 
and said it must change its ways before Washington will restore 
normal ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian military chief Gen. Wiranto denied allegations his  
troops forcibly evicted people from East Timor. ``They 
spontaneously fled from their homes to seek a peaceful place for 
their safety,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But some Timorese residents had a different story to tell.  
</P>
<P>
	``The military did it. They forced people out and they forced  
them onto trucks and they took them somewhere,'' said Joao da 
Conceao da Silva, whose sister and brother are among thousands who 
he claims were deported from the southern town of Aielu to West 
Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said, `We will kill anyone who refuses,''' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a leader of East Timor's anti-Indonesia Falintil  
guerrillas ventured into Dili today for the first time in three 
years to discuss cooperation with the international force. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornelio Goma, the guerrillas' second-in-command for the capital  
area, said his 500 fighters would keep their 100 weapons -- ``all 
sorts of weapons, semiautomatics, old guns, new guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Falintil will not hand over weapons ... we are the national  
liberation force of East Timor,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Falintil, which fought a decades-long struggle for East Timor's  
independence, will likely form the core of an independent East 
Timor government and its army. On Wednesday, Falintil rebels manned 
roadblocks and guarding areas of East Timor where international 
peace forces have not reached. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. relief workers said Falintil will be enlisted to help  
distribute aid in the eastern part of the province. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. relief coordinator Ross Mountain said the humanitarian  
situation is gradually improving. The first mass food distribution 
in the capital is scheduled for Saturday at five sites, handing out 
enough to feed 100,000 people for a month, World Food Program 
spokeswoman Annie Spring said.

<HEADLINE> Vitamin Co. To Plead Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Canadian company agreed Wednesday to plead  
guilty and pay a $5 million criminal fine for its role in an 
international conspiracy to fix prices on vitamin B-4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said the agreement is part of its ongoing  
investigation into a global conspiracy to rig prices for certain 
vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinook Group Limited of Toronto was accused of conspiring with  
other businesses to raise and fix prices for vitamin B4 in the 
United States and other countries from January 1988 through 
September 1998. The Justice Department said Chinook also conspired 
to divide the market for the vitamin during that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitamin B-4 is used primarily in animal feed.  
</P>
<P>
	Joel Klein, Justice's antitrust chief, said the case shows the  
government's ``continuing resolve to thwart illegal activities that 
harm American businesses and consumers, regardless of the location 
of the culprit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one-count criminal case was filed in U.S. District Court in  
Dallas.

<HEADLINE> Former NBA Star Out as Women's Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Orlando Woolridge is leaving as coach  
of the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA in a parting the team said 
was ``amicable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Woolridge in 1999, the Sparks had best record in their  
three WNBA seasons, 20-12, and lost to eventual league champion 
Houston two games to one in the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolridge was third in the WNBA's Coach of the Year voting,  
behind Van Chancellor of Houston and Sonny Allen of Sacramento -- a 
team the Sparks ousted in the playoffs' first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolridge was an assistant coach for his first 1 1/2 seasons with  
the Sparks and interim coach at the tail end of a 12-18 1998 
season. He declined to comment on the reasons for his departure. 
Team president and interim general manager Johnny Buss was not 
available to comment, a team spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sparks are confident in the new direction in which the  
team is headed and would like to thank Woolridge for his efforts 
over the past 2 1/2 seasons,'' the Sparks' statement said. ``The 
search for a new coach will begin immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first former NBA player to become a WNBA coach, Woolridge  
played 13 NBA seasons with Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia and the 
Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	He entered coaching as an assistant to the girls' coach at a Los  
Angeles private school in 1996-97, and joined the Sparks as an 
assistant in mid-1997.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Spending Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Beset by internal disputes and veto threats,  
Congress left most of its spending work unfinished Thursday as the 
government closed the books on the 1999 fiscal year. President 
Clinton denounced a plan to save money by slowing income-support 
payments to millions of working poor families. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me be clear: I will not sign a bill that turns its back on  
these hardworking families,'' Clinton said at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes earlier, he signed legislation keeping agencies open  
through Oct. 21, giving the two sides more time to battle over 
issues ranging from schools to foreign aid. Just four of the 13 
annual spending bills were signed into law before the fiscal year 
began Friday. One has been vetoed and five others face veto 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
	One legislative deadlock was broken when House and Senate  
conferees finally agreed on a $8.7 billion farm relief package 
after dropping a provision that would have eased the embargo on 
trade with Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the action in the Capitol centered on legislation  
financing labor, health and education programs, the biggest 
spending measure of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate spent a second, desultory day debating its $324  
billion measure. Though Democrats successfully won extra spending 
for social services and child care, the bill still faced a veto 
threat because of cuts in Clinton's proposals for hiring teachers 
and other efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The most controversial action was in the House Appropriations  
Committee, which used a near party-line 33-26 vote to approve its 
$316 billion version of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	But first, Republicans used a party-line 32-27 tally to approve  
a plan aimed at letting them redeem their pledge of passing 
spending bills without dipping into Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP proposal would spread out over 12 months what has  
historically been a lump sum payment to most low-income working 
poor under a program known as the earned income tax credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in California for the GOP presidential nomination,  
Texas Governor George Bush said, ``I don't think they ought to 
balance their budget on the backs of the poor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid Bush's remark and opposition from some Republicans in the  
House and Senate, one GOP official, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said they might seek other savings options to avoid 
political damage. But others said they would stick with the delayed 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., read Bush's comments aloud to the  
Appropriations Committee, drawing hoots from Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., while not taking direct  
issue with Bush's comments, said, ``We don't use it (the money), we 
just spread it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That budgetary sleight-of-hand would produce $8.7 billion in  
savings in fiscal 2000. That is because with monthly payments, much 
of next year's funds would instead be paid out after Oct. 1, 2000 -- 
the start of fiscal 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old tax credit program is designed to help 20  
million low-income people avoid becoming welfare recipients. The 
credit averages $1,890 annually for families with children, and 
should cost nearly $32 billion next year, the Treasury Department 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the three-week truce that became effective with  
Clinton's signature on the continuing resolution, the tone was 
combative on both sides as each sensed a brewing spending battle 
that could reverberate through next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. and Mrs. America, President Clinton is using your Social  
Security card as his personal credit card for more government 
spending,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, told a news 
conference, continuing the GOP drive to position itself as the 
defender of the pension program. 
</P>
<P>
	Firing back, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said  
the GOP plan to delay support payments for the poor ``is probably 
the most cynical and cruel of the suggestions or gimmicks that 
they've made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides warred all day over Social Security.  
</P>
<P>
	Democrats trumpeted a letter from the Congressional Budget  
Office, Congress' nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, saying $18 
billion in Social Security surpluses would be spent under current 
GOP plans. Republicans waved a hurriedly produced CBO letter of 
their own stating that those surpluses would not be touched if 
Congress sticks to a spending target GOP leaders have set for final 
versions of their bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also pushed nearly $350 million in other savings  
through the House Appropriations panel from raising fees for direct 
student loans and eliminating a rebate the Federal Housing 
Administration gives some of its low-income borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
	They also abandoned an earlier proposal to reclaim $3 billion in  
unspent federal welfare funds from the states, a plan criticized by 
both GOP and Democratic governors. 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote, the committee also added $515 million in aid  
proposed by Rep. David Price, D-N.C., for farmers hurt by the 
recent hurricanes Floyd and Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton signed the fourth spending bill Thursday, a $21 billion  
measure financing energy and water projects. He has also signed 
measures financing the Treasury Department, Congress' own 
operations and military construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine unfinished bills cover 12 Cabinet departments including  
Defense, Health and Human Services, Interior and Justice, plus 
dozens of smaller agencies.

</P>
<P>
	WENATCHEE, Wash. (AP) -- W.B. ``Babe'' Gavin, longtime owner and  
publisher of the Lake Chelan Mirror weekly newspaper, died 
Wednesday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after losing his right arm to cancer in 1970, Gavin  
continued to paste up news stories, develop pictures and set type. 
He also kept on driving a tractor in his apple orchard. 
</P>
<P>
	Gavin drove a laundry truck in Cashmere until the publisher of  
the Cashmere Valley Record hired him in 1932 to sell ads, write 
news and lay out the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper business stuck. When the Lake Chelan Mirror in the  
town of Chelan was put up for sale in 1937, Gavin's boss helped him 
buy it. 
</P>
<P>
	Gavin married Margaret Laschinger in 1939, and the two operated  
the Mirror for more than 30 years before their son Rick Gavin 
became publisher in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include two sons, six grandchildren and one  
great-grandchild.

	HARRISON, Ark. (AP) -- Former state Sen. Ralph Hudson, who  
entered politics after owning a grocery store and serving as a 
postmaster, died Tuesday. He was 96. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudson was elected a Boone County judge in 1955. He served four  
terms before being elected state senator, a position he held from 
1963 through 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was chief executive and chairman of the board of  
Guaranty Savings &AMP; Loan before he retired in 1981.

at University of Nebraska-Lincoln, died Tuesday of a heart attack. 
He was 48. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones had oversight of all university services that support  
academic programs, including human resources, facilities, 
landscaping, custodial work, parking, police and mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to coming to Lincoln, he was vice president for financial  
affairs and treasurer at Marquette University and director of the 
department of finance for the Government of the District of 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had oversight of the District of Columbia for the U.S.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Anneli Cahn Lax, the editor of a series of  
textbooks aimed at making mathematics more accessible to the 
general reader, died Friday. She was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lax retired from New York University in 1992, where she  
taught for 31 years. In her dissertation at NYU, she made 
significant contributions to the theory of hyperbolic equations, 
which deals with the behavior of waves. 
</P>
<P>
	But she may be best known for her work toward improving the  
understanding of mathematics by both students and lay people as 
editor of the Mathematical Association of America's New 
Mathematical Library Series, which began in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Lax was a longtime active member of the New York Academy of  
Sciences and was instrumental in shaping its program for science 
education for children. Among the honors she won was an award for 
distinguished service to mathematics from the mathematical 
association.

                        *Gustavo Leigh Guzman    	
</P>
<P>
	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Air Force Gen. Gustavo Leigh Guzman, a  
key figure in the 1973 coup led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, died 
Wednesday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Leigh was commander of the air force on Sept. 11, 1973, the day  
of the Pinochet-led coup that toppled Marxist President Salvador 
Allende. 
</P>
<P>
	Leigh quickly emerged as the toughest member in the four-man  
military junta. Just hours after the coup, Leigh vowed the military 
would ``eradicate the Marxist cancer from our fatherland, until the 
last consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was on his personal orders, he disclosed later, that the air  
force bombarded and heavily damaged the presidential palace to put 
down the resistance by Allende and a small group of his followers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, Leigh was the first junta member to urge the  
restoration of civilian rule. That cost him his position with both 
the junta and the air force. 
</P>
<P>
	Also that year, when Pinochet called a vote to request that  
Chileans reject the United Nation's condemnation of the regime's 
human rights record, Leigh called the move ``typical of governments 
in which power is in the hands of a single dictator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other members of the junta -- Adm. Jose Toribio Merino and  
police Gen. Cesar Mendoza -- have died. Pinochet remains under house 
arrest in Britain fighting extradition to Spain, where a judge 
wants to try him for the human rights abuses during his 17-year 
regime.

for transportation safety and health issues, died Tuesday night at 
the age of 54 after a nearly three-year battle with breast cancer.

	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Bishop Edward W. O'Rourke, retired leader of  
the Roman Catholic Diocese of Peoria, died Wednesday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a long history of health problems, including heart  
ailments and a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	During his 55 years as a priest and bishop, he lectured on  
theological and socioeconomic issues and wrote six books. He was 
bishop of the local diocese from 1971 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	He also taught for 15 years at the University of Illinois and  
later became executive secretary of the National Catholic Rural 
Life Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He suffered a stroke in 1985 and had heart and other ailments  
since then, but he remained active in church-related work. He 
founded Renaissance Stand, which helps the unemployed find jobs, 
soon after retiring.

	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Ancient history expert Chester G. Starr,  
professor emeritus at the University of Michigan and author of more 
than 20 books, died Sept. 22. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  
and wrote more than 20 scholarly books. He was founding president 
of the Association of Ancient Historians. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Centralia, Mo., Starr earned bachelor's and master's  
degrees at the University of Missouri and a doctorate at Cornell 
University. He served as professor of history at the University of 
Illinois for 30 years before joining the Michigan faculty in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	The regents said his ``virtuoso performances in the classroom  
and his evident delight in explaining the complexity and 
significance of ancient societies have captivated several 
generations of students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr served with the U.S. Army from 1942-46. He was chief of  
the Historical Section with the Fifth Army in Italy, and attained 
the rank of lieutenant colonel.

<P>
	CROWN POINT, Ind. (AP) -- John Richard Zieba, who twice escaped  
execution at the Auschwitz Nazi concentration camp, died Saturday 
after a long illness. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	After earning a master's degree in chemical engineering in 1939,  
Zieba was arrested by the Nazis for his involvement in the Polish 
Underground, a rebellion group that engaged in activities designed 
to disrupt the German occupation of Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	He was held at several Nazi concentration camps and was released  
in 1945 by German guards, who were ordered to kill all prisoners 
before the Allies advanced but did not. 
</P>
<P>
	After his release, Zieba moved to Germany, where he met his  
wife, Victoria Twarogowska. They were married on Aug. 7, 1946, and 
moved to the United States three years later. 
</P>
<P>
	They settled in Cleveland, where Zieba eventually went to work  
for the Robert Gair Co., which was later bought by the Continental 
Can Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, the company transferred Zieba to its Elkhart plant. He  
stayed there until 1960, when he went to work as a chemist at 
Whitehall Laboratories before retiring in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Bob Marley To Be Honored on Album </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu and  
Aerosmith's Steven Tyler are among the performers whose renditions 
of Bob Marley tunes will be in a new tribute album. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob Marley: Chant Down Babylon'' will be released in November,  
Jamaica's Island Records said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The album, produced by Marley's son, Stephen, is a joint effort  
with Def Jam Records, a label better known for its hip-hop acts. 
The songs highlight the 1970s hits of Marley, known as ``The Gong'' 
in Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope it will make an impact in terms of the hip-hop  
world,'' Stephen Marley said. ``They need a spiritual icon like 
`The Gong' to get a different message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, who will add a bluesy feel to ``Turn Your Lights Down  
Low,'' is married to another of Bob Marley's sons, Rohan. 
</P>
<P>
	Badu will sing ``No More Trouble,'' and Tyler will cover  
``Roots, Rock, Reggae'' from Marley's 1976 breakthrough album, 
``Rastaman Vibration.''

<HEADLINE> Anti-Cyberstalking Laws Mulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harassing someone via electronic mail could  
land a cyberstalker in jail under legislation being considered in 
the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, introduced by Rep. Sue Kelly, R-N.Y., would strengthen  
current federal law by broadening the definition of stalking to 
include harassment by e-mail, telephone or any other form of 
interstate communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, authorities could prosecute for threatening behavior even  
if no explicit threat is made. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the current federal anti-stalking law is so narrow,  
many stalking victims have had nowhere to turn,'' Kelly said during 
a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee's crime subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Recent research has shown that more than 1 million women and  
more than 370,000 men are stalked every year. About 59 percent of 
women victims are stalked by spouses, former spouses, live-in 
partners or dates,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said the bill was inspired by people like Jayne Hitchcock,  
a writer who has suffered more three years of harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	It began after the New York state attorney general's office  
began investigating her complaint about an apparently fraudulent 
literary agency that advertised on the Internet, Hitchcock told the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyberstalkers ``e-mail bombed'' her, sending hundreds of e-mail  
messages and posting forged messages in Internet discussion groups 
over her name, one of which invited people to call or mail her 
their sexual fantasies to help her write a book. It included her 
real telephone number and home address in Crofton, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt violated and scared for my life,'' she said. ``I began  
receiving 25 to 30 phone calls a day from as far away as Germany.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police couldn't or wouldn't help, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Friends familiar with e-mail traced the messages to three people  
apparently connected to the literary agency, and she filed a $10 
million civil suit against them, Hitchcock said. Then, her lawyer 
received a death threat, neighbors were phoned by people seeking 
information on her and complaints accusing Hitchcock of stalking 
were filed with federal and Maryland authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got so bad I had to see a psychotherapist ... and finally  
my husband and I moved to New England,'' said Hitchcock. The suit 
is still pending, Hitchcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, advocates for abused women asked Congress to  
renew the Violence Against Women Act, a 1994 law that devoted 
federal money to fighting domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question that (the law) is making a difference,''  
said Bonnie Campbell, director of the Justice Department's Violence 
Against Women Office. Communities nationwide ``are setting up the 
infrastructure needed to improve our response to violence against 
women,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Paper Questioned on Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The owner and publisher of one of  
South Korea's largest newspapers was questioned by prosecutors 
Thursday about allegations he evaded $23.2 million in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Suk-hyun's questioning followed two weeks of investigation  
into the Bokwang Group, in which he is a major shareholder. Hong's 
newspaper, The JoongAng Ilbo, was not directly involved in the 
alleged tax evasion scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution's probe was prompted by a National Tax  
Administration complaint that Hong was suspected of being 
personally involved in the tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
	If found guilty, Hong could face at least five years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Hong's newspaper, with an estimated circulation of 1.8 million,  
said the investigation was retaliation for its critical stance 
against the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consider this investigation to have targeted a specific  
news organization. It is a political conspiracy designed to stifle 
the free expression of opinions,'' JoongAng reporters said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris-based World Association of Newspapers, which  
represents some 17,000 publications in 93 countries, sent a letter 
to President Kim Dae-jung on Thursday, protesting Hong's 
questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Any punitive action against Hong ``will inevitably damage the  
credibility of your commitment to establish a full democracy in 
South Korea, in the eyes of the international community,'' the 
letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate government response.  
</P>
<P>
	The National Tax Administration's complaint said that Bokwang  
opened more than 1,100 bank accounts under false or borrowed names 
to evade business and inheritance taxes for Hong and his family, 
mostly between 1996 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong also was suspected of involvement in large-scale land  
speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bokwang Group has four subsidiaries specialized in  
convenience-store chains, TV component manufacturing, 
communications and finance.

<HEADLINE> W. Virginia To Play All Road Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- The Mountaineers will play every game  
of the 1999-00 basketball season on a foreign court while West 
Virginia administrators try to resolve potential problems with 
asbestos in the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of West Virginia's 18 home games will be played at the  
12,000-seat Charleston Civic Center instead of the 14,000-seat 
Coliseum. Six will be held at the 7,000-seat Wheeling Civic Center 
and three at the 4,000-seat Feaster Center at Fairmont State 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	Average attendance for men's home basketball games is about  
8,000, athletic director Ed Pastilong said. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's home games will be held at the 2,000-seat Morgantown  
High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Gale Catlett didn't attend the news conference held to  
announce the new schedule, and Pastilong was vague about how he 
took word of the disruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Catlett realizes it'll be a little bit of a disadvantage  
playing all of your games away, but he's very competitive,'' 
Pastilong said. ``Sometimes adversity brings out the best in 
people. We're hoping that will be the case here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia will move volleyball and wrestling matches to the  
Shell Building on campus. Athletic officials are still deciding 
where to hold gymnastics meets. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials are working with the U.S. Environmental  
Protection Agency to develop a testing plan to find out whether 
asbestos levels in the air inside the Coliseum are dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	Asbestos was applied to the bottom of the arena's ceiling in  
1969 to limit condensation and muffle noise. The adhesive holding 
the asbestos in place is now weakening, causing chunks of it to 
fall into seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The building's outer ring, where classrooms and offices are  
located, remains open because its air system functions 
independently of the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia plans to remove the asbestos from the Coliseum  
next spring unless the EPA forces it to do so sooner. The work 
should take about six months and cost some $15 million, according 
to Scott Kelley, vice president for administration and finance.

<HEADLINE> Grain Futures Plummet; Gold Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Grain futures prices plummeted Thursday on the Chicago Board of  
Trade as the government released estimates of supplies that were 
higher than traders expected. 
</P>
<P>
	In other commodity markets, orange juice futures fell, and gold  
gave back some of its recent major gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures fell in reaction to the release Thursday of  
government estimates that stockpiles would be 1.796 billion 
bushels, about 100 million bushels more than anticipated, market 
participants said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was bigger than the trade was looking for, surprisingly  
so,'' said Don Roose, president of Iowa-based U.S. Commodities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hurting corn prices were an improvement in harvest  
conditions this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures also plummeted on estimates that quarterly stocks  
were much larger than expected. Roose said the growth in corn and 
wheat stocks reflect weakening export demand and a serious decline 
in feed use. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures fell in sympathy with corn and wheat, but losses  
were limited by stock estimates that were down slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Thursday, wheat for December delivery fell 8 1/2 cents  
to $2.75 3/4 a bushel; December corn fell 5 1/2 cents to $2.08 1/4 a bushel; 
December oats fell 2 cents to $1.13 1/4 a bushel; and November 
soybeans fell 1/2 cent to $4.91 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, cattle futures prices were higher in trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while pork futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle futures were up 0.97 cent to 68.27 cents a  
pound; October feeder cattle rose 1.17 cent to 81.07 cents a pound; 
October lean hogs fell 0.43 cent to 48.97 cents a pound; and 
February pork bellies fell 0.42 cent to 63.80 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Frozen concentrated orange juice futures prices fell to a  
six-week low in heavy trading Thursday on the Board of Trade of the 
City of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The market has given back gains made last month when prices  
soared more than 20 percent on a bullish crop estimate report. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange juice is expected to trade in a tight range ahead of the  
U.S, Department of Agriculture's Oct. 8 release of its first 
Florida crop estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	November orange juice fell 3.00 cents to 87.50 cents per pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures gave back recent gains in trading Thursday on the  
New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold reached $300 an ounce this week, but then the nearby  
contracts fell back below that mark Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold's frenzied price rally earlier in the week stalled late  
Wednesday and the decline spilled over into Thursday. Prices had 
spiraled as high as $329 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold was driven down by news that Russia may place 7.3 million  
ounces with Western banks, enabling it to be lent to the market. 
Market participants also believe the market was simply readjusting 
after the recent highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold for October delivery fell $1.10 to $299.50 per ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	Palladium followed gold lower Thursday, giving back gains it  
posted the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium for December delivery fell $22.85 to $369.00 per  
ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium is used heavily in the automotive industry in the  
manufacture of emission-control devices.

<HEADLINE> Stockton, Hornacek Sign With Jazz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- John Stockton and Jeff Hornacek will  
return to take another shot at winning an NBA title, eager to give 
the Utah Jazz as much time as their aging bodies allow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz on Thursday announced that Stockton, 37, signed a  
two-year contract and Hornacek, 36, agreed to a one-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	It remains to be seen whether the oldest backcourt in the NBA  
can lead Utah back to the NBA Finals, in which Utah lost in 1997 
and 1998. Both players made it clear they're coming back to pursue 
the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go for it. You're always trying to win a championship,''  
Hornacek said when asked if this season marks his last chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms weren't disclosed for either contract. Published reports  
say Stockton, the NBA's career leader in assists and steals, will 
be paid $22 million while Hornacek's deal is worth $5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Jazz owner Larry Miller said during a news conference that he  
negotiated directly with the players, as he has done for years. 
Stockton said he was never concerned he wouldn't get a good deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of faith in each other,'' Stockton said. ``I  
really had a restful summer even though I was unemployed the whole 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, forward Karl Malone signed a four-year, $66.5  
million contract. With Stockton and Hornacek back, Utah is 
committed to the trio that took the team to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone turned 36 in July. Although the clock has been ticking on  
the Jazz for years, it's clear from the length of the Stockton and 
Hornacek contracts the stroke of midnight can't be too far away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all realize this is coming to an end,'' Stockton said.  
</P>
<P>
	Miller said just as he rooted for John Elway to win the Super  
Bowl, he's hopeful that Malone, Stockton and Hornacek can win the 
NBA title before they retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all important to the Jazz, to be sure, but also for  
what they mean to the game, these guys deserve to win a 
championship,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem for all three, and for the Jazz, is age.  
</P>
<P>
	Stockton and Hornacek at times were defensive liabilities in  
last year's playoffs, being beaten off the dribble by quicker legs. 
The Jazz were eliminated in the second round after Malone shot 
3-of-16 from the floor in Game 6 against the younger Portland Trail 
Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton had offseason surgery on an elbow and Hornacek  
underwent surgery to repair a chronically sore knee. Both declared 
themselves fit and said they're ready for training camp next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``As September rolls around, I can't speak for everyone, but I  
get excited to get back to work,'' Stockton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornacek was expected to see fewer minutes than last season,  
splitting time with swingman Shandon Anderson. On Wednesday, 
Anderson signed a deal with the Houston Rockets, leaving the Jazz 
without a proven backup at shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornacek said last weekend, when he was inducted into Iowa  
State's hall of fame, that this would be his last season. He hedged 
a little on Thursday but didn't recant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we can win it this year,'' Hornacek said. ``In our  
talks, Larry said to play this season and just see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> LSU QB Booty Hopes To Reclaim Magic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE,La. (AP) -- Five years ago, Josh Booty was the  
quarterback every college wanted, the guy Bill Walsh called the 
best high school QB he had ever seen. Now he's got the chance to 
prove he's still that player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've waited a long time for this chance,'' Booty said. ``Now  
I'm going to make the most of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Booty, now a 24-year old sophomore, was USA Today's national  
high school football player of the year in 1993 in a class that 
included NFL passers Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf. 
</P>
<P>
	He dazzled Walsh and others by throwing for 11,700 yards and 126  
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Booty also impressed baseball scouts with his ability to throw  
from home plate over an outfield fence 380 feet away. Eventually, 
the Florida Marlins impressed Booty with a $1.6 million deal to 
play baseball and he spent the next five years chasing that dream. 
</P>
<P>
	But baseball never worked out and Booty said he never stopped  
dreaming about LSU. This spring Booty repaid part of the money to 
the Marlins and walked on with LSU. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have played for anybody when I left high school,''  
Booty said. ``I could have played with the team that won the 
national championship. But I wanted to come to LSU and help them 
win. I still do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Booty took classes in the spring and summer to qualify for  
football. He also spent hours in the weight room and learning the 
system. Still, he couldn't beat out fellow sophomores Craig Nall 
and Rohan Davey for the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I made those decisions, based on the information I had, I  
thought Craig was the right choice, Rohan was the right choice, and 
now Josh is the right choice,'' coach Gerry DiNardo said. ``For 
example, I had no way of knowing how Josh would react to having 58 
pass opportunities until he had them. When I was walking off the 
field after the last game, I had enough information to make a 
decision about all three of them and so I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Davey crumbled against Auburn, however, Booty stepped in  
and demonstrated that his arm was still strong. Even though he 
couldn't prevent LSU's 41-7 loss, he showed some of the ability he 
had displayed in high school, setting an LSU record passing 58 
times for 29 completions and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``That did a lot for me. It was almost like playing two games  
right there, so I think it got rid of some of the rust,'' Booty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And if the whipping Auburn handed the Tigers did little to boost  
the confidence of a team trying to come back from a 4-7 season, it 
at least helped Booty, who's trying to shake off some bad baseball 
memories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing minor league baseball and struggling every day -- it  
doesn't get any worse than that,'' Booty said. ``It's tough when 
you have to go to the park every night. You might go two weeks in a 
row and go 1-for-28, get in a big time rut. I struggled in baseball 
a lot and went through some ups and downs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With an off week, Booty got extra time to work with the starters  
in preparing for Saturday's game against No. 10 Georgia. He expects 
to need every minute since Georgia's defense is the most 
complicated of any LSU opponent this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs will probably take a page from Auburn's successful  
defense of LSU -- stop the running game and pressure an 
inexperienced quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm getting better as the days go on,'' Booty said.  
``I'm confident we're going to move the ball on Georgia. If we can 
establish a bit of a running game, we're going to do good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond a strong arm, LSU is counting on Booty to bring maturity  
and leadership to the team. It's something Booty believes he can 
provide. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a whole different thing out on the field,'' Booty said.  
``I'm trying to lead by example. If I can move the team down the 
field and score, that's the best example I can give. 
</P>
<P>
	``The job is mine now. I'm confident that I'm going to go out  
there and play the way I always have. I going to play to win not 
just to not lose. I've waited too long for this to let it get by 
me.''

<HEADLINE> Who's Watching Academic Fraud? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	No matter how it turns out, two useful lessons will come out of  
the growing flap at Tennessee regarding possible academic fraud: 
</P>
<P>
	1 -- The proper use of ``who'' and ``whom.'' That way, in the  
future, whenever an NCAA investigator asked, ``Who wrote this 
English paper for whom?'' a football player would know the correct 
response is, ``My tutor wrote it for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	2 -- Just how unofficial college football's ``unofficial''  
national championship is in danger of becoming. 
</P>
<P>
	The way things stand and always have, the team that wins the  
Sugar Bowl next Jan. 4 could be caught cheating red-handed on Jan. 
5 -- yet walk away with its share of $13 million intact and call 
itself the national champion until the end of time. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's time to look at this.  
</P>
<P>
	The people who are supposed to be in charge of such things  
better do something and fast if the charges against Tennessee turn 
out to be true. Otherwise, the reward for cheating will continue to 
outweigh the risk of getting caught. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people assume the NCAA controls the Division I-A football  
postseason the same way it controls the postseason in every other 
sport. Never assume. The NCAA sanctions the bowls, but says it has 
no say when it comes to the hardware or cash handed over in the 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	The championship game is played on a rotating basis at one of  
four bowl sites -- Sugar, Orange, Rose, Fiesta -- and controlled by a 
handful of very powerful men who currently go by the moniker of the 
Bowl Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	There are polls, computer programs and printouts to be used as  
guides to determine who plays for the national championship, but 
the BCS has the last word about who plays in their other three 
bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	The BCS is headed by Roy Kramer, who happens to be the  
commissioner of the Southeastern Conference, which happens to have 
Tennessee as a member. This may sound like a conflict of interest, 
but as Kramer knows, it could happen to anybody. Especially in his 
circle. Kramer's partners in the BCS just happen to be the 
commissioners of the other five major football-playing conferences 
-- Pacific 10, Big Ten, Big 12, Big East, Atlantic Coast -- and a 
representative from Notre Dame, which is practically a conference 
unto-itself. 
</P>
<P>
	And this is where the ``unofficial'' part comes in.  
</P>
<P>
	If the charges against Tennessee, the national champion, turn  
out to be true, what's the worst that can happen? 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA has the power to do plenty -- but only after the fact.  
And because the BCS operates outside its jurisdiction, football is 
the one sport where the organization can't do anything about the 
``before'' part. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of Miami, for example, has felt the NCAA's sting.  
The Hurricanes are returning to national prominence this season, 
nearly five years after getting hit with three years' probation and 
the loss of 32 scholarships for violations committed during coach 
Dennis Erickson's watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami also won two of its four national titles during that span,  
but nobody took the money or the championships back. The UCLA 
women's softball team wasn't so lucky in 1997. The NCAA took back 
the national title the team won two years earlier, after finding 
multiple violations. 
</P>
<P>
	And should charges of tutor-student violations at Minnesota  
prove true, the NCAA could go after the victories and money the 
school collected in last spring's NCAA basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But football is another story.  
</P>
<P>
	NCAA spokesman Wally Renfro confirmed for the Los Angeles Times  
this week that his organization could not go after a football 
champion's purse or crown. ``As to whether the NCAA has any area of 
authority over the BCS champion, I don't believe the NCAA does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer did not return a call Thursday seeking comment about  
whether the BCS would think about punishing teams caught cheating. 
</P>
<P>
	But his spokesman, Charles Bloom, who, like Kramer, is an  
employee of the SEC, told the newspaper, ``It's not one of those 
things that gets discussed: What if a previous champion has to 
forfeit games? What happens to the BCS trophy? I don't think that's 
been discussed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked when it might be, Bloom added, ``I don't know.''  
</P>
<P>
	Since it's going to be a long time before the best solution -- a  
playoff run by the NCAA -- is in place, here is something to 
consider in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
	Policing the football programs is the NCAA's job. It shouldn't  
be made any more difficult by the presence of the BCS. The two 
organizations should straighten out that jurisdictional matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering how lucrative the bowls have become, it's only a  
matter of time before we're stuck with a champion whose cheating 
was flagrant enough to warrant being stripped of a title. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be a shame if they got away with it because no one  
figured out who was supposed to be watching whom. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Giuliani Declares War on a Painting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- City officials have fired another round in their  
escalating fight with the Brooklyn Museum of Art, accusing the 
museum of displaying controversial work just to drive up its value. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusations made Wednesday by Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota and  
the city's top lawyer, Michael Hess, came a day after the museum 
sued to stop Mayor Rudolph Giuliani from freezing its funding over 
the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has threatened to cut city funding to the museum  
because of its decision to display an exhibit that includes a black 
Madonna decorated with elephant dung and pornographic cutouts. The 
funding amounts to $7 million, or about one-third of the museum's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The pieces are from advertising executive Charles Saatchi's  
collection. Lhota and Hess say the museum's board planned the 
``Sensation'' exhibition so the works would fetch high prices at 
auction once the show closes. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum's board members are ``shilling for a British subject  
who is a multimillionaire and trying to enhance his art 
collection,'' Lhota said. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited a New York Observer article which said that after the  
show closed in London, Saatchi auctioned 128 pieces from his 
collection, many of them by artists in the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, on a fund-raising trip in California, said he has been  
in touch with Lhota and Hess about their accusations. He said the 
project raises the question whether a publicly funded museum should 
engage in ``shock commercialization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andree Corroon, a spokeswoman for Christie's, which is helping  
sponsor the show, said the auction house had no plans for an 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bewildering accusation has absolutely no substance, is  
absolutely not true,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the museum called the accusations ``preposterous  
and misleading.'' The show opens Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a federal judge has been asked to decide whether to  
restore the museum's funding. The museum sued the city on Tuesday, 
saying Giuliani's act violates the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the Senate agreed unanimously Wednesday to a  
non-binding measure calling for the withholding of federal funds 
from the museum unless it cancels the exhibit. Independent Sen. Bob 
Smith of New Hampshire said the museum has received $500,000 from 
the National Endowment for the Arts in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, singer David Bowie -- who recorded an audio tour  
for museum visitors -- joined leaders of major New York City museums 
in support of the Brooklyn Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sensation represents some of the best, worst but definitely  
most extreme of the high-profile work to have come out of Britain 
in the last 10 years or so,'' Bowie said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders of two dozen cultural institutions -- including the  
Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Modern Art -- signed a letter 
protesting the mayor's funding cut.

<HEADLINE> Under Attack, IOC Leaders Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Under sharp attack from U.S. officials,  
leaders of the International Olympic Committee are meeting to press 
ahead with their anti-drug plans and decide how to deal with 
another vote-buying scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	As the IOC finalizes a series of reforms aimed at restoring its  
image and credibility, the issues of drugs and corruption have come 
back to the forefront and will play a major part in the IOC 
executive board meetings starting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and Congress have accused the IOC of failing to  
deal adequately with either issue, triggering a war of words that 
has plunged relations between the Olympic body and the United 
States to a low ebb. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry McCaffrey, the White House drug policy chief, recently  
launched a series of scathing attacks on the IOC and its plans to 
set up an international anti-drug agency. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey has dismissed the IOC as a ``Byzantine'' organization,  
described president Juan Antonio Samaranch as a ``former fascist'' 
and even questioned the IOC's right to control the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound sent a bluntly worded letter to  
McCaffrey last week telling him he was ``plainly wrong'' to 
criticize the anti-doping agency and should instead tackle the drug 
problem in American pro sports. Pound said the IOC will proceed 
with the drug agency with or without U.S. government support. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey and other critics say the agency should be completely  
independent of the IOC. But the IOC, which is putting up $25 
million to start the project, says it has done more than any other 
organization to fight drugs and should continue to play a leading 
role. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC says the agency, which will coordinate drug testing  
around the world, including out-of-competition controls, has the 
backing of European governments, the United Nations and other 
bodies. It says the agency will be established by the end of the 
year and be fully operational for next year's Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we promised the athletes of the world, and we are  
going to fulfill that promise,'' Anita DeFrantz, an American IOC 
vice president, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC also has been criticized by leading international sports  
officials for its proposed anti-doping code, which sets out drug 
rules and sanctions for Olympic sports. The document, scheduled to 
go into force Jan. 1, will be reviewed this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, a vocal IOC critic who chaired hearings in  
April on Olympic corruption, has scheduled another hearing Oct. 20 
on the drug issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Six days earlier, the House will hold hearings into allegations  
that a ``culture of corruption'' surrounded Atlanta's winning bid 
for the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A report submitted to Congress this month detailed gifts, travel  
and offers of college scholarships, job assistance and other perks 
to IOC members and their families by Atlanta bid officials. U.S. 
Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., said the report showed ``votes were for 
sale'' and accused the IOC of creating the atmosphere which led to 
a pattern of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC board will decide how Samaranch should respond to a  
letter from Upton requesting him to testify at the hearing. The 
House commerce subcommittee has threatened to subpoena Samaranch if 
he declines to appear voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch declined to testify at the McCain hearings in April  
prompted by the bribery scandal stemming from Salt Lake City's 
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's new ethics commission said Monday it would investigate  
any misconduct by IOC members related to the Atlanta bid. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz said critics like McCaffrey and members of Congress  
should take into account that the IOC has embarked on major 
reforms, expelled members who committed wrongdoing, opened its 
financial books and taken other steps to clean itself up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done a lot in this year,'' she said. ``That is what's  
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the four days of meetings, the IOC board also will get  
progress reports from organizers of the Sydney, Salt Lake and 
Athens 2004 Summer Games.

<HEADLINE> Steel Execs Urge Retention of Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Times are still tough for the steel industry  
and American manufacturers can't afford any weakening of trade 
barriers, top steel executives told Congress on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Import levels have eased from last year's record highs, but  
still haven't returned to where they were before the Asian economic 
crisis triggered a surge in arrivals of low-cost, foreign-made 
steel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of the forces behind the steel crisis remain,'' James  
Haeck, executive vice president of Cleveland-based LTV Corp., told 
the House and Senate steel caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Foreign steel industries are more subsidized, more protected,  
and more cartelized than any other industrial sector,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	American steelmakers say the help other nations give their steel  
industries has built up more steelmaking capacity than the 
worldwide market needs. That makes it difficult for American 
companies to command the prices they desire, and led last year to 
five bankruptcies and an estimated 10,000 layoffs in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Clinton administration assurances that it will oppose  
efforts to discuss anti-dumping laws during the next round of 
multination trade negotiations, the steel industry is nervous about 
what might happen during the World Trade Organization meeting in 
Seattle in November. 
</P>
<P>
	George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America,  
said the union intended to have a 500-person presence in Seattle 
during those talks. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, steel unions and 97 steel companies signed a joint  
letter to President Clinton underscoring their concern about 
preserving anti-dumping laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel industry used those laws to get punitive tariffs  
imposed against Japan for selling a common type of steel for less 
in the United States than in its home market. Japanese steelmakers 
have appealed to the U.S. Court of International Trade, and the 
Japanese government is considering a request by its labor unions to 
file a complaint against the United States with the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the Clinton administration announced it will  
hold a series of high-level talks with Japan about steel dumping. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel issue has been difficult for the Clinton  
administration, which was vilified by organized labor for fighting 
legislation to impose quotas on steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	That anger could become a problem for Vice President Al Gore as  
he seeks union support for his presidential run. 
</P>
<P>
	Bethlemen Steel Chairman Curtis Barnette told reporters his  
industry is telling other segments of the U.S. economy ``It's steel 
today, it could be you tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The trade issue will be the No. 1 political issue in the 2000  
election,'' he said. ``In my view we should not underestimate the 
enormous public concern over what is happening in the trade area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnette spoke with reporters prior to a private meeting with  
White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Lectures Media Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Concentration of media ownership in too  
few hands homogenizes the culture, the Rev. Jesse Jackson told 
broadcast news leaders from across the country Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who has called for Federal Communications Commission  
hearings on the effect of media mergers on minorities, said he is 
concerned the trend toward consolidation of ownership will leave 
too many stories untold. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too few people are calling too many shots,'' he said at the  
annual convention of the Radio and Television News Directors 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was challenged by other members of a panel addressing  
the broadcasters. Erica Farber, publisher of the trade magazine 
Radio &AMP; Records, said consolidation in radio has had the opposite 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the industry is so much more willing to take on new  
ideas,'' she said. ``There's so much more diversity in formats than 
there was 10 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Pittman, president of America Online, and Michael  
Bloomberg, founder of the multimedia news service that bears his 
name, both noted how the Internet is allowing for many more voices 
in the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``Six months, two years from now, everyone is going to have  
their own radio and television station,'' Bloomberg said, ``and I'm 
not so sure that's a good thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson countered that the powerful media owners are much more  
able to drive the public agenda than would-be moguls. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the RTNDA teamed up with a few minority journalism  
groups to encourage radio and television stations to hire more 
minorities. The percentage of minorities in electronic newsrooms 
has slipped from a high of 21 percent three years ago to 19 percent 
now, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization steered clear of the question about minority  
ownership of the media. John Sears, RTNDA chairman, said his group 
will concentrate on what its members can control.

<HEADLINE> Lycos Opens Web Site Aimed at Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the Internet's most popular Web sites  
has opened a new virtual playground, one of a growing number of 
kid-friendly destinations aimed at reassuring parents anxious about 
their children roaming the Internet's seedier neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos Inc. of Waltham, Mass., said it created www.lycoszone.com  
as a protected environment for children online. Except for its 
advertisements, all the links lead to other Web pages within the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	The site, unveiled Wednesday, is among dozens of so-called green  
spaces being constructed as safe havens for children whose parents 
are worried about inadvertent exposure to pornography and other 
unsavory material found on the Internet alongside its educational 
and entertainment content. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can log in, spend all your online experience as a child in  
Lycos Zone, and as a parent you can feel pretty good,'' said Chief 
Executive Officer Robert J. Davis, who acknowledged that the 
Internet was ``a medium I'm not comfortable having my children do 
without guidance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis noted that other industries also offer ostensibly  
protected realms for children, such as the Nickelodeon cable 
television station and ``Sports Illustrated for Kids,'' the spinoff 
of the popular sports magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can predict with a pretty good degree of accuracy what  
you'll see there,'' Davis said. ``We're trying to do the same thing 
for kids online. We're recognizing there's a new and future 
audience out there. Someday the kids who are 8 and 10 and using 
this product will be 22 years old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos, with $135.5 million in sales last year, is one of the  
Web's popular ``portal'' sites offering collections of news, 
entertainment, stock quotes and more. It was the fifth most popular 
site on the Internet with more than 2.4 million visitors daily, 
according to figures this month from Media Metrix Inc., an online 
ratings service. 
</P>
<P>
	Other kid-friendly sites include Yahoo!'s ``Yahooligans,'' The  
Walt Disney Co.'s ``Fun for Families,'' Netscape's ``KidZone'' and 
Headbone Interactive's ``Headbone Zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More Web sites with content geared toward children are listed on  
a site the online industry organized earlier this year, 
www.getnetwise.org. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a solution that's good for certain types of families  
and educators, and it can help parents understand how to let their 
kids use the Net in a safer way,'' said Ari Schwartz, a spokesman 
for the Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology. The 
group helped organize the ``Get Net Wise'' site. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lycos' reliance on online advertising aimed at kids drew  
criticism about the site from the Center for Media Education, which 
successfully lobbied last year for a new federal law that prohibits 
Web sites from collecting information from children without 
parental permission. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that at the end of the day, we have to hide children  
inside gated communities to protect them is not the best way to 
ensure that online media serve the needs of children,'' said Jeff 
Chester, the group's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	Chester suggested these new Web sites aimed at children were  
``part of a marketing strategy to urge parents to let down their 
guard while the online industry moves to begin aggressively selling 
to children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos said all its advertisements on its Web site are clearly  
marked as ads, and it said no personal information -- such as names 
or e-mail addresses -- will be collected, even with parental 
permission.

<HEADLINE> Crashes With Older Drivers Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While overall traffic deaths are declining,  
the number of older Americans involved in fatal crashes has jumped 
by 33 percent over the past decade, according to a new analysis of 
government data. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Florida, home to many retirees, had the most drivers  
aged 70 and above who were involved in accidents with at least one 
fatality -- 474 such drivers, up 41 percent from the 1988 total of 
337. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas and California placed second last year, with 316 such  
drivers in each state. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, 4,934 older drivers were involved in fatal accidents  
in 1998, a 33 percent increase from the 1988 total of 3,716. 
</P>
<P>
	The Road Information Program, an advocacy group supported by  
construction and insurance groups, compiled the results from data 
released last month by the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is asking for road improvements including better signs  
and lighting, especially with the baby boom generation heading 
toward retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent federal research about older drivers indicates that the  
aging process causes reduced vision, slower reaction times, a loss 
of information-processing ability and reduced neck and upper body 
flexibility.

<HEADLINE> Mormon-Owned Station Edits NBC Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Mormon Church-owned KSL Television deleted  
two sexually explicit words from NBC's new drama ``Law &AMP; Order: 
Special Victims Unit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The words deleted were ``unique to its subject matter,'' said  
Steve Lindsley, vice president of KSL. 
</P>
<P>
	KSL edited out the word ``penis'' twice and deleted the last  
word in the phrase ``shove it up your ass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rebecca Marks, vice president of publicity for NBC, said  
Wednesday that KSL was the only affiliate to complain about the 
content of ``Special Victims Unit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsley asked NBC to no avail to flip-flop the ``Law &AMP; Order''  
program, which aired at 8 p.m., with ``Dateline,'' which airs an 
hour later. In the past, KSL moved programs to a later time if 
conflict arose over content. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, when KSL changed affiliations from CBS to NBC, part of  
the agreement between NBC and KSL was finding another station to 
air ``Saturday Night Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm editing for language every week, I'm more inclined to  
move a program,'' Lindsley said.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Nixes Free Trade-Job Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trade liberalization has greatly benefited the  
U.S. economy but the gains have come through creation of better 
jobs, not more jobs, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to business executives Thursday night in Minneapolis,  
Greenspan mounted a vigorous defense of free trade, which he has 
done several times this year as the nation's trade deficit has 
widened sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	He said increased global trade has ``fostered markedly higher  
standards of living'' for the United States and other countries 
that have participated in promoting it. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said freer trade has pushed businesses to more  
productive fields through increased global competition, meaning 
fatter paychecks for workers and lower costs for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan cautioned, ``We too often try to promote free  
trade on the mistaken ground that it will create jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trade can influence the type of jobs that an economy can create,  
but not the overall number, he said, which is influenced by other 
factors, such as the central bank's decisions on whether to spur or 
dampen consumer demand by lowering or raising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to find credible evidence that trade has  
affected the level of employment in this country over the long 
run,'' Greenspan said. ``Indeed, we are currently experiencing the 
widest trade deficit in history with a level of unemployment close 
to record lows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's remarks, which were distributed in Washington,  
represented the latest in a series of speeches he has given this 
year to counter what he views as a growing clamor for new trade 
barriers as the U.S. trade deficit has ballooned. 
</P>
<P>
	The deficit so far this year is running at a record annual rate  
of $247 billion, 50 percent above last year's all-time high of $164 
billion. The global financial crisis has cut sharply into exports 
of farm products and manufactured goods while increasing the flow 
of low-cost imports into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The campaign to expand free trade is never won,'' Greenspan  
said. Legislation to further lower trade barriers ``is becoming 
increasingly difficult to pass in Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 134 members of the World Trade Organization will gather in  
Seattle in December to launch new trade liberalization talks. But 
the Clinton administration will not be able to complete the 
negotiations because President Clinton has been unable to persuade 
Congress to pass the necessary legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said he also was concerned that as formal trade  
barriers were being reduced, more countries were resorting to other 
forms of protectionism such as increasing tariffs and findings that 
goods were being ``dumped'' at unfairly low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``While these forms of protection have often been imposed under  
the label of promoting fair trade, oftentimes they are just simple 
guises for inhibiting competition,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has supported a number of dumping  
cases filed in recent months by the steel industry, which argued it 
was losing millions of dollars in sales because of a flood of cheap 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said the transition from obsolete technologies to  
newer technologies that trade generates does represent lost jobs 
for workers through no fault of their own. He urged support for the 
transition through job training. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a great tragedy were we to stop the wheels of  
progress because of an incapacity to assist the victims of 
progress,'' Greenspan said.

<HEADLINE> 5 Interviewed for Independent Counsel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton supporters may be about to see the  
last of Kenneth Starr. But they may not like his replacement, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges who must appoint Starr's successor interviewed at  
least five prosecutors from his staff for the job Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the candidates were Hickman Ewing, who once drew up a  
draft indictment of Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Jay Apperson, who 
handled the recent prosecution in which longtime Clinton friend 
Webster Hubbell pleaded guilty to a felony and a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	Another of those interviewed for Starr's job, Ed Page, is  
handling the criminal investigation into possible false statements 
about Mrs. Clinton's role in the purge of the White House travel 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is Ewing who is perhaps most familiar to the Clintons. He  
has questioned each of them repeatedly during the course of Starr's 
five-year criminal investigation. Testifying in the trial of Susan 
McDougal earlier this year on obstruction charges, Ewing said that 
at dinner one evening with other Starr staffers, he graded the 
president and first lady on their responses to questioning by 
Whitewater investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said the president was about a 'C' and Mrs. Clinton about an  
'F,''' Ewing testified. He said he made the statement after Mrs. 
Clinton said, ``'I don't recall' about 50 times'' during a 
deposition in July 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing acknowledged that he had drawn up a draft indictment of  
Mrs. Clinton, a step he said is not unusual in prosecutors' offices 
as they try to assess the evidence for and against potential 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office must compile a final report on the overall  
investigation of the Clintons, dealing with Whitewater, the FBI 
files controversy and the handling of documents from the White 
House office of deputy counsel Vincent Foster after his death in 
1993, which has been ruled a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's successor also will have to deal with the still-open  
investigation of possible obstruction in the testimony of 
presidential accuser Kathleen Willey in the Paula Jones sexual 
harassment lawsuit against the president. Mrs. Willey says 
President Clinton made an unwelcome sexual advance, an accusation 
the president denies. 
</P>
<P>
	According to courthouse employees, other candidates who were  
interviewed by the three-member panel of federal appeals court 
judges included: 
</P>
<P>
	--Mike Emmick, an assistant U.S. attorney who worked on the  
Monica Lewinsky investigation. Emmick was one of the prosecutors 
who tried to persuade Ms. Lewinsky to cooperate with Starr's office 
during a controversial daylong confrontation with the former White 
House intern in a hotel room. Starr's office was sharply criticized 
because the prosecutors discussed a possible immunity deal with Ms. 
Lewinsky without her attorney present. 
</P>
<P>
	--Paul Rosenzweig, who writes legal briefs for Starr's office and  
was the first prosecutor to receive word in January 1998 that a 
witness, who turned out to be Linda Tripp, had information for 
them. Rosenzweig got his information from a former law school 
classmate who was working behind the scene on the Paula Jones case. 
Clinton supporters seized Rosenzweig's role as support for their 
allegation that Starr's office was working in concert with Jones' 
legal team to hurt the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Page previously worked in another independent counsel's  
investigation of former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros. Page 
handled the case against Cisneros' ex-girlfriend for lying about 
tape recordings she made of telephone conversations with former San 
Antonio mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	At Susan McDougal's trial last spring, Ewing was subpoenaed by  
Mrs. McDougal's lawyers in an effort to demonstrate that Starr's 
office wanted her to tell lies that would falsely implicate the 
Clintons in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing as head of Starr's Little Rock office oversaw the  
examination of Mrs. Clinton's work as an Arkansas lawyer, including 
investigating the mysterious disappearance of her law firm billing 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Those records showed up in the White House under  
still-unexplained circumstances two years after they had been 
subpoenaed by a grand jury. The records revealed that Mrs. Clinton 
had done legal work on one of her Whitewater partner's land 
development projects south of Little Rock that federal bank 
examiners found was riddled with fraudulent transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's successful prosecutions of the Clintons' Whitewater  
partners and then-Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker dealt in large part 
with transactions at the land development where Mrs. Clinton had 
performed some legal work.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: No New Info. of U.S. Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen said today the  
Pentagon will look at any ``substantive information'' on claims of 
a mass killing of Korean civilians by U.S. soldiers during the 
Korean War, but he said he is not aware of any new information to 
support the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Accounts of South Korean villagers and a dozen ex-GIs who either  
witnessed or were involved in the killings were reported by The 
Associated Press on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser,  
called the AP report ``obviously deeply troubling. I intend to 
discuss this with Defense Department officials to attempt to 
determine the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Jakarta today, Cohen said that ``to the  
degree that any substantive information is forthcoming, we 
certainly would look at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, however, ``This has been examined on several occasions  
in the past and I am not aware that there is any information that 
would corroborate or support that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, spokesman Bryan Whitman said no further inquiry  
was immediately under way by the Defense Department as a result of 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The killings took place during three days in late July 1950, the  
American veterans said, when their Army battalion killed a large 
number of South Korean refugees beneath a railroad bridge at a 
hamlet called No Gun Ri. 
</P>
<P>
	With the soldiers' statements confirming much of their account,  
the Korean claimants called today for a U.S. investigation into the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Koreans have said in a series of petitions, including the  
latest one rejected in 1997 by the Korean government, that some 300 
refugees lay dead under the bridge's twin arches. About 100 others 
were killed in a preceding attack by U.S. Air Force planes, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the U.S. government will meet our demands and console  
the wandering souls of those who died an unfair death,'' the 
claimants said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. military has said repeatedly it found no basis for the  
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, after the AP report was released, Pentagon  
spokesman P.J. Crowley said, ``We just have no information in 
historical files to lend any clarity to what might have happened in 
July 1950.''

<HEADLINE> Bail Raised for Alleged Bilker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A New Jersey man accused of cheating Japanese  
investors out of up to $1 billion will face stricter bail 
conditions, a judge decided Thursday after prosecutors upgraded 
charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Armstrong, 50, of Maple Shade, N.J., must find four  
individuals who have $5 million in assets or he will be imprisoned 
beginning Oct. 7, U.S. Magistrate Judge Frank Maas ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's lawyer, Marc Durant, told Maas it was doubtful his  
client could raise bail. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not going to have even one person who has that kind of  
assets who can do this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Durant also said he ``disagrees vehemently'' with the amount of  
money prosecutors allege his client lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, Armstrong said the charges were ``absolutely  
false, dead false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defendant, carrying a book titled, ``The Chronicle of The  
Chinese Emperors,'' said he wished he could talk. ``I can't. I'd 
love to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong allegedly squandered millions of dollars in assets as  
the founder and chairman of a Princeton, N.J.-based investment 
firm, Princeton Economics International Limited. 
</P>
<P>
	For at least the last four years, Armstrong sold about $3  
billion in so-called Princeton Notes to foreign investors through 
the investment fund, authorities allege. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the promissory notes were advertised as  
conservative investments but instead were misused by Armstrong for 
risky trading ventures that failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong had been free for two weeks on $5 million bail secured  
by signatures from his 81-year-old mother and his two children. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian D. Coad asked for stricter bail  
conditions as prosecutors upgraded charges against Armstrong, 
adding additional counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, 
securities fraud and wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Coad said prosecutors believed Armstrong had significant assets  
in offshore bank accounts and was spending substantial amounts of 
money already on his legal defense. He said Armstrong had traveled 
extensively outside the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Durant, though, said his client did not have a checking or  
savings account or own property and had lived in a house with his 
mother since his wife left him early in their marriage, leaving him 
to raise two children alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer said Armstrong already would have fled if he were  
planning to do so, especially since he had been on notice of the 
severity of the case since Sept. 1, when the FBI raided the offices 
of his companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In arguing for tougher bail, Coad said investigators and Alan M.  
Cohen, the court-appointed receiver for Armstrong's businesses, had 
been obstructed by attorneys for Armstrong in their quest to 
unearth his assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong succeeded in getting the government of an offshore  
island to freeze his assets under the foreign entity's control so 
U.S. authorities could not intervene, Coad said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said the tighter bail requirements were necessary  
because ``given the amount of money involved, as time goes forward 
there is a substantial chance of flight.''

<HEADLINE> Election Officials Hold Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Election officials held a bipartisan  
conference from Iowa and New Hampshire on Thursday but failed to 
sort through a dispute over the lineup of caucuses and primaries 
that launch the presidential nominating season. 
</P>
<P>
	A meeting of a special commission that includes representatives  
of both parties in both states was scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, those two states have developed an agreement  
where Iowa's leadoff caucuses take place eight days before New 
Hampshire holds the nation's first primary. 
</P>
<P>
	That was threatened this year when New Hampshire Secretary of  
State Bill Gardner announced that his state's primary would be Feb. 
1, the day after Iowa's caucuses, tentatively set for Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try to resolve this issue,'' said Iowa  
Secretary of State Chet Culver. ``We're looking forward to having 
these discussions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican and Democratic leaders in Iowa said they hoped to  
pressure Gardner into moving to Feb. 8, when most assumed the 
primary would be held. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner said New Hampshire's date was not negotiable. ``We've  
got the calendar being printed,'' he said. ``It's going to be Feb. 
1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Iowa officials said they'll continue to press, but point  
to a state law requiring that Iowa's caucuses be held eight days 
before another primary, holding out the possibility that the caucus 
date could again be changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are holding out hope, but we will do whatever it takes to  
remain the first caucus state,'' said Joe Shannahan, a spokesman 
for Gov. Tom Vilsack. 
</P>
<P>
	Culver said he was arranging a conference call between top  
Republicans and Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire, hoping to sort 
through the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Depending on what they say, we'll go to plan B,'' said Culver.  
``We have a state law, which we have to comply with, which says we 
have to go eight days before any other primary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of the dispute is the heavy attention and campaign  
time given to states that launch the nominating process. Officials 
in Iowa and New Hampshire have banded together in past elections to 
ward off challenges from other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking a slice of the limelight, a host of other states have  
moved their primary elections closer and closer to the beginning of 
the season, a ``frontloading'' that's reshaped presidential 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	It's likely that both parties will have a nominee within six  
weeks of the opening of the nominating process, putting an 
extraordinary importance on money and name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	Dee Stewart, executive director of the Iowa Republican Party,  
said continued negotiations are likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think we need to continue to work,'' said Stewart.  
</P>
<P>
	Part of the reluctance to once again move the date of Iowa's  
caucuses is pure logistics. Officials in both parties must find 
sites for the caucuses in each of the state's more than 2,000 
precincts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to convince them it's a serious problem,'' said

	Full Probe Sought on Korea Killings  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- With new evidence in hand, South  
Koreans who say they survived a U.S. Army machine-gunning of 
hundreds of refugees in the Korean War demanded a formal U.S. 
investigation today into what happened beneath the No Gun Ri 
railroad bridge in July 1950. ``The U.S. government can no longer 
deny its responsibility,'' they said in a statement. The Pentagon 
said any ``compelling new evidence'' would cause it to take another 
look at the long-standing allegations. The South Korean government 
said it will investigate whether the survivors' claims are true or 
not. The Associated Press reported yesterday that a dozen Army 
veterans, in AP interviews, corroborated the core of the Koreans' 
account of the killings at No Gun Ri, a hamlet 100 miles southeast 
of Seoul.

	Cohen: No Evidence of U.S. Massacre  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen said  
today he knows of no evidence that would substantiate claims that 
U.S. soldiers massacred South Koreans during the Korean War. The 
claims of South Korean villagers and a dozen ex-GIs were reported 
by The Associated Press. At a news conference in Jakarta today, 
Cohen said: ``I am not aware of any evidence that would support or 
substantiate those claims. But to the degree that any substantive 
information is forthcoming, we certainly would look at it. But this 
has been examined on several occasions in the past and I am not 
aware that there is any information that would corroborate or 
support that.''

	Barak Promises Lebanon Withdrawal  
</P>
<P>
	BEIT EL, West Bank (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak renewed a  
campaign pledge today to get Israeli troops out of Lebanon by July 
2000 -- but he was evasive about whether he will do so if peace 
talks with Syria do not materialize. Barak spoke a day after his 
deputy defense minister, Ephraim Sneh, said Israel would only pull 
out of Lebanon as part of a security arrangement with Syria, the 
main power broker in Lebanon. Sneh's remarks raised speculation 
that Barak was trying to back away from his withdrawal pledge since 
prospects are remote at this stage that Syria will agree to 
guarantee quiet on the Israeli-Lebanese border after an Israeli 
pullout.

	Students Assault Australian Embassy  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- About 400 student protesters threw  
rocks and petrol bombs at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta today 
in anger over Canberra's role in the multinational peacekeeping 
force in East Timor. The attack is the latest in a series of 
incidents against the mission, which twice has been hit by gunfire 
since the Australian-led intervention in East Timor began 10 days 
ago. There also have been daily protests at the diplomatic compound 
in the capital's downtown. Witnesses said at least three 
Indonesians were injured.

	Grass Wins Nobel in Literature  
</P>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Guenter Grass, one of the most  
significant authors to emerge from Germany after World War II, was 
named the winner today of the 1999 Nobel Literature Prize. The 
Swedish Academy cited Grass' first novel, ``The Tin Drum,'' 
published in 1959, which recreates his hometown, Danzig, in the 
years before the war. ``It is not too audacious to assume that `The 
Tin Drum' will become one of the enduring literary works of the 
20th century,'' the academy said in a statement.

	Economic Growth Slows in 2nd Qtr.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy, weighted down by record  
trade deficits, saw growth slow to an annual rate of 1.6 percent in 
the spring -- worse than previously estimated and the smallest gain 
in four years. But many private economists believe the slowdown 
reported today by the Commerce Department was only a brief pause. 
They are looking for growth to rebound in the current 
July-September quarter to a sizzling rate of 4 percent or higher. 

</P>
<P>
	Wall Street Stocks Open Higher  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened higher with the Dow  
Jones Industrial Average up 38 points in today's early going. 
Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange lead decliners by almost 
2-1. The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 4 points.

	Final Candlestick Game Today  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Candlestick Park will host its final major  
league game today when the San Francisco Giants face the Los 
Angeles Dodgers. Candlestick opened on April 12, 1960 -- two seasons 
after the Giants moved west from New York. Vice President Richard 
Nixon and Hall of Famer Ty Cobb presided over the opening ceremony. 
Now the fifth-oldest park in the majors, Candlestick was home to 
Willie McCovey, Juan Marichal and Mays, who hit 203 homers there 
and undoubtedly would have hit many more if not for the gusts 
blowing in from left field. The Giants will leave the wind-swept 
stadium to the NFL's 49ers.

<HEADLINE> House Votes on Violence to Fetuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Thursday to make it a crime to  
harm a fetus during a violent act against a pregnant woman. It is a 
key bill this year for opponents of legalized abortion, and the 
administration threatened a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, said leading abortion foe Rep. Christopher Smith,  
R-N.J., ``recognizes in law the self-evident truth that an assault 
on a pregnant woman is an attack on two victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, which passed 254-172, makes it a separate  
offense to injure or kill a fetus in the commission of a federal 
crime of violence against a pregnant woman. 
</P>
<P>
	A person need not have knowledge of the pregnancy to be charged  
separately for harming a fetus. When an assailant intentionally 
kills or attempts to kill a fetus, the punishment is the same as 
that for similar acts against a person. 
</P>
<P>
	But the death penalty does not apply and the bill does not apply  
to abortions performed with the mother's consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 24 states have laws that recognize the unborn as potential  
victims. Supporters led by Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said 
federal laws too should allow prosecutors to bring murder charges 
in cases of violence where a fetus dies, even if the mother 
survives the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill recognizes that when a pregnant woman is assaulted  
it is a more serious situation,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the 
House Judiciary Committee chairman. ``That second little victim 
deserves recognition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Democratic-led opponents argued that abortion opponents  
again were using a commendable goal, halting violence against 
women, to undermine abortion rights guaranteed in the 1973 Roe vs. 
Wade Supreme Court decision. 
</P>
<P>
	It recognizes ``for the first time under federal law that an  
embryo fetus is a person with rights separate and equal to that of 
a woman,'' said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of addressing the real issue at hand,'' said Rep. Nita  
Lowey, D-N.Y. ``this bill is an ideological marker for the 
anti-choice special interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was the most contentious involving fetal rights to hit  
the House floor this year. In recent years the GOP-led Congress has 
concentrated on banning a late-term abortion procedure known as 
partial birth abortions, but has been thwarted twice by 
presidential vetoes. It was unclear whether the Senate would take 
up the legislation this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department, in a letter to Hyde, said the bill was  
constitutionally suspect and ``unprecedented as a matter of federal 
statute'' in making the fetus and mother separate victims. It said 
the bill could be seen as ``gratuitously plunging the federal 
government into one of the most, if not the most difficult, 
difficult and complex issues of religious and scientific 
consideration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House issued a statement saying the president would be  
advised to veto the legislation in its current form. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats offered a substitute, proposed by Rep. Zoe Lofgren,  
D-Calif., that would create a separate federal criminal offense for 
violence against pregnant women, with increased punishments when 
that pregnancy is harmed or terminated. The proposal, which does 
not mention the fetus, was defeated 224-201. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee denied  
that abortion foes were trying to make the bill a ``proxy vote'' on 
Roe vs. Wade. But he said it was one of the most important issues 
Congress is taking up this year. ``The children who are killed in 
these crimes are just as dead as those who die in the abortion 
clinic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood, said ``the  
intent of the law is clear -- separate the fetus from the woman, and 
attach rights of personhood on the fetus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 2436.

<HEADLINE> Widow Battles Mo. School for $5.7M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- An 89-year-old widow who said her  
husband made her buy day-old bread as he secretly saved $5.7 
million is fighting to keep some of the money from going to the 
University of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Olive Deal, who lives in a nursing home here, said she was  
unaware her husband, John, had amassed a fortune until he fell ill 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Deal, who died in September 1998, established four trusts at the  
universities of Missouri and Kansas. Three, totaling $2.3 million, 
cannot be revoked. However, Mrs. Deal wants at least one-third of a 
$3.4 million trust at the University of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	A South Carolina Family Court judge awarded Mrs. Deal $2.5  
million last year. The school, contending she is being used by 
family members who will inherit her estate, questions whether it 
must adhere to South Carolina court orders and has refused to alter 
the trust, according to court records cited by The Greenville News 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``My fear is that you have a university that is an arm of the  
state of Missouri hiding behind the protections of the state of 
Missouri and defrauding this little old lady in South Carolina,'' 
said Mrs. Deal's lawyer, Ned Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Deals lived frugally during a 50-year marriage and survived  
on Social Security checks after retiring, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deal was an entomologist for the State Department who spent most  
of his career in China. He was an alumnus of Kansas. Missouri 
officials do not know why he established a trust for their school. 
</P>
<P>
	The trusts were discovered after a South Carolina judge  
appointed Deal's nephew to oversee Deal's estate during his 
illness.

<HEADLINE> Pizza Hut Buys Rocket Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- In an effort to send sales into a new orbit, Pizza  
Hut Inc. plans to put its new logo on a Russian rocket carrying a 
piece of the International Space Station. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-foot ad will be slapped on a 200-foot Proton rocket  
scheduled for a mid-November launch from Russia's space city, 
Baikonur, Kazakhstan. The rocket will be carrying the space 
station's living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Pizza Hut chief executive officer Mike Rawlings said today the  
pizza chain is paying about half the price of a 30-second 
television ad during the Super Bowl -- currently up to $2.5 million 
-- for rights to put the ad on the rocket. He wouldn't be more 
precise. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials plan to use the Proton launch as the  
centerpiece of a major space-oriented ad campaign, including 
commercials featuring the blastoff and in-store promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rawlings said Pizza Hut marketers first considered trying to put  
the updated logo -- the company's name beneath a red roof -- on the 
moon with lasers. 
</P>
<P>
	But, after consulting for two months with astronomers and  
physicists, they found that the image would have to be as big as 
Texas to be seen by earthlings more than 238,000 miles away. The 
project also would have cost hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we found this opportunity that has so much credibility and  
so much excitement for people, and we're real excited about making 
it happen,'' Rawlings said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time an American company has paid the  
cash-starved Russian space program for an ad. PepsiCo Inc. paid $5 
million three years ago to have cosmonauts float a replica of a 
soda can outside the Mir space station. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians have been pitchmen for other products as well and  
once gave a Japanese TV reporter a seat aboard a rocket for cash. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. law prevents advertisers from putting ads on American  
spacesuits, but the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
is interested in working with private businesses to commercialize 
space. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old pizza chain is trying to overhaul and update its  
image by spending $500 million to modernize its restaurants with 
sleeker designs and higher ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
	Rawlings also has worked to improve the company's product with  
fresher pizza toppings. The new logo was another part of his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided that if we were going to launch this logo, to  
really launch it and find a big way to do it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Full Probe Sought on Korea Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- With new evidence in hand, South  
Koreans who say they survived a U.S. Army machine-gunning of 
hundreds of refugees in the Korean War demanded a formal U.S. 
investigation today into what happened beneath the No Gun Ri 
railroad bridge in July 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. government can no longer deny its responsibility,''  
they said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon said any ``compelling new evidence'' would cause it  
take another look at the long-standing allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Korean government said it will investigate whether the  
survivors' claims are true or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``With keen attention, we'll try to verify the truth of all  
related things concerning the case,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Chang Chul-kyun said. ``Any further action will be decided after 
those efforts are finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press on Wednesday reported that a dozen Army  
veterans, in AP interviews, corroborated the core of the Koreans' 
account of the killings at No Gun Ri, a hamlet 100 miles southeast 
of Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	The Koreans say 300 of their relatives and other civilians were  
shot to death at the bridge, and 100 others died in a preceding 
U.S. air attack. American veterans said anywhere from 100 to 
``hundreds'' of civilians were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP also reported, based on declassified U.S. military  
archives, that U.S. commanders at the time issued orders to their 
troops to shoot civilians to guard against disguised North Korean 
enemy among columns of South Korean refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen, traveling in Indonesia today,  
said past examination had found nothing to back up the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not aware of any evidence that would support or  
substantiate those claims. But to the degree that any substantive 
information is forthcoming, we certainly would look at it,'' he 
told a press conference in Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this has been examined on several occasions in the past  
and I am not aware that there is any information that would 
corroborate or support that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP research also found no official Army account of the No  
Gun Ri events. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said that ``if there's  
compelling new evidence to look at, obviously it would be important 
to make sure we've left no stone unturned in getting to the bottom 
of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After years of futilely pressing their claim, the ``Petitioners  
of No Gun Ri'' group was jubilant over the U.S. news report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked up at the heaven and looked down at the earth, but  
there was none who would listen to our sad story,'' said Chun 
Choon-ja, 61, her voice quivering over tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never been happier before. Now I can rest in peace when  
I die,'' said Park Sun-yong, 75, who said her small son and 
daughter were killed by U.S. soldiers at No Gun Ri. 
</P>
<P>
	The group filed a claim with the South Korean Government  
Compensation Committee in 1997, but it was rejected last year 
because a five-year statute of limitations had expired long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In its statement today, the group demanded that the U.S. and  
South Korean governments launch immediate investigations of No Gun 
Ri, that ``the U.S. president and Congress make an apology and 
compensation,'' and that the United States build a memorial to the 
dead at the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the U.S. government will meet our demands and console  
the wandering souls of those who died an unfair death,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Koreans had the support of the U.S. National Council of  
Churches. 
</P>
<P>
	``The South Korean victims and their relatives deserve  
justice,'' its general secretary, the Rev. Dr. Joan B. Campbell, 
said in New York. She urged that the ``truth should be disclosed to 
the public and the families of the victims should be compensated 
adequately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her statement also praised the courage of the American veterans  
who talked publicly about the events. 
</P>
<P>
	The church group had taken up the South Koreans' cause last  
year, asking the Pentagon to investigate No Gun Ri. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the United States, a veterans' leader called the  
news report ``propaganda more than anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if it did happen, I don't think we need to hear this  
really,'' said Harley Coon, president of the Korean War Veterans 
Association. ``I can't see where it's going to do anyone any good. 
It's certainly not going to shed any good light on our military.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a top Korean War historian, the University of Chicago's  
Bruce Cumings, said the new information is essential to setting the 
historical record straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything that can be done to bring out the truth of the Korean  
War as Koreans experienced it will serve reconciliation. It will 
serve to bring Koreans together,'' Cumings said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of America's most popular military historians, Stephen E.  
Ambrose, signaled that the news about No Gun Ri was not surprising. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you put guns into the hands of poorly trained young  
men and send them off to a foreign country, bad things are sure to 
happen,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  IMF Head Warns Against Complacency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Governments should not be lulled into  
complacency by the calm prevailing in world markets and the 
improved economic growth after last year's global financial crises, 
the head of the International Monetary Fund said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michel Camdessus told finance ministers and central bank  
governors from 182 countries they must to fight complacency if they 
want to avert future crises and press on with reforming 
international financial systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be making a grave error if we let the return of  
relative calm in financial markets and the improvement in world 
growth prospects lead us to believe that further reforms are not 
necessary,'' Camdessus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus spoke at the end of the annual meetings of the World  
Bank and the IMF. The organizations earlier approved a new $27 
billion debt relief initiative intended to let 36 of the world's 
poorest countries spend money on education and health projects 
rather than on loan interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said governments now are ``obliged to deliver on what  
has been promised ... these steps have created a strong new impetus 
to the war on poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate announcement, the IMF said its board has approved  
a plan for a one-time off-market sale of up to 14 million ounces of 
gold to finance the debt relief initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other issues discussed during the nine-day sessions  
were the appreciation of the Japanese yen against the dollar, 
Ecuador's decision to default on $98 billion in bond payments, 
alleged money laundering by Russia and enlisting the private sector 
in preventing and resolving financial crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Camdessus discounted speculation he may consider  
resigning before the end of his third five-year term in 2002. 
Wolfensohn was reappointed to a second five-year term during the 
meetings.

<HEADLINE> Milwaukee Gets 2002 All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Miller Park, whose opening was pushed back a  
year until 2001, will be the site of baseball's All-Star game the 
following season. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement had been expected since Bud Selig, whose family  
controls the Brewers through a trust, became commissioner in July 
1998. The All-Star game was last at Milwaukee in 1975 and orginally 
was scheduled to return this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an opportunity for us to show off nationally -- to show  
off internationally -- both Miller Park and all the things going on 
in this community,'' said Brewers president Wendy Selig-Prieb, the 
commissioner's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers had hoped to move from County Stadium to adjacent  
Miller Park next season, but a construction accident in July killed 
three ironworkers and delayed the ballpark's completion a full 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Brewers headed for a seventh consecutive losing season,  
manager Phil Garner was fired mid-season and general manager Sal 
Bando was reassigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig-Prieb called the announcement about the 2002 All-Star game  
and last week's hiring of new general manager Dean Taylor ``the 
beginning of what I hoped would be a lot of good news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig said Milwaukee can expect to see at least 100,000 visitors  
in town for the game. The game could be worth $70 to $80 million to 
the city's economy, Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers originally were awarded the 1999 All-Star game. Then  
it became Miller Park wouldn't be ready this year, and the Brewers 
then switched to the National League. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's game is in Boston. The All-Star game will be at  
Atlanta next season and at Seattle in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The only time the Brewers have been host to an All Star game was  
for the NL's 6-3 win in 1975. The game also was played in Milwaukee 
in 1955, when the Braves were located in the city. The NL won 6-5.

<HEADLINE> Chemical Processing To Halt for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- A temporary halt in production on New  
Years Eve of a deadly chemical is among the precautions being taken 
by some leading manufacturers against toxic accidents and 
production foul-ups caused by Y2K computer trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Chemical manufacturers are confident that plants and production  
systems are safe from computer glitches that threaten operations 
Jan. 1. But brief production halts are planned as a fail-safe 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhone-Poulenc, DuPont, Monsanto and Ashland Chemical all said  
they will idle some North American plant operations on the weekend 
when the calendar turns from 1999 to 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel secure that we're Y2K-compliant, but we made a  
decision that where prudent, we will not produce,'' said Tom Dover, 
support manager at the Institute, W.Va., plant where Rhone-Poulenc

pesticide plant at Bhopal, India, in 1984 and killed 3,000 people 
in the world's worst industrial accident. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``We're not going to operate those processes that have  
some of our highly hazardous materials in them.''

<P>
	For the same reason, Rhone-Poulenc is also planning to eliminate  
its stockpiles of methyl isocyanate before the end of the year, 
Dover said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts fear that with the arrival of 2000, older computers  
that read only the last two digits of a year might mistake the year 
for 1900, causing shutdowns and malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The chemical companies want to avoid not only accidents but also  
ruined batches of chemicals if computers shut down or if power and 
other utilities are interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Year's Eve shutdowns go beyond the way many companies  
often suspend operations over holiday weekends. Many chemical 
companies normally run at least some of their plants around the 
clock every day of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Certain chemical processing operations at Ashland's 15 U.S.  
plants will not operate from Friday night until Monday morning ``to 
take extra precautions,'' spokesman Jim Vitak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because New Year's Day is on a Saturday, companies expect  
production shutdowns will cause few problems and not be excessively 
expensive, Vitak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto will halt production for about eight hours before and  
after midnight on Dec. 31, said John Ogens, director of the 
company's Global Year 2000 Project. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Couvillion, global director for DuPont's Year 2000 Project,  
said managers at each of the company's 321 production units 
worldwide will decide whether to idle all or portions of the 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Clancy, spokesman for Union Carbide Corp. in Danbury,  
Conn., said the manufacturer does not expect shutdowns at any of 
its seven plants in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Carbide built the pesticide plant at Bhopal, and paid a  
$470 million settlement in 1989 for the accident.

	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Some major chemical manufacturers plan  
to suspend operations on New Year's Eve as a precaution against 
toxic accidents and production foul-ups caused by Y2K computer 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhone-Poulenc, DuPont, Monsanto and Ashland Chemical all said  
they will idle some North American plant operations on the weekend 
when the calendar turns from 1999 to 2000.

<HEADLINE> Man Who Hit Stephen King Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS, Maine (AP) -- The driver who hit horror writer Stephen  
King was indicted by a grand jury Thursday on charges of aggravated 
assault and driving to endanger. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oxford County grand jury found that Bryan E. Smith ``did  
recklessly cause serious bodily injury to Stephen King'' as the 
author was walking along a country road June 19 in Lovell. 
</P>
<P>
	Aggravated assault carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in  
prison. The other charge could bring Smith up to six months in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	King, who was walking against traffic, was thrown 14 feet and  
suffered multiple broken bones and a collapsed lung. He is 
recovering at his Bangor home. King has said he believes Smith is a 
danger to himself and others and should not be allowed to drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 42, told police he lost control of his Dodge Caravan  
because he was distracted by his dog, and has called the incident 
``an accident without a cause.'' Smith has said that he is very 
sorry for what happened, but that the accident should not be 
treated as a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Norman Croteau said the case was not reviewed  
differently than any other case in which a pedestrian was injured.

	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- A Jewish boarding school is planned as  
the first in the country for high school students from all three 
branches of Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers say they have raised $40 million for the first phase  
of construction of the American Hebrew Academy for about 800 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	There are Orthodox Jewish boarding schools around the country,  
but planners said the Greensboro academy will be the first to 
include Conservative and Reform branches. 
</P>
<P>
	The school, which organizers call pluralistic or liberal, will  
emphasize Jewish identity. Midsize cities nationwide lack such 
schools, and planners hope Hebrew Academy will appeal to students 
from such communities. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of Greensboro philanthropists began planning the school  
in 1996, and an anonymous donor provided 100 acres for the campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron Green of San Francisco, a protege of architect Frank Lloyd  
Wright, is designing the school, incorporating such touches as 
stone from Jerusalem. Eight to 10 buildings will be constructed 
during the first phase, to begin in November.

 *Nun says she will accept Vatican's ban, stop gay ministry    	
</P>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A nun ordered by the Vatican to cease her  
ministry to gay and lesbian Roman Catholics says she will obey the 
church's order but will work within the church to have it reversed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sister Jeannine Gramick said in a statement that she believes it  
more beneficial to minister to gays and lesbians with the church's 
blessing than without it. But she called on fellow Catholics to 
``help me find creative, collaborative ways to lift the burden of 
this directive from my shoulders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gramick, 57, and the Rev. Robert Nugent founded New Ways  
Ministry in Mt. Rainier, Md., in 1977 to ``promote justice and 
reconciliation of gays and lesbians.'' They were summoned to Rome 
last July and ordered to stop their work. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith said  
Nugent and Gramick ``have caused confusion among the Roman Catholic 
people and have harmed the community of the church.'' It called 
their teachings ``erroneous and dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent said in late July he would stop ministering to  
homosexuals. But Gramick said she was ``anguished and deeply 
troubled'' and took a month's leave from her ministerial 
commitments to decide whether she would obey the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Catholic Church teaches that homosexual acts are  
sinful, it also says that homosexuals should be treated with 
``respect, compassion and sensitivity.''

 *Church of the Nazarene joins world Methodist body    	
</P>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Church of the Nazarene, a  
conservative denomination that has largely shunned ecumenical 
affiliations, has joined the World Methodist Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The council's largest U.S. member is the more liberal United  
Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nazarene church stems from 19th century U.S. ``holiness''  
revivals that began largely within Methodist circles and eventually 
produced separate denominations. The Nazarenes have 620,000 U.S. 
members, and 1.3 million including affiliated churches worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Methodist council leaders approved the Nazarene church's  
application at a September meeting in Hong Kong. A council 
executive said talks had gone on for decades with the Nazarene 
church, the largest body in the Wesleyan tradition that was outside 
its membership.

 *Catholic parish survey shows impact of priest shortage    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new survey shows that 17 percent of U.S.  
Catholic parishes lack a resident priest. In most cases such 
parishes are served by a priest from another parish, but others are 
administered by deacons, sisters or brothers in religious orders, 
or lay members. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings come from a survey of parishes by the Center for  
Applied Research in the Apostolate, affiliated with Georgetown 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey said lay ministers outnumber priests in every region  
of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The center's report said the average U.S. Catholic parish  
consists of 850 households and 2,000 individuals, among whom about 
40 percent attend weekly Mass.

 *Interfaith TV network continues scaled-down religious programming    	
</P>
<P>
	STUDIO CITY, Calif. (AP) -- The Odyssey Network, a cable TV  
outlet founded by an interfaith coalition, continues to offer 
scaled-down religious programming in the fall season premiering 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Odyssey, which reaches 29 million homes, put a new emphasis on  
family-oriented entertainment last April after Hallmark 
Entertainment and the Jim Henson Company jointly paid $100 million 
for 45 percent ownership. Another secular firm, Liberty Media, is 
also a part owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Religious programming was the total fare when the New York-based  
National Interfaith Cable Coalition launched the network in 1988. 
Originally called the VISN channel, it was later renamed the Faith 
&AMP; Values channel and became Odyssey in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In this fall's schedule, religious shows fill three morning  
hours and two overnight hours. There are also religious programs 
Saturday nights after 10 and on Sundays from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m.

 *Southern Baptists scuttle study    	
</P>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The executive committee of the Southern  
Baptist Convention voted against a study on the influence of 
alleged ``unbiblical'' worship styles, a reference to charismatic 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	But the head of Georgia's Baptists, the Rev. Gerald Harris of  
Marietta, told the executive committee the issue is unlikely to 
die. Last November, his state convention narrowly defeated a move 
to bar membership to churches using charismatic practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris said the practice, such as the revival initiated at the  
Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola, Fla., is drawing churches 
away from the Baptist denomination and ``causing a great deal of 
disruption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The executive committee acted on a motion referred by the  
Baptists' national gathering in June.

 *Methodist faces second church trial over same-sex ceremony    	
</P>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Methodist pastor Jimmy Creech faces a second  
church trial for performing a gay unity ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska's Bishop Joel Martinez said Creech must stand trial for  
conducting an April ritual for two men in Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	A March 1998 church trial cleared Creech over a similar 1997  
ceremony involving two women, but then the Methodists' highest 
court ruled that such rituals violate church law. 
</P>
<P>
	Creech, who lives in Raleigh, N.C., maintains that the United  
Methodist Church law against rituals for same-sex couples amounts 
to institutional bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was disappointed by the church panel's decision but  
not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, likely to be held in Nebraska in the next few months,  
will be ``a detriment to the church,'' he said, calling it ``an act 
of violence against lesbians, gays and bisexual people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A jury of 13 ministers will decide Creech's fate. If convicted,  
Creech could be dismissed from the clergy. 
</P>
<P>
	Creech went on voluntary leave of absence after Martinez  
declined to reappoint him pastor of Omaha's First United Methodist 
Church after the earlier controversy.

<HEADLINE> Party Loyalists Applaud Gore Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From President Clinton on down, Democratic  
Party loyalists applauded Vice President Al Gore's latest campaign 
shakeup -- but with a relieved sigh that hinted, ``It's about 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some greeted with bemusement Thursday the vice president's  
almost prideful claim: ``I now am, in effect, the underdog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in New York, Gore said he will personally open his  
new Tennessee headquarters next Wednesday, ``and the campaign will 
arrive a few days after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, asked about Gore's bombshell, told reporters at the  
White House that he and the vice president had long talked about 
Gore relocating and loosening up his personal campaign style. 
</P>
<P>
	The president suggested that he had pressed the changes because  
the same strategy worked for his Little Rock, Ark.-based campaign 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose I think that because I had such a good experience  
when I stayed home, close to my roots. We discussed it a long time 
ago,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they were good decisions, and I think they'll get good  
results. And the most important thing is, he made them and he 
believes in them,'' the president added. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee Democratic Party Chairman Douglas A. Horne enthused  
that Gore made a ``great move'' that would relocate his operation 
to ``where the normal people are, and show the American people that 
Al Gore is now Al Gore only and not just doing President Clinton's 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horne added, ``We would have liked for him to have done it even  
sooner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Begala, a veteran of the `92 Clinton-Gore campaign's Little  
Rock ``War Room,'' had also been pushing Gore for months to get out 
of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows me that Gore's on the side of bold action,'' Begala  
said. ``Al Gore has his mo-jo back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Sullivan, the state party chairwoman in New Hampshire,  
where Gore narrowly trails Bill Bradley in polls gauging the 
Democratic presidential nomination race, chuckled at Gore's newly 
adopted label. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, New Hampshire does have this reputation for going for  
the underdog,'' Sullivan said. ``I guess we have to wait and see 
who's the real underdog on Election Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Gore's backing by the party establishment -- 18  
senators, 19 former senators, 96 House members, 17 former House 
members, eight governors, eight former governors, 13 lieutenant 
governors and 241 mayors -- hardly jives with his claim to the 
underdog title. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, he scooped up endorsements from 750 CEOs and  
business leaders from across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its kind of silly that he's calling himself the underdog,''  
said New Jersey Democratic Chairman Thomas Giblin, a Bradley 
supporter. ``He has the influence of the White House and a lot of 
the operatives of the Democratic National Committee working on his 
behalf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said former Clinton adviser Dee Dee Myers: ``I'm not sure he  
needs to label himself an underdog. He can let other people do that 
for him'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign aides, meanwhile, scrambled over the logistics of  
uprooting Gore's multi-million-dollar headquarters from Washington 
-- where Gore's three floors of a downtown office building cost him 
$59,069 a month in rent -- for a more down-home Nashville operation 
at 1800 Church Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're moving it from K Street to the aisles of K-Mart,'' Gore  
beamed. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign manager Craig Smith is leading the transition team, but  
he told his colleagues Thursday that he will not move to Tennessee 
because he has a young family in Washington that he does not want 
to leave behind. 
</P>
<P>
	No decision has been made on the future of the campaign manager  
spot, another Gore aide said. Others in Gore's senior staff 
remained undecided about the abrupt move South. 
</P>
<P>
	With some aides talking about a possible telecommute from their  
Washington homes, California Democratic consultant Bill Carrick 
sounded a warning: ``That will not work if they have war resisters 
staying behind the lines.''

<HEADLINE> McHale, Thompson To Be Enshrined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Kevin McHale pushed himself beyond  
pain and whatever else stood in his way. John Thompson pushed 
himself and everyone around him until they sometimes felt like 
shoving back. 
</P>
<P>
	The high standards of the Boston Celtics star and the Georgetown  
coach propelled them into the Basketball Hall of Fame. They will be 
inducted Friday night, along with Cleveland Cavaliers executive 
Wayne Embry, women's college coach Billie Moore, and the late NBA 
pioneer and owner Fred Zollner. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale, who formed a powerful frontcourt with Larry Bird and  
Robert Parish, made it into the Hall of Fame on his first try. 
Other triumphs did not come so easily, like the 1987 final against 
the Los Angeles Lakers that McHale played with a battered right 
foot. He reportedly used a patio chair as a walker when he was off 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all that pain, we don't want you to play,'' his coach,  
K.C. Jones, said, adding. ``He said, `I'm doing this!' '' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a testament ... to his fiber,'' Parish said Thursday.  
``Most players with a broken foot wouldn't think of playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics lost in six games, and McHale underwent surgery. He  
was hobbled by foot and ankle injuries until retiring in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	But during 13 seasons with Boston, McHale played on championship  
teams in 1981, 1984 and 1986. He made seven NBA All-Star teams. 
</P>
<P>
	A Minnesotan with a taste for the outdoors and an easygoing  
exterior, McHale at first wanted to play hockey. But he grew to a 
gangly, long-limbed 6-foot-10 and came to Boston in 1980 as the 
sixth man. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale eventually learned to shoot a jump hook and a fadeaway  
jumper. He transformed himself into one of the league's most feared 
offensive threats, averaging 55 percent from the floor during his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson captured his share of glory, too. During 27 seasons at  
Georgetown, he stalked the sidelines with a towel habitually draped 
over his shoulder. Georgetown made 24 straight postseason 
appearances, three NCAA Final Fours, and won the 1984 national 
championship -- the first ever won by a black coach. 
</P>
<P>
	But it took the outspoken, even combative Thompson three tries  
to reach the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're standing for your views, you're going to have  
enemies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a `yes' man, maybe you can get into the Hall of Fame  
-- but that's not his nature,'' said Tom Heinsohn, another Hall of 
Famer from the Celtics. He played with Thompson when the future 
college coach was a backup center for Bill Russell. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinsohn said he would have picked Thompson for the Hall of Fame  
even more for being a ``social worker'' with his many players from 
poor backgrounds than for being a winning coach. Colleagues say 
Thompson always demanded that his players be their best on court 
and in class. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Shapland, an athletic department staffer who worked for  
Thompson for 15 years, said the coach taught him Yoda's lesson in 
``Star Wars'': ``There is no try; do or do not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He challenged you. There were some days I left the court as a  
player not thinking good thoughts about him,'' said Georgetown 
coach Craig Esherick, who played for Thompson and later was his 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson also demanded more and better chances for minorities.  
Thompson endured racial taunts when he first fielded a 
predominantly black team at Georgetown. He boycotted two games in 
1989 to protest NCAA Proposition 42, saying its financial limits 
hurt minority athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when finally elected to the Hall of Fame, Thompson grumbled  
that maybe his politics had delayed his entry.

<HEADLINE> Greyhound To Install Bus Lifts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To resolve allegations of discrimination,  
Greyhound Lines Inc. agreed Thursday to phase in lift-equipped 
buses for disabled riders two years before it is required to have 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department reached the out-of-court agreement with  
the nation's largest intercity bus company after receiving a number 
of complaints that Greyhound drivers and employees had violated the 
Americans With Disabilities Act by discriminating against the 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the complaints involved refusal to aid a disabled person  
in boarding a bus, injuries that occurred when disabled riders were 
carried on or off buses or other mistreatment, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carrying people with disabilities onto buses is often  
dangerous and humiliating,'' said Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant 
attorney general in charge of the Civil Rights Division. ``This 
agreement is an important step towards eliminating carrying in 
intercity transportation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee added that the agreement is important for disabled people  
because ``intercity bus service is often the only affordable form 
of transportation for many people with disabilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greyhound President Craig Lentzsch said, ``The agreement brings  
closure to 14 unresolved complaints by passengers over a period of 
seven years, 1992-1998. During that period, we carried more than 
100 million passengers, including several million who described 
themselves as disabled.'' He said Greyhound cooperated with the 
Justice investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Department rules require that Greyhound and all  
other bus operators provide lift-equipped bus service on 48 hours 
notice, beginning Oct. 28, 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greyhound agreed to take two steps before that deadline:  
</P>
<P>
	--Between now and March 31, 2000, Greyhound will begin providing  
lift-equipped buses or station-based boarding devices along its 
major routes and will try to make them available on its other 
routes if passengers call Greyhound's toll-free ADA hot line, 
1-800-752-4841, 48 hours before they travel. At first, the company 
does not expect to be able to fill all requests for equipment but 
will still provide assistance, by carrying if necessary, to get on 
and off at all stops, including for rest and meals. 
</P>
<P>
	--Beginning April 1, 2000, Greyhound's ``Access Greyhound''  
program will guarantee accessible buses between any of the 2,600 
locations it serves if it has 48 hours notice -- except when there 
are sudden breakdowns in the bus or the lift, an unforeseen lack of 
trained personnel, an unusually high demand or the service at a 
particular site would be very costly. The company will still 
provide assistance even if a lift-equipped bus cannot be found. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Oct. 28, 2001, all newly purchased or leased buses  
will have lifts and Greyhound will provide lift-equipped buses 
between any locations on 48 hours' notice. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also agreed to train all its employees in assisting  
disabled riders, set up an internal dispute resolution procedure to 
handle complaints from disabled riders within 90 days, inform 
passengers of their rights, set up an advisory committee of 
disability rights advocates and remove other barriers in Greyhound 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Greyhound will pay more than $17,500 in damages,  
including payments from $500 to $4,000 to 14 individuals who 
complained about its service. These include allegations by people 
who said they were refused passage or boarding assistance because 
of their impaired vision or mobility, were inappropriately carried 
on or off buses or were verbally harassed.

<HEADLINE> ACLU Suit Challenges Drug Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The American Civil Liberties Union filed a  
lawsuit Thursday to stop Michigan from requiring drug tests for 
welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's Family Independence Agency said it would begin  
testing on Friday unless the court ordered it not to. 
</P>
<P>
	``We call it the Family Independence Agency for a reason,'' Gov.  
John Engler's spokesman John Truscott said Thursday. ``If someone's 
abusing drugs, their chance of improving their lot in life is 
really diminished, not to mention the problems it creates for their 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU argues that across-the-board drug testing of applicants  
is discrimination and treats the state's poorest families as 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forcing parents to choose between providing for their children  
and giving up their privacy rights is a giant step backward for 
public policy in Michigan,'' said Kary Moss, executive director of 
the ACLU of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of two  
women and a family-advocacy group. It seeks class-action status. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of states require limited drug testing for some  
welfare recipients, but none have made it part of the application 
process for family benefits, said Gwen Rubenstein of the New 
York-based Legal Action Center, a nonprofit policy group. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan's drug testing will start as a pilot program in four  
counties. In 2003, the state plans to expand it statewide for 
applicants and add random checks for those already receiving cash 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who test positive for drugs and refuse treatment could  
gradually lose their cash assistance. Those who refuse to be tested 
will be denied cash assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The test results apply only to the state's largest state cash  
assistance program, the Family Independence Program. Medicaid, 
disability, emergency and other state assistance programs are not 
affected, and program rules say police won't be notified of 
positive tests for drugs.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Amax Accepts $1.8B Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. agreed to a sweetened  
$1.8 billion cash and stock offer from Phelps Dodge Corp., ending 
their six-week takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge, the nation's largest copper producer, said the  
merger with Cyprus, announced Thursday, would create a lower-cost 
global copper producer and allow the companies to integrate 
operations in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge raised its bid to $19.74 a share from $19.02 to  
persuade Cyprus Amax to abandon its plans to merge with rival 
Asarco Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely pleased that we were able to reach a  
negotiated agreement with Cyprus Amax that is clearly in the best 
interest of both companies,'' said Douglas C. Yearley, Phelps Dodge 
chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge originally made a tandem offer in August to acquire  
Asarco, and also was rebuffed. Yearley said he is still interested 
in acquiring the New York-based copper producer. 
</P>
<P>
	But he now must beat out a higher bid from Mexico's top copper  
producer, Grupo Mexico SA. 
</P>
<P>
	Asarco spokesman Jerry Cooper declined to comment on the Phelps  
Dodge-Cyprus deal, saying only that Asarco intended to explore 
``all alternatives available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge offered $7.61 in cash and 0.2203 of a Phelps Dodge  
share for each Cyprus Amax share. Shareholders of Cyprus Amax will 
have the option of receiving $20.54 a share in cash for their 
stock, or 0.3550 Phelps Dodge shares for each Cyprus Amax share 
they hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect the copper markets will improve in a year or two and  
that means the stock prices for Phelps Dodge will increase,'' said 
John Taraba, a Cyprus vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal could close as early as mid-October.
